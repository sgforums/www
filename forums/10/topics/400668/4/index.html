              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am disappointed in you, being a scholar I expected much more
                  from you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a long time horizon, most stock markets make returns of 10%
                  to 15% annually.</p>
              <p>Insurance companies who receives fix premiums from the insured
                  uses these funds to invest in the stock markets and other
                  investments. When the insurance contract matures, the insurance
                  company pays out the interest of maybe 6% to the insured, the rest
                  of the profits goes into paying out expenses and dividends to
                  shareholders. Insurance contract like CPF is not liquid, if you
                  choose to withdraw early, you might not even get back the initial
                  money you put in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is the ultimate shareholder of CPF? The government or the
                  people?</p>
              <p>Who took the risk? The people or the government?</p>
              <p>If say tomorrow, all the investments in Temasek and GLC is worth
                  nothing.</p>
              <p>Do you think CPF will have problems paying out all the CPF money
                  to retirees as they fall due? Why do you think US has no problems
                  paying out it's mountain of debt? I heard the printers can churn
                  out billions a day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>All they ever need to do is get MAS to increase the money supply
                  (welcome to fiat currency) which raises inflation. Who suffers
                  when inflation is high? The government or the people? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why have a cap for those with accounts less than $30k from
                  investing to get more returns? Why not have a capped for those
                  whose accounts are in excess of $30k and let them make 3% interest;
                  and those who have less than $30k make 5% interest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Hong Kong's MPFA is a much more equitable organisation,
                  it has finance professional to educate investors about the
                  kind of investments they should take and let the investors
                  make their own choice. The gains and losses are of no
                  consequence to the organisation, they don't make or lose any
                  money from the investment choices of investors. While CPF pays a
                  flat nominal interest rate which is manipulated by itself (In
                  a way, because the government has all the cheap funds it needs from
                  CPF, no need to raise interest rates to obtain funds; who sets the
                  interbank rates in Singapore which in turn dictates the CPF
                  interest rates.) and exploits the CPF balances of the poor. It's
                  like "The Ring" it comes full circle. åŽ„è¿�å¾ªçŽ¯ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>gentlemen and women,</p>
              <p>every man and woman have their rights to live and invest as they like, i think we have tor respect that, in this world, in term of peoples, there is alway a class differentiation, be it in term of money or status or knowledge that divided the classes, no society can take that away, but if we will to learn to respect each other integrity and forgo the class, i think we will be more gracious, harmony and less insulting of each other.</p>
              <p>I hope the above is clear.</p>
              <p>You  do not need to tell people what you are doing...keep it to yourself is better, but if you really want to expose yourself or show your egos and proudness, you must also be willing to take in comments and critics.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Point out exactly where I said 2.5% was fair. Which sentence. Go on. Most of times, funds in the OA isn't inside anyway. It's not even worthy to use as comparison for 30 years investment. You still want to say you didn't miss the point of contention?</p>
              <p>2) Guess your data was based on which country? Which country was I talking about? Have you calculated for our local index?</p>
              <p>3) The article took 1926 to 2001. 1926 was near the bottom, and 2001 was near an interim top which is very near to current levels. Basically, they can take 1926 to 2010 and the same start and end data would be used.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) I asked about your own calculations and analysis. You showed me other people's analysis. Huh?</p>
              <p>5) You failed to address if our govt have the ability to secure more than 8% over 30 years. Did you take into account our government's track record in overseas investments?</p>
              <p>6) You failed to take into account that a percentage of cash must be set aside, hence the full amount of gain will never be possible by any funds. Even if they can secure 8% on 80% of the funds, the overall result would be only 6.4% gain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fair comparison? Seems like you never even bother to use some brains.</p>

              <p>1) Point out exactly where I said 2.5% was fair. Which sentence. Go on. Most of times, funds in the OA isn't inside anyway. It's not even worthy to use as comparison for 30 years investment. You still want to say you didn't miss the point of contention?</p>
              <p>2) Guess your data was based on which country? Which country was I talking about? Have you calculated for our local index?</p>
              <p>3) The article took 1926 to 2001. 1926 was near the bottom, and 2001 was near an interim top which is very near to current levels. Basically, they can take 1926 to 2010 and the same start and end data would be used.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) I asked about your own calculations and analysis. You showed me other people's analysis. Huh?</p>
              <p>5) You failed to address if our govt have the ability to secure more than 8% over 30 years. Did you take into account our government's track record in overseas investments?</p>
              <p>6) You failed to take into account that a percentage of cash must be set aside, hence the full amount of gain will never be possible by any funds. Even if they can secure 8% on 80% of the funds, the overall result would be only 6.4% gain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fair comparison? Seems like you never even bother to use some brains.</p>

              <p>1) You did not explicitly say that the interest rates paid by CPF is fair, but you stated it implicity on 4 Jun 7:01am.

              <p>Do you think that the 2.5% (Ordinary Account) and 4% (Special Account) interest paid out by CPF is fair? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>4) I am not qualified to give calculations and analysis, so I used an abstract from a book, the book is quite old, that's why it only goes up to 2001. At present I agree that all major markets are trading in the lower range due to the fallout from US subprime. But when we look at investments, we shouldn't take specific ranges when it's high or low, we should always take a long term perspective.</p>

              <p>5) Whether the PAP government is able to secure 8% or more is irrelevant, if they had employed proper qualified professionals for the job, the issue of low returns would not have materialized.

              <p>eagle,</p>
              <p>If you think that CPF is fair to all Singaporeans, maybe you should respond to my earlier post directed to you. If you think CPF is unfair to all CPF holders, then please omit the post below. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am disappointed in you, being a scholar I expected much more from you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In a long time horizon, most stock markets make returns of 10% to 15% annually.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Insurance companies who receives fix premiums from the insured uses these funds to invest in the stock markets and other investments. When the insurance contract matures, the insurance company pays out the interest of maybe 6% to the insured, the rest of the profits goes into paying out expenses and dividends to shareholders. Insurance contract like CPF is not liquid, if you choose to withdraw early, you might not even get back the initial money you put in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who is the ultimate shareholder of CPF? The government or the people?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who took the risk? The people or the government?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If say tomorrow, all the investments in Temasek and GLC is worth nothing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think CPF will have problems paying out all the CPF money to retirees as they fall due? Why do you think US has no problems paying out it's mountain of debt? I heard the printers can churn out billions a day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">All they ever need to do is get MAS to increase the money supply (welcome to fiat currency) which raises inflation. Who suffers when inflation is high? The government or the people? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why have a cap for those with accounts less than $30k from investing to get more returns? Why not have a capped for those whose accounts are in excess of $30k and let them make 3% interest; and those who have less than $30k make 5% interest?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think Hong Kong's MPFA is a much more equitable organisation, it has finance professional to educate investors about the kind of investments they should take and let the investors make their own choice. The gains and losses are of no consequence to the organisation, they don't make or lose any money from the investment choices of investors. While CPF pays a flat nominal interest rate which is manipulated by itself (In a way, because the government has all the cheap funds it needs from CPF, no need to raise interest rates to obtain funds; who sets the interbank rates in Singapore which in turn dictates the CPF interest rates.) and exploits the CPF balances of the poor. It's like "The Ring" it comes full circle. åŽ„è¿�å¾ªçŽ¯ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>

              <p>1) The point of contention was about CPF SA all along. Where did you even see 2.5%?</p>
              <p><strong>You told me I said it was fair for 2.5%. Where?</strong> Don't try to twist away.</p>
              <p>And I have explicitly talked about 4%. Guess you didn't even bother to read properly again.</p>

              <p>2) See. You missed the point of contention. Who were we talking about in the first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) You understand what is the meaning of interim top? Another post that totally missed the point (yet again, any surprising?) about comparing with 2010 and statistics,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Using outdated info? How much dumber can you get?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Missed the point again. Try again, do you need to me point out to you exactly where you missed the point?</p>

              <p>1) This is not about side tracked. You have yet to say which sentence implied.</p>
              <p>Don't tell me you don't have the basic ability to finish one thing before starting on the next?</p>
              <p><strong>Which sentence did I imply about 2.5%. </strong>I'm still waiting. As long as you cannot show the sentence or post, you are basically just talking rubbish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) My chat was primarily with Calvin. Who were the people we were referring to?</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about something else related to the thread, but totally unrelated to my discussion with Calvin, sorry, I'm not interested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) It's not even technical analysis. You raised statistics via your so called research. I showed you back statistics.</p>
              <p>Get your facts right. Oh ya, wonder if you could read. I have already mentioned the word statistics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Your sentences are all out of point. There's no point to start tackling at all because they don't even fit the point of contention here. And sorry, I'm not insulting you. I merely state a fact of you that you admitted too. How is that insult?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) You missed the whole point because we are talking about GIC being able to earn 8% and pocketing the difference of 5%. You tell me whether they can secure 8% is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>How much more out of point can you get?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) Geez, which post was I referring to the OA at all? All along, I was referring to the SA.</p>
              <p>And I have already told you the OA isn't even worthy of comparison.</p>
              <p>Out of context yet again.</p>

              <p>Vague explanations? I didn't even bother to explain to you unlike to Calvin because all your points aren't even into what my discussions were with him. There wasn't even any explanations, so I can't even see how you could see vague explanations.</p>
