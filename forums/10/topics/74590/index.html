            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree, that there are nice Singaporeans in our midst, and there are nice China nationals and foreigners in our midst too. But if I take a mental step back and look at the whole picture, I see more ungracious locals than people of other nationals.<br><br>I believe this is because of the decades of being first and number one in almost everything. While competition is good, it can cultivate selfish behaviours such as being first to board or alight, trying to get somewhere first/earlier as motorists, having secured a seat on the MRT so one should keep it, and the list goes on.<br><br>Can't you see? It's the very structure of living in Singapore that has gotten most people "ugly". Being better, being faster, being more impressive, being higher in status, having come from a better school, blah blah blah...<br><br>How about the givernment starting a campagne for Being Nicer than Others?<br><br>I either drive, or take the taxi sometimes. But when I have to ride the bus of MRT, I'd make sure it is short commute, and do not bother to sit down at all. Because if it is crowded, I'd be looking out for old folks boarding, and then making sure the old lady or man sees me, so that I can wave them over to take my seat. Why? Because one time, I got up to give my seat to an old lady, a guy nearby just conveniently sits down. So I had the unenviable task of ordering that person off the seat so the old lady can seat down. Of course, after that I had to ride the rest of the way with poisonous glances from the man I confronted in front of so many other passengers.<br><br>What can I say? What more need I say? China nationals, that's quite another story altogether....<br><br>For later....<br><br></div>
