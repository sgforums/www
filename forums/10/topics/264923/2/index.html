Personal incidents that crippled them financially or left with no one to support them, with absolutely no one to turn to, either that or don't know whom to turn to. These people are very real, if anyone recognises them and would wish to help them there is still a chance to do that.<br><br>These people don't give a shat about their pictures on the net? What do you guys think? They go home and switch on their $5000 state of the art computer and start surfing the net? They need recognition, they need help... the government has got to start accepting that they exist and stop all that bloody bullshat.

            <div class='col-md body'>I ran into a homeless sleeper in Hougang. It was memorable because he went right to the trash bin beside a bus stop. In front of everyone. He fished out half finished coke and drank it and he was looking so happy to find that bottle of coke. Finished it in one gulp. Then he proceeded to find any ciggies. Squat down light up and puffed away. Then walk off as if there is not a care in the world. The guy looked late forties, light skin suggests he might be an office worker all his life. If he had a shirt and pants on, he could pass for shenton way crowd but he obviously is a homeless. It was more shocking for us than for him to see poor people.<br></div>
