            <div class='col-md body'>will today hike in gst also hike up the numbers of public sleeper?<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s Public Sleepers<br>By LuckyTan..<br>Jun 30, 2007<br><br>Â‘SleepersÂ’ in Singapore....<br>June 24, 2007<br><br>"There are no homeless, destitute or starving people [in Singapore]Â…Poverty has been eradicated."<br>-Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's permanent representative to the UN<br><br>"You go down New York, Broadway. You will see the beggars, people of the streets...Where are the beggars in Singapore? Show me."<br>-Lee Kuan Yew<br><br>"There are no homeless people in Singapore because they are called SLEEPERS. Singapore is ingenious we have gotten rid of homelessness without spending a single cent" - Lucky Tan<br><br>Every time I work late and pass by the bus interchange near my place, I notice the growing number of homeless at the bus interchange. Each pillar at the bus interchange now has a permanent resident (PR).<br><br>You ever wonder why the homeless sleep next to pillars? So that the tired people coming back from work don't step on them when they sleep.<br><br>Since every pillar is now occupied, I wondered where a new homeless person would go. The Sunday Times has the answer....<br><br>"Sleeping in the city is becoming popular...." - Sunday Times 24 June 2007.<br><br>"Sleeping in void decks, Changi beach, bus interchange is also very POPULAR especially among the poor..." - Lucky Tan<br><br>Some of you might have criticised the govt for building the extravagant Esplanade spending hundreds of millions tax payers money on a building that hosts operas, musicals and symphonies that only the richer citizens can afford.<br><br>But you are wrong, while the rich get to watch "Les MisÃ©rables", the poor get to sleep in the underpass between Esplanade and the Citilink Mall at night.<br><br>The Esplanade is indeed a very useful building both rich and poor people get to use it.<br><br>It seems not all the 'sleepers' are jobless. Why do people with jobs need to sleep in those places?<br><br>The answer is very simple and logical. The real wages of some workers are now so low that after the numerous bouts of utilities increase, transport fare increase, and rental increases, there is hardly any choice but to sleep on streets.<br><br>I would do it too if I make $900 a month because I can save: -<br>* $100 on transport because I sleep close to where I work,<br>* Another $200 on rental and<br>* $50-$100 of utilities bill.<br><br>In other words I can save half my income, by sleeping in public places.<br><br>As Singapore heads for top 1st world status, the cost of living can only rise relative to the wages of low-income workers.<br><br>We can see greater utilisation of our public buildings, MRT stations, bus interchanges and 24hr MacDonald's outlets as they double up as sleeping areas for these sleepers.<br><br>It is great that our beloved government had such great foresight to invest so much money on these beautiful buildings such as the Esplanade we now know how much vision it took.<br><br>I really couldn't imagine that the Esplanade could be actually be that useful to every one.<br><br>http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/</div>
