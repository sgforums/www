Everyone in the group knew that none of us was a foreign investor. There were students, diplomats and teachers in our group, but as far as I could see, no foreign investors,' Gerard said.<br><br>As China's economy charges ahead and local governments scramble to attract investments, the 'hiring' of expatriates has become a way for some Chinese companies to put up a supposed symbol of commercial legitimacy.<br><br>The hiring process is opaque, often arranged by mutual Chinese acquaintances and sometimes leaving the foreigner unaware of the assignment at hand.<br><br>Other foreigners are better informed of their roles, though the exchanges rarely go beyond the superficial, said Kuwaiti professor Hussein Mussallam from Qinghua University.<br><br>'Some people ask me to pretend to be something that I am not,' he said.<br><br>In one extreme case, a Caucasian American was asked to pose as a priest at a Chinese wedding.<br><br>According to Prof Hussein, hiring agencies keep a database of foreigners and are often paid for meeting quotas.<br><br>'If they bring in 20 foreigners, they get paid a certain amount. They don't care if you are a businessman or not,' he said.<br><br>'The Chinese need to invite someone for respect to a party or a company, and if you have foreigners present, it shows how important you are,' a sociology professor at Beijing's Renmin University said.<br><br>While non-Asian foreigners are sought after, Caucasians are the ones most in demand.<br><br>'White people are an expensive commodity in China. It is a glorious thing to show off that you have foreign friends,' said the sociology professor, who declined to be identified.<br><br>'You can brag about this.'<br><br></div>

In a large foreign bank here, their Credit Dept Head is a foreign Indian National approves bank loans despite having no lending experience at all. He probably does not understand the transaction risks or loan structures that he's been approving. But then, all he needs like most Ang Mos is talked well.</div>
