This medium was harnessed by the opp. during the last election. If I recall correctly, it was started by Chee's party. <br><br>The govt came down hard on the opp. But as this technology was new, the law was somewhat inadequate. The opp. was lucky to get away. Now the PAP govt is thinking of using podcast. They know that if they can't beat these new tools, they have to use or to control them. <br><br>My point is this. If there are no ppl, whether opp. or ordinary citizen, to push the boundary of freedom of expression, will thing get moving? Will the govt ever bother?</p></div>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Protests in Singapore are rare and an assembly of five or more people requires a permit from the police. Singapore says it needs tough laws on assembly for the maintenance of peace and stability.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Main reason is LKY is fearful protest will pose threat to him and party.   It is also for self serving reason why evil LKY and party refuse to allow protests in Singapore.   If protest means no peace and stability, Hong Kong by now would have been a chaotic country.    LKY and party needs to have tight control over the people to keep their rice bowls.   </span></p>

              <p>LKY and party make it an offence because they are afraid of threat when there are large number of people gather for one purpose.    Almost everything they do, they do it mostly for their own selfish reasons than for the good of the people.   Indeed, we don't need such a self serving govt to continue to serve the public.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are not afraid of the government , if we're afraid, wouldn't we be pissing our pants or holding our breath when Parliamentary session is televised during our night time TV schedules?</p>
              <p>If we're afraid, wouldn't there be substantial votes for PAP MP's during the last GE to throw opposition members off balance?</p>
              <p>Come on, I feel our government has done an excellent job in ensuring our path is littered with few garbage ( eg . SARS crisis, 9/11 and Iraq War ). In comparison to other countries where political problem arises every few months, there's a 0.001 % chance of that occurring in Singapore. when was the last time a political crises with a magnitude comparable to that during the 1960's occurred (the MCP vs PAP)? Political problems inevitably leads to economic problems, they're just like siamese twins.</p>
              <p>Maybe we can refer to it as a blessing in disguise, however I feel that the recent price hikes is unavoidable. With rising global food prices, which government would be willing to subsidise the increase in costs? in the end, even if they do, policies will be brought forward to increase GST ( which haven't happen to us ever since the earliest rise in food prices were announced )</p>
              <p>One of the solutions to the problem can be, the government should encourage everyone to donate food items to the poor, when they are the ones severely affected by the rise in rising prices.</p>

              <p>Uh...Where, may I ask, is the 'democracy' in all this?</p>
              <p>Isn't PAP a democratic party? That's what I heard people say, that is.</p>
              <p>If even peaceful protests are disallowed, then it certainly leaves one wondering what kind of political system we have here in our country. Dictatorship? Totalism? Or simply I-give-orders-as-I-like kind of system?</p>

              <p>Maybe high paying leaders should take the lead. "everyone" had already donated to ERP, SMRT, Comfortdelgro etc in the recent hikes.. who still have money to donate? Not me... Me have to save money to pay for increase in electricity bills so I can surf net at home and not only in office.</p>
