              <p class="first">SINGAPORE, July 11 - A Singapore court charged 19 people on Friday, including several opposition party members, for taking part in a protest over rising prices in the city-state.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">Amongst those accused was Chee Soon Juan, leader of Singapore's most vocal opposition party, the Singapore Democratic Party, and several of its executive members.</div>
              <p>Court documents showed they were charged for participating in a procession and an assembly, offences that carry a maximum fine of S$1,000 .</p>
              <p>"The Tak Boleh Tahan Protest was meant to speak out against the multitude of ill-timed price hikes initiated by the government," said a joint press statement by the group.</p>
              <p>Tak Boleh Tahan means "Cannot Take It" in Bahasa Malay. Singapore's inflation is at a 26-year high, leaving increasing numbers of the city's poor turning to temples for free food.</p>
              <p>Some economists believe the government's two percent tax hike on goods and services last July helped stoke inflationary pressures.</p>
              <p>Protests in Singapore are rare and an assembly of five or more people requires a permit from the police. Singapore says it needs tough laws on assembly for the maintenance of peace and stability.</p>
              <p>The accused said they will go to trial but are currently without legal representation. In a press statement, the group's sole lawyer, Chia Ti Lik, said he was unable to represent them because he was also accused.</p>
              <p>"We are now all the more convinced that the protest was needed and justified and simply had to be done," the statement said. "We make an appeal for Singaporean lawyers to come forward to represent us in these proceedings."

              <p>It's a tricky business. Protestations have the potential to end up violent, chaotic and uncontrollable.</p>
              <p>But then again, to arrest people for making perfectly peaceful protest that does not bring about inconvinience or disruption to the nation at large seems quite ridiculous too.</p>

              Correct, they were not breaking law but were exercising their constitutional right for expression.

              <p>Evangel<br><br>Like you, I am not a PAP or opp. supporter. I am a pro-Singaporean. I love my country and my people. <br><br>I agree with you that 19 ppl is few. A few hundreds or thousands would make a dent on the PAP. But you have to understand that the people in Singapore are still afraid of the PAP. Not only afraid but the whole system is designed such that all of us are locked into the structure - psychologically, socially and economically.<br><br>Indeed, mass communicating with the people is more effective. But you also have to understand that the media here is under the control of the PAP. At the moment, for the opposite to communicate to the people, is only a dream.<br><br>We have opp. party members in the parliament doing the communcation with the government. But how is the situation now? Any improvement? Will the govt ever bother to improve? Further attempt in this direction of any use? <br><br>Also, communication up to a certain point, without action is just what it is, ineffectiveness - talk and no action.</p>

              <p><br>These are not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mass</span> communication tools in the right sense. What you mentioned are communication tool and not mass communication tool. <br><br>Not the one-to-one channels. Mainly, the one-to-many channels, with the action and reaction being instance and stimultaneous. Mass communication involves newspaper, magazine, TV, rally, public speech etc. PAP is still afraid of the people gaining access to such means.<br><br>But I hear they may change the law to allow for podcast. With the kind of budget and network, who you think have the edge?</p>
