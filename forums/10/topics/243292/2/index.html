How you intend not to be judged on what you write, and called that your freedom of speech, and then yet want people to take your words with some weight is a total mystery.

            <div class='col-md body'>No, you don't have to be sorry... what about being careful? You just made a mistake that only sia sway yourself and entertain others, not to mention written a couple of long posts on a faulty assumption. And best you made this mistake not because people trick you, but because in your haste to chiong you never even read properly.<br><br>You should take some time to think before pouncing on anybody in here, then maybe you can avoid making such basic mistakes like not even realizing what not being part of 66.6% is.<br><br>The truth is, many people in here probably hold the same position with you on many issues, but the way you arse about in here either turns them off, or you end up attacking those that might be your allies in the first place. If you haven't noticed, if you bother to read the posting histories of others that you might not like in here... a lot of them are actually the anti-establishment you are trying to find in the first place, but because of a little thing here and a little thing there you end up flaming them.<br><br>So I must honestly tell you, it's quite funny... not to mention actually HELPING your REAL opponents, not harming them by wacking people who are actually on your side.<br><br>Try something, it's called tolerance and flexibility. The enemy of my enemy is my friend... not everybody but anybody that is absolutely like me is my enemy.<br><br>You know there's a saying about flamers, that they need to wear fireproof boots because they often end up burning their own feet. Anybody can flame, but only really smart people make a proper argument. At the end of the day you can outshout someone, but who really wins is another matter. The person who wins the flame war might actually be the real loser in the end as his opponent has managed to bait him into revealing his own inconsistencies.<br><br>Sun Tzu said that if you know yourself and your enemy you will be victorious in every battle, if you dunno your enemy and only know yourself, you'll win one and lose one. But if you dunno both your enemy and yourself, you will be in danger in every battle.<br><br>While your Japanese "Banzai!" charging style of argument is very noisy and impressive... might I suggest another tatic that works a lot better... namely something called "fight smart and know your true friends and foe"?<br><br>I'm not trying to tekan you or anything, if I was the PAP, I would keep highlighting your error for my own gain like the Bah Chor Mee incident. I'm trying to tell you this for your own good: You actually have many potential allies and people with agreement with you in here- don't turn them into your foes by your reckless and careless actions.</div>
