Singapore does have room for expansion in finance, banking , logistic management and tourism areas.<br><br>However if one wants to do nuclear physics or even let's say marine biology - they have to venture overseas. Even for certain sciences, Singapore has not established itself as an internationally known research entity yet.<br><br>And not to mention , there is almost no such thing as second chances in Singapore. Overseas, I have seen nurses become doctors /lawyers/statisticians etc but not in Singapore. Once a nurse, almost always a nurse unless you want to open a medical related business . I don't see people taking on another line .<br><br>Singapore in a way has her own advantages and disadvantages . So you cannot say whether a singaporean would have made it bigger if they had stayed in Singapore or overseas even. Why do you think the government likes to send scholars overseas if Singapore was so good?  Heck even LKY's own grandsons did the IB instead of taking the normal route of education that Singaporeans have.</div>
