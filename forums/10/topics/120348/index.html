            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it is tough for Sporeans to have to live in a competitive society. A fundamental issue is, if as a community we do not get the best from our people, are we able to survive in the long run, let alone flourish and excel?<br><br>On the other hand, there is another thread in this forum about Sporean students being too competitive and selfish. Is the price for such a competitive society too high to pay or could it be simply because some of our students have been taught in the wrong way?<br><br>In principle, it would be hard to argue with the premise of needing to build a meritocratic society, especially for a small country with little resouces except its people. IMO, the authorities are slowly changing their ideas of excellence in learning institutions and are moving away from academic achievements to include non scholastic fields. However, the emphasis on grading is still persistent. I wonder what alternatives are there to encourage excellence without the competitive element?<br></div>
