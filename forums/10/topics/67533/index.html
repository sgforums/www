Sure they've made many many decisions that aren't the best in public opinion but dun u think they've done a good job on the whole?<br><br>At least we don't have corruption as bad as the indons or widespread famine and poverty throughout the nation. We've achieved a standard of living that our neighbours all envy.<br><br>Disclaimer: I dun support the govt on many of its policies but i'm only trying to be fair to them.<br><br>How about it guys?

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with the PAP is that they are living in past glory.<br><br>While their preformance in the past is undoubtedly stellar, compared to many other third world countries who didn't make the cut, we never really evolved in terms of political maturity out of our third world status. While Singapore became affulent, our politics and they were they were run stayed firmly entrenched in the 1950s.<br><br>The true irony is, it seems that the PAP is suffering from a bad case of victory disease, where they won so much at first, the concept of being failable has become alien to them. Witness the Japanese in ww2 who suffered badly from the same syndrome and squandered many chances later in the war to make things better for themselves for the simple reason they never considered failure to be a possibility, and hence, never learnt much.<br><br>Such is the case now with the ruling party, it appears that they are under the impression that their words and ideas somehow weight more then that of the people or the opposition, and that anybody who questions their truth must therefore be against the progress of Singapore under the annoited leadership of the ruling party, and henceforth are traitors.<br><br>Therefore, it follows through that any form of opposition to their ideas and rule can be considered treason to Singapore.<br><br>One of the key symptoms of victory disease is also a lack of touch with reality... which is acutely demostrated by The Party now as they often make sweeping statements on how the general populace is happy with their choices, to the current sluggish reaction of gar'men linked organizations like SIA and PSA to the harsh reality that they can be beat if they sit on their butts.<br><br>And unfortunately who takes the fall whenever their infaliable politics fail?<br><br>Ordinary singaporeans.<br><br>The reason why Singapore still works is a legacy of the glory days gone by, built on the blood, tears, and sweat of the people, who had chosen the PAP to lead them in their struggle back then... the sad this is that, the general populace now thinks that Singapore as a nation now belongs to the PAP and that we are just maids and servants living in it, having long forgotten (in part probably by not so subtle propangada) that the current sucess of Singapore was attributed to her people as well.<br><br>We have this mentality that Singapore is a flat that we are renting from the PAP, and not a nation that we have built. Should this be?<br><br>There always needs to be somebody providing leadership to a team or a group, but the role of the leader is that, providinG leadership. The leader is not <span style="font-style: italic;">the team</span>, and the rest of the members <span style="font-style: italic;">don't rent</span> the team from the leader.<br><br>In fact, the true role of leaders in a democracy is <span style="font-style: italic;">to serve</span> the people, not to act like appointed monarchs and live off the people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for your opinions.

The white men have returned to steal our jobs, our women and basically the lives that our forefathers have fought so hard for. I would be damned the day i see an expat let into parliament.

Mind you, unless you are the direct descendant of a small group of Malay fishermen on this island in 1819, this exact accusation could be levelled against you.<br><br>To put things in perspective, I expect that white people in Australia could say of me that I "steal our jobs, our women".  I am guilty on both counts and absolutely unrepentant about it.  Hell, I even stole my place in the postgraduate program from hundreds of white students.  The question is, was this because of my skin colour?<br><br>With regards to the job and the education, the only reason all of those white people were deprived was because I was a more suitable candidate, and dammit, I was the sharpest knife in that particular kitchen at the time.  As for the women, it was a matter of my personality, amongst other things that shall not be mentioned here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If that sounds like an ego trip to you, well, read it how you will.  The fact of the matter is that for everything I achieved in a place where I was the outsider, I did it by being the most qualified and most experienced person available, and I worked my arse off to make sure I was in the right place at the right time.  I did not think that I was superior because I was Asian - I knew I was superior because I damned well worked to get there.<br><br>I have heard white men express exactly the same sentiments as you have, and I will tell you exactly the same thing I tell them.  This is a dog-eat-dog world, and if you are to get what you think you deserve, you jolly well work for it instead of finding someone else to blame.  At best you are doing yourself a disservice because you are preventing yourself from developing the competitive attitude necessary to achieve what you want, and also from identifying the areas in which you need to raise your own game.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gedanken, I thank you for your insightful reply and i must admit that you have indeed made me become a more self-aware of my views. First of all i agree with you that this is a dog-eat-dog world and we should all be tenacious and jump at the oppoturnities for the betterment of our lives. I agree with you that thru ability and hard work, you have deserved your place in the society you belong to now (aussie ain't it??) and most importantly i congratulate you in finding happiness in that land. In case you are feelin sceptic, i am not being sarcastic at all and i mean what i say from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>But (you knew it was coming) I do have a few points to raise. I am generalising my views about the white men( hmm maybe i'll start a new thread about this) if i were to judge on a case to case basis i wouldnt be able to complete doing so in this lifetime. Forgive me if i sound racist but I welcome the white men with open arms and an open mind, but lets compare the situation in singapore and in australia. Once again please do note i am generalising and not accusing all white men guilty of the actions i am about to point out<br><br>1. In Singapore, the locals tend to put the white men up on a pedestal even before they show their abilities. Many expats were brought in by large sized firms to improve the way they work or to provide the expertise that Singaporeans could not.<br><br>My question for you is that: were you offered a bungalow/big condo apartment, car, enormous wages and other benefits not given to the australian people when you went there? i think not. You were instead, given a fair playing ground and you WON it(congratulations again).<br><br>2. I don't know if this is completely true and i am prepared to be badly flamed for this but ang mohs just seem to be a little bit too proud of who they are. I feel that they come to our society and culture and while MANY and i really mean a large portion of them try to blend in and learn about it ( kudos to these people, respect!) a sizable amount of them treat our people, our culture with disdain. And somehow, the very singaporeans that put them up on a pedestal and follow them around like they were revered gods ( i hate these singaporeans even more then i dislike ang mohs) are influenced by it and turn their backs on the society that raised and supported their rise to where they are. You think that they could show a little gratitude? I'm not expecting any replies to this point as i would rather leave it up to all of you to take a look around next time you're out on the streets.<br><br>3. Women. Weird creatures aren't they? Nvm hahaha...  Actually I'm glad for the ang mohs who steal our women. SPGs Bah! who needs them? I'm definitely not going to go out with one who thinks that local men can't make it. Nuff Said.<br><br>4. Western Culture. Now this i have quite a bit to say.. and i will say it in my next thread( i've decided to start a new one as we are totally out of point)<br><br>Anyway, Gedanken, from where you are and in comparison to the govt that oversees your well being at the moment, what dya think? does our govt deserve the flack it receives from my fellow forumites or is it actually deserving of support??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Farmer Brown, I'll just address your last point - I'll hop over to your other thread to address the others.<br><br>I'm in a rather interesting position at the moment - after ten years in Australia, I'm actually spending this year in Singapore to attend to some family issues (along the way, I turned down a $85K job in Oz - I'm kicking myself! :mrgreen<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.  My current situation makes for interesting comparisons, not only between Singapore and Australia, but between the Singapore of 1994 and that of 2004.<br><br>A comparison with Australia's form of government, by virtue of its great difference to the Singaporean system, highlights a number of interesting things about how Singapore is run.<br><br>First  and foremost, there is the relationship between the Government and the opposition.  As you would be aware, the two main political parties is Australia are the Liberals and Labour, with smaller parties like the Democrats playing a smaller but nonetheless significant role.  Currently the Liberal are in power, and Labour is in the opposition.  Unlike Singapore, Australia has a shadow government, which constitutes of a cabinet formed by the opposition party.  For almost everything that the government says, the shadow government will throw its two cents in to sway the public opinion.  On top of that, each state has its own government, and this Government may be from a different party to that of the federal government, with its own views on how things should be done.  My first thought when I came across this ten years ago was "How the devil does this country get anything done if there is opposition to everything?".  God only knows how they do it, but they do manage to move along.  In contrast, we have a virtually one-party system in Singapore, where the Government makes autocratic decisions and the people gripe about it.<br><br>Which system is more workable? There is no straight answer because of the differences between the characteristics and circumstances of the Singaporean and Australian populations.  In particular, speaking in relative terms, the Australian people are more prepared to think for themselves, and are also in a better position to do so.<br><br>As Singapore Tyrannosaur stated, the PAP system worked well, and was perhaps even necessary in the days when Singapore was struggling to stand on its own feet.  This situation has changed, but neither the government nor the population have kept up with these changes.  That said, given the fragility of SingaporeÂ’s situation as a small nation with no natural resources, the governmentÂ’s approach is not entirely without its merits.  There are some days when I hear of the Australian peopleÂ’s whining about something that the government has done and I think Â“Well, your vote for them was your message Â“we trust you to run thingsÂ” Â– now shut up and let them do the jobÂ”.  There are always going to be some tough and unpopular decisions that a government has to make, and this I best done without undue interference by the people.<br><br>A classic case in point is the issue of National Service.  The idea has been raised time and again in Australia, and the public outcry has always prevented its implementation.  However, all the way through university, I used to sit back with an Australian ex-infantryman and watch the kids in the class, and we both agreed that some service time would knock the decadence out of these kids.<br><br>The previous government in Melbourne made a lot of autocratic changes to the state.  I agree with the way teachers were made more accountable for their own jobs, but cutbacks to the medical and public transport systems were a disaster.  On the other hand, the current government has done jack squat.  Overall, the effects of the changes would have taken place faster if the governments had not changed, and the changes to the medical and public transport systems may have been developed to a workable point.  This highlights one key advantage of the government situation in Singapore Â– the government actually stays in place long enough to do what it needs to do.<br><br>Of course, there are drawbacks to the Singaporean system, and these have been covered in other posts already.  My two centsÂ’ worth of observation is that the average Singaporean is not very politically aware, owing to the one-party system that has existed for so long.  However, looking at snapshots of Singapore taken ten years apart, there has been some progress in this department, albeit slow and way too late.<br><br>One key disadvantage of the one-party system is that it has precipitated groupthink Â– everybody has had to toe the company line, so inappropriate decisions have gone through unopposed.  I agree with what ST said about the government living in the past.  Back in 1994, it already occurred to me that Singapore was well on its way to overpricing itself for manufacturing, and that it needed to shift to the intellectual capital game.  At the time, I was already hearing stories of Indian and Thai workers getting jobs because they could perform the same tasks as Singaporeans but at a much lower price.  Ten years later, the government is just starting to catch up with the facts.  Certainly there are likely to have been a number of reasons for this, but groupthink prevented the government from performing a reality check, and that is why we are behind the game.<br><br>The government has also overestimated its position in relation to the people.  As a group, Singaporeans are ruled by the government.  However, as individuals, they have much more freedom to do as they see fit.  To entice them back into the fold, the government calls such individuals quitters.  Go figure Â– a government saying Â“fine Â– I wonÂ’t play with you eitherÂ”, much as a five-year-old in a playground would.<br><br>Do I support the government for what it has done for Singapore?  In a limited sense, yes.  However, one needs to question what kind of country this government has created in the process of building up its infrastructure.  Oscar Wilde once said, Â“America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization<br>in betweenÂ”, and I think the same can now be said of Singapore.  In putting out its fires, the government has now flooded Singapore Â– the level of control that the government needed to get Singapore up and running is now stifling the countryÂ’s growth.  It is time they got with the program.</div>
