              <p><strong>Political leaders cannot be trained, but must be found, says MM Lee</strong><br> <span class="update">By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 02 September 2009 2217 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>INGAPORE: Political leaders cannot be trained, but must be found and be people with passion, says Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. 
              <br> <br> And that's one reason why, unlike corporate leaders, they are so much harder to get.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee was speaking on leadership transition and other issues in a
              wide-ranging dialogue session at the fifth anniversary of the Lee Kuan
              Yew School of Public Policy.
              <br> <br> It was a mixed 800-strong crowd of corporate heads, policy analysts, international students and half the Cabinet.
              <br> <br>They were all present to celebrate a school that has grown from
              just 40 students from a handful of countries, to over 300 students from
              52 countries and territories.
              <br> <br>At the dialogue session, when asked what he would do if there was a
              freak election result locally, Mr Lee said he had ensured safeguards
              were in place.
              <br> <br>"Many voters now tell us openly - "my family, three of us vote for
              you but two of us voted against you". Just to let you know we want an
              opposition voice and we don't want you to be so overwhelming. So in
              that case you may have a freak result and that worries me. So we have a
              president with blocking powers," said Mr Lee.
              <br> <br>Which means a new party cannot raid the reserves or change top
              officials, such as the police commander, without the president's
              consent.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "I spent 15 years thinking out these safeguards and
              finally persuaded my younger colleagues that we needed this because
              they can't guarantee that they'll each time provide a better team than
              the opposition, just because it has been done in the past. No problem
              in next election, but maybe after that - if we don't find a good team
              in elections after that - we are at risk."
              <br> <br>But concerns about the global economy were also very much on
              people's minds and questions were asked as to Mr Lee's views on what
              could have led to the fallout.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee believes the excesses of the liberal system and the belief
              that a completely free market will allow great benefits, were
              contributing factors.
              <br> <br>"However we learn, whatever lesson we learnt, I believe that the
              free market system from time to time you must expect a glitch and a
              failure in the market. It happens regularly ... you will learn the
              lesson from this ever after, no more crisis and I think certainly it
              will happen again. That's the way of the free market economies," he
              said.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee also fielded questions on his views on developments in India and China.
              <br> <br> But it wasn't all serious as he refused to take one question.
              <br> <br>One man asked: "I believe that Indonesia currently faces a
              situation you have often warned against. Which is when there are too
              many voices in the marketplace, it is too easily swayed by public
              opinion. How do you think a country like Indonesia should deal with
              this type of situation?"
              <br> <br>"You expect me to endorse your statement? My business is to
              maintain friendly relations. I think I'll pass that question," he
              replied.
              <br> <br>The school, also gave mementoes to donors. It had successfully
              raised $16.5 million, which with the government's matching grant, would
              make it $33 million, far higher than the initial aim of $5 million. -

              <p>This is becoming more worrying for Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the late 1980s, it was said that new talents have to be recruited early so that they can be given sufficient time for on-the-job "experience" before wearing the actual ministerial shoes, which even then will still require "mentoring" by the more seasoned senior ministers and politicians.</p>
              <p>After more then 30 years, now it seems that leaders' can't be trained but must be found ?</p>
              <p>For LKY, there seems two options open to find immediate leaders, if one is to trace the thoughts in the statements he has made in the last forty years.</p>

              <p><cite class="auth">AP - <span>Thursday, September  3</span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE
                  - Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew said Wednesday that he
                  expects his People's Action Party to win the next two elections to
                  extend its grip on power by as much as 10 more years.</p>
              <p>"I don't see any problem in the next election or probably in the
                  next one after that," Lee, 85, said at a dinner to mark the fifth
                  anniversary of a college named after him.</p>
              <p>"But if we don't find a good team in the election after that, and the opposition gets a good team together, we are at risk."</p>
              <p>Lee,
                  who founded the PAP and was Singapore's first prime minister from 1959
                  to 1990, remains a powerful figure in the Cabinet and in the party. The
                  PAP is the only party to have ruled Singapore.</p>
              <p>The current government was elected in 2006. The next elections are set for 2011.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lee,
                  who now has the title of mentor minister, said even if the opposition
                  took power by a "freak result," it won't be allowed to fire top police,
                  army and other officials without the approval of the president, who is
                  appointed by a committee of government officials.</span></p>
              <p>Lee, who is the
                  father of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said an opposition government
                  would by law also need the president's approval to tap international
                  reserves, indicating it would not be given.</p>
              <p>Otherwise "all our hard-earned savings could go in five years," he said. "I spent 15 years thinking up these safeguards."</p>
