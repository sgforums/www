The current system of election is a closed system which prevents people from fielding their own best individual candidates because of blockage of singles from standing for election by the GRC based on excuse of providing racial balance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"The official justification for GRCs is to allow minority representation. However, opposition parties have criticized GRCs as making it even more difficult for independent and opposition members to get elected, as a single strong candidate will find it very difficult to win and a steep group deposit of at least S$67,500 (S$13,500 per candidate) is required to stand for election. The opposition has also charged the government with gerrymandering GRC boundaries at very short notice, and "stuffing" otherwise weak GRCs with cabinet ministers. Many PAP MPs have also entered parliament by being placed in a Minister's GRC and so have never faced a vote.<br><br>Critics have noted that Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam won the 1981 Anson by-election in a Chinese-majority constituency, and that since the GRC system was implemented, minority representation in Parliament has actually declined."</div>

It costs more money too to run for one GRC.<br><br>3. The Govt has happily rewritten the boundaries like Chengsan when it felt like it. Guess that was a poison pill for them in Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>4. People in a GRC vote for the minister rather than the idiots for an MP into Parliament. Goh Chok Tong had the bloody cheek to admit that it was a way to get MPs into parliament knowing they are such idiots they can't even sell themselves to the people to justify why anyone should vote for them.</div>
