            <div class='col-md body'>to be frank, it is a fact that gov ministries and stat boards only value full-fledge NUS and NTU lor.....those NUS and NTU grads not performing also auto-promoted to a higher level.....*sigh*<br><br>they plan things while mickey-mouse-degree-holders do the ground works.....*sigh*<br><br>still in most forums, most ministries' and stat boards' dare not commit themselves whether how much they recognise or value part-time degree holders.  Their replies, I am tired of reading the same old things leow, are always very generic:- "our staff appraisal system is performance-based and we don't just look at the academic qualifications"<br><br>Bull-shit man!!!  they always answer that way to cover their own rice bowls and also to paint a beautiful pictures in case our ministers or pesident are reading the forums....<br><br>and mind you, they have very high level of hypocrisy man....the level where no one can feel they are telling lies......*honourable butt salute to them*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, many s'porean (employers and employees) value the local degree more than those achieved part time.<br><br>Dont they know that entry requirements for both NTU &amp; NUS are so much lax than 10 years ago.<br><br>I was not able enter to NTU or NUS bcos I am not the top of the corps in poly. No money also, so do my NS, start work, got married.<br><br>Out of my busy scheduleand armed with some savings and "advice" from the government, went to take part time adv diploma, later was accepted by UNC thru PSB for engineering degree but found too expensive $30K plus. that would drain my savings by almost half. also need to keep for rainy days and baby (still working-help government mah). So chose a arts degree from another academic agency.<br><br>yes, the arts degree (mgmt) took 15 months to complete, but please understand there is no semester breaks and there are only 20 contact hours for each module with the lecturers. The rest relies on the course guide issued, text books and reccommended texts and extra readings by individual. The exam take is similar to the campus.<br><br>So dont deny our degree and term it mickey mouse or whatever. We obtain it with sheer hard work and not luck or dime.<br><br></div>
