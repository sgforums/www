            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>No flat = No wedding<br>Newly-weds who find it hard to get a flat amid buoyant property market are putting off their weddings<br>By Tan Hui Yee, Housing Correspondent<br><br>AS PROPERTY prices rise, some newly-wed couples are postponing their traditional ceremonies while they wait for a new Housing Board flat.<br>Many have been priced out of the resale market while others want to buy a new home, which means joining the hordes trying their luck at ballots in HDB sales exercises.<br><br>It is leaving couples in a dilemma. While they have registered their marriages officially, they are reluctant to hold the customary ceremony that legitimises the union in the eyes of the community, until they have a home to call their own.<br><br>Members of Parliament say they are getting more appeals from distressed couples.<br><br>Aljunied GRC MP Cynthia Phua, who raised a question on the availability of flats in Parliament this week, told The Straits Times that one or two such couples bring up the problem at her Meet-the-People session every week.<br><br>Although technically married, many of them live apart, in their family homes, while waiting to get a flat together.<br><br>Madam Phua said: 'For us Asians, once you hold back your customary wedding, you can't live together, and you can't even have babies.'<br><br>Deliveryman Ang Kah Liong, 34, has unsuccessfully applied for a new flat 10 times since he registered his marriage with his girlfriend three years ago. The couple - who earn $3,000 a month - live with Mr Ang's parents and three elder brothers in their family's two-bedroom flat.<br><br>They were determined to wait until they had a flat of their own before holding the customary ceremony but family pressure finally prompted them to hold it in September.<br><br>'I had no choice,' said Mr Ang. 'I could not wait anymore.'<br><br>People like Mr Ang are being caught in a supply-demand crunch.<br><br>The buoyant resale market, which has seen prices grow by 11 per cent in the first nine months of this year, is fuelling a demand for new HDB flats.<br><br>In the July to September quarter, five-room flats in Queenstown - a coveted district - sold for a median sum of $110,000 above their valuations. This means a buyer had to pay at least $110,000 in cash as that amount cannot be covered with a home loan.<br><br>So young couples who cannot afford such resale prices - even with government grants that can go up to $40,000 - are turning to new HDB flats.<br><br>MPs told The Straits Times that many seek help to get a new flat near their parents' homes but this can be difficult as these are usually in older estates where few new flats are being built.<br><br>Jalan Besar MP Lily Neo said: 'Many couples want to live near their parents in the Central Business District, but as you know, there aren't many flats there.'<br><br>They stand a better chance of getting a flat if they are willing to consider other locations, said Dr Neo.<br><br>Application figures for recent HDB sales exercises show how competitive the flat race can get.<br><br>The HDB received almost 8,000 applications for just 400 flats in Telok Blangah recently, and more than 1,600 applications for 516 homes in Punggol.<br><br>The HDB is pumping up the supply of new homes to meet demand. A further 3,600 flats are expected to be offered under the build-to-order system from now until March.<br><br>However, the Government has stated that it cannot meet all the demand for new HDB flats as that would risk creating an oversupply in the future.<br><br>Meanwhile 28-year-old secretary Koh Bee Leng and fiance Julius Lim, 30, who hope to marry next year, carry on with their house-hunting.<br><br>The couple have set their eyes on four-room flats in a mature estate such as Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh, but have had no luck in two sales exercises this year.<br><br>Ms Koh said: 'Everything is uncertain now, because of the issue of the availability of the flat. That's delaying our plan to get married.'<br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY HO AI LI<br><br>tanhy@sph.com.sg </blockquote>so how?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
