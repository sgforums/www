And in supporting the BarÂ’s proposal at a press conference today, Salleh has laid out some of the thorny questions that should be tackled.<br><br>His first question was about the judicial authority of the courts: "Where is the power?" he asked, claiming that since the 1988 judicial crisis, "the Government has tried to clip the power of the judiciary."<br><br>In 1988, Article 121 of the Federal Constitution was amended so that judicial power which was originally vested in the High Courts was restricted to "such jurisdiction and powers as may be conferred by or under federal law". This, Salleh said, removed judicial authority.<br><br>Next, he turned to the power of judicial review, to deal with "complaints by the rakyat" against "wrongdoing and abuses of power".<br><br>Ouster clauses in various Acts in Malaysia Â— such as the Printing Presses &amp; Publications Act and the Police Act Â— make the decisions of ministers final so that they cannot be questioned in court. "Where can you go?" asked Salleh. Some lawyers point out that there is still scope for judicial review although it is now more limited.<br><br>He supported YeoÂ’s call but stressed that making amends to him and his fellow judges was not as important as restoring the judiciary and rule of law. Malaysia claims to have rule of law, he noted: "What kind of law?"<br><br>If the country really wants to be governed democratically and in accordance with law, he said, provisions of the Constitution relating to the judiciary which had been amended should be "looked into and amended so that we would be in line with all other democratic countries".<br><br>The statute of limitation period is over. Salleh is not suggesting legal action: "It is too big for the courts to decide," he said.<br><br>But the legal questions asked by the former Lord President are worth serious consideration as part of ongoing efforts to clearly mark the separation of powers between the executive, judicial and legislative branches of Government.<br><br>Revisiting the issues raised by Salleh, including the subject of judicial authority and judicial review, could help the process of strengthening the judiciary.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Wednesday/Frontpage/20060823075722/Article/index_html" rel="nofollow"><strong><span class="large">Nazri: No reason to reopen the case </span></strong></a><br><br><span class="small">23 Aug 2006</span><br><br>KUALA LUMPUR: The sacking of a Lord President and two Supreme Court judges in 1988 will not be reviewed.

ThereÂ’s no way weÂ’re going to re-open this matter," he said, commenting on a Press conference given earlier yesterday by former Lord President Tun Salleh Abas.<br><br>"He was tried by his peers. A panel of international judges was called.

No sane judge will make a deal to implicate his own brother judge."<br><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Regretably, Nazri was not honest enough to admit that four of the Malaysian judges had <span style="font-style: italic;">"sold their soul to the Devil"</span>, and the other two Judges from Sri Lanka and Singapore - were both obedient and dutiful servants of their respective governments.<br><br>The cards were already stacked against the persecuted honorable Lord President of the Malaysian Court and his two brother Justices.<br><br>That was the darkest hour for the Malaysian Judiciary, which will remain clouded by this grave injustice if Nazri and the present Chief Justice will not re-visit the circumstances and methods employed to remould an Independent Judiciary into one that is compliant to the Executive Branch.<br><br>Singaporeans have alot to learn from these events.</span></span></div>

People can voice out.<br><br>"Newspapers write articles sometimes opposing the Government.<br><br>"But, it is also time to review ministerial powers.<br><br>"At present, it is Â‘any decision of the minister shall be final and cannot be questioned by the CourtÂ’."<br><br>In 1988, Salleh wrote a letter to the King on behalf of the judges expressing disappointment over accusations made by the then Prime Minister Datuk Seri (now Tun) Dr Mahathir Mohamad against the judiciary.<br><br>Salleh was suspended. Later, five other judges were also suspended, of whom, two (the late Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawan Teh and Datuk George Seah) were dismissed.<br><br>Salleh, who will be 77 on Friday, was speaking to reporters after undergoing an angioplasty.<br><br>During the Press conference, he distributed a press statement on issues relating to the 1988 episode which led to a crisis in the judiciary.<br><br>"Since the judicial crisis took place in 1988, the Government has tried to clip the power of the judiciary. The way to do it, which I think is absolutely wrong, is to take away the vesting of judiciary authority from the courts.<br><br>"At one time, the courts had what we call the power for judicial review which is to receive complaints from the rakyat against wrongdoings and abuse of power."<br><br>He said the public should be allowed to take their complaints to the upper courts as practised in England and India. "It is very healthy.<br><br>"But in this country, you canÂ’t do that simply because the Government does not want to be tested as to the rights and wrongs of the GovernmentÂ’s doing."<br><br>He proposed the laws be amended to allow greater judicial independence.<br><br>"For example, if people want to hold a meeting, a rally or a speech, they need to apply for a permit but if the permit is not given by the local police chief, you can appeal to the chief police officer. But his decision is final and cannot be questioned in court.".<br><br>After the 1988 crisis, Salleh said he became disillusioned with the law.<br><br>"So much so that I never encouraged my children and grandchildren to take up law. I took my comfort and solace in becoming a simple gardener."<br><br>Asked how the 1988 crisis took place, he said it started when two Asian Wall Street Journal reporters made certain comments for which their visas were withdrawn. The matter went to court.<br><br>"Justice Datuk Harun Hashim then made a very strong comment on the power of the Government to withdraw the visa. The Government started to see the judiciary as interfering with the Executive. A lot of statements were made by the previous Prime Minister against the judiciary. I donÂ’t want to go further than that."<br><br>(In September 1986, the Government suspended the publication of the Asian Wall Street Journal and served a 48-hour expulsion order on two of its reporters Â— John Berthelsen and Rapheal Pura. The Journal challenged the order in court. The Supreme Court ruled on Nov 3 that the suspension of the Journal and the expulsion order on the journalists were wrong. The paper resumed publication and the expulsion order was quashed.)<br><br>Salleh said: "Political parties should not be a law unto themselves whereby disputes within the parties are not the subject of judicial review. Thus the parties become judges in their own cause, a clear violation of the principle of natural justice.<br><br>"More than this, the appointment and promotion of judges must be transparent if unhealthy frustration within the judiciary is to be avoided."<br><br>Bar Council president Yeo Yang Poh had said recently that a major mistake which had damaged democracy and the rule of law in the country was the "shameful episode in 1988 when the institution of the judiciary was attacked by the executive, resulting in the unfair and unceremonious dismissal of three top judges, and injuring many more".<br><br>Salleh said the councilÂ’s proposal to review the matter was for the countryÂ’s benefit, "which we want to see being governed democratically and in accordance with the rule of law, so that the system will endure for many generations to come".<br><br>He added the Bar CouncilÂ’s proposal should not be taken lightly as it involved a serious attempt to restore the judiciary to its "former golden era".<br><br>On Minister in the Prime MinisterÂ’s Department Datuk Seri Nazri Abdul AzizÂ’s statement dismissing the proposal, Salleh said: "Reading (NazriÂ’s) statement, I can only conclude it was made impromptu, off the cuff, without much study... I thought it was made in haste."<br><br>Salleh said he had no personal interest in the investigation, adding any such decision would be "a political decision... It would be up to the Government".<br><br>However, if called upon to give evidence, he said: "I would definitely like it."<br></blockquote></span></div>
