              <p><br>pardon me, changing of cook does not imply thinking big, it only imply decisive implementation, to think big, you have to have a vision, from there you work your way down, opposition are in opposite of it, they work in a way of thinking small and work in a way of doing small, that failed miserably, the like of Dr Chee can tell you a thousand stories already. He should think big, then work from top down, he should gather big supporter such as China or any other superpower to gain the balance of power to do anything here, instead he goes around selling papers and get himself into trouble for nothing.</p>
