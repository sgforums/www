              <p>If there is one fine day where our leaders are willing to hear our opinions instead of losing touch with the people, how will you want Singapore to be changed? For me it will be</p>
              <p>1) Implement a minimum wage policy. So that it will cost the same to hire a local &amp; a foreigner. Then the employer will hire on merit instead of price.</p>
              <p>2) Sell HDB base on gross family income instead of market demand.(Refer to Mr Tan Kin Lian's Blog) HDB is a public housing movement. Selling HDB Flats based on market demand creates loopholes for speculation irregardless how tight the anti speculation control is.</p>
              <p>3) Give more incentives to employers when their employees go serve NS. One of the common complains of the employers is that local employees have to serve NS. If the govt wants the employers to be supportive. More incentives should be given.</p>
              <p>4) Regulate the influx of foreign workers. Although the govt says the number is regulated, I disagree. The large numbers solely justifies for short term economic growth &amp; nothing else. In fact it is detrimental to productivity because growth is fueled by cost cutting instead of true productivity.</p>
              <p>5) Scrap the meritocracy system in selection of Members Of Parliament. I don't see the need to hire outstanding corporate eagles to be MPs. These people are good at making money so let them be. Parliamentary roles are meant for public service. Pegging public service salaries to corporate standards does'nt justify well for talent retention. I believe we need candidates with the spirit for public service besides their educational &amp; career portfolio. People who are willing to put in some sacrifice for a cause or purpose.</p>
              <p>6) Our leaders are worried that the enterprises &amp; MNCs may relocate due to competition. My opinion is that it is because they have not done enough to improve the productivity &amp; efficiency of our workforce. Productivity is not about solely the man hours. It is about efficiency. Quality over quantity. There's no use for large quanties if our produce are of inferior qualities to our competitors. Our qualities, efficiency, infrastructure as well as the micro details have to be improved so that we can have the right to command a higher price over our competitors. Then it is sayonara for companies who solely survives on price war.</p>
              <p>7) Lastly, I will like to touch on our educational system. It is sad but true that our students are trained exam candidates but notlearners. Our meritocracy system in education system have to be changed. For example, the streaming system in Primary school. It is a sign of Elitism from young age. Strong children needs to develop sense of compassion &amp; weak children needs to develop their sense of self esteem. Countries like Holland do not require their students to take exams in the 1st 7 years of their education &amp; yet they can produce Nobel prize winners. That is somethin which we can learn from.</p>
              <p>These are the changes which I wish to see in the future if our voices can be heard. Feel free to write your CONSTRUCTIVE opinions. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Why change soup??? think further lah...when my Dad go to a restuarant and find the soup not up to taste, he ask for change of Cook, not the soup ya.</p>

Why  opposition is thinking of filling up a few more seats in the parliament only, why not think of changing the whole PAP govt...change the cook ya.

              <p>first and foremost, to change the "cook" would be asking for a disaster to knock at your doorstep, some of the systems in place have become the pillars of the countrys growth, added unpopular ones that is now rojak with the basic ones, it's no easy task, to change it would create chaos.</p>
              <p>again you also forget that you as a pro-pap supporter is ignorant of the GRC system, how do those unpopular mps get there? thru the good ones.</p>

              <p>haiz, i hv to knock your head so that you can think big.</p>
              <p>If opposition is going to win anything is singapore just by election and competing in a few seats, 100 years down the road, still PAP rules.</p>
              <p>Incubment PAP MPs have mostly set their foot on their consituencies, because they already have a strong support. This places can hardly change, same goes to oppostion wards, hougang and potong pasir can hardly change to PAP MPs, that is the trend.</p>
              <p>Our oppostion, unlike opposition of other countries, when they got both peoples and external support, remember how LKY won his position, he gather support from British and tungku, but the present opposition got no one supporting them, they need to work on this, and to change singapore, they got to believe in revolution, either internally or externally, 911 airplane crushes into buildings are a long term revolution from internal mole, does oppositon have that mole in PAP? </p>
