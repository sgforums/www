              <p>Don't need to think so much everyone should have realized. It doesn't cost more than 50k to build a HDB flat unit. In fact, people in the industry have said that it cost around 20k-30k cost per unit. 3,4,5 room unit, how much space bigger only? Just that have more cramp rooms mah. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>If you can't afford, rent. Makes no difference from a 99yr leasehold from HDB. Your house will still be your liability unless you intend not to live there and sold it for a profit. Can we be 100% sure that we could sell it at profit in the future?</p>
              <p>If you are struggling to make ends meet, isn't it better to pay $600 rent per month than $800 monthly instalments?</p>
              <p>If your income is not very high, you would most likely stay in the house you bought for life. So would your life be better if you had paid $600 than $800?</p>
              <p>Of course there are other good reasons to buy your own house. Leave it to everyone to think about it. It's just an example. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
