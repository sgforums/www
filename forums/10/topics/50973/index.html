You're just one man fighting against the entrenched mindset of the entire party, and in Singapore's case its even harder with the cult of personality built around one person and the a significant number of the cabinet handpicked from his offspring and those who subscribe to his ideas.<br><br>Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan is one such example, a well known critic of the government who joined the Cabinet and claiming he wanted to enact change from within. Today he faithfully spouts the party line and is all to often controlled by the all powerful Party Whip.<br><br>To be a politician in Singapore, you either join an oppostion party, or become a government scholar or a wildly successful businessman who doesn't have too many skeletons in your closet. If taking the last 2 options, you then sit back and wait for the invitation from the ruling party to join their ranks. Oh, and given the government's fixation with grades, a 1st class Honours Degree is the bare minimum requirement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps we need an opposition with leaders that have good credentials already OUTSIDE of politics BEFORE entering the political fray.  The current oppo crop just cannot beat the PAP given their current image and strength.<br><br>I admit that much of their image is what the PAP paints of them, but then if they had indisputable credentials, then it'll be alot easier for people to trust them.  After all, while i mentioned elsewhere that the government now has some buffer for certain miscalculations given singapore's economic success, the election of people to become leaders of our country must have no mistake, cos we dun have enough buffer to elect a weak or lousy leader in and still expect to survive till the next elections to get him out.. .<br><br>my two cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah... Singapore can be consider a constitutional "monarchy", as SIngapore elects the "King" or Yang di Pertuan Agong, who is the President.<br><br>Why is this so?<br><br>Because of our past history with Malaysia. During the days when Singapore was merged with Malaysia. Every state has a chief minister (the state governor and now promoted to the position as a Prime Minister) and a ruler, or the Yang di Pertuan Agong (which is merely a symbolic representative of the people of the state).<br><br>Why the need of a symbolic representation is a matter of face, I think. Anyway, this is how our president came about who was then Yusof bin Ishak. But Yusof bin Ishak was always be looked down on for the Dubar or the Conference of Rulers as he was not born of the royal blood and was considered a commoner by Sultans of the Malaysian state.<br><br>The only true friend who really considered Yusof equality of status was our ally's Sultan of Brunei who was not part of Malaysia. Because the Sultan of Brunei thinks he was being looked down on when initially he was joining Malaysia, he did not like his status among the other Sultans.<br><br>Anyway, we still needed a President who's a model Singaporean whom the people look up too. So far, Mr. SR Nathan is averagely, so-so popular to me only. Firstly, he was not truly elected, as he was automatically appointed as President because he's the only eligible candidate. To many people, he still haven't do anything great than our former elected President Ong Teng Cheong. To me, the only thing I remember about Mr.  Nathan was his declaration of continuing eating of roti-prata in the Istana even though he has heart problems.</div>
