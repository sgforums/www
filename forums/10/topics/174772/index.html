            <div class='col-md body'>Letter from Jasna Dhansuklal<br>Manager, Corporate Communications<br>National Library Board<br><br>WE REFER to the letters by Cheong Ling ("Is cash so bad, NLB?", Jan 9) and Seah Cheng Hwee ("Cashcard-only policy a pain", Jan 11).<br>.<br>The introduction of cashless payments at the libraries is part of the National Library Board's (NLB) efforts to automate the payment process to serve our customers better and faster. As a result of this implementation, queues at customer service counters and transaction times have been reduced considerably. Cashless transactions take just a few minutes to complete.<br>.<br>Cash collection for micropayments at all our 23 branches is not feasible as it is too manpower-intensive as it involves not just the collection of cash, but also the handling and management of cash as well as daily banking transactions.<br>Currently, there is a wide variety of modes of cashless transactions. These include Cashcards, cheques, Ez-link, Nets and also online payment via prepaid accounts. Ez-link payment is now available at six libraries (Bukit Merah Community Library, library@orchard, Sembawang Community Library, Queenstown Community Library, Tampines and Jurong Regional Library).<br>.<br>Anyone with an ATM card can also use Nets for payment and since July last year, the Nets payment option has been available at all libraries except the Sengkang Community Library. These modes of payments are becoming popular among Singaporeans.<br>.<br>It is not cost-effective to accept payments less than $2 via Nets as each Nets transaction incurs a cost to NLB. For such payments, customers can pay via Ez-Link, Cashcard or combine their payments with those of their immediate family members.<br>.<br>We thank the readers for their feedback and hope they will continue to enjoy the services provided by the library.
