              <p><span class="time">December 28, 2009</span></p>
              <p>A Malaysian citizen and Singapore PR by the name of Chan Yeow Kwan has written to TODAY Voices urging toe Singapore government to realize the fact that “citizenship is a personal choice.”</p>
              <p>There is much public debate lately on Singapore PRs “exploiting” loopholes in the system to “enjoy the best of both worlds”.</p>
              <p>PRs are allowed to purchase resale HDB flats in Singapore and do not have National Service obligations.</p>
              <p>In last few years, there are reports of PRs who sold off their HDB flats for a hefty profit before retiring in their homelands for good.</p>
              <p>The “unfair advantage” enjoyed by PRs is a constant source of consternation and anger among Singaporeans leading to the recent announcement by the Ministry of Education to allocate one additional ballot for citizens in primary school application.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan admitted that he has been a Singapore PR for 15 years and has not taken up Singapore citizenship yet.</p>
              <p>From the tone of his letter, it appears that he has no intention of doing so.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan claimed that PRs spend their “prime years here contributing to the skilled workforce” and “Singapore gains by having young professionals from different cultural backgrounds and with a diversity of view points.”</p>
              <p>Mr Chan’s profession is not revealed in the letter. Though PRs are largely skilled workers in the past, nowadays semi-skilled and unskilled workers are given PRs as well.</p>
              <p>The state media is full of reports of cleaners, construction workers and masseurs being given Singapore PRs and citizenships.</p>
              <p>It is not known how they qualify for Singapore PR in the first place. According to the Home Affairs Ministry, there are 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens last year.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan added that it is a “personal choice” as to why some PRs do not take up citizenship:</p>
              <p><em>“It is not so much dictated by incentives, but by internal and external circumstances. A few friends of mine have returned to their home countries due to family commitments such as ageing parents who need constant medical care.”</em></p>
              <p>He also claimed that “Singapore will not lose if PRs choose to leave” as “it can keep on attracting young, new talent.”</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is not Singapore who lose out but Singaporeans themselves should these PRs leave after “milking” dry the system.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of foreigners have contributed to the rise in the cost of living, especially that of public housing and helped to keep the wages of the ordinary Singapore worker stagnant.</p>
              <p>An Indonesian PR “spoils” the market lately by forking out $653,000 to buy a 4-room resale HDB flat in Queenstown when he could well afford a private condominium.</p>
              <p>As PRs do not have to spend up to 4 weeks a year for reservist training, they are more highly sought after by employers thereby putting Singaporeans at a perpetual disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Despite widespread resentment and anger on the ground at the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy, it continue to insists that foreigners are “essential” for Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine, Singapore’s geriatrician leader MM Lee Kuan Yew said he is aware that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs.”</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>With such “enlightened” leaders like Lee and his son the Prime Minister in Singapore, Mr Chan’s worry that he may be “pressurized” to take up Singapore citizenship is completely unfounded.</p>
              <p>He can well continue earning Singapore dollars in Singapore and convert to Ringgit back in use in Malaysia where he can probably retire like a king for the rest of his life.</p>

              <p>yo, PR are not citizens ya, they are here to help to boost our economy, for them, they can earn Sing dollars here, buy house and pay full taxation, for us, we can tap on their skills and working to help our economy and also their taxes can be use to boost our education for our youngs and care for our oldies. A win win situation.</p>
              <p>Nobody would want to leave their homeland if there is good pasture in it, it is of no choice but to leave their loveone behind and search for better pasture, and fortunately, singapore provide that unique multi racial culture that suited many to flock into here. As a citizen of Singapore, we should be glad that our country can attract peoples to come here, it shown our strong economy powerness and a strong cohesive society. And if think that PRs parent countries are gaining from them, you are wrong, those countries do not know how to use their resources has an added advantage to Singapore, we tapped their brain and their strength in helping us to good life and prosperity.</p>
