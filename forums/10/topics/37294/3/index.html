As for singaporean joining the long long causeway queue, i do not know how are you going to explain it. But i do not think they buy tons of stuff from malaysia. They cross the causeway just to spend over in malaysia (movie, hairdo, makan, shopping, tour, fun etc) and not to buy stuff back in bulk but maybe some items that they can carry e.g. fashion stuff, gift etc which is cheaper over there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to tripwire,<br><br>You said in response to my post<br><strong><br>a) because here in singapore... they face a difference cost?<br><br>b) is it just NTUC or even your local mama shop also sell the sweet 20% more?<br></strong><br><br>The NTUC and the local grocery store sells the product at the same price. I see no added value that NTUC offers to the consumers. And how come only food and basic clothing is cheaper in Malaysia? You can buy electronics goods in both countries and find that its cheaper HERE. How do they keep the prices low while NTUC can't do the same for the food?<br><br><strong><br>NTUC and other GLC drove your mom-pop shop out of buisness... WHILE INCREDIBLY... the presence of hypermarts across the causeway charging at far lower price then local NTUC DONT??    someone lost a screw?<br></strong><br><br>The local neighbourhood grocery stores were wiped out during the 80s. The surviving ones are a remnant. So now the Malaysians in Johore are taking on NTUC. And good for them I say.<br><br><strong><br>if NTUC hires only locals... would you still go to shop at NTUC if they have to now charge your sweet at 40% higher then in malaysia to offset the cost of hiring local??<br></strong><br><br>If they want to charge 40% more for a sweet because of local staff, then they are stupid. After all, our electronics goods are cheaper than Malaysia's. How come our food is more expensive? We can go to any shop in town and buy it list price and still it will be cheaper than Malaysia. And those shops are locals. So how come locals in that segment can compete while food cant?<br><br>The Mai Ling pork has a shelf life of 3 years. So that is no spoilage or use by date. Same goes for shampoo etc. Yet those are cheaper in Malaysia. Like I said, we are being fleeced by the NTUC.<br><br><strong><br>so... you like to contradict yourself.... i see....<br></strong><br><br>So you like personal attacks .... I see ....</div>

However, for these "Privately Owned" stores to enjoy the strength of the NTUC bulk purchases, they have to sign on as "members" of a co-operative. The membership fee do not come at a low price, and these stores have to make minimum purchases for these mini-marts to maintain their membership.<br><br>If you noticed, many of these neighborhood NTUC FairPrice MINI-Markets are no longer in existence.<br><blockquote><strong><br>You seem to be purposefully arguing for the sake of an argument, without understanding the thrust of the post that the writer has made, and befuddle the issues of the original post, as the argument develop over the next few days.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> dont act smart lah... you are the one who is reading with eyes closed... no wonder everything looks fuzzy to you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong></blockquote>Who is acting smart now ?<br><br>Tearing up someone else's point of views, and pasting your critique with nonsensical "one liner" remarks that does not lead anyone to know your own ALTERNATIVE point of views nor bring the debate to any specific directions.
