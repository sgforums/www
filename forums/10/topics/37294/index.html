If anybody thailand should be the one to have national service for armed forces to beef their defence but they don't. So then why is there a need to train 450,000 conscripts when you don't even have a land border with myanmmar. The incident in 89 didn't appear in the news but was discussed in parliament. All I have said is true, they appeared in the media, newspapers and magazines at one time or another in bits and pieces.
