            <div class='col-md body'>To paulho<br><br>To me, Malaysia's Army is a credible threat. However, they are more rational than terrorists. If our SAF is spending to deter terrorism, then yes, I agree. But I don't agree on spending on some military stuff that brings intangible results while hundreds are laid off. (with wives, children all hungry)<br><br>If our entire SAF deterrence policy is one where we have to have better equipment that the enemy in order to keep the peace, then we will face economic ruin long before the first bullet is fired. Do we need equipment superiority when we already have numerical superority? Are we going to fire the first shot?<br><br>The old USSR was not defeated militarily. It went bankrupt trying to match the west. Even if the Malaysians bought whatever, are you now saying that we have no weapons that can counter the threat? Do we still need to have more white elephants?<br><br>To me, the threat is economic rather than militarily. My suggestion is to sacrifice some white elephants (the SAF is NOT a white elephant while some of its past and recent purchases are) to use in our economy. With unemployment at 4.9% and rising, we need more jobs and butter rather than guns. Lets turn the swords into plows.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am plain cheap<br><br>However, with the middle class having cars and being able to take advantage of the savings offered by Malaysia, and with the rich people able to afford the luxury items, the main loser is the poor. Those who can't travel to JB to shop or those "misled" not to shop.<br><br>That pork item is just one of the many that we can compare. In fact, made in Malaysia items such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, toiletpaper will all have greater savings. I don't smoke but I was told that smoking is one of the great savings?<br><br>Those are just on everyday household items. Not to mention the food, the petrol, the haircut, car service, car wash, clothes, stationery, medicine, drinks are all cheaper. Its easily a SAVINGS of $100 per car load of people per trip. (some even more) I have gone to Malacca for a weekend and that action packed trip is about $300 cheaper than a weekend in Singapore. But lets just use the $100 number for now.<br><br>Assuming that we can go 2 times a month, that is $200 per month worth of PURE SAVINGS. So assuming the middle class gets a take home salary of $4k per month, thats 5% of the take home pay. Very significant.<br><br>Our leadership plainly say that their million dollar salaries are only a few plates of char koay teow. Well $200 per month is close to 50+ plate of char koay teow.

With the display of your understanding of keynsian economics, you try to teach others about the "Keynsian effects of the NTUC Project. And now you are missing the point of the original issue posted two days ago. Don't flatter yourself with your assumptions of my post.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Here lies the problem that you have created in your head-on rush to give your critque, by preferring to read more then what my writing clearly spelled out.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> if you have to blame someone... blame yourself for inability to express yourself correctly and and with foresight....  afterall... the message is in the eye of the perciever...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> furthermore... i think that you are far more nationalistic then economistic..</strong></blockquote>Standard "blame game" of a lame politician in the making; but thanks alot anyway for your "compliments" whether I am a nationalist or an economist - it is no skin off my nose.<br><blockquote><strong><br>In your earlier post, you mentioned your expert "keysian effect" of an investment such as this NTUC White Elephant can have; and I had merely indicated how wrong you can be, as the major beneficiary of such an construction venture will largely benefit foreigners more then Singaporeans.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> which i have replied to kenhor post... how such an investment can also led to much benefits in many local economy and singaporeans.. ...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> furthermore... singapore is an open economy... its close to impossible to keep the money in the local economy as there are simply too many leaks... the best that can be done.. is to bring in more money then those that leaked out.... </strong></blockquote>For someone who has basic university training in economics, you sure are out to impress without even trying to understand the point of views of kenhor and myself. To borrow a line from someone of your class - "we are talking over each other's head".<br><blockquote><strong><br>Me upset about Foreigners taking more jobs ?

I will start a new topic to obtain some response as to why people cash in their ERS and SSS Shares.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Well, at least you are honest enough to concede that the ERS and SSS scheme is midguided besides being paltry, and that the funds could have been put to better use.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i percieve the current economic crisis as a golden opportunity for the govt to show its concern for its citizens... a proper system could have been instituted to grant help to all needy singaporeans...  unfortunately... this topic is departing from the original topic... and yes... i think the govt... is too economistic an animal this time round... </strong></blockquote>Same question as above - why did you cash your ERS and SSS ? In a hurry too - within the Year ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>BTW I have kept all my ERS and SSS shares, as the sums are so paltry that it is not worth my effort even to think about it.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> if you dont need it... please donate it to the community chest.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  </strong></blockquote>Certainly confirm that you are some kind of clairvoyant with psychic powers to read more into my postings of simple words.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Billions of Dollars ?
