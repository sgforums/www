            <div class='col-md body'>If government wants to solve its many problems, it must listen to genune feedbacks and not those who for the past thirty odd years have been singing praises for the government.<br><br>People like the pro-government grass root people or insider should not try to give feedbacks to forums as they are compelled to say good things about existing policies or practices.<br><br>Instead they should give feedbacks face to face to their RC, CCC, Town Council, Ministries, MPs and Ministers..<br><br>Let people give feedbacks which are true and not be subject to all the harassments or pressures. After all, PM Lee is inviting people to air contrarian or non-mainstream views. So please to those who constantly sing praises or try to justify government views, please think again.<br><br>Give greater opportunity to genuine feedbacks from the people. Do not try to convert them to same old views and justifications for the government. If these people who are part of government or grass root need to say something good, to win attention or favor, try to speak directly to their higher up or MPs instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Even the installation of cameras too so long. There is no sense of urgency in efforts to improve public safety.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's S'pore for you... for all you know... there may be thousands of Lee Hsien Loong's haters all ard... but the media only selects letters and interviews from people favouring him as PM. =P<br><br>as fer me...i've never had a good opinion of him anyway. HIs speech further emphasized how self-centred he was...<br><br>for example he says sth abt giving civil servants a five day week...well... this was requested a long time ago but he wasn't keen to approve of it. Now that he's PM he's given his approval just to gain the public's favour.<br><br>and look at his wife, Ho Ching. Shouldn't civil servants be asked to leave the service the moment they make mistakes, especially major ones? It is no secret that Ho Ching has caused Temasek HOldings to lose millions of dollars... i believe the ans is all too obvious to us why she is still in such a position of responsibilty.</div>
