MRT making hundreds of million a year from us. it isnt asking alot for them to build a door to ensure safety of children and old folks from falling into the track.<br>singaporean, time to wake up and stop thinking alike like the govt. we need to think outside our world.<br><br>if some of your teacher dare to stand out to voice out their concern, please encourage them and stop hiding behind the desk.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>long time since i post here.<br><br>well i think to some extent the media coverage on the speech is a bit too biased.<br><br>I saw the part whereby they claim that "activists hail govt's reforms". Basically the person they interviewed was  the defunct head of the roundtable. The Wp's slyvia lim didnt even comment.<br><br>frankly i feel that if you look closer, yes there are changes that help us, but he is still side skirting the opening of society. There is alot of existing debate on the need to open society so you guys can look at other threads.<br><br>Well men at arms asks why are we unhappy with government because all he sees is just ramblings with no substantiation.<br><br>i feel that the government has done a good job. But it is probhably getting into people's nerve that most of their MPs are not elected. As we know every election 70-80 percent of the seats remain unchallenge. It is also widely acknowledge that the Ruling Party engages in gerrymandering just before each election. Such a situation whereby there is no viable opposition and an extremely powerful incumbent causes this resentment-where the people do not feel represented-which Men at arms is looking for. people can get sick when some one is always right too.<br><br></div>
