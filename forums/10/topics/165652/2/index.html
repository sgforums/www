I am in favour of building carpark cos it makes economical sense to the shopowner there, to have a vibrant shopping area.   Next, will be the valuation loss for  the residents that residing at Blk 12 near the carpark as the property value will deplete as it is the carpark is too close for comfort.  The residents will probably loose out for the next few years without increasing their property value.<br><br>What amase me is that the structure of the carpark do not have the 2million fee and also why not take the opportunity to increase one more level since the objective is to increase the vibrancy of Holland V.<br><br>Lastly, why was it constructed there and not somewhere near blk 15?</div>

The car park at the junction of Holland Road / Holland Avenue will be reopened after construction works are completed around 2008. The other carpark at Taman Warna will have part of it occupied by one of the entrances of Holland Station, and the rest of it will be reinstated after construction completes.<br><br>To address parking demand due to the closure of these car parks, LTA has completed the following works as part of the car park upgrading contract:<br><br>1) Reconfigured the car park next to Block 14, adding 30 car park lots, increasing the number of lots to 328.<br>2) Widened the access road to allow for two exit lanes.<br>3) Erected signs along the road to direct motorists to these parking lots and directional signs on pedestrian walkway to lead them to Holland Village.<br><br>This upgraded car park will not be affected by CCL construction works and will remain even after Holland Station is completed.<br><br>Should you require further clarification, please feel free to contact us at Tel: 6858 7621 or email at cut_waste_secretariat@lta.gov.sg.<br><br>Leow Yew Chin<br>Cut Waste Secretariat<br>Land Transport Authority<br>DID: 6858 7621<br>cut_waste_secretariat@lta.gov.sg<br><br>Date of Reply 	: 	17/08/2005<br><br>Reply 	: 	Clarification<br><br>We thank you for your feedback.<br><br>The earlier works carried out in 2004, such as the widening of the access road, included preparatory works for the construction of the Circle Line Holland station. As an intermediate solution to alleviate the parking demand, we provided parking lots along the access road. Some were removed when the final traffic scheme was completed. As part of the earlier works, we also added 30 lots by reconfiguring the existing carpark. It may have been perceived that there had been no increase because of the removal of some lots previously barricaded off by the Police for security reasons. This upgraded car park will not be affected by the Circle Line construction works and will remain even after Holland Station is completed.<br><br>LTA had reviewed the parking demand together with URA and HDB. There are more than 200 parking spaces available in the multi-storey car parks, Blocks 5A and 10A. These car parks are within a few minutes? walk to the Holland Village. Nevertheless, we monitored the traffic condition with URA and HDB and found that motorists are reluctant to utilise the alternative car parking facilities. We had also received feedback from residents. To address these concerns, we decided to implement the car park deck.<br><br>URA and HDB are working on the upgrading and redevelopment plans for the area. The car park deck may be removed or retained, depending on their final plans. So far, there has been no decision made on its removal.<br><br>Should you require further clarification, please feel free to contact us at Tel: 6375 7085 or email at cut_waste_secretariat@lta.gov.sg.

The CCL phase 4 (Farrer Road) construction has removed many of the landscaping, shelters and walkways, at their place are many HUGE cylinders instead.<br><br>Another form of dynamism? After 3 years of MUP, another 3 years of chaos for CCL.<br><br>Anyway when CCL roll into in 2010, the residents will rejoice.</div>
