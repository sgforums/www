            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Visitors and residents at Holland Village now have more parking lots to park their vehicles.<br><br>A car park deck has been built on top of an existing open air car park in front of Block 12, Holland Avenue.<br><br>The shortage of parking lots in Holland Village has led to a lot of indiscriminate parking in the area; more so since two carparks were closed last October to make way for the Circle Line.<br><br>Some 116 car park lots were taken away, so it is hoped that the new car park deck will help ease the problem.<br><br>The S$2 million addition can take 89 vehicles, with another 28 parking lots added to the existing deck.<br><br>There are already more than 300 parking lots in two public carparks nearby.<br><br>It is hoped the additional lots will help solve the problem of car park woes at Holland Village to some extent.<br><br>Said Lim Swee Say, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and MP for Holand-Bukit Panjang GRC, "On the whole I expect the car parking issue to be a constant challenge because as long as Holland Villange continues to be successful, which I believe it will be, traffic will continue to be increased. And given the limited space, I hope everyone of us will cooperate with each other."<br><br>P Sripathy, project director (Circle Line 4 and 5), Land Transport Authority, said, "No doubt there are other carparks. These are ample enough for patrons to park but it's a bit of a walking distance from the centre so this project is helpful to the businesses as well as residents."<br><br>And visitors have already found it easier to get a parking spot.<br><br>"I think it's a fantastic idea. It's a pity they didn't put another floor on top," said one person.<br><br>And it is hoped that when the Circle Line is finally completed, car park woes at Holland Village will disappear altogether when visitors can take the MRT instead. - CNA /ct<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at the carpark, 50% is reserve for residents and 50% for public.  I am not saying that it is wrong but they should have consider to build it at a more appropriate place.  By the way this is only a temperory carpark and it worth $2mil, I didn't realise building a carpark in Holland V cost that much.  An average 3 rooms in Bllk 12 worth $200,000.  I just cannot comprehend the cost for it and that is all.</div>
