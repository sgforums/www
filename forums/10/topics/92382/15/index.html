            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Thinkloud2000,<br><br>The topic "Definition of True Democracy" arose because there exist many problems with autocratic governance. I don't have to go through the 20 problems with autocracy as posted as they were well discussed previously.<br><br>I agree with your view and those of Elfred that some other countries have worse problems. According to such view we can accept that autocracy has achieved a certain degree of success. Many people will not disagree with such view.<br><br>But we must remember one thing: success at what price to the people. Do all people succeed as well as the scholars and the rich?<br><br>I do not wish to go through the lengthy discussions again which policies of autocratic governance have caused problems and in what way they have caused problems to many people. I will confine to answering to your question: Why this topic as it seems too idealistic to ask for democracy or accountable and transparent management.<br><br>The main reason for starting this topic is that there existed many problems with autocracy as the ideas of a few men are not sufficient to run a competitive economy. Many solutions or policies under autocracy are too narrow only serving the interest of perpetuation of the rule not overly concerned with citizens' problems which are often sidelined with justifications and excuses. There is an absence of alternative views. The past policies could only achieve so much and the economic competitiveness stagnated up to a certain point.<br><br>The second reason is: autocracy is not a system or one that is sustenable. I have given you the reason for saying so in the previous post and replies to Elfred.<br><br>Even though democracy alone will not solve all problems, it offers a certain clearly defined political structural framework well tested in history towards which people could strive for improvements and continuous improvements.<br><br>Mistakes made by any elected leaders may be corrected in due course. Yes, there may be frustrations in solving certain problems due to the need to accommodate alternative views and allow checks and balances. Yes, important changes will take time to gain acceptance. There is a risk of discontent being expressed in street demonstration and labour unrest too.<br><br>However, look at the bigger picture. It does not mean that just because of freedom of expressions and choices there will necessarily be civil unrest or chaos as our leaders and news media under their control want all to believe. Many autocratic or dictatorial countries have turned to democracy and are having initial or teething problems. However that does not mean democracy has failed.<br><br>Democracy existed over the past many centuries. Many non-democratic countries are working towards establishing democratic electoral processes to ensure that there are no more perpetual abuses or mismanagement under autocratic or dictatorial rules as seen in the past.<br><br>Many people might not be aware that if there is no accountable and transparent participative governance involving all citizens to take part in freely expressing their views and scrutinise performance the situation may be worse. So it is important for Singapore to evolve its political system towards democratic model which allow mass participation to take place to bring about the knowledge applications and contributions by all.<br><br>Given a more educated workforce, there is a need to change to embrace all views and suggestions. Democracy is a long winded process but by suitably institutionalizing the good features of socialism, leadership in our case into the democratic framework as posted in the 7 points of practical democracy, the big mistakes under one-man domination and autocracy can be avoided without unrest. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But we must remember one thing: success at what price to the people. Do all people succeed as well as the scholars and the rich? </blockquote>I do not find tat only scholars succeed in singapore nor find other countries being different as well. Being a scholar, in some sense, had shown tat u are capable in a certain sense. If u r good enough, u can strive to be a scholar as well. U can say tat some of the schlars r fu#ked up, but then a high percentage of them r good as well. People who had a rich dad also find himself having more capital to start a business too. Life is not fair. Not in singapore, not in any democratic nation as well. I see people who r more educated in other country or being rich before they work being more successful as well.<br><br><blockquote>The second reason is: autocracy is not a system or one that is sustenable</blockquote>First I want to ask wat do u mean by the word sustenable... I have checked with dictionary and there is no such word for it. If u r talking about sustainable, Singapore and china has been around for donkeys years and it indeed seems to be sustainable. In fact the british also have its monarchy in the past and it had been around for few thousands years as well. America do have its share of autocracy when being controlled by british in the past as well. It do make them sustain longer even than the history of democracy itself. Autocracy sustain nations in the initial phase of building a country. U skip tis step and u will find yourself mire with many problems which can not be solved. Is democarcy sustainable ? It doesn't work on all countries as shown many times before<br><br><blockquote>Mistakes made by any elected leaders may be corrected in due course. Yes, there may be frustrations in solving certain problems due to the need to accommodate alternative views and allow checks and balances. Yes, important changes will take time to gain acceptance. There is a risk of discontent being expressed in street demonstration and labour unrest too. </blockquote>Not to forget some policies tat should be implemented is never implemented due to pressure and maintaining popularity. Changes r rarely seen after the implementation of policies because of difficulty of convincing opposition. U see countries like France and Germany, can they remove their healthcare benefit even though it is making htem in the brink of bankrupcy ? They can't. Indonesia has also ran out of resources trying to subsidise for the fuel cost in indonesia. Can they change the policy ? They can't. Resources appear to be used up within a short period of time in order to gain popularity.<br><br><blockquote>Many autocratic or dictatorial countries have turned to democracy and are having initial or teething problems. However that does not mean democracy has failed. </blockquote>And tat does means tat autocarcy is needed in the starting up phase of most nations. Only after the country is rich and educated then can democracy be implemented. Democracy fails if a country is poor and short history of education for its people.<br><br><blockquote>Democracy existed over the past many centuries. Many non-democratic countries are working towards establishing democratic electoral processes to ensure that there are no more perpetual abuses or mismanagement under autocratic or dictatorial rules as seen in the past. </blockquote>Is malaysia free from abuses and corruption ? They aren't. IS indonesia free of abuse from its leaders ? They didn't. Is india managing well comnpared with country like china ? They isn't. It doesn't depend on your political model.</div>

Life is not fair. Not in singapore, not in any democratic nation as well. I see people who r more educated in other country or being rich before they work being more successful as well.<br><br>Robert: If you are to re-read the quote, you will notice that you have avoided answering to the point. The point being singled out for your reply is: at what price was success extracted. I have repeatedly answered the same points previously relied upon by protagonists of autocracy that not all democratic countries did well. Now I am answering to the same points of sorts that not all scholars are bad as we cannot pain all in one broad brush.<br><br>However, under our autocracy, a great deal of claims have been made that our scholars it rely on to assert its supremacy are talents who could solve all problems to justify their autocratic rule and paying them the world's best salaries.<br><br>Unfortunately autocracy when put to the acid tests during the last two recessions and previous Asian Financial Crisis simply come across as helpless and cannot solve many serious problems. Apart from re-gurgitating past policies to attract more foreigners to replace quitter Singaporeans in jobs or opportunities, these scholars as a whole or the autocratic system was helpless and told the people that they have to wait and wait for external world recovery.<br><br>The people are now saying the autocracy and scholars are not that great and have failed to solve many problems. The only success seems to be the uncanny ability to tax and recover all costs treating all government departments as business corporations from citizens like milking cows thereby running down our economic competitiveness.<br><br>There are no creative or entrepreneurial solutions so far to prove that the scholars are indeed talents who could lead in creating a more entrepreneurial or competitive economy going forward. It the ability of extracting S$500,000 - S$800,000 per family from double and triple taxing on big ticket items really what is called talents or meritocracy.<br><br>There were serious problems affecting the economy. However protagonists of autocracy simply tried to avoid answering them as you have avoided answering to the quote in a relevant factual manner. Go and re-read people's feedbacks on such problems. If the autocratic rulers are not as self-centred, they should be able to see immense problems.<br><br>The most crucial of all these 20 problems was the practice to talk down on people and dismiss problems as not created by them or by making comparisons with worse-off countries. With the media under their control, they happily stay put and expected the people to form political parties to challenge them. That is the only response to date - not that original, thinking out of the box or entrepreneurial.<br><br>There has been a neglect of nurturing practical applications innovations and entrepreneurs needed to sustain a more competitive economy for years due to track-minded auto-piloting of certain non-welfarism policies of the past as mentioned in detailed by ex-civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow.<br><br>Try to answer the above-mentioned replies given in previous discussions to date. Do not assume there are no problems with autocracy or that autocracy has been a success if you cannot answer to these concerns. I do not wish to repeat my previous replies already given to your selective comparisons that autocracy has been successful elsewhere or democracy has failed in many cases. Reply to the valid points made in my previous posts which you failed to do so up to now by avoidance and unending selective comparisons to suit your arguments.<br><br>I only hope that after the long intervals of pondering over the matter you will henceforth reply with relevance and to the point and not resort to saying some scholars are doing better than others and at the end hope to get away with assumptions in your own mind that autocracy in our context has greatly succeeded.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>...to continue</div>

Guess that's why ridiculous actions like the War against Iraq happen! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Calling for democracy is not really worse than calling for more good people, because -surprise, surprise- both are essentially the same. Democracy provides the forum for the cancellation of the bad by the good, in allowing the sharing of a variety of opinions.<br><br>Democratic systems are not just defined by he existence of the electoral vote, becasue as you indicate, voting sometimes goes by popular sentiment and prevents the good pple- i suppose that includes your "Great People" as well - from being in  power. But one must recognize that in authoritarian and autocratic systems, like Singapore, the quality of the people selected for office is solely dependent on the wisdom of the existing "good" people running the govt. ANd that is the trap of authoritarianism and autocracy- that the people selected might end up being in theri positions due to the self-interest of the existing "good people".<br><br>But since I do not want my argument to degenerate into an autocracy-bashing essay like Robert's has, I shall continue with my definition of democratic systems. the govt is NOT the sole institution of the system in such a case. it is partnered by such as the free press and the NGOs and the research institutions.<br><br>the free (and) responsible press reports all information and opinions of the govt and the pple. it is the medium of two-way communication in the democratic system. To clear any misconceptions, the free press is not one which is run by demagogues spewing threats of revolution, because obviously in such a press, censorship will be prevalent, except that it will be censorship of pro-establishment views.<br><br>I know you dislike academia, but nonetheless independent research institutions like the Pew Foundation provide empirical data from their researches, which ina democratic system, will spur debate thorugh the medium of the free press, which will aid the government in deciding proper policies and selecting good people for office.<br><br>As for NGOS, these are stuff like AI and UNHCR, which serve to remind the government of its obligation to preserve the institution., and the check to ensure that despotism in any form does not occur. ANd obviously, these are independent and non-partisan - their viewpoints are their own, and not a result of influence from third parties.<br><br>That is essentially what democracy is, and not jsut Robert's sadly over-simplified definition of a multi-party state with all those cliches like transparency and accountability.<br><br>And anyway, my main point expressed in teh analogy was that: SIngapore is not democratic. But more than that, we should aim to make it more democratic, even more so than the West.<br><br>I really dun think it's impossible, we just need to cram our minds hard.<br><br>Thanks for your reply.<br><br>the pikamaster (who's awiitng results from sadistic MOE)</div>

Someone has previously referred to other possible alternative systems of governments like monarchy and now you have again referred to it. Upon further discussions, actually monarchy may or may not be a system as it similarly relies on the ideas, intuitions or "which side of the bed the monarch wakes up from". If a leader or monarch decides otherwise to benefit himself, will such a system be able to correct its mistakes or solve problems to keep the country competitive. It is common sense that autocracy counts on the ability of the top-echelons or supreme leader himself to be self-inspired and benevolent. Once he loses that interest being too comfortable or afraid to change, all the goodness of any earlier achievements may simply come to an end. Someone has assigned another factor to explain that autocracy or other systems may work just as well. He called that "heritage". When I asked him "heritage" should be started from which period "before or after the second world war" he did not reply any further because "heritage" is too uncertain and intangible to be comparable to accountable and transparent democracy.<br><br>Autocracy appears to be possible for a new state just gaining independence. Emperor Qin Szu Huan might be hailed a great leader who united the ancient China. Today, he would be incompetent if he has not the ability to involve all citizens in applying all fields of knowledge to attain competitiveness.<br><br>Therefore in today's context, sustainability is not offered by monarchy or autocracy unless autocracy can incorporate a combination of accountable and transparent practices offered by democracy to motivate and involve all to succeed in teamwork, coordination and knowledge application.<br><br>The latter lack of involvement of citizens in mass participation and practical contributions in all fields was what went wrong with our autocracy. That is the reason for its lack of solutions to many problems except to tax and recover all costs as posted.<br><br>Britain may be regarded as a monarch in form but in substance it is a democracy. A sustainable system is a system to begin with and as a system it is capable of self-regulations and self-corrections to solve problems as they occur. How to progress competitively in a knowledge-based world of today is a bigger challenge than what the rulers are capable of. If people don't go along and share any common interests or programs because of continuing same policies of the past, they would migrate and continue to ignore all the self-justifications put up to perpetuate the autocratic rule.<br><br>Sustainability is not just a matter of doing well for one generation or one period of time after independence. The fact that China or India has survived for centuries does not mean that their systems or ad hoc or imperialistic rules of the past are sustainable in today's competitive environment.<br><br>In today's context, sustainablity is afforded by one that will continue to gain momentum from past to future to bring about non-stop improvements and upgrading capable of solving problems due to internal self-regulations and motivations of all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>...to continue<br><br></div>

Yes, there may be frustrations in solving certain problems due to the need to accommodate alternative views and allow checks and balances. Yes, important changes will take time to gain acceptance. There is a risk of discontent being expressed in street demonstration and labour unrest too.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Stupidissmart: "Not to forget some policies tat should be implemented is never implemented due to pressure and maintaining popularity. Changes r rarely seen after the implementation of policies because of difficulty of convincing opposition. U see countries like France and Germany, can they remove their healthcare benefit even though it is making htem in the brink of bankrupcy ? They can't. Indonesia has also ran out of resources trying to subsidise for the fuel cost in indonesia. Can they change the policy ? They can't. Resources appear to be used up within a short period of time in order to gain popularity. "<br><br>Robert: "Obviously you have agreed to the underlying point as quoted: that democracy may be slower in regard to making of certain changes but being more accountable and involving masses through freedoms and choices with checks and balances, democratic countries could correct mistakes like taxing people double and triple on land usage, and transportations could be addressed better in due course.<br><br>Democratic processes could be in a better position to avoid that kind of overzealous pursuit of Mother tongue/CL1 to the extent of causing big problems to the populations realized recently by MM Lee 30 plus years late. By then, many of its best practical minded talents and entrepreneurs have migrated. Will you not consider these are big mistakes caused by autocracy but not capable of being solved because one man held his belief so stubbornly in so-called leadership or talents which cannot be changed until disasters struck.<br><br>Certain democratic countries might have encountered certain problems with welfarism but not all of them. The people knew the problems and were sorting them out. You appear to refer to newly democratising countries as good examples to suit your arguments like Indonesia in respect of over-subsidising of fuel costs by government. Do you realize that by having made so many selective comparisons with worse-off countries which are not democracy until recently, you are not objective in your discussions. Welfarist democracy might have experienced certain problems with hand-outs the important thing is they have a system that allows their people to change. On the other hand, as against welfarism the reverse of taxing and recovering all costs of providing government services on various pretexts does not mean autocracy is a better system either with regard to welfarism. Domestic sector of the economy is deprived of growth and at the end the problems so caused is far worse when compared with some form of reliefs to people which autocrats prefer to brand all as welfarism to suit their self-perpetual rule.<br><br>So again do not use the welfarism and Indonesia's example to justify that autocracy has succeeded very well or deny problems with autocracy of aspirations of people for sustainable improvements, accountable and transparent management.<br><br>A open and accountable system over and above everything else allow people to progress and compete on knowledge applications in all field. It is doubtful autocracy so strongly based on ideas of one supreme leader or a few subsisting scholars at the helm will lead to mass innovations and discoveries of new frontier technologies as many democratic societies have for years been enjoying.<br><br>Broad-based education as a system of autocratic rule or justifications by a few scholars upheld as talents holds the ultimate key to progress and further advancements. Just look at autocracy. Progress beyond limited success of initial industrialising has tapered off at a certain level. As witnessed, by the general helplessness during the last two recessions, and the earlier Asian Financial crisis, there is a lack of motivated mass participation in innovations and knowledge application to sustain the economic competitiveness of a new age. There is a lack of entrepreneurs which now are considered more important than academic grades or scholars.<br><br>Autocracy now has to rely on sheer replacements of citizens or companies to ride over people' wishes for real and genuine progress. People are not being motivated as they are suffering from all kinds of discouragements due to taxing and recovery system of running the place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

So for every comparison you have made selectively to suit your arguments there is no truths in your conclusions or deductions whatsoever.

Democracy provides the forum for the cancellation of the bad by the good, in allowing the sharing of a variety of opinions.<br><br>Democratic systems are not just defined by he existence of the electoral vote, becasue as you indicate, voting sometimes goes by popular sentiment and prevents the good pple- i suppose that includes your "Great People" as well - from being in  power. But one must recognize that in authoritarian and autocratic systems, like Singapore, the quality of the people selected for office is solely dependent on the wisdom of the existing "good" people running the govt.

Isn't this <span style="font-style: italic;">Village</span> of smaller villages? And how powerful is democracy beyond the powers of one of the most powerful democracy-calling superpower?<br><br>Not really that powerful, as least going from what Robert's expection of democracy.<br><br>If even USA is not willing to give up its veto, or one may liken it to a sort of ISA's nature, Robert, you are just chasing for something that'd (not say never) but almost impossible to come about. And such time and effort is wasted.<br><br>You see, if (for eg) some powers can easily or rightfully intervene democracy, it's gone. For eg (again), we all practise what democracy in this forum and it turns out all wants to have the moderators replaced. But scally IDA intervenes and veto against the decision or intervene by blocking everyone who are have that decision out of the forum and replace another bunch of forumers, or whatever.<br><br>In reality, situation will decide democracy, and those politically talented will decide the situation. While what most, if not almost all, really need is to focus on getting good people into the government, or nurturing good people to improve things.<br><br>What is democracy when your replacement for a bunch of rots is just one other bunch of decays...?<br><br>Whether it's the dynasty or the village under dynasty, it was still the good people, the politically talented, in place whereby good regime resulted.<br><br>I know many do not have much guidance in political thinkings, most just read textbooks (such as those from Fukuyama or what) or go through what formal education on politics. But it's critical for political interested to think in the proper direction.<br><br>Do not forget one thing, people behind the screens. The party of people whom you scream and swear against for being autocratic, being depots, being whatever, were products of a form of democracy. PAP was formally an opposition, due to election. PAP became the incumbent, also due to election.<br><br>This incumbent whom many claim to be autocratic is a result of democratic election. I don't know whether how well you guys and gals are thinking, but for Robert, just realise that if you find PAP autocratic or say what autocracy creates problems, in one whole round, it'd have to be democracy to give rise to what autocracy you are unhappy about... and you are still focusing so much about democracy...? I really find it funny. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I ain't angry with you, Robert.

What temerity and what impunity to confront millions of American voters with such over-blown egoism.<br><br>How odd is that conclusion? On the one hand you are favoring autocratic efficiency and ability to persist in running on pure accidents or luck, on the other you forget that they were elected under democratic or presumed democratic processes in first place. So which is which now? Has our autocracy benefited from democratic processes or democracy acquired a new-fangled autocracy in our case ?<br><br>I suppose by the same token of your logical reasoning, our democratically elected leaders are after all also same as Reagans and Bushes, actors or jokers in the same vein. It would seem that once autocray has its way and the mind is made up, no one else will be good enough and there will be no such things as choices, alternatives or solutions. So how do we have a logical discussion ?<br><br>You have been saying again and again that having good leader is the single most important criterion. Let me ask: how do you judge who is a good leader or his results in the first place? Do you have a basis?<br><br>So far, I can only see intuitive judgmental opinion like: "I don't trust democracy. I only trust good men and women to get good men and women.". This kind of reasoning is like: "it depends on accidents or luck in finding a good man to run a country". This has been the case for autocracy or leadership as far as I can see in your arguments. Sigh !!!</div>

But in an autocracy, it is 100% or 0%; there is no middle ground. SO in autocracy, you either gain more or lose more than in democracy, depending on the enlightenment level of the autocrats.<br><br>Anyway, as for the answer to your primary question: all the informal organs of govenrment i.e. the free press, the NGOs etc. provide checks and balances to prevent abuse of power by the autocrats/people in power.<br><br>the reporting of the free press on the govenrment's actions and the public's reaction serves as a means of communciaiton on waht needs to be done in the various aspects of governnance, and as a feedback for what already has been done.<br><br>The NGOs' primary fucntion, like the research institutes and universitiies, is to highlight the relevant issues that require the government (legislative and executive) to tackle and to pressure the authorities to act fast, especially on crucial issues like terrorism or IP Rights. As that old proverb says, "Two heads are better than one"; put it this way, no matter how "talented' your autocrats are, it is extremely impractical to assume that they have information on everything that requires their attention or even know everything that requires their attention. THus, the NGOs provide such an avenue for information that is objective and solid.<br><br>The Judiciary maintains the executive's proper behaviour and controls the quality of the  laws pased by the legislative. we're referring to an independent judiciary of course.<br><br>even in the legislative, the need for more than one opinion and oinformation from different perspectives is served by the existence of different factions within the collective body. thus, better and more informed decisions can be made in general.<br><br>Does that answer your question, Elfred?<br><br>the (willing) pikamaster</div>

What temerity and what impunity to confront millions of American voters with such over-blown egoism.<br><br>How odd is that conclusion? On the one hand you are favoring autocratic efficiency and ability to persist in running on pure accidents or luck, on the other you forget that they were elected under democratic or presumed democratic processes in first place. So which is which now? Has our autocracy benefited from democratic processes or democracy acquired a new-fangled autocracy in our case ?<br><br>I suppose by the same token of your logical reasoning, our democratically elected leaders are after all also same as Reagans and Bushes, actors or jokers in the same vein. It would seem that once autocray has its way and the mind is made up, no one else will be good enough and there will be no such things as choices, alternatives or solutions. So how do we have a logical discussion ?<br><br>You have been saying again and again that having good leader is the single most important criterion. Let me ask: how do you judge who is a good leader or his results in the first place? Do you have a basis?<br><br>So far, I can only see intuitive judgmental opinion like: "I don't trust democracy. I only trust good men and women to get good men and women.". This kind of reasoning is like: "it depends on accidents or luck in finding a good man to run a country". This has been the case for autocracy or leadership as far as I can see in your arguments. Sigh !!!</div></blockquote>Well... heaven is fair...<br><br>You give some to him you take away some...<br><br>If that's the what line of thought you really insist to take, then it's up to you. I am not here for such argument but sharing of thoughts.</div>
