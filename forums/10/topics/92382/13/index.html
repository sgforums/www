There are about 20 major problems created due to many years of entrenched centralist top-down management as posted under "Definition of True Democracy" at www.sgforums.com.sg.<br><br>If scholars, autocracy or centralist system cannot solve these 20 problems. High costs and loss of economic competitivenesss of the domestic economic sector are two serious problems not being addressed. It is too easy for MM Lee to assume that he has won any debates with students. He has not won any debates with the general population yet on this matter.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear fellow forumers,<br><br>There have been many postings on democracy versus autocracy, the latest being the debate between MM Lee at Kentridge with NUS students on 31.1.2005.<br><br>Just look at changes in our region: China, Indonesia and many other previously autocratic or communist countries are loosening controls on citizens to allow greater participation in decisions that affect their lives. Why do they have to open up the political process  - supremacy of knowledge, technological advances and the internet of course!!!<br><br>On the subject of change or democratising, there have been many fears or reservation expressed in MM Lee's debates with students of disorders due to openning up.<br><br>There can be alternatives or solutions to past problems like communism and communalism too or recently even terrorism. Instead of closed door decisions any country can no doubt practise open and accountable processes to be more effective in solving diverse problems.<br><br>The leaders should recognize that in a knowledge-based, technological and internet world of today, it is no longer intuitions or good judgements alone on the part of a few men at the helm that determine success.<br><br>Success is proportional to the ability to attain goals through wider participation and making decisions under consistent accountable and transparent management.<br><br>Thaksin has just achieved a landslide victory as reported by Today's Newspaper published on 8.2.2005. It was reported that Thaksin has quelled fears about autocracy.<br><br>In other words, democratizing, involving people to strike the final goals or heading to the right directiosn are proven to be generally the more progressive governance.<br><br>The above-mentioned democratic accountable and transparent processes will lead to better solutions of the 20 problems posted facing Singapore. It is better for MM Lee to debate these with students again on more forums. I hope he will not side-track such debating points the next time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, all forumers,<br><br>As posted to Feedback Unit:-<br><br>QUOTE: Singapore is too much like a machine ("hardware") today. Cold but efficient. Everyone follows a rule book. The education system has succeeded in moulding every child to fit the economy as designed by a few elites. Those that are different.....is deemed by the rest as misfits and looked down upon.UNQUOTE<br><br>The FU has not answered questions from fellow forumers how the above-mentioned truthful opinions of citizens would be implemented. Forumers have asked for some kinds of loop to show sincerity in feedbacks or progress in effecting change. Dr. Wang Hai Yuen again recently said that there was expectations by people to introduce loop to feedbacks to effect responses to people's grouses. He was probably not listened to by the higher up yet.<br><br>QUOTE:"This just doesn't stop at one's qualifications, salary or skill sets etc. It propagates to how one thinks, acts, looks etc. We have turned into robots powered not by electricity but $$$. UNQUOTE<br><br>The same thing has happened to another regular feedback as stated in the foregoing. The existing system seems to be interested only in taxing and after taxing recovering as much costs as possible at market-value fees and charges. The loop to Feedback should be introduced as soon as possible. This system of governance does not benefit the people. It only benefit the government or government efficiency. People are the targets or the miling cows. It is time to heed people's repeated suggestions to do something sooner rather than later.<br><br>QUOTE:A lot of us can't see the rule book anymore and they are at a loss. Scared for themselves and their children.UNQUOTE<br><br>Why are the scholars still rule-book oriented? The controls and regulations from the top in the form of queries, dealing with problems at work level probably consist of fault-finding without another book to guide civil servants on "how to serve the public", "how to cut red tapes", "how to be more flexible"...<br><br>Without a balance and allowing superiors to manage or govern on intuitive or ad hoc basis, everything will be dependent on some sorts of self- or self-centred approaches which finally lead to difficulties to change.<br><br>The "Softer" Rule Book should take precedence over personal judgmental approach of individual superiors to lessen power-play or use of power to entrench past behaviours or policies that were autoc-piloted.<br><br>The above-mentioned suggestions to change the civil service to one more user- or citizen-friendly have obviously been overruled by top-down principles or postulates of MM Lee and no one dares to offend his thinking along this line. This self-inhibitions by all civil servants or civil lords is the one to change.<br><br>QUOTE:To stay ahead, Singapore needs to have diversity built into our lives. WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. THERE'S NO ONE ANSWER FOR EVERY PROBLEM. UNQUOTE<br><br>This again is another feedback regularly taken up by forumers here. For example, some have called on leaders to recognize that individuals are different and each should be given the right opportunity at the right moment to develop or nurture to diverse applications of knowledge - innovations and entrepreneurships. No one seems to be interested as there is no loop to the feedbacks channel to show how good ideas and suggestions are received at higher or departmental level. In other words, autocracy is so deeply entrenched that it will continue to pose a major obstacle to change to benefit citizens.<br><br>QUOTE:Got to set up this culture quickly AND EXPORT IT so that more good capable people will WANT TO SETUP in Singapore. In this respect, we can learn to be like America......we have to be a 'statue of liberty' for Asia. This in my view will decide if Singapore can stay ahead.UNQUOTE<br><br>I agree that the moment Singapore autocratic relaxes and stops thinking of its ease of governance as major criterion of nationhood, the doors of creativity and entrepreneurship will open and Singapore could even take this as a culture of mass participation and innovations to the next level - export its real entrepreneurial spirit abroad to benefit its regional business management which probably suffer from the same dire lack of open and accountable mass contributions from workers.<br><br>QUOTE:I'm not talking about democracy, individual rights above society etc. It's meaningless to me. Just another charade. UNQUOTE<br><br>On this point, there is a need to recognize that failures to achieve real benefits and progress for people are caused by autocracy not any particular other causes. Autocracy has posed a great deal of limitations and controls affecting choices. Individuals or systems within systems are not at fault.<br><br>The only way forward is for autocracy and autocratic behaviours of leaders to change. How to do so should be determined by something from higher up. Democracy may not solve many problems but democracy as a system is still intact. The fact that democracy has not been as successful as the Western European countries like Finland or Switzerland does not mean that people should give up democracy. Singapore has a basic democratic base but over time this base has been altered to one befitting the autocrats.<br><br>By openning up and democratising Singapore political process, the 20 problems with autocracy as posted earlier will be better solved through greater accountability and coordination thereby bringing people on board to effect change. This has been the gist of changes as posted by many here if I may sum up their points. However sad to say, it leaders are still paranoid about self or talents that they presumably possess then this mass participation and a more entrepreneur culture will never happen at all..<br><br>By accepting the suggestions to introduce the 7 points of democracy (a kind of practical platform) to assure citizens of rights or choices in making suggestions for change without fears of reprisals a great deal of what people are asking for in the above-mentioned can happen naturally and logically. The basis issue here so very simple for all to see is whether our autocratic leaders still believe in the need to keep decisions making to themselves..or whether they are prepared to loosen up all the policies that do not work as shown in the 20 problems with autocracy.<br><br>QUOTE:I'm not talking about dismantling the institutions either. Indeed SOME are worth keeping. Though a serious overhaul is long overdue in some UNQUOTE<br><br>Many forumers have regularly posted on the need too to keep to certain good institutions that we have. We have a system which enables government to decide on matters that might take longer in other system. However, many institutions are not worth keeping because they only justify greater controls for government own sake.<br><br>Examples of institutions not worth keeping include: press and media self-censorship as written about by Michael Backman (disinformation by MITA), diverse duplications, committees of parliamentary secretaries, town councilors, committees and statutory boards that overlap with existing ministries which tend to excuse of primary functions of ministers of non-performance or failures etc etc. I am sure forumers have more examples to give ...All these would not have been tolerated by CEOs of MNCs or private sector as these are too costly to maintain and not effective. Committees and secondary appointements of all kinds should be amalgamated to the primary departments once the temporary purposes have been served not to be carried on to add on costs.<br><br>God Bless..

And of this politically enabled, only they know the 1 who would really know how to govern. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually... seems to me there's a problem in this debate on democracy and autocracy.<br><br>Just my 1ct view, nothing more. No need to agree.</div>
