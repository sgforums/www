If status quo is not bad at all, and if we aren't enjoying the freedoms tt other countries do, and yet it's ok, then why are you looking for more space, freedom and empowerment i.e. looking to change the status quo?<br><br>A constitution deals in the political sphere. Generally, the daily life of Singaporeans should not be changed too much; what do you mean by a changing way of life anyway? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Customs inimical to progress will be broken down, but this does not mean that all traditional customs will disappear. It also does not mean that familiar buildings, such as schools, markets, factories, hotels, or even the I(Casino)R will be torn down. Not  a revolution in that sense of the word.<br><br>What the new constitution means is that the form of administration and political structure will be changed, as I explained in my previous post. It has an ideological accent, but I doubt that it is really too strong; well, everything needs to be based on an ideology at some point, doesn't it?<br><br>Anyway, my basic question is : what do you define as the Singaporean way of life? Aren't there aspects of it you might like to change, such as kiasuism or what? As a side note, revolutions didn't exactly change the way of life for many people in the country either; the only one that did, I think, was the Industrial Revolution.

            <div class='col-md body'>Democracy can be anything but there is no true democracy. As you see USA as a pure democrat state or like the democratic party which is centre-left and not completely centre which considers as true democrat or the Republican Party which is centre-right. And Singapore uses the democracy in a way that is their style which thinks that we have freedom of speech or whatever but it is social-democrat and not democratic only. How about China? They use the word democratic also their usage also have their style like Singapore or others but they are socialist not deomcratic. Ask another thing North Korea uses democratic in their official title but it is their style too. So democratic can be in any style whether on the left, right or the TRUE one which no country have it.</div>

In practice, though, There are going to be many obstacles in setting up and running such a form of organization. First and foremost, the sources of information by which such research needs to be based on is monopolised by IPS and other govt-afflilaited agencies; there is not much of a way to get to them. Secondly, reseach carried out by CiPRI may not make it to the public, because in case you may not notice, CiPRI will most likely be branded a political organization (read: party) and not be allowed to share "inflammatory derogations" with the public since these would "threaten national interests and be inimical to national security". Don't these concerns sound familiar? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>the sad pikamaster</div>

In practice, though, There are going to be many obstacles in setting up and running such a form of organization. First and foremost, the sources of information by which such research needs to be based on is monopolised by IPS and other govt-afflilaited agencies; there is not much of a way to get to them. Secondly, reseach carried out by CiPRI may not make it to the public, because in case you may not notice, CiPRI will most likely be branded a political organization (read: party) and not be allowed to share "inflammatory derogations" with the public since these would "threaten national interests and be inimical to national security". Don't these concerns sound familiar? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>the sad pikamaster</div></blockquote>I do not have the details on your proposed CiPRI. Is it the same as People's Policy Panel i suggested to the FU sometime ago whose role is to review and comment on government policies? If it is the same then I disagree that CiPRI is a political organization.  It would be more than an independent NGO body formed by the people to serve the people.<br><br>Of course, I am not against CiPRI whatever form it may take even if I do not support the details yet at this stage.

These attitudes do not rest in specific "factions", as you call them, but like everything else, rest on a spectrum. At one extreme end, there is the control-freak, and China, NK and Russia fit tt end, and the other end has anarchy: USA and Netherlands are quite good examples of this. Every person has his or her own position on the spectrum, denoting his or her attitude respectively. where something lends between that point and anarchy, it is called democracy, and anywhere between that point and the point of the control-freak is called dictatorship. left  means the range of democracy, and right means dictatorship, so clearly democracy cannot be centre right; it can be left-centrist or centrist though. right side refers to dictatorship or authoritarianism, such as is practiced in Singapore and Malaysia. The "democratic" in the pledge refers - although I doubt pple understand it - the ultimate centrist point, the ideal point for political attitude, which no nation have reached; I concede even the USA has not reached that point. That is the point which is equally anarchic and control-freakish (if there is such a term) , and at the same time neither anarchic nor freakish.<br><br>hope you understand.<br><br>the sincerely democratic pikamaster</div>

They are left-wing to the extent which they change existing systems of adminiatration and social organization, and right-wing to the extent which they seek to maintain the social quo they set up; left wingers usually advocate continuous change.

            <div class='col-md body'>(Posted to FU on 18.7.2005)<br><br>It takes many years for the elites to understand people's expectations and aspirations.<br><br>What people want and have posted in this panel can be essentially summarized as follows:-<br><br>(1) Accountability and Transparency government.<br><br>(2) Ministers walking the talks and results-oriented.<br><br>(3) Broad-based education system emphasising on practical knowledge application to produce more entrepreneurs to create jobs. (Not narrowly emphasising on producing more academicians and scholars will not produce a vibrant or competitive economy. It is seen to produce well-paid civil servants without solving many problems e.g. high cost problem is getting very serious) In fact the past policy has dragged on our competitiveness from 1970s.)<br><br>(4) Promises and plans annonced were not implemented as posted in the 20 problems with autocracy". There is something wrong with implementational efficiency in the whole government. Lack of accountable and transparent work processes supported by coordination and practical knowledge application is the root cause.<br><br>(5) All elites must work together as a team to solve the urgent high cost problem. The high cost is mainly attributable to NKF-style of pushing up costs wrongly misled by assumption that monies will solve all problems. EQ, work processes were not seen to be produced to make all ministers more effective and transparent. It is clearly seen by hollow moralizing by ministers asking people to support certain policies without they themselves walking the talk.<br><br>(6) Empower everyone in work places to apply existing knowledge with innovations and creativity instead of emphasising on paper chase to no end. Knowledge per se will not solve all our problems. It is the way we encourage all to apply kaowledge as they learn and work that will fire the innovations. Our current education system emphasiing on getting more scholars is too narrow. It is basic and fundamental that we need education and training. It is the way we go about applying those knowledge and technological excellence that count not getting more people to chase for more paper qualification. That is why people continue to tell the government - do not over-depend on scholars but get everyone to apply knowledge at every level of educaion. In fact neglecting existing knowledge application will deprive us of competitiveness as compared with Korea or Finland.<br><br>(7) Empower the masses by opening up to practise an all inclusive society that every citizen can feel belonged and is able to participate in without all the controls and gerrymandeering e.g. GRC, electoral boundary redrawing or the threats of defamation lawsuits as seen in the NKF case. Remember that citizens are outraged not so much with NKF or Durai but the fact the whole governing elites are behaving in the wrong way only looking after themselves and each other and protecting their own narrow interests. There is a lack of accountability and transparency in ministers' replies to problems on fare hikes, work-site accidents or double-charging on HDB land costs.<br><br>All the problems with the education and political system's shortcoming were caused by lack of attention to citizens' expectations and aspirations. There is too much talks about abilities of Elites who have yet taken active steps to solve high costs and other problems.<br><br>PM Lee will be successful and supported only when he can change the present system of government to give eeryone a place so that all will see that he really intends to build an inclusive society. By emphasising that Durai is right and NKF did nothing wrong and the whole system is fine there will be more delays and postponement of solutions. Majority of the citizens are earning third-world low wages but they are made to pay first-world costs. Why are ministers still telling the whole world that Singapore has succeeded in beoming a first-world conntry!!!!!!!!<br><br>Please understand how Finland, Switzerland and Korea open up their political process for participation by all including the active citizens.<br><br></div>

I don't believe Singaporeans are <span style="font-style: italic;">happy</span> to be led by the nose, so they let themselves be led; it is more as in they feel helpless, and feel that they have no other alternative except to follow the leader. That is why there is widepsread political apathy. If people were merely happy, they would care about politics, that is they would want to care about politics, because any political development would be something worth boasting about. it's the same reason why Teens care about stars (i'm nto one of these - teens, i mean, not stars) like Lindsay Lohan or David Beckham.<br><br>But I do agree with your last statement though.<br><br>cheers,<br>the pikamaster</div>
