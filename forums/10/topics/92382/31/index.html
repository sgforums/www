Is this kind of leadership what we need today in nation building?<br><br>How do we get our leaders to translate goals, objectives and all kinds of look-good policies into actions and processes to deliver results with objective performance, reliability, justice, empathy with the poor and needy, the underdogs or socially handicapped or better serve the social and economic wellbeing of all.<br><br>Chances are that leaders today are still mostly rhetorical, and conceptual offering good-looking policies and assumptions rather than the ability to deliver results and economic competitiveness.<br><br>Given the continuously fast-changing technological and knowledge-based environment  of today, it will be foolhardy to rely on concepts about talents or assumptions in governing of a country.<br><br>In the new age, leaders should be people possessing implementation abilities and special knowledge and skills in applying technologies to fuel growth. Practical knowledge applications will thrive and lead the world in the future.<br><br>Hence, they should act as facilitator of follow-through performance, objective and accountable corporate governance, leveling up of populations to gain competitive advantages to seize opportunities at practical applications of knowledge by all in every field.<br><br>They should mobilise people to achieve progress through implementation processes and go beyond revenue collections and enforcements of regulations and controls or provisions of basic services in security, medical or other utility needs of the early ages.<br><br>Effective leadership today should consist of the following criteria:-<br><br>(1) Translate goals and objectives and policies and assumptions into implementation processes to empower all in transforming widest fields of knowledge to create technology start-ups and jobs to bring about value-adding competitiveness.<br><br>(2) Collective leadership or governance to avoid narrow top-down conceptual look-good management by a few erudite elites or individuals.<br><br>Process management will avoid bias, prejudices of individuals, presentations, public relations, rhetorical abilities or emotive personality appeal.<br><br>Collective process management should aim at translating all goals, objectives, ideas or policies into real implementation capabilities from planning to execution, applying knowledge with total coordination to benefit whole society. Implementational efficiency and creativity must be part of the new ability to lead and rule.<br><br>The government must oversee the implementation of all knowledge applications from an holistic economic master plan, to realize technologicial start-ups and value-add all economic activities to stay competitive.<br><br>The modern governments should nurture an environment to grow more entrepreneurs and technological start-ups and create jobs. Government should be about creating higher paying jobs to sustain people's expected standards of living.<br><br>Very often, sad to say, many governments are only overly concerned with their own equations of success and protecting their own interests which are not consonent with the majoirity's interests or wellbeings.<br><br>It will not be enough to govern a country based on collecting maximum taxes, saving or privatising government expenses and creating government surpluses. Without empowering the workers and employees to participate in practical knowledge application, the economic pie is unlikely to grow.<br><br>Modern governments should practise holistic good corporate governance and dispense with self-centred policies of the past and should open up to facilitate building up of capabilities and competitiveness through practical knowledge application.<br><br>Only by practising collective good corporate governance as described will governments solve problems diverse problems in a more holistic manner.<br><br>All decisions will then carried out by means of committed people-centred implementation processes without hindrances from all the media hype, justfications and look-good presentations and defensiveness.<br><br>(Read more: <a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com</a><br><a href="http://www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com</a><br><a href="http://www.easymanager.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.easymanager.blogspot.com</a>[/b]</blockquote>If I were to have both that skills and techno know-how, why in the hack would I stop the police to investigate the White Elephants?<br><br>All of you should wonder whether it's the persons deciding on how the skills to be utilised or the persons with alot of skills more important.<br><br>We can have a very fanciful tool, but it'd gather dust and dirt over time doing totally nothing to but maintain its existence. What is the f^^^ use of this?<br><br>Or one can vote in a Satan and the tools into the parliament.

After all, as long as the incumbent party has dominated the election processes and assured itself of return to power why not allow some alternatives or new blood who definitely can contribute to robust debates and good accountable corporate governance.<br><br>The "assassins" to provide voters with a choice - one an incumbent while another "alternative" unobjectionable voice of people - might be a wrong name but definitely it will offer a very good and creative electoral strategy for a party which has been dominating the politics without reliefs to suffering masses and suppressed views. PAP should look at such an alternative of supporting objective and unobjectionable people in standing in coming election.</div>

I think Singapore today is quite different from what it was at the last election. Structural unemployment is a bigger problem than before, costs have gone up despite a diminishing pay packet and despite all the promises of higher property value following upgrading, not many wealthy people have resulted from this anyway. Add to these the NKF saga, the Nicoll Highway collapse and talk about elitisim.....this government has alienated alot of people, including those who support most of their policies.<br><br>The opposition parties will gain seats if they can be united for once and plan their election strategy so that the most promising candidate is offered at each constituency instead of diluting votes for the opposition. But they have to be credible...we cannot have opposition party candidates turning up in slippers and who cannot give a rational argument about policies.</div></blockquote>oxford mushroom,<br><br>the problem with the opposition is tt it is consistently barking up the wrong tree. the SDA especially makes itself a laughing stock when it keeps calling for more democracy; practically, I think, pple have decided tt the SDA are nothing more than a bunch of ineffective clowns. the WP is still bz nursing its dream of a welfare state with minimum wages, free confrontational trade unions etc., unaware that 19th century mechanisms will not work in a 21st-century knowledge-based economy, and tt especially in Singapore, confrontational tactics will doom us because we have sold our soul to the MNCs, as famous UK economist Galbraith put it. (btw. Galbraith actually made DIRECT reference to Singapore; I'm not just using a generic expression here...)<br><br>the platform the oppo should have should be based on 2 key  issues: the structural employment problem u mentioned and education.<br><br>The structural employment issue is good 'cos it hits out at the economic prowess of the govt. Using this issue would probably be more effective after LKY leaves the scene for good, though.<br><br>Education is a much older issue, but yet it ties up to modernity well. for eg, in the NKF saga, you can point to the failure of CME that produces such men like Durai. For Nicoll Highway, blame tt the education system doesn't teach skills adequately. Elitism is the best candidate to use when attacking education, since you can directly link the streaming system to the production of social elitism...<br><br>(if one wishes to argue the insignificance of education as a issue for an electoral platform, one should look at Norway: their key election issue is the state of national kindergartens.:mrgreen<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But sadly, the oppo are not changing their tone much...

And plus, the social conditions of the Time of the Warring States are totally different from the conditions no: In the past, Monarchs had either the Divine Right or the Mandate of Heaven, which are non-existent in politcs today. So you can't compare Liu with the modern politician anyway; the former had the existent support because of his Mandate to rule; the latter needs to cultivate support in order to legitimise his rule.

No matter how difficult were the circumstances and the odds, he sought to win over the support of his people based on good rationale and strategies, planning and logics and won the respect and admiration of his subordinates with great success.<br><br>In our case, all leaders sought to use their legalistic power to the fullest to tax and raise fees to create surpluses claiming success for such surpluses and voting their own handsome rewards and highest bonuses as typified by the NKF way of governance although majority of ordinary people are experiencing much hardship.<br><br>Anti-welare and meritocracy policies were auto-piloted to excess resulting in loss of practical entrepreneurship and economic competitiveness. Many unpopular education and language policies were rammed down on the people despite hurting the people wellbeing, unpopularity and hardships.<br><br>Our leaders did not exercise rationale judgment but only use their legalistic controls and regulations. This form of harsh autocratic governance has stifled entrepreneurship and creativity not only in education, but job creations and economic development.<br><br>The result is: today Singapore is losing its past economic competitiveness in term of per capita earning from 8th to 22nd. Yet despite all these problems, there is hardly any improvements until NKF raised the genuine issues.<br><br>Do you call this kind of legalistic controls and regulations or taxing and recovering costs successful government? You can choose to worship such autocratic leadership irrespective of feedbacks on people's struggles and problems. But the fact remains that such autocratic top-down management is now unsuitable for running a knowledge-based society and it is old-fashion and unimaginative management.<br><br>Please refer to the past postings to read the 20 major policy errors and problems with such top-down autocracy.<br><br>If only MM Lee was less conceptual and more down to earth to understand what is good and people-centred management, or was willing to learn from Zhuge he could have saved the economy and avoided so many problems with his oppositions. He needs not have created so many problems by being more proactive and taking timely actions before economy drifted and entrepreneurs migrated in large numbers.<br><br>He could have achieved real success by employing Zhuge great rationality, objectivity and good corporate governance.<br><br>Singapore despite all the claims made by our leaders through clever creative accounting and statistics is badly short of strategies and the economy is entirely at the mercy of external cirucmstance without any true strategies at work since the 1970s.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Modern examples or historical exampls, Robert and Pikamaster, is that in politics and governance, if you are good in governance you'd probably steady yourself in politics.<br><br>If one wonders if those arrogant ever got started when such (mostly blind or layman) people perceive them so, that's over-worrying.

            <div class='col-md body'>From the recent devleopment at Sg, we can see that there are several "incidents" that pointed out our hidden weaknesses:<br><br>1) Citiraya scandals that involved many high position Sg executives in many MNCs. This also exposed the weakness of our banking sector control mechanisms. The CAO incident further proven the point. All our honesty image had gone down the drain after so many years of effort. There is simply too little transparency in our system.<br><br>2) Poor education system. Now Sg media finally bring the spot light to the young singaporean. The new generation singaporean are really too open in sex but too poorly educated in protecting themselves.

And plus, the social conditions of the Time of the Warring States are totally different from the conditions no: In the past, Monarchs had either the Divine Right or the Mandate of Heaven, which are non-existent in politcs today. So you can't compare Liu with the modern politician anyway; the former had the existent support because of his Mandate to rule; the latter needs to cultivate support in order to legitimise his rule. Why do you think the MIW get so jittery whenever they lose seats in GE or by-elections?<br><br>2) ok ... and so???

Please don't include this point. Btw, did you consider that people cannot judge themselves well either under normal circumstances i.e. if they are not forced to do honest self-reflections?

[/quote]<br><br>A system that tries to promote elites has got all the elites getting themselves into troubles from insider trading to CBT in one instance after another. Obviously in promoting elitism or meritocracy the leaders have forgotten something very important than elites and intellect - morality and EQ, the primary factor of success among top Fortune 500 companies.<br><br>The most important criterion for Singapore is therefore not elites, scholars or meritocracy. It is corporate accountability, level-playing field, equal opportunities, broad-based education, practical knowledge applications by all and setting of personal example among the leaders so that everyone in society will contribute in a more acceptable manner and not to gain benefits and private enrichments.<br><br>NKF is just the tip of the iceberg. If all care to look there will be more abuses and malpractices than just Citiraya and CAO you mentioned.<br><br>Has many years of meritocracy or leadership imparted the right value despite all the hype about leadership and talents of our elites and those in charge ? It will be noticed that once the ministers and elites are out of office, and not given the networking opportunities, not many of them have become successful in creating jobs or business ventures to prove their abilities. It is usually the lesser mortals and ordinary people with passions that help the economy and not the elites.<br><br><blockquote>[b]Just look at the young kids around your neighbourhood, how many of your young neighbours bother to say "hello" to u.

Will they learn to say hello and be humble to serve the people. Will they care for humility and service to the nation or care for the poor and needy?<br><br>[quote]<strong>3) NKF case.
