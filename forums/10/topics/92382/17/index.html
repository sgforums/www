            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Elfred,<br><br>pre) I'm wondering how come u ahven't replied to my post yet, either in email, pm (YP or SGForums) or in this forum thread itself. I know your last post was lost, but surely you would retype it. </blockquote>My apology. I the type who'd lose interest in repetitive things... meaning having to type the same thing all over frustrate me. When younger, reading textbooks twice is very torturing. Hence my hatred for textbooks in schools...<br><br>So naggings are also rather torturing to me too. Hence I rather talk to people who'd yield meaningful exchanges or be left alone. Not that I don't try to socialise. But when it comes to meaningful talking, it definitely needs the kinda partner.<br><br><blockquote>ANyway, I was looking through your reply to Robert's post, and here are my observations:<br><br>1) the burden on you is to *prove* that democracy indeed will increase these problems, instead of solving them. Inf act, from a cursory glance at teh list, I can already pick out which problems could be solved or prevented should democracy be implemented: (1) (12) (13) (14) (16) (20). And ther eason why these problems would be solved is because of Adam Smith's Selfishness Principle. I'll leave you to figure out the details.</blockquote>I don't wanna to forget telling you this, that Adam Smith ruined an entire nation with his wishful thinking... If it's the same Adam we're talking here.<br><br>Don't mind explain your ideas. I'd be interested. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>2) no comment.<br><br>3) I agree.<br><br>4) Due to the excesses of Emperor miccheng, YP is no longer a proper avenue for feedback in policy-making. Robert should try the FBU, but of coruse they gove cryptic repllies too...</blockquote>Hahaha...<br><br>You aware how many posts have been deleted at FBU in comparison to YPforum nowadays?<br><br>You can't blame FBU. YP is run by sort of volunteer basis. Hence, the stake or the motivation behind is different. The FBU is chaired by a slew of MPs and high class people. FBU's reply is usually, and naturally, more bureacratic or <span style="font-style: italic;">cryptic</span> according to you.<br><br>But of course, you can't expect those forumers who are at YPForum not for proper discussion but simply slug rubbish and hurl personal attempts such as the joker, Kilfred, which (hahahaha...) I can't be bothered with.<br><br><blockquote>5) Hmmm... democracy would provide the different angles from which to study the budget.<br><br>hmmm.... our financial reserves are supposed to be huge, considering our size. And I can think of prudent ways to expend the money, rather than hoarding it in government treasuries. How does keeping large sums of money actually "lower the costs" as you put it? Does it reduce exchange rate, and nayway how does reduction of exchange rate help lower the costs?</blockquote>Huge? There is no such things as huge. It's be best as huge as possible and the key is properly managed, not size.<br><br>I very much doubt the monies are <span style="font-style: italic;">hoarded</span>. It may look like been <span style="font-style: italic;">hoarded</span> on book. But what in actual, whether it's still there or not, or if it's really idling forever, is not our problem. Not at least for now.<br><br>Lower the cost? I was not talking about the reserves.<br><br>The reserves, unlike other nations as China and most European economies, helps to act as buffer. It's as if the army. The army may never have gone to war, but it acts as a buffer to thoughts of aggression. Something as such.<br><br>So in the simplest term, the reserves ensures (by right) that Singapore (which do not have significant resources to, Eg, sell or mortgage to IMF) would be able to absorb economic shocks such as those from currency speculations and super-last resorts to draw a budget deficit from.<br><br>And as long as the book says it's there, it's just as if a scare-crow in the paddy field, for the least.<br><br><blockquote>But of course the issue here is the social benefits vs. the social costs. Do these companies truely care for the public in the way that the provision of "public utilities" is supposed to imply? Or are they mroe concerned about maintaining supernormal profits? At the other side, is there truely anything that can be used in defense of maintaining the profits? For example, are they being used to benefit the staff of these companies? Your assertions only hold true if the complete affirmative can be given to all these questions.</blockquote>I can only tell you, when you privatised, when you have shareholders, when you have bottomlines, and managers to feed, you'd know what is the answer to your question. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Which CEO would bother what happen tomorrow if today the bottomlines look marvelous and numbers are flashy enough for display? As one leader ever commented '...commerical entities ain't charities...'. And as another '...there is no free meal in this world...'.<br><br>Other than that, you'd have to do your on thinking and get quotes to yield some lights for yourself.<br><br><blockquote>6) Hmmm, I do not believe in experts either, but I beleive that a proper fiscal management structure will ensure adequate utilisation of public funds.</blockquote>Who doesn't know that? I also know a proper government with high level of governance will natually not be worried of elections.<br><br>Now the problem is, you are not breaking out of the social norms. You see if you wanna make that sort of statements, you'd have to pinpoint the system behind it. There's no such thing as in belief in proper. Only when you go to the root, improve it, then whatever <span style="font-style: italic;">propers</span> you want will come.<br><br>And the roots will still be the people. People's decisions bring us here, people's decision to bring us somewhere. Not democracy.<br><br><blockquote>7) I concur with this point.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> hmmm... guess who are the richest? the government officials!  You are right in saying no true unrests eg. strikes, demonstrations have been brought about by the increasing rich-poor divide, but nonetheless there is still a high level of resentment, despite whatever Straits Times might claim through its biased reporting. And anyway, you are forgetting that the only reason for no unrests is that all these forms of actions are banned, through extremely autocratic laws! Perhaps Democracy cannot solve the problem, but neither can autocracy. And once again, you have not defined "wise".</blockquote>Nay.<br><br>During Suhartoe's time, very few people ever believe unrest will come in Indonesia the way we seen during the crisis. You don't see Acheh in such huge unrest.<br><br>You cannot ban unrest, as those in Malaysia during Anwar's sodomy issues.<br><br>The only effective ban is good governance with good people.<br><br>MM's time can effectively do so because Singapore is to liberate itself and go for an economic boom times. When people are full, the hearts and morale are high, banning results in only some minor lonely noises by political activists.<br><br>But when the government is established, and the hearts changed, plus an army of empty stomachs (the have-nots), the slightest overlook in governance will spark unforeseenable fire.<br><br>Unrest is by right undesireable, and illegal to government, in nature. A Ban is legal constraint. If you put them both together, you'd discover that a real Unrest is illegal in nature cannot be contained by legal means. It is as if saying if you are very angry with the government and you guys are going to rebel, you're not going to bother about what's legal and what's not. Rebel itself is never legal. (which government promotes rebellions against itself? Hahahaha...)<br><br>Suhartoe forgotten or was not aware of one thingy, the tighter he crutched Indonesia, the more forelorn it is for his party to return to power once things happen. Iron hands with too much unhappiness only make a party the public enemy and whomever associated with it doom itself, just as Megawati did the last election. I guess that shows she did not really understand the people more than her attention on politics and power.<br><br>But people is the sourceof power. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>9) Averages? Now that's an interesting concept. Well, I find averages weak too; i find medians better, perhaps that's why the new Constitution I am designing (as an intellectual exercise)  is going to use medians as the new counting measure, even for voting.... But anyway, your final statement in this para is a Fallacy of Association- Democracy providing good people is no way related to a person being unhappy with autocracy. And anyway, that's Begging the Question too: Does autocracy always guarantee good people, and if so, how?</blockquote>My view is pretty simple. Good people and not forms of governments bring good governance or solve what problem Robert mentioned.<br><br>We can't have Medians, cos if possible, we must have the best people for the leadership positions, and these positions need leaders, not butchers, not<br>by what trade or social norms.<br><br><blockquote>10) In the end, this whole discussion boils down to one key question, which regretfully you have still not answered: Why is autocracy more likely to cause the selection into power of wise leaders than democracy? I fyou think you have answered this question already, then please direct me to the relevant phrases in your previous posts.</blockquote>In addition to what I have commented, that no matter what government doesn't matter, I'd explain your question here of such comparison.<br><br>Suppose Democracy have 7 Roberts in a row to govern the nation. And 1 of the Roberts miraculously is much better leader. But he may or may not last till his term before being ousted or, by rules, must be replaced by the next Robert.<br><br>Considering there are 1 Pikamaster who, assuming here, is worse in quality than all the Roberts produced by democracy. But Pikamaster govern till the 7th Robert expire himself.<br><br>Assuming Pikamaster in this case is one bombastic and pompous fellow who needs no help from good people. But his policy will last. He got his time to fail and improve, and unlike every Robert, his improvement in governance canbe applied in the next time, but every Robert who barely get the balls got to be replaced. See?<br><br>So even if one Robert manages to recognise the damage he'd face with only one choice: to do nothing. Whereas in autocracy, assuming Pikamaster would improve, the nation still have hope.<br><br><blockquote>Cheers,<br>the pikamaster (who only got 8 pts for olvls)</blockquote>I got 80pts for O'levels. No lah. My results not as good cos by that stage, I was already sick of the education systems, and the happenings around. Guess too much thinking too young won't help you enjoy the system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If you wanna be a great leader of your time, you must become a thinker yourself, Pikamaster. Then you'd surround yourself with great political minds of your time, then that'd be a force to reckon with. Surround yourself with Yes-men and drum-masters, my deepest regrets to your aspiration, cos talents will malfunction.<br><br>You take care.</div>

( I've just been studying economics. ) And anyway, if you do not need to ensure that teh reserves do not go above a maximum, i do not see why you need "prudent management" of the reserves. After all, you don't need to manage something if you can allow it to grow any size it wants to. (pardon my English, if it seems inaccurate.)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  and anyway, you are still begging my main quesiton in this para: how do the large financial reserves help lower the cost of running the country day-to-day or lower the cost of living? After getting carried away by your talk on the size of reserves, you have still failed to give a concise answer to this question.<br><br>5) rhetoric, thetoric everywhere, but no concrete evidence in sight. *sigh*  but from what I have... the word "shareholders" is very interesting. Supposedly that's supposed to mean that the firm is to be held accountable for its action. Sadly, these shareholders are never usually members of the public - instead they are other corporations or government boards, and of course the govt treats everything as an economic imperative - yes, the Curse of Adam Smith. In short, profit maximisation becomes the main idea driving the firm, and that is not always beneficial to teh public consumer, especially when it involves rise in energy fees, MRT fares, bus fares etc.  Managers to feed? Friend, the company does not consist of just the managers, lest you forget.<br><br>Anyway, the rest of your paragraph seems to be a perfect affirmation of my viewpoint, except perhaps for the phrase "there is no free lunch", which is dubious in meaning and requires clarification. So could you please clarify it?<br><br>6) societal norms? when did that ever come into the picture? You need to clarify, or else this is merely a Fallacy of Association.. But anyway, teh role of democracy, the "rule of the people"  is precisely to provide a good medium for decision-making to take place, and thus toe nsure that the best decisions will be made.  But look at the next paragraph...<br><br>7) hmm... Have you heard of something called the Rule of Fear? According the a well-known historian, unrest arises out of two things: popular disatisfaction and courage that whatever unrest occurs can foster change. Why there is no unrest in SIngapore is simple: nobody believes that anything can change around here through their actions, save a few extremists like CSJ.  THat is what creates political apathy too. That is plain from every post in every local internet forum, be it YP, Sintercom, Sammyboy, or even thsi forum, SGForums. As you would realize, there is still considerable fear of the ISD, whether implicit or explicit. Around these forums eg. in YP, you'll see pple trying to act macho and bravado, asking pple why ISD haven't come for them yet? But in reality, if one can detect the undertones, these people (no mentioning of names required except Moshedyan... oops...) are equally as fearful even though they put up a face. Even one can see Jamie Han's hesitance when he asked MM his question. So it is Fear, and hopelessness for change that percolates through our society, which prevents the outbreak of unrest, not any trash about good governance, that the authorities would have you believe.<br><br>What is ilegal to government isn't always illegal by common sense or moral principle. Yes, and that applies even to rebellion. In fact, Confucianism, the philosophy we are supposed to be following here in Singapore, actually legalizes rebellion in certain circumstances. Go read the Analects or search the web for analyses of Confucian thought, if you don't believe me. And the other side applies equally.<br><br>Hmmm... "people are the source of power!" how interesting, now waht do you mean by "people" here? The particular meaning you're using here is dubious.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Hmmm.... democracy and autocracy are not forms of government in the same way noveau is a form of architecture.  Democracy and Autocracy are both political systems. What is the definition of systems? Systems are entities consisting of inputs, processes and outputs.  in this case, we must talk about the processes before we talk about the outputs. Down here, you have successfully used a Biased Sample argument. You assume Pikamaster (no relation to me, I hope, 'cos if so, that would constitute a Poisoning the Well action)  would improve, but that is precisely the problem. Will s/he definitely improve? And in the case that s/he does not improve, can we ensure that better leaders come to power? the principle here is the process of leadership selection.  Despite your Appeal to Spite ("barely got the balls"), the case is that, unlike waht you said, the 1st Robert can still attempt to run for power again, and get elected, unlike in the other case where nobody can run against Pikamaster, even if s/he is proved to be increasingly decadent.  But all this is missing one point: All the Roberts can be elected into power at once; Democracy involves the selection of a GROUP of pple into the government, not just one, by vote. Whereas autocracy involves the selection of ONE person i  government, with his attendant yes-men. And the exact  implication of yes-men means that  Pikamaster will never change because obviously yes-men will not point out his/her mistakes and incompetencies if s/he does not recognize it him/herself.<br><br>9) it is impossible to get 80 pts... the lowest anybody can go is 54 pts.... sinc e the lowest grade is F9.<br><br>haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> who are the great political minds of the century, in your opinion? yes, I read alot, and so far the most I can think about are Ghandi and Churchil and LKY, not much pple else.

Have you heard of something called the Rule of Fear? According the a well-known historian, unrest arises out of two things: popular disatisfaction and courage that whatever unrest occurs can foster change. Why there is no unrest in SIngapore is simple: nobody believes that anything can change around here through their actions, save a few extremists like CSJ.  THat is what creates political apathy too. That is plain from every post in every local internet forum, be it YP, Sintercom, Sammyboy, or even thsi forum, SGForums. As you would realize, there is still considerable fear of the ISD, whether implicit or explicit. Around these forums eg. in YP, you'll see pple trying to act macho and bravado, asking pple why ISD haven't come for them yet? But in reality, if one can detect the undertones, these people (no mentioning of names required except Moshedyan... oops...) are equally as fearful even though they put up a face. Even one can see Jamie Han's hesitance when he asked MM his question. So it is Fear, and hopelessness for change that percolates through our society, which prevents the outbreak of unrest, not any trash about good governance, that the authorities would have you believe.</blockquote>There's unrest. Just because there is no reports doesn't mean there hadn't be boycotts and such during the past decades. Capt Ryan was merely one small evidence of, no matter how small, unrest.<br><br>Well... Fear is one of the European inclined manner of rule. Have you not heard of the Iron-Lady of Britain? Where there is an empire, the Tsars before the last were rather iron-handed and fear loomed in China during the political storms in China. Suhartor also resort to this. But that's probably because they ain't aware of other methods of governance.<br><br>Well... fear never stop Acheh going into trouble, forcing Suhartoe into taking MC. Fear never stopped rebellions in Russian empire. Fear never protected the Malaysians from rallying around a disposed Anwar.<br><br>The opposite of fear is courage. And courage sees no barriers. Jamie is not hesitant. I suppose he regreted later. If he ever was hesitant, such comment would have been sent not in such posture. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>You see, Pikamaster, Singapore is a very small place. If you just go down the grounds and interact, you'd probably realise more things than you spent time in thinking of draft the acts. If X happens in Singapore, stories fly in city. There were many rumors spreading like wild fires precisely because Singapore's small. If something significant happen in Singapore, the main media will have their say, the grounds will be burning on their own fire. You don't have to worry so much. But in either case, you must think about the info and not trust entirely.<br><br>When their guts and stomachs hurt enough, no need belief, people will stir. Which is also why most such people are laymen.<br><br><blockquote>What is ilegal to government isn't always illegal by common sense or moral principle. Yes, and that applies even to rebellion. In fact, Confucianism, the philosophy we are supposed to be following here in Singapore, actually legalizes rebellion in certain circumstances. Go read the Analects or search the web for analyses of Confucian thought, if you don't believe me. And the other side applies equally.</blockquote>Aiyah... ... Confucius thinking is not appropriate for politics. If you want to be gentleman in stuckar contrains without thinking, you can just read confucius. If you want to talk about politics, you should read selectively.<br><br><blockquote>Hmmm... "people are the source of power!" how interesting, now waht do you mean by "people" here? The particular meaning you're using here is dubious.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </blockquote>Hahahaha... Quite so. Just take the general term.<br><br><blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Hmmm.... democracy and autocracy are not forms of government in the same way noveau is a form of architecture.  Democracy and Autocracy are both political systems. What is the definition of systems? Systems are entities consisting of inputs, processes and outputs.  in this case, we must talk about the processes before we talk about the outputs. Down here, you have successfully used a Biased Sample argument. You assume Pikamaster (no relation to me, I hope, 'cos if so, that would constitute a Poisoning the Well action)  would improve, but that is precisely the problem. Will s/he definitely improve? And in the case that s/he does not improve, can we ensure that better leaders come to power? the principle here is the process of leadership selection.  Despite your Appeal to Spite ("barely got the balls"), the case is that, unlike waht you said, the 1st Robert can still attempt to run for power again, and get elected, unlike in the other case where nobody can run against Pikamaster, even if s/he is proved to be increasingly decadent.  But all this is missing one point: All the Roberts can be elected into power at once; Democracy involves the selection of a GROUP of pple into the government, not just one, by vote. Whereas autocracy involves the selection of ONE person i  government, with his attendant yes-men. And the exact  implication of yes-men means that  Pikamaster will never change because obviously yes-men will not point out his/her mistakes and incompetencies if s/he does not recognize it him/herself.</blockquote>I think you miss the point. The 1 Robert whom you like may not be whom others like. If he gains in election again, those who like him will claim democracy, those who don't will claim autocracy... (when PAP got elected, those happy call it democracy, those unhappy said autocracy... same lah.)<br><br>This is merely assumption over a period of time. If you want the 7 Roberts to be in powers all the time, if the 1st Robert is 18yo, then by the 7th Roberts would be around 55 yo. If the 1st Robert is 45yo, by the 7th Roberts would be around 70yo!?<br><br>How can they be all in powers?<br><br>Well, as I said,if that Pikamaster is already stuck without wise help but yes-men, the situation will allow democracy too attempt an replacement and end the autocracy you mentioned. I have said before, before such day'd come, the government of whatever-cy would still have chance to avoid such day.<br><br>He won't definitely improve, but he won't definitely not improve.<br><br><blockquote> 9) it is impossible to get 80 pts... the lowest anybody can go is 54 pts.... sinc e the lowest grade is F9.</blockquote>Correct. Cos I expecting you claim All Roberts can be elected at once. In every moment in Singapore, as I mentioned, it'd be very lucky if we produce one Robert whom you want.<br><br><blockquote>haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> who are the great political minds of the century, in your opinion? yes, I read alot, and so far the most I can think about are Ghandi and Churchil and LKY, not much pple else. Two are dead, and the third lives in a road accessible to nobody except himself and his family.<br><br>Well, it's been nice talking to you. And I will be willing to talk to you, as long as you don't send personal attacks at me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Cheers,<br>the pikamaster  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </blockquote>Why would I send personal attacks on you?

I remember reading an article somewhere which were comparing the different states of Eastern Europe before the fall of Communism. It noted that there were some states on the same parity with certain Western countries. Unlike their neighbours, these states were having economic growth. Mind you, thsi is economic growth.

Give your point, then your examples, otherwise i admit, I really can't understand what you are saying here.<br><br>12) no comment<br><br>13) PAP's autocratic controls on electoral processes through the laws, as stated in section 9 of this post, will ensure otherwise, unless of course you are thinking about change as in through revolution or verthrowing of the government like in ukraine or the Eastern European countries?<br><br>FYI, go read this thread; it's titled "political participation in  Singapore" :-<br><a href="http://forums.tjc.edu.sg/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=1126" rel="nofollow">http://forums.tjc.edu.sg/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=1126</a><br><br>What went wrong with PAP?<br>hmmm...<br>Well, looking at their constitution and comparing it to the policies of latter-years, you realize that many of the most recent policies violate the principles of the Party's own Constitution and Manifesto. Which ones should be pretty obvious. The Manifesto and Constitution are available at their website.<br><br>14) Hmmm.... read the above.<br><br>15) Whatever help it is, an autocrat will most likely select one who is a close friend and hence, will give advice biased in favour of him/her. Yeah, even professional ones, 'cos rmb, in an autocratic state, if whatever you say is unfavourable to the autocrat, you would get punnished severely, through legal means or other stuff.<br><br>16) try to anyway.... i'm listening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>17) I like Winston Churchill, I marvel him for his courage in leading Britain through the war and the way he handled his own personal life.

The way this forum operates is not suitable for very long replies. How? I don't think there should be any problem.<br><br><blockquote>5) Do these companies truely care for the public in the way that the provision of "public utilities" is supposed to imply??</blockquote>What do you think? I suppose this is common sense upfront. Do shareholders receive <span style="font-style: italic;">cares and love</span> for dividends?<br><br><blockquote>6)  Hmmm... actually, I'm trying hard to keep focused, but you seem to be the one going off in tangents. If you are simple and direct in what you say, I wouldn't need to ask for clarification. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And if you can't explain these to me on casual postings, then there is always pm or email correspondence. I have sufficient inbox space, u know... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </blockquote>Very simple, there are certain things I rather not type and type on. I'm not a very patient person on such things. I'd probably try to explain, make typos, and hack care, which'd probably not be suitable for long or deep discussion. In fact, I have tried to maintain the replies cos you sound proper enough.<br><br>Emm... the fact is what you are asking is not possible for a simple and straight forward reply without trying to explain certain things you'd find doubtful or 'going off-tangent'.<br><br><blockquote>7) ...?</blockquote>??????????<br><br><blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> why? the pple come to perceive that the government is utterly increduclous and powerless to help them or change things, adn more importantly, to stamp down on them, partly because the people realize that a rebellion will spark mass support.<br><br>Your're right, it's not so simple, not so simple as merely economic crisis. I remember reading an article somewhere which were comparing the different states of Eastern Europe before the fall of Communism. It noted that there were some states on the same parity with certain Western countries. Unlike their neighbours, these states were having economic growth. Mind you, thsi is economic growth. And yet, these states sparked off revolutionary riots ar the same time as their other neighbours. So, it is not just economic discontent that fuels revolutions.</blockquote>Do you know about the unrest at Argentina a few years back? Economic progress won't necessarily make people happy... But an economic irrationality will probably deride stability. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So there has to be some sort of ability to ensure such economic progress doesn't lag behind governance.<br><br>Economic growth? For the state figures or without huge massive rich-poor gap.<br><br>You'd have to go on more explaining this point.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>9) A knowledge-based economy without Thinking People? Now, how is that suppsoed to function?</blockquote>Hahahaha... That's the big issue. How?<br><br><blockquote>But the issue here is't about MM. Like I said before, I admire MM for standing up to all those influences you mentioned in the PAST. But many of his actions in the past to which he hangs on today are grossly outdated, and are beginning to spark of political paranoia eg. Political Donations Act, GRC, ISA, Defamation Act etcetc and his working to preserve them simply doesn't aid in national progress.</blockquote>Look, in my view, MM is a victim of his own systems. You can't blame MM for that cos if you checked his backgrounds, his time, and so on... The problem is... I really don't know how to put it. It's not just out-dated, it's just religious belief.<br><br>MM consults and reads alot. So let's just say this <span style="font-style: italic;">despot</span> is not so despotic after all. Just know that no one is perfect. He probably didn't realise the impact of certain things. Just as you asked, 'now, how is that supposed to function'? He'd have to figure out on his own, or the PM has to do it.<br><br><blockquote>But anyway, down in this para, you have gone off-tangent again. The main issue is not about Jamie Han and MM Lee; it's about the role of courage in causing unrest to occur. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </blockquote>You'd have to learn how to link meaningful thingys up somehow. You see... in order for unrest to come, we need people as Jamie Hans who see this as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral courage</span> to, say, challenge challenge challenge. But on the other hand, to prevent unrest, we also need the likes of Jamie Hans to bring up bring up bring up. So the issue is, how things are handled.<br><br>Courage is not the first determinant, it's the root that fuel such courage. And Jamie's courage is due to purely being <span style="font-style: italic;">green</span>, in my view. If he's down to his last pence, I don't see why he'd not even rob the bank. Chain reactions, see? An unrest doesn't come from nothing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>10) I can't think of more examples offhand, but I kindly request that you go read some international history, especially on the Great Revolutions, p'raps like the English Civil War or sth. and you'll see my point there.</blockquote>To tell you the truth, I have read them before my O'levels. But I had never memorised them. Can you tell me why are there revolutions, and those English Civil Wars and American Civil wars? In one word, poverty. Oppressions also, but aristocratic abuses of powers causing grave mishaps and difficulties caused such a condition for mega unrest. That's why I said, huge rich poor gap under tight social order is a seed for mega trouble.<br><br><blockquote>11) "Lest" doesn't mean "unless".<br><br>Haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">you can explain the difference to me. Well, I suppose CHinese Politicians are indoctrinated with Communist Philosophy. ANyway, what do you mean by "foundation"?</blockquote>Emm... That's a very narrow side of perception you choose or are only able to see. You see, the Chinese have thousands of years of political culture to handle governance of huge and complicated lands, and to handle various situations. I must admit, even that would only means a minority are blessed with high standard.<br><br>You see, Pikamaster, politics is a very different kinda 'skills', because there is no set things to happen and no set things on manual to react to success. It's a kinda skill of wisdom. So what foundation? Mainland politicians have the blessings of their culture as deeply entrenched foundation.<br><br>Assuming... ...<br><br>The easiest way to understand is, since you claimed you have read so much literature, but other than knowing so much, you seem not really understand as much. If you are now handed with facts and figures, you'd most probably just jump on them and make decisions. <span style="font-style: italic;">But</span> that's the point. Your decision making /thinking is as if there is no need to read all those literatures.<br><br>In Singapore, in westernised thinking, examples are key to proving. Hence facts and figures, in addition to experience perhaps. In oriental thinking, examples and such ain't that important but slave to enlightened level of thinking. Before I even started out in reading western literatures such as histories and those philosophies, I started out elsewhere. Eg. If I have started out as academic effort, I might have just gone along with democracy as what many have been talking about.<br><br>Now it appears very clear-cut that you cannot have two engineers to make one politcian, or take 4 CEOs and equate a great leader. That's meritocracy, but it doesn't make much sense.<br><br>A foundation takes:<br><br>1. Reading the right things to head the right way of thinking.<br>2. Exposure to the right things to head the right way of thinking.<br>3. A correct way of a person to head the right way of thinking.<br><br>(1.) probably requires a formation of cultural build-up, not in learning how to dance or Shakespears. (2.) probably is determined by interests and your encounters. (3.) probably is self-explanatory, in that if you choose to chase after the norms, you'd just be another layman. A layman who read alot can become a skillful scholar/professional, but not a thinker. Try not to take as face-value or something definitive.<br><br>You have indulged in too much theories and after-effect of the education system, I am afraid so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Emm...<br><br><blockquote>       Yep, I know politics is all about interests, and never about friends. Or then... you have Ghandi, Washington and FDR...  </blockquote>The issue is understanding. And you see, all those examples again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Now So said that in politics there is no forever friends but forever interests <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't mean</span> you don't have friends. In fact, interests need not always be the dominant factor.<br><br>Eg. Whom you befriend with will decide what interest to be... vs Whom you befriend with is decided by what interest to be. (Hope this will make you understand).<br><br><blockquote>        I guess now, you mean read selectively <span style="font-style: italic;">based on interests</span>? Ahh, well...</blockquote>Emm... Not really. During Aristotle or Plato's times, do you think they have so much to read? How come they are great thinkers of their time? In fact, I very much doubt most political thinkers need to read that much than a scholar needs be. That's a important difference between a human mind and a computer.<br><br><blockquote>         But again, please clarify in a more direct manner. Give your point, then your examples, otherwise i admit, I really can't understand what you are saying here.</blockquote>Emm... I am the sort who don't like to explain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Alright this is no excuse, but have you ever wondered it's the same copies of MM's memoirs people got, excluding those who bought just for them to accumulate dust (I am sure you have a copy as well), why are the results of reading different? Something, you'd have to answer yourself, while I'd probably try to guide your thinking focus to get the answer.<br><br><blockquote>12) no comment<br><br>13) PAP's autocratic controls on electoral processes through the laws, as stated in section 9 of this post, will ensure otherwise, unless of course you are thinking about change as in through revolution or verthrowing of the government like in ukraine or the Eastern European countries?<br><br>FYI, go read this thread; it's titled "political participation in  Singapore" :-<br><a href="http://forums.tjc.edu.sg/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=1126" rel="nofollow">http://forums.tjc.edu.sg/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=1126</a><br><br>What went wrong with PAP?<br>hmmm...<br>Well, looking at their constitution and comparing it to the policies of latter-years, you realize that many of the most recent policies violate the principles of the Party's own Constitution and Manifesto.

You see, whatever the autocrat'd choose, it's his/her responsibilities if those choices are not up to standard to his/her political regime. In either way, if the autocrat is of a quality as best as the next average layman, such selection defers little from the democracy.<br><br>But here, you incidentally pull in a side, but important point, that democracy allows a wider choices of selection than an autocrat. <strong>But</strong>, it's gonna be pretty useless because no matter how possible is an politically desireable element would enter the selection by democracy (wider selection), the determinant of the outcome is still the laymen perception.<br><br>You see, Pikamaster, we could have a very wise autocrat at any one time, but very hardly a very wise average group of laymen. Assume autocrat is very wise but is just another voter and he spotted a political talent X. Now X, Y, Z are going for election, <strong>but</strong> Y or Z may appeal much more to the laymen than X, and critically speaking, this autocrat's good ability of spotting the talent will be useless cos he consists only of 1 vote. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>16) try to anyway.... i'm listening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>17) I like Winston Churchill, I marvel him for his courage in leading Britain through the war and the way he handled his own personal life.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,  Elfred,<br><br>From your exchanges of opinions with Pikamaster on merits and demerits of autocracy as against democracy, I can see that you have relied on accidents or luck or some inexplicable judgmental abilities of particular autocratic leaders as basis for substantiating continuing autocratic rule.<br><br>Yet, no matter how confident are the autocratic leaders, they have had to give or contrive an impression of democratic rules and principles to get the support of the people.<br><br>This love-hate relationship with democracy on the part of the autocrats goes to show that autocratic rule is not sustainable and finally it has to work towards satisfying the people of accountable and objective rules rendered possible under democracy.<br><br>Pikamaster has explained that there is a greater chance of throwing up good leaders in a democratic process than in autocracy in reply to your point that it is good leaders that count not any democracy. He added that in an autocracy, governance has to depend on self-enlightenment of the autocrats.<br><br>I observe that you have failed to rebut Pikamaster's point about democracy will better assure of election of good people than autocracy. You have also failed to rebut his second point that in an autocracy good governance depends entirely on self-enlightenment of the autocrat.<br><br>On the other hand you even admitted that good rulers ain't always tolerant to those with very high qualities, hence spotting and grooming. You agreed that autocratic rulers might get conceited, and subscribed to irrelevant qualities such as social norms and (of course) bootlicking.<br><br>Pikamaster deliberated that in a democracy, informal organs of govenrment i.e. the free press, the NGOs etc. provide information, serve as pressure groups and offered checks and balances to prevent abuse of power and feedback for what have been done.<br><br>However you went on to contend that such checks and balances could not be entrusted to generalization of people. For one, their interests would totally be different. Not to mention, the views of one topic will not be definitely isolated to that topic, but might have chain effects and considerations. The Casino is one of such topics.<br><br>In addition, as Pikamaster further pointed out that Judiciary maintains the executive's proper behaviour and controls the quality of the laws passed by the legislative provided the judiciary remains independent of course.<br><br>Your only argument in support of autocracy is : "Nobody ever have completed infos, not autocracy that's up to task, not autocracy that's not up to task, not NGOs."<br><br>You conceded that politician who fumble into too much infos, facts and figures easily misses the basis of nature. Man ain't god. You only need to know what you need to know. You only need to know from whom will and can give you what you need to know.<br><br>The last straw of your argument is that : changes can be very fast, that you what you decide you finally know, that what you know could have just become what you don't know. In other words, you claimed that wisdom always weighs heavily over facts and figures in an industry that concerns everyone's fortune: politics.<br><br>To all these points, I will say that you have nothing substantial to offer to justify continuing rule of autocracy. All arguments given thus far are but justifications or appearance of good leaderships or autocracy.<br><br>Your parting shot was: "everyone makes mistakes, there is no complete information, politicians just have to decide on information available and wisdom weighs heavily over facts and figures in politics.<br><br>I would therefore conclude that your arguments in support of autocracy are insufficient to support your case for continuing autocratic rule as follow:-<br><br>(1)    Autocracy is not a political system or a viable system. It does not possess any tangible judgmental superiority in any way but only individualism or judgmental abilities of the leaders who for a fact in our case has been more concerned with keeping the dominant party in perpetual power at whatever costs.<br><br>The so-called distrusts of generalities or collective wisdom of people is just a smokescreen to exclude people from criticising its actions or failures in policies.<br><br>(2)    There is no truth in your assertion that people lack judgmental abilties or the ultimate institutions of democracy are not capable of good deliberations of policies and decisions. Autocracy relies on painting a disparaging picture of democracy to justify its closed-door decisions and actions. There is no tangible proof to show that democracy and its accountable and objective processes will not work or are biased towards sectional interests.<br><br>On the other hand, it is the responsibility of elected leaders to understand people's feedbacks or wisdoms and finally hold themselves answerable to criticism or checks and balances. This can happen only if the leaders are not autocratic and practising accountable corporate governance. Why should there be sectionalism or chaos if leaders are capable and talented to work accountably and objectively to safeguard their interests and aspirations.<br><br>I would say that all the problems or presumed problems with democracy will not arise in the first place if leaders are willing to discharge their primary duties and responsibilities as mentioned.<br><br>You cited casino issue as an instance where exercise of some inexplicable extraordinary insights of certain concommittant factors other than economic or moral reasons as being within their judgmental abilities. It is to be noted that apart from claims of some magical extraordinary judgmental flairs on the part of the autocrats, there is a lack of overall economic integration strategy to justify the case for a casino.<br><br>The fact is very clear that judgmental abilities or decision making process is not good corporate governance. Good corporate governance is: (1) Good judgmental abilities plus (2) Good implementations.<br><br>The latter is full of problems as the whole civil service is still far from capable of solving many repeated problems year after year and ministers were seen to be espousing the same sets of desired good governance - coordination, management excellence and knowledge application.<br><br>Good leadership decisions are not supported by good implementations so autocracy cannot really claim to have succeeded to this extent that it is capable of solving problems.<br><br>It is well and good to put up a good decision like "building a just and equitable society". However it is to be noted that many of the policies of the past like this one were not effectively carried out.<br><br>The problems with autocracy are often in the poor executions. For example, the often-repeated meritocratic policy was in itself not in doubt. The problem was: its overzealous pursuit has divided the populations into scholars and quitters and neglected of pursuing a even handed broad-based education to support entrepreneurship and competitive society.<br><br>Practical applications of existing and down-to-earth knowledge is critical to entrepreneurship but this aspect of governance and education was neglected. Since the 1970s there is hardly any consistent and focused adoption or implementation of a new economic strategy to push Singapore beyond the basic industrialization phase. That is why there has to be a heavy and constant reliance on foreigners to sustain its economic competitiveness for so many years.<br><br>Without institutionalizing a system of democratic governance framework to work closely with a more educated workforce, there would be constant problems in carrying out good decisions supported by the collective wisdom of the masses. There will be constant repeated failures to understand people's problems, facts and figures of institutions of professionals and active citizenry etc.<br><br>The concentration of policies in promoting academic talents has been at the expense of nurturing the practical talents and entrepreneurs of every citizen. This neglect has resulted in grave loss of economic competitiveness of its own domestic sector of the economy.<br><br>Had there been greater consultations and in-depth corporate governance, the problem of high costs of living affecting majority of the citizens would have been better solved from the 1970s instead of continuously pushing for civil servants' high pay structures causing high costs to whole society. Academic talents have been over-blown beyond the limit needed for success causing considerable problems to the whole population.<br><br>Singapore could have produced more entrepreneurs from broad-based education which would have solved high-cost and other problems. People could have been more gracious and willing to look after one another if autocracy has not caused class divisiveness or disaffective divide.<br><br>(3)    The costs of Medical cares, transportations, educations, housing, utilities and many essential services were entirely the result of making only decisions or presumably good decisions which totally contributed to high costs suffered by majority of the its citizens. One track-minded or auto-piloting of many incorrect past policies had been the single most important mistake of autocracy. Its policies were self-centred not open to wider participation by people. They were not nimble enough to meet challenges in the later years for self-centred reasons or face.<br><br>Even if it is conceded that autocracy in our case has achieved a certain success due to judgmental abilities of particular leaders, the period has long passed and Singapore has been facing many more problems since that period. From 1970s, apart from taxing and recovering costs in every aspect of governance, there is hardly any new visions to take the economy higher. As can be seen in the 20 problems of autocracy, the governance has failed to achieve economic competitiveness or greater entrepreneurship. The many scholars employed to run the system have been found wanting and helpless in the last two recessions to create jobs or stop the outflow of foreign companies. The domestic sector of the economy is suffering from natural death and attritions.<br><br>Rather, you should have realized that it is people who have been coerced into paying S$800,000 per household under a system of double taxes for land and triple taxes for vehicle ownership that created the present surpluses which the autocracy claimed as its success in a one-sided governance.<br><br>Is this kind of autocracy sustainable? Has our autocracy produced a knowledge-based world economic strategy to tap on citizens' abilities to produce competitiveness from greater innovations, creativity and application of knowledge?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>1) in truth, i don't find any difference in mechanism between YPForum and this one, or even with Sintercom for the matter. Besides, like I have indicated a number of times, you can always discuss with me in email.<br><br>2) good. case settled then. So, retiterating my point,  privatized "public utilities" are analogous to sutocratic government control.<br><br>3) Perhaps there has been a  misunderstanding here. Perhaps, like yous ay, there is really a need to go into thsoe other topics. Yes, of course, I know that simple answers are not possible for political discussions. In fact, in political forums, I am beginning to despise short posts, becasue they are usually more inflammatory than informational. So I guess the problem I'm having is that I cannot grasp at all what some of your points are, because you hide them in such a way that I cannot find them. So, I'm requesting you to be more simple and plain in your making of relationships between various pieces of information. In fact, I think it would be good if you formatted your replies in the form of a thesis statement, with elaboration. That way, it would be clearer, and I would be able to reply more constructively.<br><br>4) I didn't understand what you were saying and/or trying to imply.<br><br>5) I'm studying in school about the Terror under the French Revolution. Under the Terror, you had Rule of Fear.  nobody dared to rebel because they were too terrified they might be executed as counter-revolutionaries. And this was even though their lives were extremely hard, economcially, as well as socially. Economically, policies like the MAximum hurt the farming peasant population, making them even poorer than before, since they hadn't the ability to make profits from selling of food. But because of the ongoing Fear, nobody dared to rebel against Paris. SO here is an example of how Rule Of Fear prevents unrest. I grant that Aceh probably wasn't a good example, because my knowledge on that is limited.<br><br>6) that's an example of what doesn't answer the question.<br><br>7) what religious belief?  Anyway, don't put words into my mouth. I didn't (and would avoid in fact) call MM a despot. I merely said that he shouldn't try to protect those outdated regulations anymore, even in the name of national security, because those laws are despotic, and they give the PAP potential for despotism.<br><br>And that last question was kind of rhetorical, although perhaps not. After all, I don't really believe a KBE can be built without thinking citizenry.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> no reply. just see section 5 of this post.<br><br>9) wrong. Go read historians' opinions and you'll see that the causes for revolutions are not that simple. You need to factor in other stiff like belief in possible change as well. For if what you said is true, Myanmar and China should both be in the midst of Revolution now, since there are so many poor people in these two countries!<br><br>10) well, Is aid you can explain to me... the problem with your advice is that it is too general, and hence too brief. How to determine what is "right"? What is "cultural build-up"?  and I do not chase after the norms, as you would soon realize after looking through the "legislation" I am writing right now once I've written them. So I ask you again, concisely, what is "right" ? what criteria do you use to judge that: wealth, historical success, intellect, wisdom, morality, empirical observation, or what?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>11) not necessarily: I have a friend in YP, but I still side the OP.<br><br>12) They did so by observation of what is around them. But at their time, there was not much information to handle, so observation was simply observed. But nowadays, observation is not always feasible, so we read books and other publications to "steal" other's observations. and btw, Aristotle and Plato did read, though only from their respective teachers' works, Plato also had many influences in his early life, and physical experiences, yes, experience. You can't think based on nothing after all.<br><br>You might wish to argue that Thales of Miletus, who was the first greek philosopher in History may have had no books to read. That's possibly because books had not been invented yet. However, there was the precursor of books, the scroll, and there is strong evidence to suggest that the content of these early scrolls, like the Code of Hannurabi, teh Babylonian Creation Myth, and the Vedas, influenced Thales' way of thinking, and obviously then, he must have come into contact with them in some way, which would mean that he had tor ead them, since there was no internet at that time.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> All subsequent philosphers were influenced in some way by his <span style="font-style: italic;">Metaphysics</span>, whether or not they sought to prove it or disprove it. And btw, teh evidence for the influences would be in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Metaphysics</span> itself.<br><br>By the way, did you realize that books are merely an extension of the ancient oral tradition? So, in the past, these great philosophers would have been influenced directly by the people who worte the great philosopic books of that time. In fact, many of them were students of these. Aristotle, for example, was a student of Plato, and Plato a student of Pythagoras, yes the guy who invented the Theorem of the Right-angled Triangle.<br><br>13) The last time you asked me to think for myself, so now I'm asking you to do the same. Besides, some of the reasons are adequately explained in the thread whose link I gave you. And some others have been spelled out by Robert earlier in this thread. so there.<br><br>14) the problem again is that you derogate the layman. nothing else to be said.<br><br>15) I could have written an essay on them, but sadly I lack the time.<br><br>But anyway, I did imply that MM was visionary.<br><br>Your selective reading seems to ahve led to very limited, cliched views of the 3 leaders.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Hello,  Elfred,<br><br>From your exchanges of opinions with Pikamaster on merits and demerits of autocracy as against democracy, I can see that you have relied on accidents or luck or some inexplicable judgmental abilities of particular autocratic leaders as basis for substantiating continuing autocratic rule.</blockquote>Hello, Robert. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hahaha... I don't really see why you should think of it this manner, Robert. I'm not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relying</span> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">luck</span>, I am (in fair-er terms) factoring in luck.<br><br>In autocracy, as I have explained, or in any whatever-cy, I rather trust good people than good system. I am rather amazed you see it this way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Yet, no matter how confident are the autocratic leaders, they have had to give or contrive an impression of democratic rules and principles to get the support of the people.</blockquote>That's precisely a problem. How are you to be more confident that the principles and what democratic rules are more confident than a, say, autocratic leader? A system has not confidence nor has any.<br><br><blockquote>This love-hate relationship with democracy on the part of the autocrats goes to show that autocratic rule is not sustainable and finally it has to work towards satisfying the people of accountable and objective rules rendered possible under democracy.</blockquote>I have a little question here, which nation ever before have you to ever effect such accountability and such with your version of democracy? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Just curious.<br><br>I am not really sure of this 'love-hate' relationship. But are you talking about politics or some ideologies? That we will have to get the parameter set up first lest we go on and on on the wrong frequency.<br><br><blockquote>Pikamaster has explained that there is a greater chance of throwing up good leaders in a democratic process than in autocracy in reply to your point that it is good leaders that count not any democracy. He added that in an autocracy, governance has to depend on self-enlightenment of the autocrats.</blockquote>So I have implied that in autocracy, a leader's enlightenment is much more possible than the average laymen's enlightenment...<br><br><blockquote>I observe that you have failed to rebut Pikamaster's point about democracy will better assure of election of good people than autocracy. You have also failed to rebut his second point that in an autocracy good governance depends entirely on self-enlightenment of the autocrat. </blockquote>I am not really rebutting, I'm trying to guide him.<br><br>In fact, talking for so long, you have not really showed that Democracy is definitely much more superior, or so that we can trust a system much more than good men and women, aka good leader/s. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>On the other hand you even admitted that good rulers ain't always tolerant to those with very high qualities, hence spotting and grooming. You agreed that autocratic rulers might get conceited, and subscribed to irrelevant qualities such as social norms and (of course) bootlicking.</blockquote>Correct.<br><br><blockquote>Pikamaster deliberated that in a democracy, informal organs of govenrment i.e. the free press, the NGOs etc. provide information, serve as pressure groups and offered checks and balances to prevent abuse of power and feedback for what have been done.<br><br>However you went on to contend that such checks and balances could not be entrusted to generalization of people. For one, their interests would totally be different. Not to mention, the views of one topic will not be definitely isolated to that topic, but might have chain effects and considerations. The Casino is one of such topics.</blockquote>Which is also correct, and there's nothing unusual or in conflict here.<br><br><blockquote>In addition, as Pikamaster further pointed out that Judiciary maintains the executive's proper behaviour and controls the quality of the laws passed by the legislative provided the judiciary remains independent of course.<br><br>Your only argument in support of autocracy is : "Nobody ever have completed infos, not autocracy that's up to task, not autocracy that's not up to task, not NGOs."</blockquote>Is that my only <span style="font-style: italic;">argument</span>? Hehehehe... Robert, I think you really need to join YP then maybe if we meet up, we could go through together. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>You conceded that politician who fumble into too much infos, facts and figures easily misses the basis of nature. Man ain't god. You only need to know what you need to know. You only need to know from whom will and can give you what you need to know.<br><br>The last straw of your argument is that : changes can be very fast, that you what you decide you finally know, that what you know could have just become what you don't know. In other words, you claimed that wisdom always weighs heavily over facts and figures in an industry that concerns everyone's fortune: politics.<br><br>To all these points, I will say that you have nothing substantial to offer to justify continuing rule of autocracy. All arguments given thus far are but justifications or appearance of good leaderships or autocracy.</blockquote>Sustantiatl or not, Robert, it's not you who could judge. But when you place yourself in, say, a ministerial position, you might be more able to understand what I was trying to guide Pikamaster.<br><br>You see, trying to think the way of when one's in school is no good for such discussion. Democracy itself is just some ideas that in reality has never been perfectly carried out. Hence, you can assume it is an ideal system that seeks to solve every tom dick and harry problems under some fancination, and in reality (eg) the cost issue exist in nations trying to be more democratic and in those nations trying not to be so democratic over times.<br><br>Still, the only way to solve problems are still the good people, not good system. And I have kinda explained how systems cannot be trusted to definitely solve problems than what autocracy must be trusted to creat more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Your parting shot was: "everyone makes mistakes, there is no complete information, politicians just have to decide on information available and wisdom weighs heavily over facts and figures in politics.</blockquote>Correct.<br><br><blockquote>I would therefore conclude that your arguments in support of autocracy are insufficient to support your case for continuing autocratic rule as follow:-<br><br>(1)    Autocracy is not a political system or a viable system. It does not possess any tangible judgmental superiority in any way but only individualism or judgmental abilities of the leaders who for a fact in our case has been more concerned with keeping the dominant party in perpetual power at whatever costs.<br><br>The so-called distrusts of generalities or collective wisdom of people is just a smokescreen to exclude people from criticising its actions or failures in policies.<br><br>(2)    There is no truth in your assertion that people lack judgmental abilties or the ultimate institutions of democracy are not capable of good deliberations of policies and decisions. Autocracy relies on painting a disparaging picture of democracy to justify its closed-door decisions and actions. There is no tangible proof to show that democracy and its accountable and objective processes will not work or are biased towards sectional interests.<br><br>On the other hand, it is the responsibility of elected leaders to understand people's feedbacks or wisdoms and finally hold themselves answerable to criticism or checks and balances. This can happen only if the leaders are not autocratic and practising accountable corporate governance. Why should there be sectionalism or chaos if leaders are capable and talented to work accountably and objectively to safeguard their interests and aspirations. </blockquote>You are on the wrong grounds, Robert. I am not supporting autocracy. In fact, I was just using this autocracy and democracy as comparison to illustrate certain craps in general political thoughts among laymen on systems.<br><br><blockquote>I would say that all the problems or presumed problems with democracy will not arise in the first place if leaders are willing to discharge their primary duties and responsibilities as mentioned.<br><br>You cited casino issue as an instance where exercise of some inexplicable extraordinary insights of certain concommittant factors other than economic or moral reasons as being within their judgmental abilities. It is to be noted that apart from claims of some magical extraordinary judgmental flairs on the part of the autocrats, there is a lack of overall economic integration strategy to justify the case for a casino. </blockquote>(No offence... starting to yawn...)<br><br><blockquote>The fact is very clear that judgmental abilities or decision making process is not good corporate governance. Good corporate governance is: (1) Good judgmental abilities plus (2) Good implementations.</blockquote>I am very sorry to point out again and again... Singapore is not an INC. In Singapore Inc, your staff listen those CEOs like Gods and give face because of fat salaries and benefits and for power and such...<br><br>In Republic of Singapore, you try having three generations of parliaments with politicians clueless of political leadership, I tell you: Get ready for serious trouble. People will see for themselves.<br><br>Good national governance is: visions, credibility due to your governing style, good governance of directions, and good thinking/wisdom, and of course (resulting in) leadership motivate the entire nation, etc.<br><br>I am afraid to tell you this, what you are claiming against here is just what the people are looking for: Judgmental abilities and decision making process.<br><br>And I kinda judge that you mix two critical errors hoping to get one right, which is quite sorry indeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>The latter is full of problems as the whole civil service is still far from capable of solving many repeated problems year after year and ministers were seen to be espousing the same sets of desired good governance - coordination, management excellence and knowledge application.<br><br>Good leadership decisions are not supported by good implementations so autocracy cannot really claim to have succeeded to this extent that it is capable of solving problems. </blockquote>Nor democracy, Robert. The only way is for good people to get or influence and creat good people in various departments to effect good civil services.<br><br>There was this emperor who could control and contain those fightings and corruptions by his scholars, and it was Kang Xi himself. He obviously understood that in any system, only good people solve problems. He nurtured an entire batch of new people, and attempted to replace those bad bloods with them in one sweep. He also dared to use good people to solve problems.<br><br>Robert, only good people solve problems, not what good systems.<br><br>You emm... sound more and more like a typical textbook politician to me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Come on...<br><br><blockquote>It is well and good to put up a good decision like "building a just and equitable society". However it is to be noted that many of the policies of the past like this one were not effectively carried out.</blockquote>And why? Because of no democracy? Hahahaha... Come on...<br><br><blockquote>The problems with autocracy are often in the poor executions. For example, the often-repeated meritocratic policy was in itself not in doubt. The problem was: its overzealous pursuit has divided the populations into scholars and quitters and neglected of pursuing a even handed broad-based education to support entrepreneurship and competitive society.</blockquote>No really... Join YP, I'd sell you a copy of COE if we meet up, then perhaps that would help you in such understanding.<br><br><blockquote>Practical applications of existing and down-to-earth knowledge is critical to entrepreneurship but this aspect of governance and education was neglected. Since the 1970s there is hardly any consistent and focused adoption or implementation of a new economic strategy to push Singapore beyond the basic industrialization phase. That is why there has to be a heavy and constant reliance on foreigners to sustain its economic competitiveness for so many years.<br><br>Without institutionalizing a system of democratic governance framework to work closely with a more educated workforce, there would be constant problems in carrying out good decisions supported by the collective wisdom of the masses.

You can't institutionise systems when problems themselves can't be institutionised, my dear Robert. That has been the most incredible folly a government can expect.

You have brought up a point but for the wrong line of thought...<br><br>In terms of academic talents and such pursue, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, in fact, in a way, China, are somehow more drastic than us. But how come they have a whole lots more of overseas coys and much more competitive than ours? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Had there been greater consultations and in-depth corporate governance, the problem of high costs of living affecting majority of the citizens would have been better solved from the 1970s instead of continuously pushing for civil servants' high pay structures causing high costs to whole society. Academic talents have been over-blown beyond the limit needed for success causing considerable problems to the whole population.</blockquote>Still, join YP and if got fate, will talk about it in person on this one.<br><br><blockquote>Singapore could have produced more entrepreneurs from broad-based education which would have solved high-cost and other problems. People could have been more gracious and willing to look after one another if autocracy has not caused class divisiveness or disaffective divide.</blockquote>Are you sure it is only happening in Singapore? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>(3)    The costs of Medical cares, transportations, educations, housing, utilities and many essential services were entirely the result of making only decisions or presumably good decisions which totally contributed to high costs suffered by majority of the its citizens.

They were not nimble enough to meet challenges in the later years for self-centred reasons or face.<br><br>Even if it is conceded that autocracy in our case has achieved a certain success due to judgmental abilities of particular leaders, the period has long passed and Singapore has been facing many more problems since that period. From 1970s, apart from taxing and recovering costs in every aspect of governance, there is hardly any new visions to take the economy higher. As can be seen in the 20 problems of autocracy, the governance has failed to achieve economic competitiveness or greater entrepreneurship. The many scholars employed to run the system have been found wanting and helpless in the last two recessions to create jobs or stop the outflow of foreign companies. The domestic sector of the economy is suffering from natural death and attritions.<br><br>Rather, you should have realized that it is people who have been coerced into paying S$800,000 per household under a system of double taxes for land and triple taxes for vehicle ownership that created the present surpluses which the autocracy claimed as its success in a one-sided governance.<br><br>Is this kind of autocracy sustainable?

            <div class='col-md body'>There is one point in particular that I would like to explore and  I quote the following,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Its citizens want to participate in governance and will contribute only when they see fair, equitable and correct policies being implemented in accountable political processes.<br><br>Past mistakes and shortcomings have to be recognized fast and changed:-<br><br>It is incorrect to make important decisions affecting citizens behind closed doors among cabinet members. This is not right!!!<br><br>Listen to the quiet but strong desire of the people and change to more just and equitable practices".</span><br><br>The government in years past had prided itself on its ability to implement unpopular measures. The premise of such policies, (often not without traces of hubris), is that the government knows better than the citizens they represent. As a matter of course, this cannot but be true (with the exception of expert groups within the community) since most citizens do not have the expertise and information available to the government.<br><br>The approach is similar to that of business corporations run by professional managers on behalf of shareholders.  Shareholders entrust the managers to run the business and do not make business decisions.<br><br>However, in the long run, it is dangerous for the government (and ultimately for the community) should authorities persist in pursuing unpopular policies without fully explaining the issues and taking into account legitimate views. It is encumbent on the goverment to have the facts published, issues debated and to have the decision process made transparent and accountable.<br><br>IMO, only through deep commitment to a process of raising the standards of community awareness and education could the government ensure the long-term survival and prosperity of Spore. Encouragingly, I do see signs that LHL understands this fundamental issue and is moving gradually in the right direction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Suntze<br><br>If the promise to open up intellectual and social spaces signalled in PM LHL's inauguration speech is fulfilled and government made more accountable to the people to serve their needs and aspirations, (not for egoism or autocratic purpose) then it will be a good start of evolving Singapore's particular brand of accountable and participative democracy.<br><br>Accountable and participative democracy is what Singapore needs now to take it to the next level.

            <div class='col-md body'>Democracy is a form of government under which the power to alter the laws and structures of government lies, ultimately, with the citizenry. Under such a system, legislative decisions are made by the people themselves or by representatives who act through the consent of the people, as enforced by elections and the rule of law.<br><br>In practical effect, this definition generally comes with qualifications and limitations. In most modern democratic nations, for example, the set of citizens who can exercise these powers through voting are restricted to those who are 18 years of age or older. A further qualification is that, realistically, in elections, decisions are not made by the whole of "the people", but rather by most of the people who actually participate.<br><br>The term "democracy"Â—or more precisely, the original (ancient Greek) version of the wordÂ—was coined and the system of citizen rule invented thousands of years ago. Over time, the meaning of the term has changed and especially since the 18th century, with successive implementations in many nations, a modern definition has emerged<br></div>
