            <div class='col-md body'>If the ministers in charge are proactive, or creative, there will not be a history of problems with departments under their charge. PM does not seem to override or correct Ministers' policies. He usually leaves it to them to speak and defend. That is why the pattern of inactions and persistent problems like work site poor safety records etc is happening. That is why LTA, MOH, Public Transport companies etc under the ministers' charge have not been recognized for so long.<br><br>Just look back at the particular ministers' past records of dealing with work site accidents, transport fare hikes, medical fee hikes and there have been only a series of defensive explanations and not much creative actions to solve problems. High costs would remain high and there will not any actions to correct shortcomings.<br><br>NKF is a typical case of ministers in charge persisting in some belief that high flyers of their recognition would deliver. But are the ministers minitoring problems like ratio of donation to salaries of CEOs.<br><br>If ministers are willing to be proactive and admit accountable and transparent management. The same MRT chaotic problems and LTA, mess or past MOH's persistence in refusing to lower hyper medical fees etc. would not have been explained away with some stupid committee or public panel's wrongful beliefs or policies. He would step in and correct them without bothering the PM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PM LHL said he wanted to build an inclusive society. He should know so far he had been excluding ordinary citizens from participating in political process. His election system such as the GRCs are contrived in such a way as to exclude citizens to vote for their own choices of MPs or Presidents. Everything the<br>leaders do is to conceive and impose their wishes and come up with schemes to carry them out to entrench themselves in power - full of hypocrisy and falsehood.<br><br>There is a saying: "You can fool some people some of the time but not all people all the time." Leaders must walk the talk instead of all the policies and pretentious schemes with double or hidden agendas.<br><br>As long as leaders continue to be self-serving and not prepared to be objective, or walk the talk, as long as they continue to double-talk there will be problems at the end like the NKF case - full of malpractices and cover-ups and at the end, implosions or cataclysmic collapses of the falsehood.<br><br>There is not enough real sincerity about building an inclusive society so far. If there is government would relent and release all the politically oppressed people and let them lead their free lives.<br><br>Leaders should be objective and real and show concern for citizens' wishes and aspirations. It is time to get real and come down from the high horse and show the citisens how to be inclusive and involve all.<br><br>It will only happen when citizens are allowed without all the gerrymandering of election processes to elect their own choices of leaders, PMs, or Presidents. Let citizens have the say in such thing. Then PM Lee can say he is above the fray of dirty politics and able to lead the new order and create a cosmopolitan inclusive society where everyone cares about fellow citizesn and the country.<br><br></div>

Is that kind of presentation good corporate governance or leadership?<br><br>Without creating any true economic competitiveness, results or accountability and without reducing our high costs, the leaders are claiming all kinds of success to the world through the media.<br><br>All the following promises are still not fulfilled but people are getting daily propaganda to show leaders in very good-looking picture to help the party win over naive people some of them are seen on TV praising the leaders.<br><br>The quality and resolve of the people now is far more important not personality cult or leaders' idolizing or worship.<br><br>If people are easily bought over by believing easily what the leaders aer saying about good things or good acts they are seen doing without holding them accountable for performance and result, we all end up suckers.

To me it is when system is broadly established as a total framework to guarantee citizens of rights and roles in nation building that able leaderships can maximize and contribute.<br><br>Singaporeans are largely brought up to believe in talents and leadership because of accidental success of personal leadership by a forceful centrist leader like Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Whether able leader will continue to bring progress is something being widely debated.<br><br>"Definition of True Democracy" as posted at www.sgforums.com sets out to establish the view that it is more important for society to take care of establishing basic rights of citizens and democratic institutions before there can be sustainable personal leadership. Many would not agree including some notable forumers from USA who have read the posting and posted contrary views praising Lee Kuan Yew to no end.<br><br>Without differentiation, between personal leadership and institutional framework that allows society to work equitably at its best, all political views are now confused and in a state of flux.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Government is now desparately in need of some oppositions in parliament now due to change of circumstance. Firstly people got fed up with their ineffective leadership during all of the last two recessions. Secondly now it is clearly proven that the incumbent party has run out of ideas how to upgrade or restore lost competitiveness. If an incumbent as proud and egoistic as this one faces such a situation, they should revamp and let there be some forms of respite to all the hypes about leadership and talents and let in some renewal. In order to retain some semblance of propriety, I bet they realise they cannot win all and got to invite some competitions.<br><br>If not the incumbent might even fail and shriver more quickly. So to retreat is sometimes better solutions than to insist on going forward. Let there be some funs and entertainment at the same time and all will be better.<br><br>There is no reason in coming election for incumbent to suppress oppositions especially after the NKF fiasco as that might be a bankruptcy move totally crippling to the whole system. To retreat sometimes is to advance in the next move and I guess this leeway to oppositions now is a right move.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be too pessimistic. I think Singapore today is quite different from what it was at the last election. Structural unemployment is a bigger problem than before, costs have gone up despite a diminishing pay packet and despite all the promises of higher property value following upgrading, not many wealthy people have resulted from this anyway. Add to these the NKF saga, the Nicoll Highway collapse and talk about elitisim.....this government has alienated alot of people, including those who support most of their policies.<br><br>The opposition parties will gain seats if they can be united for once and plan their election strategy so that the most promising candidate is offered at each constituency instead of diluting votes for the opposition. But they have to be credible...we cannot have opposition party candidates turning up in slippers and who cannot give a rational argument about policies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually share MM's view on elitism... saved that my version of political elitism and his ain't quite the same.<br><br>Basically, to govern, you really need a type of people. Not just those all boiled up with hot gas in the bellies and for the sake of election.<br><br>In order to govern, one has to have some basis for wisdom. Scholars and such branded personnels are usually the pests of past regimes who unwittedly contribute to both downfall and destruction of a regime.<br><br>It's not what the western educated call it the people who can come up with policies... Policies... they are never perfect and utimately if it's still the man behind, it's still the man itself which is the factor. Which is why people such as Durai could have lasted so long, even under challenged.<br><br>Leaders have the responsibilities to lead the society. People with huge know-hows ain't necessarily the people with the ability to educate the people and influence them in the right manner.

Is this kind of leadership what we need today in nation building?<br><br>How do we get our leaders to translate goals, objectives and all kinds of look-good policies into actions and processes to deliver results with objective performance, reliability, justice, empathy with the poor and needy, the underdogs or socially handicapped or better serve the social and economic wellbeing of all.<br><br>Chances are that leaders today are still mostly rhetorical, and conceptual offering good-looking policies and assumptions rather than the ability to deliver results and economic competitiveness.<br><br>Given the continuously fast-changing technological and knowledge-based environment  of today, it will be foolhardy to rely on concepts about talents or assumptions in governing of a country.<br><br>In the new age, leaders should be people possessing implementation abilities and special knowledge and skills in applying technologies to fuel growth. Practical knowledge applications will thrive and lead the world in the future.<br><br>Hence, they should act as facilitator of follow-through performance, objective and accountable corporate governance, leveling up of populations to gain competitive advantages to seize opportunities at practical applications of knowledge by all in every field.<br><br>They should mobilise people to achieve progress through implementation processes and go beyond revenue collections and enforcements of regulations and controls or provisions of basic services in security, medical or other utility needs of the early ages.<br><br>Effective leadership today should consist of the following criteria:-<br><br>(1) Translate goals and objectives and policies and assumptions into implementation processes to empower all in transforming widest fields of knowledge to create technology start-ups and jobs to bring about value-adding competitiveness.<br><br>(2) Collective leadership or governance to avoid narrow top-down conceptual look-good management by a few erudite elites or individuals.<br><br>Process management will avoid bias, prejudices of individuals, presentations, public relations, rhetorical abilities or emotive personality appeal.<br><br>Collective process management should aim at translating all goals, objectives, ideas or policies into real implementation capabilities from planning to execution, applying knowledge with total coordination to benefit whole society. Implementational efficiency and creativity must be part of the new ability to lead and rule.<br><br>The government must oversee the implementation of all knowledge applications from an holistic economic master plan, to realize technologicial start-ups and value-add all economic activities to stay competitive.<br><br>The modern governments should nurture an environment to grow more entrepreneurs and technological start-ups and create jobs. Government should be about creating higher paying jobs to sustain people's expected standards of living.<br><br>Very often, sad to say, many governments are only overly concerned with their own equations of success and protecting their own interests which are not consonent with the majoirity's interests or wellbeings.<br><br>It will not be enough to govern a country based on collecting maximum taxes, saving or privatising government expenses and creating government surpluses. Without empowering the workers and employees to participate in practical knowledge application, the economic pie is unlikely to grow.<br><br>Modern governments should practise holistic good corporate governance and dispense with self-centred policies of the past and should open up to facilitate building up of capabilities and competitiveness through practical knowledge application.<br><br>Only by practising collective good corporate governance as described will governments solve problems diverse problems in a more holistic manner.<br><br>All decisions will then carried out by means of committed people-centred implementation processes without hindrances from all the media hype, justfications and look-good presentations and defensiveness.<br><br>(Read more: <a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com</a><br><a href="http://www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com</a><br><a href="http://www.easymanager.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.easymanager.blogspot.com</a></div>
