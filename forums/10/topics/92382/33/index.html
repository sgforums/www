How can we say that the USA potrays the perfect paradigm of democracy?

Thus, we obviously cannot compare the implimented systems in Singapore and say, USA.<br><br>Hence, the question that needs to be addressed is, are we as democratic as we depict ourselves to be? Or do the men in white merely overstate the citizens' freedom in order to appease the watchful eye of the crotch-hair administration?</div></blockquote>I agree that there is no absolute of democracy, communism or any political or economic system.<br><br>Nevertheless, rational people everywhere can aspire to the ideal and try to attain as much values they aspire as practicable. If democracy consisting of a basic framework of government (executive, legislative and judiciary) plus a basic constitution guaranteeing the rights of political participation is our aspired model, then we should go on and try to work on it and make it work for us.<br><br>I am afraid many people are not talking about any such model of democracy and they keep changing their mind between one system or another relative or absolute.<br><br>Hence, there is a need to ensure that we uphold our current basic constitutions and framework of governing components and try to avoid our present system deteriorating to become an autocracy or authoritarianism as much as we can.</div>

They may wish to remain as concerned citizens only giving their views without winning any arguments or medals.<br><br>Posting of political views are supposed to be open by the new administration as it was announced that the new leaders want citizens to have views and not apathetic.

In electing their leaders, people impliedly choose them to be the best who have extra abilities to be objective and accountable and set as good examples of themselves.<br><br>By virtue of leaders being persons elected to lead the people,  it would be incorrect to expect people to try to understand and warm up to the leaders or worshipping the ground they walk on or being part of society. <strong>For leaders to be effective they should demonstrate extra quality and ability and willingness to understand people and be prepared to lead by example and subscribe to principles of accountability and transparency</strong>. If leaders are unable to be objective in applying sedition law to non-mass circulation electronic dairy like blogging, people will see them as less than objective or reasonable and will grow wary and unwilling to support such leaders.<br><br>So far our leaders over the past forty years or so have passed many ISD-like draconian laws. They are not prepared to rationalise and be objective or lead by example in making themselves accountable in invoking and applying sedition law to personal blogging.<br><br>By failing to show such objectivity in applying sedition laws to bloggers' immature remarks over the net, it shows that they are not leading by example.</blockquote>I suppose the simplest and time-thrifty way to make you realise of what many also must realise of what (whole chunk) you mentioned is to summarised a reply to the darken portion:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Extra quality leaders from low quality of perception from average quality of choosers...?</span><br><br>It's as if I'd to choose the good apples for the dinner dishes, and I'd automatically choose all the apples without worms even if I have low quality of perception and I simply go on average...<br><br>Do you, and all else, understand what I am trying to say...?<br><br>This kills politic(al progress), hence society's progress. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So it's no surprise I don't see eye to eye with many people... But are their eyes brighter than mine in terms of such issues? Is it quantity or quality that matters, which is an additional branch of thoughts?<br><br>Well, you can't assume these leaders are Draconian and that's their fault... because they are the results of the people. The issue is still the people, and Singaporean inertia to face up to the stuckar mentality and attitude is horrendously so. That's why unless necessary, I myself really ain't wanna bother about local politics, especially being trained in politics for so long.<br><br>Are you sure you or everyone else is no Draconian in their place?<br><br>Why? Put it this way, Robert, whether they are autoritarian or draconian or fundamentalistic or what... what's exactly that differentiate between a good leader for progress and a lousy one?<br><br>Political wisdom, my friend. Yes. Only that. No qualification, no Edmund Chan, no big brand titles, no nothing else. What is the role of such leaders? Book keeping? Figures-mongling? Obviously not!<br><br>Actually, what is politics to you? Have you thought of that inspite such huge amount of texts you have posted, alongside with your insistance over the 20problems... ...<br><br>Time to think, Singapore... and it's gonna be a silly call on my side anyway.

But for your benefit, I shall summarize:-<br><br>1) No we aren't. And actually the authorities don't really much care about portraying us as democratic; their focus is on portraying efficiency and effectiveness and quality. They use these to counter-argue proponents of democracy locally and overseas, or where they can't, sneak in the "Singapore is unique" argument.<br><br>2) Ya, we have to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>3) That's because the govt maintains harsh laws. Economics explains partially why these harsh laws exist. These laws exist to preserve political stability and to offer power to the investors over their labour. This attracts investors easily, or at least attracted them easily, but they are not beneficial for the long-term development of the nation's citizens.<br><br>Btw, UN-HDI puts Singapore under the list of developing countries, p'raps because we have a thrid-world income structure.<br><br>the pikamaster<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(Reply to forumer, As Posted to Feedback Unit on 6.10.2005)<br><br>I suppose when our leaders first told the people about the dangers of welfarism 30-40 years ago as practised in the west, they were correct.<br><br>Singapore is a resourceless country where people must survive by hardwork and creativity. This basic principle is still true.<br><br>However, things got screwed up when the leaders went about implementing this policy. Instead of balancing taxation against services, every ministry and department is managed as cost centre recovering every costs and charging fees up to or exceeding market values.<br><br>When any ministry or department is inefficient or costly, there is no one to check on them and the leaders allow them to increase fees to cover back any cost increases.<br><br>The state is practising no longer welfare-avoidance but monopolistic charging of fees and recovering full costs of services and market values. Not only that, many services were privatised to reduce spending but in many cases, they are accumulating surpluses like NKF without accountability to people.<br><br>That is why many statutory boards are making excessive profits from people like what HDB has been doing.<br><br>So is it correct to preach about dangers of welfarism and expect people to listen to confucianism or moral high grounds any more?<br><br>Every department is a cost centre. Making monies are no longer enough. They are making more and more monies and accumulate them as surpluses while the private sector economy practically cannot survive and people are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>Unless there is a balance between avoiding welfarism and profiteering, Singapore will not be able to return to the old-day vibrancy and entrepreneurship.<br><br>Essentially through persistent taxing and privatisation the government gets richer and businesses, jobs and people suffers.<br><br>Government will not admit its policies of raising prices in all departments is wrong whether there is NKF or not. Licence fees were originally collected to operate the TV media but privatising the licence fees were conveniently absorbed by media authority as government surpluses.<br><br>There has to be big changes to the whole system of taxing and recovering costs.<br><br>"Welfare basically is state subsidy and state aid to an individual. So welfare goes to providing essential services as well as funds for the poor. State funds come from taxes.So what does the govt want to avoid ? One bankruptcy, that state expenditure for services do not impose a heavy burden on the state, if it does then state has to raise taxes. The other what is termed crutch mentality. What is crutch mentality ?<br><br>The country today is being run like a business or company where the company has to balance its books and accounts regularly and cutting off costs or expenses.<br><br>Under this kind of government, then people will not be wrong to regard it as Singapore Incorporated the place to demand the maximum and give back the minimum in the same way people are paying for goods and services. After all the government at every board meeting is not going to look after their interests but approve all policies to keep increasing government's own profits.<br><br>"Essentially people demanding state to provide essential services and aid even at the expense of state gowing bankrupt. Point is for Singapore we are not growing bankrupt, we have reserves. "<br><br>By logic people can rightly ask the state in today's system of government to keep spending for their benefits selling votes to them at high price even if the state is going bankrupt because the state is now not a country.<br><br>"But we still don't want to develop crutch mentality as this has disasterous consequences. But the issue is people are growing poor and finding life harder to get by - so now how should the state help, whta should the state do ? Lower cost, that good. Is lowering costs and increasig subsidies for medical education and transport going to place a burden on our state system ? Not for transport at least which is making fat healthy profits. Does the average citizen have some right to subsidies ? "<br><br>By the way state is running the country like a business, people do not have to be so concerned with certain duties or issues. If state want transport companies to keep making more and more profits, people have to try their own ways and devices to try other ways to survive the high costs because the state is no longer acting in their interests.<br><br>"Yes, to begin with we pay taxes, why should the state not subsidise us a little ? Will it create a crutch mentality - gut feeling no, why? Because we still co-pay, because susidised say medical treatment we don't choose our doctors, we have to stay in a lower class ward we make do with less priviledge. At worse say polyclinics don't have air con I'm ok with that. New hospital don't need wonderful gardens - ok too, just buy more beds! "<br><br>People should group themselves into many VWOs and set their own rules to survive in competition with the state-sponsored and state-run companies or GLCs.<br><br>"How does the crutch mentality come about, how does the crutch mentality think ? That's a question we need to ask. If you say we will keep costs high and then those who cannot afford get aid - will this result in crutch mentality ? yes, more likely to happen, so yes I agree with you Robert that in a way our govt could be creating its own gimme gimme gorilla. "<br><br>Welfare or clutch mentality comes about because the state is in control of everything and the news media. All policies are presented to suit the agendas of the state. We are still not independent in our thinking to find the right solutions yet. It is now for the people to think of new solutions how to get their leaders to be fair,equitable, accountable and people-centred. Long long ago, the leaders have stopped serving the people but they are still thinking that they have done well.<br><br></div>

I would sympathise with those who are now singled out for "backward" punishment just because it suits the situation to do so as it may happen that this offers opportunity to punish someone now.

Policies or law made are not enforced for "backward" punishments as two wrongs do not make a right. The best practice will be justice is not only done fairly and equitably throughout and not affected by to-and-fro correctives to fit new thinking or policies. Justice should also be seen as being done based on fundamental principles well practised and accepted by the masses over time.<br><br>If anyone has been forgiven then similar forgivance should be extended to all the rest and not selectively to suit situation or to look good to suit new policies.</div>

The former incldues the latter and the right of States to have power over their citizens i.e. the Public Mandate. The latter merely refers to a state's independence.<br><br>4) the word "certain" is very vague. Please clarify the details of what you would like to have as guidelines, and I mean *fully* clarify here, not clarify as in what the ST does.<br><br>5) I'm not familiar with the post GMS has put up, which you claim "fails to differentiate between social openness and political openness"; perhaps you could paste it on this thread? And tt guy's UID is miccheng, and his name is Michael; that's what he signs off with for every of his posts. Unfortunately, I have to say that Mikey is rather a political conservative i.e. he believes in PAP to the letter, which makes him kinda close-minded. Hmm... the only issue I could think of that could have a double-relationship with both social and political openness is the homosexual issue. Hmm... is that what GMS's post was about? But I still think GMS is quite well-informed though.<br><br>6) blame education and the govt's warping of the media for this. It's a vicious circle.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>7) What is the "fundamental" of a nation in your opinion?<br><br>8 ) I think I agree wih your basic point in this paragraph. Did you read Yadav's commentary in TODAY? He sort of said the same thing. Lai CF is a nonsense spouter anyway, so dun listen to him.  The main problem down here is that Good Thinkers usually get burnt up with the bad, so u end up with a bare wheatfield (w/o kokocrunch<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">) , instead of one with the wheat only. The Sedition Act is just extremely vague. Using the Act, the government could simply arrest anyone here, even harmless ones like earthlings73, or you or me. Because by engaging in these discussions and inviting others to join in, we break the part of Clause 3 which talks about "inciting political disaffection toward the government". The Sedition Act clearly needs to be refined.<br><br>9) Everything comes both ways. If you have a good environment, you will have good thinking i.e. if you have a real environment that actively promotes racial harmony and where people believe in that concept, we will have it. The problem is that Singaporeans' legalistic mindsets and pragmatism override that. Our pragmatism teaches us (quite wrongly) that ideals are impossible to achieve, and our legalistic mindsets immediately revel in the most violent punnishments possible for the crimes - some people on this forum actually suggested the racist bloggers be hanged, in the newspapers, a letter contributor suggested to cane the bloggers, and so on, and Yadav's commentary was met with a quick and emotional rebuke. It's very clear that all these people don't believe in racial harmony at all, especially the one who maintained overtly that racial harmony is "an ideal that is unrealistic". So, what have we here???<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>10) If the forgiveness is sincere i.e. not a court's "forgiveness", then repentance will come. In truth, I realized that the racist bloggers are not really repentant. "I did not know it would cause my being captured, I will not do it again" is more a conviction of pragmatism, than an expression of regret. Neither do I think the A-Star Blogger was really repentant either, even if Philip Yeo chooses to delude himself into thinking so.<br><br>11) Agree. Laws, especially the most punitive ones, are only short-term solutions.<br><br>12) Your line of reasoning here makes me dizzy.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>13) An over-simplification, I'm afraid.<br><br>the (skeptical) pikamaster</div>

He'd probably really go get an oath declaring 'he's has nothing seditious in his dictionary...' if he'd get stuck in a sedition issue.<br><br>Argh... frustrated just to think such people exist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

And their immature perception, probably shared across the islands by many others, is generally left to develop. It is unfair that they be left unchecked and such attitude shall 'mature' into something disasterous should these people doing very well in academic be (in Singapore's scenario) arranged into key positions.<br><br>Just as the kid with the animal organization, he might become the next uncle Lai who may see it proper to take liberty on others across the internet in his own view. These people are pleading harmless, or even innocent, are actually educating their problems to the next batch of ignorant kids. And they could end up being promoted in real-life and rationally speaking, this doesn't mean they would automatically 'mature' as they advance... which is a problem of society that better people are relatively stuck down there and such elements progress.<br><br>In that manner, I have already explained whether immature is taken by you as young or simply immature. The court of justice has a role, as explained many years agao in YP forum, that its judgement must serve as a responsible component of good governance in Singapore, which is repeated by the judge of these three bloggers. Hence, because they refused to think and insist of offending out of no reasonableness, there is nothing the court can do but to impose something drastic to them as preventive measures.<br><br>We are aware that all those kids are still commoners.<br><br>Overtime, without the society's ability to even mildy self-regulate, with such elements developing mentality of problems, this state can't even be stable, how can we simply count on the population to cooperate or build what inclusive society? By their manner of inclusive, it's actually kinda bashing and/or chasing away quality people who think <span style="font-style: italic;">differently</span> from these people, and that's it for Singapore.<br><br>These people who never think risk Singapore as they could influence in a way the type of leaders who'd helm eventually. Only good thinking people can create a proper inclusive society, not any people, Robert.<br><br>Do you really think Moi can result in inclusive of alot of people, for instance? See how many times I have urged Friedlice to stop his nosense about myself. It isn't really hard to understand the governance I am thinking about, is it?</div>
