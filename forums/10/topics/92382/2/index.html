You painted a world of democratic love, peace and joy but i think u can agree that's not the true reality. Yes, the failure of some countries to implement successful democracy due to their own pitfalls cannot be use to penalise the ideals of which, but it is still true that this is no easy solution and not quite realistic. In theory, communism is also beautiful and wonderful, but we also recognise that it is not realistic.<br><br>Is democracy "obviously successful"? Has democracy "triumphed over dark forces existing in all political systems of one kind or another"? Those are very very sweeping statements which borders on being presumptuous. On what do you base these statements? There are still a few monachies that enjoys more prosperity and stability than many democratics. Granted, that doesn't means monachy is a better system, but it does show that democracy isn't the only way to go.<br><br>Western (esp amercian and hollywood) media has hyped the ideals of democracy beyond it's merit. It doesn't mean democracy doesn't work, it just means it's been very over-rated. And that it's not the end to itself, rather a means (among other options, singapore's socialist styled republic including).<br></div></blockquote>Your 2-cents bit is actually worth more if you should insist on your particular choice of words or English as superior.<br><br>I don't think I have selectively compared with systems as I like and ignored facts or substances offered in your posting.

It is also my opinion that it is a worthy ideal that can be used as basis for refinement.<br><br>I am not denying your point that in actual practice, such model may be difficult but democracy offering such points in part or in whole has endured despite all criticisms mentioned by you in your posting.<br><br>So, one cannot deny its merits which must be many to be attractive to many countries.  I did not say that Singapore experience is not an alternative model either. I only tried to show you that if it is indeed a model it has to be postulated to be seen as a model. What features were outstanding in Singapore model and could stand up to scrutiny as worthy of emulation.<br><br>Surely you would allow me to ask you one question if you insist to be so critical about American model of democracy : Is there an alternative you could offer as a better model. If there is no clear answer, I suppose it is clear to all that criticisms you have so painstakingly dashed out have no basis in facts or substance in the context of our discussions here about an ideal democracy all progressive and peace loving people all over the world could work towards.<br><br><a href="http://www.freeimages.co.uk&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.freeimages.co.uk<img src="http://www.btinternet.com/~fireballxl5/nature/flora/nature01478_small.jpg"></a></div>

We're hardly repressed. We still have access to alternative news sources and can crap about local politics on the internet. We're also free to vote for the opposition if we so choose(quality is however sadly lacking in that department, other than notable examples of Mr Low Thia Kiang and Chiam Chee Tong) Sure there are restrictions and the Internal Security Department.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART ONE</strong><br><br>robertteh says<br><blockquote>However, what seems clear to me from the historical perspectives given by you in the foregoing that despite arguments for and against democracy......</blockquote>I am uncertain if you are referring to my previous post or political philosophers in your first statement. I have not made a case against democracy at all. My point is that there is NO one ideal democratic model that every country should emulate. Rather, it is crucial that Singapore be allowed to develop its own system according to its own needs and unique circumstances, just like countries in the West have in the past.<br><br>This is precisely why there are so many forms of democracy these days-  Presidential democracy (US) and Westminister democracy (UK, Australia) are the universally acknowledged ones. But even these are not perfectly democratic. There are also variations of the democratic ideal in other pats of the world. Electoral democracies (Singapore and Malaysia) observe all the basic tenets, and maintain all the norms of a democracy, but civil and political liberties are not granted in the same way many of the older, established liberal democracies in the West do.<br><br>Is this necessarily a bad thing you will ask? As I pointed out earlier, this depends on the degree of political evolution each society has undergone. Sudden political freedom without education, political adriotness and skilful adaptation leads to political and economic chaos (Russia, East European countries, Philippines, Indonesia etc) simply because people are not equipped to handle their responsibilities as a responsible, participating political citizen, and the state is unable to perform two difficult tasks-political and economic reform simultaneously. Resources and manpower are stretched, and ordinary folks clamour and expect immediate political and economic miracles. If they don't see these, protests, riots, coups occur as dissatisfaction grows and frustrations explode. In the end, both economic and political goals are not achieved. While these appear to be seeping generalisations, they are not- one only has to look abroad to see examples abound.<br><br>Modern day Western democracies achieved economic reform and industrialization <strong>FIRST</strong>, before political reform was carried out. Yet, these same countries expect developing or newly independent countries to achieve in one or two generations, what they took centuries to achieve. Very often, a failure to follow Western dictum results in media and government hectoring with all kinds of unsavoury and derogatory labels and commentaries being published/made. I am not sure if ulterior motives exist (perhaps the West prefers to maintain the status quo so that other parts of the world are perpetually embroiled in political and economic chaos while they maintain their position at the top of the global political hierarchy), but I can safely say that since the breakup of the USSR, Russia has been left alone to deal with the political and economic fallout ALONE most of the time. It may be democratic now, but good has democracy done? Higher standards of living? More jobs? More social security? None of the above at all! Only endemic poverty, unemployment, inflation, shortage of goods and services, breakdown of law and order etc. Like the Indonesians , Russians often yearn for the good old days (communist era) when there was food on the table, a roof over their head, and social security. While Indonesians certainly welcome democracy, there is also a longing for the old Suharto days (New Order) paradoxically, for the same reasons. It doesn't take an ordinary person to realize what years of inflation, unemployment, poverty and political chaos can do to one's livelihood and family.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TidalWave333:</div><div class="quote_body">robertteh's 7-point definition of a 'true democracy', while inspirational, also smacks of idealism (and possibly naivety). The American political model certainly does not possess all of those virtues. In fact, I would go so far to add that those prerequisites are set so high that pragmatically, no country can ever satisfy them adequately.<br><br>What is a 'true democracy' anyway? This question has been debated for centuries by the likes of Bentham, Mills and Rousseau. In fact no liberal democracy in the West can be said to be perfectly democratic...hence the term 'polyarchy'.<br><br>The US has had two centuries to develop its political model while European nations have had even longer (more than four centuries) as pointed out in postings under 'American Electioneering'. It's interesing to note that American democracy granted the vote to only white males who owned property initially, before this was given to women in 1920, and black Americans in 1964. And if one thinks of how the previous American election between Gore and Bush was played out (problems with voting paper i.e chads, the manner of counting votes, the influence of media, the large numbers of disenfranchised legal voters, the status of American votes from overseas etc)  or the Guantanamo Bay controversies, or the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, or the passing of the Patriot Act etc,...many questions must occur to those who have always placed great faith in the infallibility of American democracy.<br><br>How many former American colonies or countries which adopted the American political model have succeeded spectacularly politically *and* economically anyway? Latin America? South America? Closer to home, the Philippines makes an interesting case study.....even after the end of the Marcos era, the Philippines continues to be embroiled in political corruption, people power coups, political dominance by prominent land-owning families, personality politics (especially movie stars and celebrities), the influence of the Catholic church in politics etc etc. Economically, it is near collapse under the Arroyo administration with poverty and unemployment everywhere.<br><br>When one turns to European (especially British and French) colonies, how many can be said to have succeeded too? Of the more than 40 former colonies, only Singapore and Hong Kong stand out as economic successes. This is not due to *only* colonial legacies like the bureaucracy, rule of law and governance which our former British masters left us (and indeed left with former African colonies and India as well), but also and more importantly, the hard work of those who were granted independence. Remember that Singapore was a very poor country in the 1960s, before joining the Malayan Federation, and after being expelled from it.<br><br>The PAP for all the criticisms of it being authoritarian, has done a good (dare I say excellent) job of ensuring political stability goes hand in hand with economic growth since 1965. As for Hong Kong, what can I say except that it was only returned to China in 1997, and that the British had a change of heart and realised the virtues of democracy only a few years prior to the handover (and after more than 150 years of colonial rule!) Despite the benefits democracy confers, can you blame the Chinese for feeling betrayed at this unilateral change of (British) heart?<br><br>I certainly wouldn't disagree that Singapore has lots of areas to see to where political liberalisation is concerned. (With a younger, and more educated and global population , it is only natural that expectations differ from the older generations.) This is not to say that the incumbent government is doing badly - indeed, there have been concrete steps in liberalization (however gradual) for a long time, especially now. One only needs to compare the state of affairs 15 years ago and at present. Political evolution cannot be rushed- it has to happen at its own pace...the Europeans (includng the Brits) had 400 years, the US had 200 years, the Australians had more than 100 years, surely it's not too much for Singapore to be given more time, given that the country only celebrated its 49th birthday recently? <span style="color: orangered;">One only has to look to Russia or former Eastern European states to see how things can go terribly wrong if this is not handled properly.</span> Indeed, it is crucial Singapore be allowed to developed its own political model, without trying to copy the West. The West developed their own political models as a result of unique historical conditions which cannot be replicated elsewhere. Even the politically apathetic can see that the US and the UK have evolved differently where political governance is concerned.<br><br>Is Singapore really politically repressed like North Korea or some Middle Eastern country? The answer is obviously no. We enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, people are free to move about freely, and despite common complaints about the lack of media freedom or political discussion, we have access to 5000 periodicals, the internet, cable news networks, and even public forums like these. People who insist on denying these realities are either self-deluded or have no intention accepting rational and logical debate. Why? Perhaps their private frustrations and anger over certain govt policies have blinded them to the big picture.<br><br>One cannot possibly vote the opposition in, just for the sake of voting in an opposition. Similarly, one cannot read everything the Western media says, and treat it as sacred. The opposition have to prove themselves (and indeed the current slate of new political leaders in WP appear to be trying hard to demonstrate this). Again, there is no need to elaborate at length the fracas between Mr Chee SJ and Mr Chiam ST over the SDP in the 1990s, or the various newspaper headlines that Mr Chee have made since.<br><br>Until a viable and strong opposition develops, the rational Singaporean will opt for the best available choice, especially a party which has a proven track record politically and economically. </div></blockquote>Where are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia today?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART TWO</strong><br><br><blockquote>it had triumped over dark forces existing in all political systems of one kind or another. It has triumphed over dictatorship, centrally controlled governance, and guided or control-based systems over the ages. </blockquote>I certainly didn't imply that anywhere in my post! (or perhaps I misinterpreted you?) Democracy has <strong>NOT</strong> triumphed. In fact, a famous American political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">The End of History?</span> predicted that liberal democracy would become the victorious idealogy over other forms of political governance at the end of the century with the defeat of Communism.........but this has proven to be false. In fact, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Clash of Civilizations </span>(Samuel Huntington) has occurred, and many other contending forms of ideologies have reared its head. In this case, Islamic fundamentalism is fighting to impose its version of Islamic (shariyah and hudud) laws in Islamic societies, especially the Middle East. Even in neighbouring Malaysia, PAS has a place in Kelantan.<br><br>Without trying to offend, it is a sweeping and rather ignorant statement to proclaim in such a triumphant tone that dark forces have been defeated. Hahaha.....are countries which do not subscribe to the Western model of liberal democracy evil? Three quarters of the world must live in evil regimes then! What about China, a centrally governed country.......for all the bad press that it has garnered in the West, it has performed the most breathtaking of all human feats in one generation- eradicating poverty for hundreds of millions of citizens (of course much more needs to be done too). Democracy has also been introduced at the village level, and political corruption is a problem being taken seriously at the highest level. But one needs to be patient where results are concerned- it is a huge country with a huge population. The government needs time to carry out political reform, and this cannot be accomplished in one or two generations, especially with other more pressing economic priorities.<br><br><blockquote>At the centre of this political transformation, is democracy championed by free people in Europe and America. So much was the historical impact of the goodness of democracy that it is being copied to a lesser or greater extent by Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, India, Singapore, Malaysia etc.<br>Not all of these countries which decided to introduce free elections had made it to be truly successful in the holistic sense - not just economic or material wellbeing alone</blockquote>No Asian country "copies" wholesale liberal democratic practices from the West. In fact, "copy" is not a word I would use so readily although newly independent countries do learn from the West. Each country merely takes advantage of its own heritage (e.g. American Occupation in Japan or British legacy in India), evolves, adopts, and emulates best practices. Hence Japan has retained its monarchy and instituted a parliamentary sysem even though the US has no monarchy and practises presidential democracy.<br><br>Even then, success is not immediate. Japan and South Korea have a long history of politcal corruption at the highest levels. Former Japanese Prime Ministers and Korean Presidents have continued to make a spectacle of themselves on TV on charges of corruption. As for Taiwan, I do not think populist and nationalist politics (e.g harping on Taiwanese, rather than Chinese identities), is necessarily the best way to go.  Parliamentarians throwing chairs and punching each other during parliamentary sessions is certainly NOT a reflection of 'freedom of speech' or 'freedom to express oneself'.<br><br><blockquote>Democracy is obviously successful after many centuries . It is for countries which did not follow its true practices to refine them to suit their needs and requirements.</blockquote>It's too early to mak a judgement call. You assume that there is only one form of democracy, when it is self-evident there are many forms. What are the 'true practices' anyway? (robertteh's 7-point criteria?) Is there only one 'true way' as practised in the West? Are other variations according to cultural, historical, social requirements less 'true'? Is Japanese liberal democracy 'true' even though the Liberal Democratic Party has for the most part (except for the early 1990s) dominated the contry's political landscape? Is Indian democracy 'less true' despite the dominance of the Indian Congress Party, and the influence of the Ghandi 'political dynasty'? True to who? The West? or the people who have to live with the system in each part of the world?<br><br>You also imply that democracy's failure or success can be easily judged in a short period of time. That's evidently 'untrue'. As I pointed out repeatedly, political evolution is a long and tedious process.<br><br>I would have loved to talk about Singapore's context, and why you find it disagreeable. But I think the post is getting too long ago, and perhaps this will give you time to ponder on what has been said so far. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Democracy for democracy's sake?<br><br>The ascension to the EU is equated with greater material-wellbeing for Eastern Europeans....a better lifelihood, a 'borderless' Europe, sharing in Europe's wealth and prosperity, discarding the unhappy memories of the communist era. No one is about to rush out to 'speak their minds' or become a political activist. I don't think any sane person would seriously think this is what Eastern Europeans are rejoicing about. What matters most are greater opportunities to improve their lives.<br><br>Speaking one's mind is not a right/gift which comes with EU membership. Do you mean to imply that those citizens could not speak freely prior to joining the EU, even though they have been democratic for at least 14 years after the fall of the communism? Surely not!<br><br>Or that democracy will/can only be reinforced with EU membership? Whether national governments will regress if it is not in the EU is a matter of speculation. However, democratic consolidation is really dependent on government adherence to democratic norms, and the political socialization of citizens over time. But looking at concrete evidence, Turkey does not seem to have regressed in its commitment to democracy- in fact its failure to be considered for EU membership is more a matter of its Muslim make-up (esp. in the aftermath of 9/11 and terrorism) than its human rights record.<br><br>Are you unable to speak your mind now? Haven't you already taken the tentative step by joining a public forum at least? I think the perception of political intimidation and repression is a psychological one, based on an innate fear of "Big Brother". (You may beg to differ of course)<br><br>As for capital punishment, it's  a digression from the subject at hand somewhat. Capital punishment (just like many other harsh criminal penalties) does, and can exist hand in hand with democracy, and liberal democracies no less. The US and Japan both practise it, as does Indonesia, a budding democracy. The EU may not, because of their own political, religious and social beliefs and convictions, but that does not make them more democratic than other liberal democracies, or the US and Japan, any less democratic.<br><br>In Singapore, you have a right to oppose capital punishment due to religious or human rights convictions of course, but truth be told, the majority of Singaporeans back the current penalty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To:Tidlewave333,<br><br>Perhaps based on the various examples of countries failing to succeed in practising democracy based on either US or UK's model, it is your strong conviction that the American or UK models are not necessarily the best or worth emulating..<br><br>You did not try to suggest any particular model as workable or worth emulating but continued to insist that each country will have to evolve its own systems best suited to its circumstances.<br><br>Some forumites are even suggesting that Singapore's model is better without defining it in some ways.<br><br>Our topic here is "Definition of True Democracy". In order to discuss in a reasonable way, we need to keep our arguments to whether the 7 points proposed in my post represent indeed true democracy or come close to it.<br><br>There is a range of emotive issues raised objecting to American form of presidential democracy. A lot of examples were given to justify that there are possibly other preferred forms.<br><br>However, I notice that these critics against American or UK model are so far not able to counter-propose as requested by me one or two that will be truly democratic and can be looked upon say by China or Indonesia as comparable models for eventual evolutional guidance to their people's aspirations - freedoms of expressions, associations, forming political parties, criticising or offering alternatives to government's policies or interpretation of executive powers etc.<br><br>In the meantime, many nations are probably watching how China and Indoneis will evolve their brand of democracy. It is too early to be judgmental and use some failures to solve certain problems in Taiwan, Philippines or Korea as failures of democracy.<br><br>After all you have rightly acknowledged that over time democracy has evolved and has been generally accepted or adopted in whole or in part by many countries where previously dictatorship or authoritarian regimes were causing much suffering.<br><br>We can keep to the topic - "Definition of True Democracy" - so that we can differentiate those that claim to be democracy but may not be for lack of certain essential ingredients. Lack of accountablity and transparency is one single large factor which is often found missing in many proclaimed democratic systems.<br><br>Lack of upholding of basic  rights like freedoms of speech or association is another area of concern among many countries presumably practising democracy.<br><br>Many proclaimed democracies will probably try to evolve their democracy in certain areas and hoping to improve shortcomings but many cannot change at the end no matter how hard they try.<br><br>The reluctance or difficulty to evolve to more participative or open model may be attributable to the people. Many forumites already acknowledged that despite the goodness of the democracy itself, politics is dirty. If it is dirty and politicians are at fault, can anyone lay the blame of system failure?<br><br>A greater understanding of true democracy even if not immediately suitable or acceptable to Singapore as some forumites are saying (don't know their backgrounds) will hopefully allow us to evolve our own political process. Hopefully our new PM will look into this aspect of our governance.<br><br><a href="http://www.freeimages.co.uk&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.freeimages.co.uk<img src="http://www.btinternet.com/~fireballxl5/nature/flora/natureflowers1342_small.jpg"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to keep this short.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>You did not try to suggest any particular model as workable or worth emulating but continued to insist that each country will have to evolve its own systems best suited to its circumstances. </blockquote>I am quite perplexed by your less than full understanding of my statement.  You appear to agree, and yet disagree with what I said. There is NO particular model that is perfectly workable or entirely worth emulating. As I pointed out repeatedly, all countries take advantage of their heritage, history and culture, and adopt political systems according to their own situation. The political system of the UK and Aus are different, just as the political system between the US and Philippines, the UK and Singapore, Singapore and Malaysia, Denmark and Canada are different.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>Some forumites are even suggesting that Singapore's model is better without defining it in some ways</blockquote>Actually Singapore's political system has been described and characterised in thousands of books and journal articles. It is a system that is deemed as unique since no sovereign country in the world has succeeded economically in just one generation without practising Western-style liberal democracy. I can't possiby be expected to write an academic essay here, but entire volumes have researched into the specific criteria/characteristics that makes Singapore-style democracy the way it is. It is variously known as electoral democracy, semi-authoritarianism, soft-authoritarianism, communitarian democracy, formal democracy among others. Start with Chua Beng Huat's Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore, Raj Vasil's Governing Singapore, or the anti-Singapore academic text The Singapore Puzzle, and follow up with the references there.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>Our topic here is "Definition of True Democracy". In order to discuss in a reasonable way, we need to keep our arguments to whether the 7 points proposed in my post represent indeed true democracy or come close to it. </blockquote>To be absolutely honest, I do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> think your criteria is really a useful guide, or much of a set of standards to work with at all. I have no wish to be spiteful or talk down to you condescendingly of course (unlike those writing in American Electioneering especially). The 7 points you brought up sound more like details in a constitution governing how elected representatives should perform their duties, and the relationship between the legislative, executive and bureaucracy than the characteristics of a 'true democracy'. There is no such thing as a 'true democracy' to begin with! To understand democracy in the mdoern day context is to strive to understand the concept of liberalism first, before the concept of democracy can be introduced. The two are inextricably linked. It's a momentous task in a public forum, but you have to be familiar with the intellectual roots of democracy, and the discipline of political science, and read works from the ancient to the modern (Schumpeter, Neher, Mills etc), reflect on it for a period of time in order to grasp it fully. It is not for a layperson to write offhand 7 points quickly here and pass it off as the criteria of 'true democracy'.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>However, I notice that these critics against American or UK model are so far not able to counter-propose as requested by me one or two that will be truly democratic and can be looked upon say by China or Indonesia as comparable models for eventual evolutional guidance to their people's aspirations - freedoms of expressions, associations, forming political parties, criticising or offering alternatives to government's policies or interpretation of executive powers etc</blockquote>In fact, the US and UK provide good examples of liberal democracy. I think what participants in this forum have been at pains to point out is that while they are universally acknowledged as liberal democracies, they are imperfect and possess flaws too (hence the term 'polyarchy'). China is not about to democratize in the sense that other 'Third Wave' countries have. It is merely liberalizing its economy, and granting some democratic rights along the way. Indonesia is democratizing of course, but Indonesia is not exactly looking to another country in particular as a shining example to emulate. But my prediction is it appears to be making the right moves: in the MPR and DPR (upper/lower houses), the direct election of the President by the people for the first time, the retreat of the military from politics and constitutional amendments etc.<br><br>The evolution of a democracy that will be satisfactory to the majority is achieveable of course. It requires political will, the clear demarcation of executive, legislative, judicial and bureaucratic boundaries and responsibilities, the socialization and education of citizens, the establishment of a party-system, the respect of civil and political rights among others. it is not just about 'transparency' or 'accountability' as you keep harping (perhaps because they are trendy jargon widely in use at the moment). Singapore is not a lost cause. Just compare things fifteen years ago and now (in terms of political participation, channels for feedback, widening debate like here, formation of interest groups, loosening of regulations etc).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: Tidlewave333,<br><br>Did Indonesia develop its present democracy from its heritage?<br><br>Did Japan, Taiwan or India take advantage of its heritage in coming to their present electoral democracy ?<br><br>I understand what you are trying to say that there are many problems affecting countries trying to practise American democracy, What I had pointed out is clear - that the problems you mentioned with Taiwan, or Philippines are not necessarily attributable to system failure. Many intervening factors may be involved to explain why other democratizations do not work as well. Time is one factor as I am sure you will agree.<br><br>I have merely tried to tell you to look at endurance of democratic system of governance from a historical perspective to show that despite all the criticisms against American or UK model nonetheless, democracy has developed and been accepted by increasing number of countries.<br><br>So far books may be written about Singapore's experiences with electoral democracy, it is too early to judge that it is indeed a model being emulated by many. There are criticisms as well as some praises. Critics of American liberal democracy (as you would like to call it) did not fully grasp its goodness but only look at it as full of problems which in the final analysis may be just the same everywhere or worse elsewhere.<br><br>If critics are so intent on criticising American or UK democracy, surely it is not too much to ask them to define which is the model best suited to a particular circumstance other than just heritage or something loose or changeable.<br><br>Surely they can come up with some 7 points too for useful discussions.<br><br>There are past problems or shortcomings faced by countries trying to democratise. The critics's arguments are understood. But I cannot see their rationale in continuing to harp on "each country will need to develop its own system of governance (of what or which governance).<br><br>The substance behind their contention that there is no point to discuss or there is no such thing as democracy or true democracy is not presented so far despite my repeated request.<br><br>In my opinion, true democracy may be idealistic, and different country may need to approach it from their own perspective and circumstances. Still, a basic model consisting of 7 points or certain key points can always be studied and arrived at for all nations to strive to work towards with suitable adaptation. This is a more proactive stand I believe than to say that there is no such model or the American model is too idealistic or not workable.<br><br><a href="http://www.freeimages.co.uk&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.freeimages.co.uk<img src="http://www.btinternet.com/~fireballxl5/nature/flora/pinkflowers02573_small.jpg"></a></div>
