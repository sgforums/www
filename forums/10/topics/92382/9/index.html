Like branding or advertisement. Many people are resigned to their fate that they cannot vote because of engineered walkovers.<br><br>For the beneficiaries and youths with the right connections or the right paper qualifications, good luck to them. They are assured of recognition and comfortable life ahead. They will be invited to tea and joint as MP. For the majority, no body knows whether there is a future here with the one-party dominant rule not producing any new solutions to solve their most serious problems - earning a living or be able to survive on lower pays and high costs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But will I vote for them? Not as long as they produce brutes like Chee Soon Juan and loose cannons like JBJ. I respect people who respect other people. If the opposition could produce more people like Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Khiang who behave like gentlemen, I'm sure more people would be willing to consider voting for them.<br><br>I do believe it's an uphill task for the opposition. It's akin to a SMB vying for a piece of the market dominated by a monopoly. Just think about it in terms of PAP being Microsoft and the opposition being every other software company. Unless PAP is broken up ala Microsoft in Europe, it's almost impossible for the opposition to get a bigger piece of the political pie. It's just the way things work. But is it PAP's fault for being good at what they do? Are they obligated to "give chance" to the opposition? Hell, don't blame the PAP, blame ourselves for not voting for a weak opposition!</div>

He's not. It's like comparing apples and oranges. He has a limited executive role. That's the way the constitution set it up to be. There are several "No 2 guys" in our executive structure each designated different roles. You've got you deputy prime ministers. And then you've got your senior minister and now your minister mentor. So it's really not so easy to identify a "No 2 guy." In any case though, the president is by no means that.<br><br>As for choosing our prime minister. We did. His name was Goh Chok Tong. He stepped down before his term ended and appointed someone to take over him. The Constitution allows him to do that. PM Lee Hsien Loong has a mandate only to serve out SM Goh's remaining term. After that (or before that actually), he will have to call for elections.<br><br>And regarding voting for president Nathan, we didn't for the very simple reason that no one was eligible to run against him.<br><br>PS: Oh my gosh!

If I like neither "Republican" nor "Democrat", who is there to vote for?  In Singapore, it's simply a case of I don't like the "PAP".  The point is that even in the UK, I don't feel that there's much political choice in terms of partisan landscape.  Most of the policies are along the same line, the mere difference is in micromanagement, in the personnel/views of the leadership.  Much of it however, is already set in stone.  Western democracy is slow and beauracratic, no one can compete with the political oligopolies just as no one in S'pore can compete with the PAP.  You're not fighting for a significant degree of choice, at best the system gives you one or maybe two contendable oppositions.  It is not necessarily competitive governance because all 2/3 could be roughly on par &amp; incompetent in performance.  No one in the UK can rescue Britain's NHS, its pension scheme, the education level or the social problems.  Choice does not guarantee competitiveness, but it does guarantee dissension.<br><br><blockquote>QUOTE: "A simple question.  Is Singapore even large enough for such a blueprint system of democracy?

The point is that you have a political celebrity who has attained a status equivalent to a "Mahatma Ghandi" in India, a "Nelson Mandela" in Africa, a "George Washington" in America...  We are talking about "Lee Kuan Yew" in Singapore.  Who can challenge his image?  Everyone knows that the PAP is overwhelmingly strong in the bask of his shadow.<br><br>If however, you question the government's talent base.  I can say that I've seen the selection process of talent in the US and the UK.  The UK's is far inferior to Singapore's process, the USA's is slightly better, but only just.  Whilst it's true that a very narrowed vision gets filtered successfully through, to classify amongst S'pore's political echelons, at the same time the selection is not based upon background, or money, or social status (perhaps save for any Lee members).  This however, is a much more serious, and apathetically alienating process in Western democracies.<br><br><blockquote><br>Reply:" Personality cult will not sustain the Singapore once-successful economic strategy largely put together by Dr. Goh Keng Swee and his team.

The point is that the pace of globalisation &amp; competitiveness has increased in alacrity.  The economic strategy put together back in the 70s-80s was something done by learning from other nations' industrial progress.  Today's politicians need to improvise, recalibrate the target sectors, and reform the industries.  However no one has these anwers.  Opening up the political landscape will probably not produce a "Goh Keng Swee" team.

Size is one factor.  Countries such as the UK, France and Finland have become too beauracratic because of their size for centralisation.  Decentralization can barely register benefits in Singapore.  There aren't many constituencies, there aren't many schools, or universities...there aren't even that many MRT stops.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, Diesel.okini,<br><br>QUOTE: "The point is that these choices are highly restrictive and do not really reflect any genuine political diversity. If I like neither "Republican" nor "Democrat", who is there to vote for? In Singapore, it's simply a case of I don't like the "PAP". The point is that even in the UK, I don't feel that there's much political choice in terms of partisan landscape. Most of the policies are along the same line, the mere difference is in micromanagement, in the personnel/views of the leadership. Much of it however, is already set in stone. Western democracy is slow and beauracratic, no one can compete with the political oligopolies just as no one in S'pore can compete with the PAP. You're not fighting for a significant degree of choice, at best the system gives you one or maybe two contendable oppositions. It is not necessarily competitive governance because all 2/3 could be roughly on par &amp; incompetent in performance. No one in the UK can rescue Britain's NHS, its pension scheme, the education level or the social problems. Choice does not guarantee competitiveness, but it does guarantee dissension. "<br><br>REPLY: "I think it is rather hypocritical to say that Singapore cannot or cannot afford to have a shadow cabinet or diversity of political parties for choice because of its population size and in the next breath to quickly condemn or belittle any alternative parties like Republican or Democrat in existence as restrictive.

"<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>QUOTE: "A simple question. Is Singapore even large enough for such a blueprint system of democracy? When will we actually see a shadow cabinet? Or the resources/ability of the opposition to compete on a popular scale with the PAP? Getting grassroots support, etc? If you ask me, the only window of opportunity that the political opposition have in Singapore, is that the people seriously become discontent. And even then, they may still keep faith with the government that has led them for over 20 years. Loyalty to Lee Kuan Yew's party is emphatic, the Minister Mentor is a personality cult.<br><br>Reply: Singapore cannot evolve to be a participative democracy featuring a shadow cabinet because of top-down and manipulative governance shutting out participation by people of talents and abilities in the past 40 years. The lack of institutionalized participation by masses was not of people's making or due to size of the country. Defamation law suits and GRC obstacles are enough to stifle the growth of participative democracy".<br><br>YOUR Response to my reply: "You have not answered the question.

No one can challenge the PAP whilst LKY lives, and for a significant period (several generations) after his demise. For all the weaknesses and faults I find in Singapore's political system, there are few people of the 20th century who I would truly consider as great men. Lee Kuan Yew is one of them. Whilst it is important to remain objective towards the principles of national government, the minds of Singapore will undoubtedly be guided by their reverence for Singapore's "father". Even in Western democracy, how can ANYONE ever hope to compete with such a distinguised &amp; remarkable leader?

If you're talking about knowledge-based economies, academic learning is very much linked to work competency.  If you ask me, you're missing the point.  Using academic grades is a universal transparent selection process.  It means anyone from any background has the chance to shine.  It breaks the aristocratic/imperialist longevity of Western democracies.  Sure, you have an elite in Singapore, but their children may not necessarily remain amongst the top niche of society.  This is social mobility, and allows for capable individuals to push towards the top.<br>Going for a practical-application style is not entirely effective with respect to looking for political leaders from the whole of society.  I agree that there should be other parameters considered, but they are ancilliary with the current process.  First you screen the capable individuals, based upon academic learning &amp; other activities.  You give them interviews, case studies, group exercises, competency-based tests, IQ &amp; EQ evaluation, personality tests, etc.  Within the organisation itself, ie the PAP, you then look at the practical application.  That is how businesses recruit/reward their graduates... looking at their grades first for selection, and then performance for promotion.  The Singaporean government is basically a dynamic business.  EQ is something few Singaporeans have at all, and is indeed important.  If you're talking about political roles, both are vital, neither is more crucial than the other.  It would merely mean an add-on to the current selection process, not an actual shift in principle.<br><br><blockquote>According to the series of researches made, it has been found that IQ accounted for success in possibly up to 25 % of cases.

Hence I don't believe the selection is entirely IQ-correlated.  Practical application means understanding and better intuition of the role.  The way the government works, is it sources the world for examples/case-studies of past enterprises.  They look at the world's medical services/systems to shape medical policy, they look at the world's transport systems to decide upon the technology, considerations, pricing schemes, etc.  A lot of what you say is very much presumption and is not entirely guaranteed to materialise as a better principle/system.  They should be considered, as we need to keep open towards change, however I'm not sure that your dismissal of the current system is the best judgment.

Entrepreneurs are few and far between, in any industry.  They are not chosen, they cannot be chosen, they simply flourish in their natural ability.  Whilst it's true that you must not suppress the mass's business instincts, you must still maintain the idea of competitiveness.  The academic area is just another training ground for competition.  Pro-foreign investment policies result in severe difficulties when there are global downturns.  The interdependence of Singapore's economy means that if the world index goes up, Singapore goes up.  If the world index goes down, Singapore goes down.  As someone geared towards finance/investment, I believe that one should not "peg" their performance to the indicies.  That is a display of mediocrity, they should aim to outperform the market.  This means putting together a large combination of various business/investment strategies, trying not to go overweight in your asset allocation so that you become overly dependent on any one thing for a particularly long period.  The main thing is to have bottom-up strengths in your economy, to make sure it stays up even when others are down.  Uncorrelate yourself from the world index, so when others make losses, you can bank on certain strengths or hedge your position to see that your assets don't lose value.  Yet such principles are so dynamic that it's nigh impossible for a government to implement.  There is a limit to the level of dynamicism a government can have in its policy, based upon the objectives of government and the need for stability.</div>
