            <div class='col-md body'>Many problems have been caused by the past academic and grade-driven education policy.<br><br>As a result of such a narrow education policy, the country is suffering from a gradual loss of economic competitiveness to neighbouring and other Asian countries to date.<br><br>The lack of emphasis on broad-based education has led to a drop in producing a truly entrepreneurial economy. Entrepreneurs are short in supply<br><br>Such narrow education policy which emphasises on academic grades has been achieved at the expense of practical knowledge application or pursuit of capabilities and excellence in every field.<br><br>This fact of our lack of economic competitiveness is clearly seen from the quality and ability of our graduates in entering into businesses and starting up their own companies. It can also be verified from the fact that during the last two economic recessions, our many scholars were found totally helpless in rescuing the economy except to blame it on the external factors.<br><br>Thus there are many problems with our education system - overemphasising on academic attainments. Dr. Tony Tan has gone on a trip recently to Europe to study their broad-based education policies there. How do they produce capable knowledge applicators in all engineering and technology areas.

(i seldom comment on one-liners, esp. if they are greetings.)<br><br>2) what you state is not only unique to Singapore.<br><br>3) I have no illusions about the simplicity/ complexity of designing an education system. I have figured out that my [intellectual] Order of Education Act might have at least 150 articles, which makes it about as long as the Constitution, okay, perhaps slightly shorter only. However, I wish to caution you about talking about "direction". The problem with such a pathway is that it gives telescopic vison only; there are multiple paths education has to travel, because of the varied nature of both knowledge and experience. And now in an Information Age, new discoveries in various different fields occur simultaneously, and thus any teaching component of an education system will have to have room for all these discoveries. If it chooses to telescope in one area, say Enginerring, as Robert suggested earlier, then it will be able to be proficient in that area, but only that area, and will lag behind in other fields. Thus, we do not just need "some" sorts of people; we need all sorts of people.<br><br>Ashby's First Law of Cybernetics states that for every slave system of a certain complexity, in order to control it appropriately, you need a control system of equal or more complexity; this is also called the law of Requisite Variety. So in the case of the teaching component of education, the system of knowledge dissemination is the control system, and huge quantities of knowledge to be taught is the slave system. because knowledge is so varied, the knowledge dissemination system needs to be equally as varied.<br><br>The argument i find most flawed in this paragraph is the one which states that "all the respective subjects must be handled correctly". what is correct? That changes as time goes by, and there is henceforth no guarantee that one method firmly ingrained in one system will remain adequate for the    rest of eternity. Look at Singapore, with the China-style Chinese Textbook system; even the govt realizes that that has to change, and henceforth you have modular Chinese. Thus, what we need is a system that is dynamic, so that the only cosntant thing about the system is its capacity to accomodate change. And to do that effectively, we need decentralization, to prevent the Ivory Tower Syndrome, where information gets progressivley summarized to the point where those at the top receive only a broad outline of the situation, and henceforth cannot respond with the requisite variety desired.<br><br>4) haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> guess why the Act I'm (intellectually) proposing is called the "Order of Education" Act?<br><br>5) like I told you, mine is an intellectual experiment obviously, since our quasi-autocratic and pseudo-democratic government will possibly not want to abandon their precious age-old tenets. ah well...<br><br>6) I agree only to a certain extent. Not everything needs to be tailored toward commercial interests. This is exactly waht we have done for the last 40 years, and look at the socia cost incurred from that: unfeeling teachers, teh society that chases after 5Cs, students who commit suicide because they can't face life's pressures, horrendous elitism which the PM still has the cheek to praise, schools denying pupils entry based on arbritrary criteria just in order to allow themselves to obtain Excellence Awards from MOE, "Taupok", certain CCAs being discriminated because they are non-sporty, SPorts School denying entry to excellent sportsmen just becasue their academic grades are good, then lamely giving the excuse that "holistic development'" is wanted, the recent bungle-up of the "O"-Level JAE system, etcetc. So we have a top-notch economy in the world, but do we have a top-notch society?  All the examples I provided above are absolutely true; you can go and check news archives of ST, TODAY, TNP, AFP, or the STAR. And no, I am strongly opposed toward the construction of the casino. In fact, even the misguided decision to build teh casino stems from teh weakness of an education system which capitalizes on commercial (economic) interests so much, it degrades other areas.<br><br>7) I think you have been partially brainwashed by YP already. The phrase "uniqueness of Singapore"  is a subtle piece of propaganda to justify what otherwise cannot be justified, like controls on the press adn the streaming system which My new (intellectual) Order of Education Act shall abolish. in fact, interestingly, if you were to do actual comparison, the uniqueness of our education system pales in comaprison to Norway. So there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I agree with you here.<br><br>9) Don't be too hasty to judge GMS, but I concur with your opinion of Chia Li Tik. Do an email discussion with GMS, and you will find tha this style of discussion will be quite like yours, with a few lapses of course. Hey, even you have lapses.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>10) That is always a fear when you have at least a quasi-autocratic government around. That's why after finishing my OEA, I am going to re-work (intellectually) the Defamation Act and the ISA.  Anyway, I hope your view of poor leadership is not one-sided. Seriously. PAP claimed most of its victories, if you can even call them that, in walkover constituencies last election, so there is no real consensus that their leadership model is approved by the citizens. And obviously, we have some very inept leaders in govt like Vivian Balakrishnan; just see how he handled the casino issue with his pathetic maturity argument. *sigh* With regards to leadership, I share the same sentiments as you do.<br><br>11) Now I find that strange.... what do you favour then if you favour neither democract nor autocracy? there seems to really be nth else. perhaps you could enlighten me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>12) Just read, and scan out the main points. I'm like you; I really don't like chunky stuff either, so I'm reading it little by little. But I did skim through and got a general picture of what Monkey was saying.<br><br>13) Switzerland? Don't worry, I am proposing (intellectually) something completely new. It won't exist anywhare else in the world, not even in Switzerland, although it builds upon the Swiss model. But it will be what I would consider integrated thinking-out-of-the-box.<br><br>14) Crush? Why should there be one? The point of having EP is to separate out Education from the main government, to achieve a form of administrative decentralization. It is meant to be totally different.<br><br>...to be continued</div>

Accordingly, won't it be more logical going by your concern that we make everyone learn everything so as not to lag behind other fields?<br><br>If you are telling me you are talking about the relevant fields, or something as such, I'm gonna ask you are you soon the you can know which is relevant and which is not to every single (say) chemist-to-be?<br><br><blockquote>            Ashby's First Law of Cybernetics states that for every slave system of a certain complexity, in order to control it appropriately, you need a control system of equal or more complexity; this is also called the law of Requisite Variety. So in the case of the teaching component of education, the system of knowledge dissemination is the control system, and huge quantities of knowledge to be taught is the slave system. because knowledge is so varied, the knowledge dissemination system needs to be equally as varied.</blockquote>I only know that sort of law which focuses on system helps little.<br><br>The case of the education system is pretty simple, that in Asia, it has been a screwed system all along. And when foreign interest thinned, rusted screws shown loose.<br><br>You see, Pikamaster, we cannot see education as a form of system and yet also wants it to applies flexibly to time and individual. That's a big mistake. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Frankly speaking, I don't mind you go ahead and carry on your idea, seriously.

That changes as time goes by, and there is henceforth no guarantee that one method firmly ingrained in one system will remain adequate for the    rest of eternity. Look at Singapore, with the China-style Chinese Textbook system; even the govt realizes that that has to change, and henceforth you have modular Chinese. Thus, what we need is a system that is dynamic, so that the only cosntant thing about the system is its capacity to accomodate change. And to do that effectively, we need decentralization, to prevent the Ivory Tower Syndrome, where information gets progressivley summarized to the point where those at the top receive only a broad outline of the situation, and henceforth cannot respond with the requisite variety desired.</blockquote>Alright. Don't mind tell you. I have once suggested a manner to teach Chinese as a subject. It's however, one of the very small minor component, though I have commented the manner cannot be used on English teaching.<br><br>Now put it this way, just as subjects and dealing with the entire Education as a whole, it requires very wise thinking in the first place. Your mentioning of what Chinese-style <span style="font-style: italic;">system</span> is merely just emphasizing a copycat-mentality, which is exactly why I can comfortably tell Singapore it's gonna be pretty stuck in such sphere of stuckar-ness.<br><br>I need to point out about decentralisation.

Look at the standards. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Put it this way, Education is not so simple. But I encourage people to go ahead and try whatever they can think of, to show the problems of the education on these people. Many are talking of thinking out of the box, for eg, but if you really observe, we are really going to get out of many boxes but only to be ignorant of the bigger box. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>          4) haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> guess why the Act I'm (intellectually) proposing is called the "Order of Education" Act?</blockquote>I stupid, hahaha... can tell me?<br><br><blockquote>          5) like I told you, mine is an intellectual experiment obviously, since our quasi-autocratic and pseudo-democratic government will possibly not want to abandon their precious age-old tenets. ah well... </blockquote>Well... ...

Not everything needs to be tailored toward commercial interests. This is exactly waht we have done for the last 40 years, and look at the socia cost incurred from that: unfeeling teachers, teh society that chases after 5Cs, students who commit suicide because they can't face life's pressures, horrendous elitism which the PM still has the cheek to praise, schools denying pupils entry based on arbritrary criteria just in order to allow themselves to obtain Excellence Awards from MOE, "Taupok", certain CCAs being discriminated because they are non-sporty, SPorts School denying entry to excellent sportsmen just becasue their academic grades are good, then lamely giving the excuse that "holistic development'" is wanted, the recent bungle-up of the "O"-Level JAE system, etcetc. So we have a top-notch economy in the world, but do we have a top-notch society?  All the examples I provided above are absolutely true; you can go and check news archives of ST, TODAY, TNP, AFP, or the STAR. And no, I am strongly opposed toward the construction of the casino. In fact, even the misguided decision to build teh casino stems from teh weakness of an education system which capitalizes on commercial (economic) interests so much, it degrades other areas.</blockquote>Emm... Put it this way, a person needs monies so as that of a nation needs to get financed.<br><br>If we can offer a good industry, a hook-line, why not?<br><br>Yeah... I agree Education shouldn't be all about monies, but that's idealistic. We have too look at the more realistic side of things. Even the Casino. I can't just be too idealistic on national issues, see? Anyway, congrats, you belongs to the majority of the population it so seems on this Casino issue.<br><br>The misguided Education is not mainly because it's due to commercial.

Yes, obviously, we need to know what is relevant to the chemists, and yes, the system  will accomodate that.

In a modern world such as this, our chemist will not just need to know pure chemistry. he would need to have at least a cursory understanding of engineering and biology, economics, IT and obviously mathematics. Why Engineering? Because modern-day chemistry uses machines and to understand how machines work, you need to know basic engineering. WHy biology? Chemicals have an impact on the environment. Why Economics? the chemist needs to make money, duh. Why IT? COmputer software, such as molecular-modelling software is becoming more and more frequent, and is essential in micro-study of chemistry. As for literature and history and geography, these are not essential for the field of chemistry by itself, but are essential in helping the chemist as a person to relate to other people in his social environment.

So as you can see, all areas of knowledge are crucial to a person's development, whatever his/her profession might be.<br><br>3) errr... when you say "screaming with red-alert again", do you mean the situation that will exist if my system is implemented or my system is not implemented?<br><br>4) Nope, Britain is just as centralized as Singapore; its system is a 300 year-old system.

But anyway, an Iranian Professor with quite an extensive set of credentials came to speak at my school today. I asked him whether the current global problems were caused  more by the quality of the international systems or of the people managing  them. His reply was an integrated one: The core of the global problems rests in lack of understanding between different groups of people, and these are reflected both in the existent international systems and the attitudes/quality of the people running and managing these institutions. Thus, none is more important than the other; both are merely different faces of the same box, if we are to use that analogy.<br><br>And that was precisely my argument from the start of this discussion.: Poor people can ruin good systems, but poor systems can ruin good people too.

And you are getting a 8 in it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Alright, kidding lah.<br><br>You see, where the magnitudes and similarities would end here, the system is still a system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  And what'd a system produce?

Are you going to blame inept leadership in MOE? Students? Parents' unrealistic expectations? 'Cos all these were caused by the education system in the first place.</blockquote>Honestly, I can't blame the old system for its credits till the mid 80s. But, to my horror, it goes on to produce and (allow, hence to) reinforce itself since. And not hard to expect, our edge gone horrendously since the late 90s, where in fact, commercial rubbish and trash events shoot and junks (and such events) got legitimate. with little or not resistance. When people ain't thinking, you can throw yourself to death and expect people expect you to condemn on your corpse.<br><br>In one way, you are right. But I rather see it as problem arising due to the fact that Singapore is damn young and small and real talents to handle events/decisions kinda lag in the push to mass produce paper-talents. Even in China, how many Confucius-s or Sun Tzu would exist among the billions of people in any point of time? Not to consider Singapore is only this small.<br><br>It's still the people, not the system. But it's not really wrong here for you to blame the system. After all, throughout history, systems are made to simplistically (or politically speaking: professionally designed) assign and function. And historically, people know system can't be trusted, especially in the long run, but yet systems always are allowed to rust and create (often self-stuckar) problems.<br><br>In a tight situation, it's gonna be something entangled with something else. So in this era, in such moments, we can only trust good people.<br><br><blockquote>It is idealistic to say that education should be not about money at all, but it is still practical to say that education should not JUST be about money. I mean, that is still one of the slogans (mis)used by the MOE: holistic edcuation. Holistic education is not idealistic; it is practical. Make no mistake.</blockquote>Well... Your fees need fundings, the schools need funding, the teachers (at least most) can't even travel to the class without paying tribute to MOT, your materials needs monies, and your time is money.

And holistic what has nothing to do with the issue in concern cos a nation, and hence it's services to the people by the people, is still needing funding. There's nothing to balance here, actually. Though it's nothing big deal to use balance.

Too be a political leader or/and a leader of the people, one of the basic quality is credibility.

His reply was an integrated one: The core of the global problems rests in lack of understanding between different groups of people, and these are reflected both in the existent international systems and the attitudes/quality of the people running and managing these institutions. Thus, none is more important than the other; both are merely different faces of the same box, if we are to use that analogy.<br><br>And that was precisely my argument from the start of this discussion.: Poor people can ruin good systems, but poor systems can ruin good people too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>I agree that Singapore itself is unique' - so unqiue that its high-profile leaders and talents all fizzled out helplessly throughout the last two prolonged recessions blaming all the problems on structural unemployments and world economic downturns.<br><br>Well sooner or later the worse world economy ought to turn around some days. What is unique is that as soon as it does, Singapore's leaders would be doubly quick in claiming victory of past policies without being too concerned with past problems.<br><br>Here is a list of past problems uniquely Singapore too since you keep singling out uniqueness factor to the disregard of alternatives of success.<br><br>(1) A Tax-and-recover system of governance<br>(2) Double charge citizens on acquired lands paid for under taxations<br>(3) Triple Charge on vehicle (Excise, COE and ERP)<br>(4) Promising a Swiss standard of living that never was.<br>(5) GRC to encumber free electoral process and changing electoral boundaries<br>(6) Growth triangle that doesn't grow<br>(7) Investing of taxpayers' funds in foreign investments to create employments for foreigners without vital accountable disclosures.<br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Self-recommendation and self-voting of minsters' pay increases<br>(9) Mixing up election speeches with civil defamation.<br>(10) Head-on Competing for business pies against citizens<br>(11) Tripartised unionism that demand workers' sacrifices to no end.<br>(12) Corporatisation of essential services to save government costs<br>(13) Paing World's Highest ministers with hardly any accountable processes.<br>(14) Inviting debates on major issue but taking of votes in parliament<br>(15) Educational policy aims at producing graded scholars for political control.<br>(16) Collapses and accidents without public accountability<br>(17) Showing of accolades of anything foreigners to no end.<br>(1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> High costs of living affecting business vibrancy and 90% of the people.<br>(19) Upgrading flats for those who voted for the party in power.<br>(20) Allowing street rally to foreigners while threatening to jail locals for doing same.<br><br>In addition, there is a particular uniqueness in producing cademic and general graduates without relevance to future emconomy - probably for political control purpose.<br><br>Over-emphasis in meritocracy has resulted in general neglect in broad-based practical education to nurture future entrepreneurs to create employments.<br><br>Yes it may be more difficult to create a ommon knowledge base to make education more flexible to meet future demands in the job markets. But what is so difficult to set direction for practically broadly based education.<br><br>Even if it is a difficult move, at least take a look around. Be open minded. You will see many past office workers and middle managers who are trained in general busines administrators or even accountants or lawyers may be fast getting outdated. Many existing awyers are becoming redundant. Nearly all cases of disputes are being referred for settlements. New factories do not need so many generalists as engineers or technologists who are widely trained.<br><br>What Singapore of the future needs in large numbers are entrepreneurs of all kinds especially in technological areas. Why? The future businesses are more technological, resource-based, advanced and diversified in regard to engineering and application.<br><br>Is clinging on to the past merticracy like a political philosophy any good? What are badly needed are entrepreneurs of the technological and engineering fields. Do we still need so many general professions or academics? If they are why are so many general and academic graduates unemployed, under-employed or taking a long time to seek employment? Is this fact not enough to tell the educationists that producing more academics is a major mistake in education?<br><br>Is these past courses called top-standard education?<br><br>Whether 50%? 99% or 0% of the existing courses should be taught in common engineering or technological bases may be a difficult question. At least, do not politicise meitocracy and be practical. Set a certain new direction  in education and do not become the ostriches of the future, buried in sand and too myopic to see other realities.<br><br>Teaching at universities is generally ten years behind actual progress in each field. Application should therefore be the gist of education and not knowledge for knowledge sake. Past success is no guarantee for future performance.<br><br>May be the current education establishments or practitioners are too complacent or too afraid to offend their political masters well-known to emphasise their pet view about meritocracy.<br><br>Is allowing wide-ranging subjects and interests to be taught in schools anti-meritocracy? Is not broad-based education even more meritocratic? Is that not being more relevant to their cultivating entrepreneurship that counts for their future survival.<br><br>Right now education is largely grade or image-driven. The name is good when somebody is produced as a scholars. It is too political too and too narrow. Graduates of the future should tell the difference that they are highly effective in use and employment of technology to renew Singapore political and economic survival. What is wrong with such a broad-based vision?<br><br>A good broad-based education should consist of basic engineering management and laws etc with a balance of 50% to be kept flexible to meet market demand. Advanced countries do offer good experiences in broad-bsed education. They are nurturing Entrepreneurs through schools and universities preparing students to stay relevant and alert to what is happening in the market places. Practitioners should come in to offer practical knowledge applications in all areas to prepare students to excel in future business set-ups and starts-up and knowledge applications.<br><br>Broad-based education can nurture creativity and a more liberal, analytical thinking in the students as pointed out in another perspective by Pikamaster.<br><br>While it is well and good to produce scholars and academics, over-commercialism will ruin education. I agree with Pikamaster too on this observation. Obviously the current meritocracy is too steeped in political control.<br><br>Meritocracy of the old emphasising on grades alone is too narrow. In the 80s. it was good to use it as a general slogan to rally the masses to make them supportive of governmet.<br><br>Today, with fast accelerating technologies, newer talents of the practical kinds in all fields are badly needed to make the whole economy competitive and vibrant.<br><br>If Singapore is going to stay competitive as it was in the 1970s, then talents must be wider in meaning as well as practicality. It certainly should not be limited to grades or paper-talents based on certain subjects.<br><br>Especially true in the case of Singapore because it is too small a country to compete on excellence.<br><br>Do not hedge the issue or deny problems with the past meritocracy or education policy. It has served well up to a point but after that it has lost out to others.<br><br>In a tight situation, we cannot keep believing in general academics but more diversified and adaptable technological education that will prepare students to become technopreneurs of the future. Such technopreneurs then will be the good people you have mentioned.<br><br>In the new world, leaders are still important. More likely applications of technologlies will take centre-stage with new leaders not of the same kinds who only talks about ideas and concepts. New leaders should be people who are keenly aware of all nuances of harnessing new ideas and new technologies but sadly only a few of such leaders are being produced in our education system.<br><br>MM Lee was a great leaders of ideas and persuasions up to a point. Beyond a certain points, implementation breaks down.<br><br>That was the point requiring greater leadership - implementation. Implementation depends greatly on coordination and knowledge application by all. This is not happening very well in areas of entrepreneurship and innovations.<br><br>It is too that credibility is an important ingredient but not the only ingredient.<br><br>The 20 unsolved problems as posted is one measure of credibility. Because of lack of implementation ability there is a gap in credibility.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>1) What size are you referring to? Population or physical?<br><br>For population: Finalnd and New Zealand and Denmark, which are actually better off in development than Singapore.<br><br>For physical: none (measuring development as GDP)<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>2) An exact answer is not possible, since the 95% would differ between different people.

I assume you are talking about the problem of unlimited wants. Well, everybody will end up prioritising wants sometime or other, so that should not really be a problem. The point of the system will be to expose students to the large variety of areas so that they can better make an informed choice of what niche to go to.<br><br>What the system aims to avoid is the case of an exclusive niche, whereby the student only knows information from his/her own specialist field, and henceforth, during working-life, fails to see impact of a decision s/he makes on another area.<br><br>In fact, it is common knowledge that many universities now offer combined degrees and minor degrees. This is to ensure multi-disciplianary training for students, essentially what my new system aims to do. So, in a way, the new system is simply synchronizing the universities with the rest of the system.<br><br>The difference is that the new system's multidisciplinary feature will be extended to everybody, not just those with the supposed "ability", as in a meritocratic system such as currently exists here.<br><br>I expect the key question would be: can the people cope? Because of the tiered-modular system for extension modules, i.e. as in M&amp;M, that will effectively weed out those who cannot cope, as they will probably not want to proceed with something that is too hard to handle, and thus as we go progressively up the hierarchy of levels, less and less people will end up in those levels, and finally the highest levels will be your so-called professional levels at University, and only those with extreme fanatic passion, or who are extremely able (considering the existence of utilitarians in our society), will pursue these level 13 and above modules. teh benefit though, will be that at least the student would ahve covered the lower levels in this area, so s/he is not very far behind in the basic knowledge; technical knowledge though, he wouldn't know. But at least, when time requires, and believe me it will, this person at least has enough basic knowledge to query an expert and will not be exactly left in the dark, or be misled by experts' lies, eg. like in MOE's case recently. More importantly, a top-down approach from "expert" to "lay(wo)man" will no longer be required, as active engagement is possible, albeit on a limited scale.<br><br>So I don't actually see what problem the niche poses. Could you enlighten me?<br><br>4) Well, one of the core aspects of the syllabus will be to teach people how to think, so your question is irrelevant.<br><br>And as I have proved to you, every area of knowledge is relevant to a person's life.<br><br>5) ok, I get your point.<br><br>Actually, I was beginning to refer to the administrative structure. Our entire discussion so far has been focused exclusively on the syllabus, but that is but one part of the entire system, albeit a significant one. The new system will also involve new adminsitrative structures such as the Wages Council and the  EP (to which the age restriction of 18 yrs applies).<br><br>Actually, I believe that this new system for pri. and sec. schools can still meld quite well with the exsiting tertiary institutions.<br><br>6) kk.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>7) Don't get you here...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> treating me as an inferior person to you. we are supposed to be having this discussion as equals.<br><br>9) yes, I agree. But I don't like the fact that humans are classified only as "resources", and that the sentient aspect is casually disregarded. In fact, much of the courage of the Ruling Party in its decisive policy making has come from treating humans as mere economic units, and that I strongly oppose.<br><br>Ya, see how much the reality differs from the official rhetoric of "promoting diversity"?<br><br>10) In Summary:<br><br>public schools - by Whitehall<br><br>Grammar Schools and Unviersities - by themselves and their students.<br><br>But let's stop talking about England, ok?<br><br>That's what I don't understand about the "unique SIngapore" argument. The users of it often unknowingly contradict themselves when they justify policies by comparing SIngapore to other favourable countries. If Singapore is like those countries eg. England, how can we call it unique?<br><br>11) I'm not suggesting toying with anybody... hey, this is a minor personal attack, not jsut against me, but against Mr [Steve} Chia too.<br><br>12) sure:-<br><br>You see, where the magnitudes and similarities would end here, the system is still a system.

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>1) Not really much of a problem. Can have a budget session for EP, where all the various ministers are invited.<br><br>Or of course, we can have just financial matters being presented by the Coordinator in main Parliament, having him debate in  Parliament over the funds required for education.<br><br>EP will function within those financial limits.<br><br>As for the issue of the incumbent, I have already acknowledged that while it is around, my new system can never be implemented becasue of its intertia.<br><br>For any future discussion thus, may we remove the incumbent from the equation?<br><br>Anyway, the OEA does not come alone. It comes as a plugin to a new Constitution, which contains a rather different political structure than  the current one. For example, a tricameral legislative, consisting of the House of Miscellaneous, the House of Industry and the House of Education. The House of Education will house EP, the House of Industry will be the version of EP for SEF and NTUC (newly-independent), with some tweaks to account for the dichotomy between workers and employers, even SME employers. The House of the Miscellaneous will consist of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Communication and Commnity Development, The Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Health (regrettably) and the Ministry of the Miscelleaneous and obviously the other MPs. The last will handle events that suddenly pop out of nowhere, like SARS or the Asian Economic Crisis, and other thematic issues, such as developing sports in Singapore. For the former, it will coordinate the other ministries in what needs to be done i.e issue directives. Each House will have its own elections, and will be kept separate from each other, unless expressly necessary to provide intervention.<br><br>2) On the contrary. My purpose in doing this is precisely to downgrade the political importance of education. Education, in my opinion, should not be based on government propaganda, like our current SS textbooks, but on objective dissemination of knowledge. Education should be severed completely from the political interests of any party, as only the students' interests and that of the teachers, which interact with the students and provide the medium through which knowledge is thought, should be paramount in any education system.<br><br>3) As far as I see it, it is common sense: who knows what the root requires better than the root itself? So I shall have to politely request that you qualify your "anti-relevance" claim. Sorry.<br><br>the (partially confused) pikamaster</div>

This will encourage more people to come forward to stand for election. The two votes essentially will result in a strong party being returned to govern with some other voted in to serve as a check.<br><br>It will be a win-win voting system where the dominant party will be returned without freak elections due to fear of oppositions not being able to get in under due to one-party domination. Secondly minor parties stand a better chance to get some candidates in to serve the purpose of check without all the elaborative and pretentious nominated or non-constituent MPs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Wants may be unlimited, but if you think, you'd realise that some wants are definite and some ain't.

Because of the tiered-modular system for extension modules, i.e. as in M&amp;M, that will effectively weed out those who cannot cope, as they will probably not want to proceed with something that is too hard to handle, and thus as we go progressively up the hierarchy of levels, less and less people will end up in those levels, and finally the highest levels will be your so-called professional levels at University, and only those with extreme fanatic passion, or who are extremely able (considering the existence of utilitarians in our society), will pursue these level 13 and above modules. teh benefit though, will be that at least the student would ahve covered the lower levels in this area, so s/he is not very far behind in the basic knowledge; technical knowledge though, he wouldn't know. But at least, when time requires, and believe me it will, this person at least has enough basic knowledge to query an expert and will not be exactly left in the dark, or be misled by experts' lies, eg. like in MOE's case recently. More importantly, a top-down approach from "expert" to "lay(wo)man" will no longer be required, as active engagement is possible, albeit on a limited scale. </blockquote>Nope, Pikamaster, the key question is what about the rest?

And more dangerously, it can become a kind of wall to shield ourselves from teh outside world, the same way that papal infailiability doctrine has becoem a fortress for the Roman Catholic Church (and btw, I'm Roman Catholic myself) , such that even now the Vatican uses it as  front against protests against conservatism in the Church. And that seems to be exactly what Singapore is doing. Our alleged "uniqueness" has become a horrid veneer which the government uses as a fortress against "attacks" on its authority from the outside, whether local or foreign. Increasingly, the govenrment's arguments utilizing this "uniqueness" element have become flawed, because they fail to provide any other evidence other than this for that.<br><br>"Uniqueness" is an argument with much emotional appeal, but like any other emotional appeal, it lacks rational thought.<br><br>2) You try to elevate yourself on a pedestal and look down to me from there, but as far as I see, you still haven't given me a proper explanation for which I can use to debunk my own arguments. You call me naiive and ignorant, but doesn't teh fact that you haven't yet responded with a proper set of explanation that I can understand (since I appear to be very lost) show that you too, are somewhat ignorant yourself?<br><br>And I shall make it clear, your position isn't enhanced by requests from you to ask me to meet you at YP.<br><br>3) What is necessity? Who decides what is necessary?<br><br>Necessity is defined as the want of a majority in any grouping. Since each grouping might be in a different situation, thus situation affects necessity. For eg, a neighbourhood school might need computers but an independent school would not sicne it already has them.<br><br>The more crucial question is: who decides what is necessary? That is always the stickler point in this kind of debate, and even in moral debates, like that over euthanasia.<br><br>I believe that a person would know his needs more than anyone else around him, even his parents, if he were given all the information about his situation. In fact, I aim to make transparency one of the key features of the system I'm designing. But of course, there are certain basic needs everyone must have: education, food, water, shelter. And that will of course be provided. And these are the basic kind of necessities I suppose.<br><br>I notice that our discussion/debate/argument has moved on to contend over the type of education a person needs, particularly the scope. The scope, as I have explained earlier, will be determined by students' decision. The issue of definitive wants and non-definitive wants will self-resolve. Non-definitive wants are wants that exist okeonly temporarily, fading off for wahtever reason there is. In line with following the student's passion, the student will be allowed to drop courses s/he is not interested in, or courses that s/he used to have interest, but lost interest in, later. So, non-definitive wants will be accomodated.<br><br>Saying that "Vagueness is the way it  has to be" conveys the impression that you don't really know so much about the subject matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>4) I have told you - I'm not using loaded connotations of any word, merely using the neutral manner.<br><br>Industries do not share everything across the board, not externally at least. But at the same time, they do not share nothing at all, thus there are always stuff like joint projects between different companies, or sponsorships or something like that. For example, Software doesn't seem to ahve much to do with F&amp;B, but why then is Microsoft a stakeholder and sponsor of Coke?<br><br>Also, in an extremely interdependent world such as ours, firms increasingly have to consider more bottomlines than just one, like eg. a chemical firm has to know the environmental effects of it products. An educational firm needs to know the impact of its decisions on society i.e. what kind of people it is nurturing eg. A Northern Irish educational agency will have to ensure that its educaitonal layout does not bolster religious intolerance.<br><br>Anyway, education is not just about preparing people for a career, it's also about training them for life.<br><br>5) So what do you think are the other aspects that I have neglected? Facilities? People? All these interact with the systems. We need good initial people to run good systems, to ensure that the systems are good. But we need to produce good people from good systems too, so that the quality of the systems can be maintained, thus the system itself which is being run has to be good too.<br><br>How have I been derailed? qualify the statement please.<br><br>6) The rest? Yes, I anticipated that question.<br><br>The scenario is this currently: a student needs to get good grades in his PSLE in order to get into the SPorts School or a good Secondary School. Because favours (like integrated programmes and facilities and teachers) are given to good schools, the other schools lose out, and so only the top school students gain tremendously. What results is that at the next weeding-out-session, thsoe from the "top schools" come up top again, and sometimes we shouldn't even consider that. Since those who do extremely badly in Secondary School are forced by the system into a specific "Normal" stream, where opportunities are reduced, and not solely in the academic field, but in other stuff such as field trips etc., there is a reason for them to feel inferior and therefore  the term "losers" comes out. For example, they cannot go to the Sports School even if they are very good at sports, because the School tries to achieve "holistic development" despite the niche it has claimed for itself. So these "Normal" students have become discriminated by a system that compromises them on many opportunities that they may want because, adn solely because, of their assumed academic disability. Despite the fantastic ads put out by ITEC, even from a cursory glance at its website, you can see that it only gives courses in "technical skills" and "service skills"; clearly these do not offer very good job prospects. And the students would no doubt feel cheated (unless they are brainwashed YP pple), since they see the other better opportunities offered to their neighbours in polys or JCs. And of course, the meritocratic society is such that it awards the best jobs to those who are most academically qualified, and show, in your sense of definition, credible social aptitude. SO thus, we see the weakness.<br><br>In my system:  Every course is possible as a choice to the student, so everyone has equal footing. The student cannot blame anybody else except himself/herself if s/he does not take up a course s/he likes. In the sense, there is no such thing as "CMI" people, sicne everyone will be able to find something s/he can make it at, and achieve the best at it, whether it is art, sports, life science, econs or wahtever there is. Even if that person is just good at technical skills, at least he knows he is doing this because this is what s/he is truely good at, and not because this was the last option available to him/her. And no, I do not look down on technical skills. Everyone will have their won niche which they can find and like, so they do not have to involuntarily condition themselves into a line they dislike, and end up to be grumpy pple like some pple around these forums.<br><br>That there are "winners" and "losers" is merely a social mindset. Tell me, is Thomas Edison a winner or a loser? In our educational terms, frankly, he is a loser.<br><br>In otehr words, there is a win-win situation for everybody, becasue everybody can find a satisfying job.<br><br>6) hmmm...<br><br>There's that suggestion that you can go and retrain, or better still, take a double degree or triple degree or something. You'll only be left with no option if you do not have grounding in the other subject areas. But that will be what the system I'm proposing gives. so the job mobility will be greater in my new system.<br><br>the neutral definition I am using for "niche" is the biological one: a role and a position for the organism [person] in a system. I'm not including any factor of uniqueness within the defintion, as you see. So the only way a niche can become outdated is if that occupation becomes a vanishing trade.<br><br>But the point is, we will always need chemists, physicists, engineers, and the like. Even if we have a fully roboticized society, we still need engineers to run the robots and direct them what to do, or to improve on the design of robots, and their functionality for certain jobs. Not that that is so likely to happen in the next century, though we must keep an open mind. Life Sciences might die out, or dot-com may crash, but still it does not mean that biologists and IT specialists are not needed.<br><br>The only real danger comes when you get an ivory-tower graduate who knows nothing but the knowledge in his field. But the precise architecture of my system aims to prevent that, so there.<br><br>And if you wish to say that I didn't understand you, please provide qualification i.e. what you actually meant in plain English.<br><br>7) Ok... I shall make it clearer... the system will aim, through the environment it provides, to nurture people that can think in every field.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Please re-think.<br><br>9) Well, if I don't get it, it's becasue you have not explained it properly enough and completely enough.<br><br>10) ???<br><br>11) Wrong. If it doesn't hit me, means that you don't understand what you claim to know fully, and hence are unable to explain to me. A great test of understanding is the ability to explain your understanding to other people who don't share the same understanding.<br><br>12) ok point taken, but perhaps you have to be a little more sensitive to waht you are writing, or sayign for the matter.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>13) Don't take my words out of context, please. I don't object to the bringing in of the concept of economic units per se, but I object to bringing it in as the overriding principle, and forgetting the humanity of the people involved as a result.<br><br>14) *sigh*... another minor personal attack...<br><br>15) My turn to ask you to think more carefully. Haha, in the same manner that you used to criticize me in the last section: It is truely unique that someone who can advise on systems theory cannot understand basic social interactions...<br><br>16) You can't explain your own text, and you expect me to understand them?<br><br>17) Be careful where you take your religious argument...we all treat our deities seriously.<br><br>My leader is someone who:<br>-looks out for the interests of others<br>-is amicable and approachable<br>-mixes well with those he leads, instead of sealing himself up in an ivory tower.<br>-in sincere in the true sense i.e. does what he promises to do and admits his weaknesses<br>-helps those he leads to resolve their conflict, without imposing his own view on them. Not imposing means not forcing them into a course of action with a "leader knows best" attitude<br><br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I number my psections for a reason, go back through each post and you'll eventually find the statement.<br><br>19) Since you're supposed to know what you're talking about, you're supposed to explain what to mean to me since I don't understand you.<br><br>20) no reply, I reminded you.<br><br>gd nite.<br><br>the pikamaster.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>[a reply to your last post abt Educational Parliament]<br><br>1) Well, ok, I agree my this suggestion wasn't very intelligent, that's why I provided the other suggestion: that the Coordinator, who will be an adult btw, will represent EP in budget sessions in the House of the Miscellaneous, to obtain the general finances for EP. He will be granted an automatic seat in the Misc House.  But that shall be his only interaction.<br><br>The Coordinator's basic fucntion is to mediate and ensure discipline in the House. He will be aided by the House Guard.<br><br>Education is not equal to one person please; it's an entire system.<br><br>2) Not if it is part of the Constitution, which obviously it shall be. the Constitution is the highest law. Nobody can violate it, or amend it, under the new provisions of the Permanent Law Act .<br><br>The Coordinator will be actively involved in the Budget Debate, having to account for the funds he requires against the other (adult) MPs.<br><br>And you should not speculate about what will ahppen when the oppo coems into power, because they are not in power yet.<br><br>3) I'm not assuming a government-less era. I told you to remove the incumbent from the equation becasue you seem to have the habit of attempting to stall our discussion by saying that the Ruling Party won't do this and won't do that, so I'm an idealist. So I'm telling you, assume a compliant government, a government that is formed under the New System I'm proposing.<br><br>Obviously, this education system I'm proposing won't work under the Old System.<br><br>4)<br><br>[1] An independent elections commission, not an ELD, will monitor and manage all elections, including the hiring of campaign managers. So that each House will have its own Elections will be a fact.<br><br>[2] the most familiar argument, I must say. You're just missing one point: Taxes are still controlled by the House of the Miscellaneous, which controls most things anyway. The prevention of Houses from combining together is to improve effectiveness, rather than to kill it. It is to ensure that the leaders of teh Three Houses are kept separate and are not unduly influenced in any way prejudicial to the people they are representing. EP will function like IP; Misc will function as Parliament fucntions now. Like I believe, education and politics should not mix, just as wage-determination and politics should not mix. Healthcare and politics (such as anti-homosexual tendencies) should not mix either, but unfrotunately it's very hard to construct representation for hospital patients, sicne you can't really have a leader for patients, not in any sense I can think of anyway. The primary reason for the existence of government is to provide security for its citizens, so that's what is given to the House of the Miscellaneous. EP will be purely representative: feedback from students is directly reported by the EP reps. And it will still be efficient; there are many levels which these information pass through, adn each level will deal with stuff it can deal with: the class with class stuff, the council with campus-specific stuff. So only the stuff which these cannot deal with will be returned to the top-level EP. And since there is decentralisation, things can be dealt with more efficiently. the School of Languages will deal with syllabuses regarding its subjects, and so on; the deans will handle their sub-deans, who will handle the teachers. It is very effective in that sense. Likewise, Estate Management deals with all the non-syllabus stuff, adn teh Coordinator deals with Finance.<br><br>Sim Wong Hoo once said: in Singapore, talents are scarce only because SIngaporeans do not recognize talent. Anyway, we don't really need talent in EP, apart from the Deans, since it is purely representative.<br><br>5) Precisely why we need to have Education separate from political machinations of adults - to prevent such oblique directions from influencing policies in undesirable ways. The issue of Economic Relevance will be solved by having the University Deans on the Council of Deans as rapporteurs and advisors to EP in general, in the sense that they will tell EP all the current trends, and most likely if teh students don't respond, the teachers will favourably. So there.<br><br>6) The following people are not included in EP: P 1-3 kids and Uni students. Like I said, EP will not provide representation to Uni Students. Since each university is unique in inclination, each will have its own quasi-EP made up of the Student Union/Society and the Lecturers' Union.<br><br>I believe that teachers may know what a student needs, but they can never know the need better than the student himself/herself. An easy example: a student cosntantly fails tests, so a teacher creates remedial; unfortunately, what the student requires is psychological counselling, becasue s/he is in a state of nervous breakdown and depression; yes, she needs academic help, but not so much as emotional help. But the ignorant teacher does not understand. So teh poor student gets remedial after remedial until she jmps and kills herself out of frustration that nobody understands her. And then, at coroner's inquiry, teacher says: Well, she should have told me. But the prob is teh teacher failed to see the most crucial sign of all in the first place.<br><br>And as I told you already, there will no longer be any more Ministry of Education!<br><br>why would they know better? because they are down on the ground experiencing it all, that's why! Isn't that common sense??? Now, that's an example of unique non-thinking. the reps still ahve their normal fucntions: student union reps still study and the teacher union reps still teach. SO tehy ahve the experience and probably can understand the situation better than a Minister who sits in an air-conditioned room reading reports, with perm-sec, and only coming out occasionally to pilot-test some new policy, without staying to observe the long-term results.<br><br>I don't intend the kids and teachers tob e politicians; I intend them to be leaders. Don't you understand this point????<br><br>So I still don't see why it is anti-relevant.<br><br>Kindly Qualify.<br><br>the (confused) pikamaster<br></div>
