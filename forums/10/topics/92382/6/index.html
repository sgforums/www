But I really hope you can open yr eyes and see. Read again what the forumites have said:<br>1. Paperchicken on 5/9 0404pm: I think there's no such thing as a "true" or "model" democracy. Each country shd adapt and come up with a democratic system that suits it best.<br>2. Qitai on 6/9 1204am: We have. We can vote down PAP. But I do not believe that democracy is an end to itself.<br>3. CenturionMBT on 6/9 0209am:.. true democracy. . .in an ideal world maybe. Â…ultimately i wouldn't care less about the politics<br>4. Muse on 6/9 1130am: The choice remains, the key is whether the people choose to take it.<br>5. Drawer on 6/9 0119pm: If like that,I rather have a chaotic democracy!<br>6. Tidalwave3333 on 6/9 0707pm : robertteh's 7-point definition of a 'true democracy', while inspirational, also smacks of idealism (and possibly naivety). The American political model certainly does not possess all of those virtues. In fact, I would go so far to add that those prerequisites are set so high that pragmatically, no country can ever satisfy them adequately.<br>7. Himbo on 6/9 0722pm: I applaude your balanced point of view as well asÂ…..Yeah....what he said..Â…<br>8. av98m on 7/9 0914pm: like the Singapore model better.<br>9. Runningismylife on 7/9 0217pm: democracy is for everyone to interprate and comprehend. for one thing is sure, there's not only one form of democracy availableÂ….. i believe that socialist democracy has brought us what other democracies have not brought to their society and country.<br>10. Reginaldroddi on 8/9 0710am: Sorry popping out but i think that democracy is an ideal world, there is no assect definition... ppl improve on ideas &amp; apply it from time to time...<br>11. Pikamaster on 8/9 0902am: My opinion is that we hsould adopt UK's "shadow parliament" democracy.<br>12. Fymk on 14/9 on 0823am:	The meaning of true democracy is *drum rolls*Â….There is no such thing as a true democracy!<br>13. Gohmengseng on 16/9 1100am: The system of democracy must be both a system of selection as well as elimination.<br><br>The other forumites like iveco, Atobe, reyes, men_@_arms, oldbreadstinks expressed their opinion on singapore politics but I can't see any opinion from them supporting yr 7 pts of democracy. Scorps125 posted something just to let off his frustrations. After yr long answer explaining the 7 pts to gregorsamsa you must have expected him to say hurray, great plan! but we have not seen his response.<br><br>I don't have to rubuke yr 7 pts. In fact, I learned from these postings and I am more convinced now that these 7 pts is a piece of shit.<br><br>So singaporean have spoken, not all of us are happy with the present system, but we know what we want, definitely not the 7pts of democracy. Feel free to keep this thread alive in case someone might want to agree with you.<br><br>But just to substantiate your credibility, please be reminded there are questions which you have not answered:  You brought up the question about the HDB's S$14billions, are you going to substantiate it? On 10/9 You posted a Conclusion in which you mentioned there are general concensus, can you advise how you reached those concensus? You were asked if you ever consider to walk your talk, are you ready to answer? You also have not answered the question if you were prepared to fight for Singapore or you will flee as soon as there is problem here.<br><br>Btw, are you here to collect info to write another book? Hope yr book on the ... management system is selling well. Times are hard, people are getting smarter, hardselling doesn't work, bullshits doesn't sell.<br><br>This is the final of my final post on this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

UN agencies can be invited to advise or assist in such inexpensive overseer body for the goodness of governance.<br><br>For example, giving of goodies that may unfairly influence the voting process or fairness be subject to such small claim prior determination.<br><br>(6) Self-voting of ministers' pay or alignment to private sector pay (abstention from voting and debate should be observed) - situations of conflicts and potential conflicts and should be re-examined. Compilation of private sector pays should be published for independent citizens' rights sub-court review.<br><br>(7) Law suits on political opponents - referred to citizens' right sub-court for prior certification that there is no infringement of constitution laws or citizens' basic rights to free election or participation in governance.<br><br>Can you say that these 7 points offering greater accountability and transparency to political process are too idealistic or impractical. Yes, countries like Taiwan and Phillipines might have experienced difficulties with democracy or its practices, but there was no arguments to substantiate the contrary views of certain forumiites that in these countries the democracy has failed. My replies to them were thorough that the difficulties experienced did not signify system failure.<br><br>Paperchicken queried that there is no such thing as true democracy. My reply was given below:-<br><br>A true deomcracy comprising the 7 essential ingredients as posted is not idealistic but attainable and will bring immense benefits to Singapore next stage of progress for the following reasons:-<br><br>(1) Singapore is a young or relatively young country. It has only experienced one part of progress as a nation for the first two to three decades of its nationhood so far.<br><br>(2) It has not experienced as yet the unleashing of creative energy of masses made possible under truly democratic system as the Americans have experienced.<br><br>(3) It is too early to pass judgment whether its present control-based top-down system with a group of talents or presumed talents leading every aspect of national life from the front is indeed the best and sustainable system.<br><br>(4) Given the control-based or guided system, there already existed many problems - high costs, elitism, loss of economic competitiveness to mention just a few.<br><br>(5) There is no immediate prospect of reversing the present high costs without involving the masses in participating in creating entrepreneurship and economic competitiveness. There is much reluctance to toe the control line or policy on the part of youths or masses and many have migrated.<br><br>(6) A critical re-examination of the present control-based policies will be essential to cater to rising expectations and aspirations of youths and people as a whole.<br><br>(7) Leadership, confucianism and Asian values have been tried but as proven by the Asian Financial Crisis, such values are abstract tenets and assumptions unlikely to create better governance but may even give rise to more abuses.<br><br>Your query was given in your comments: "black cat or white cat, the cat that catches the rat is a good cat." Deng Xiao Ping. You had not offered any evidences to substantiate why the 7 points were too idealistic or impractical except in making queries which were unrelated to the points posted.<br><br>Point by point, I had replied to subsequent queries by forumites but they did not appear to disagree with reasons given to paperchicken.<br><br>Iveco and others did not disagree with the 7 points or offered any substantial arguments or evidences to contradict the soundness of the 7 points. Only Iveco suggested proportional representation to further enhance the 7 points' accountability and transparency.<br><br>My replies to Tidalwave333 were to be read in context too. I don't think I will go into what he had posted and my replies. It is to be noted that apart from your trying to do a summary of your own and failing to rebut the arguments put forth by me at the material time, what you are trying to do now is to justify your own conclusion that you disagree to the 7 points. There is nothing new you had offered by way of substantiation of your points or rebuttals of my replies to paper chicken or others.<br><br>I would leave the posts and the queries made as they stand. I respect your reservation of your own judgment, but have to point out that your summary does not represent in the least the totality of the views and replies as posted on this topic. If you should start a fresh topic on this subject, you could have the satisfaction of bringing out your own arguments on this matter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Well, here's a thought. Bring in some younger Nominated MPs - late 20s, early 30s - who could be representative of the younger population that the Government is trying to reach.<br><br>Up till now, it seems that the ones picked are generally all very well-established individuals and tend to be over the age of 35.<br><br>In my opinion, the reason many young people are somewhat disillusioned with the Government is largely attributable to the fact that they don't know the office-holders in person. They have never met the Prime Minister, they have never talked to a minister. They see them only on TV or at official openings, giving speeches, and that is their perception of them.<br><br>Unfortunately, the fact that there are also many in the civil service who are still rather 'old fashioned' in both their management and PR skills makes matters worse, as these are the 'bosses' of the younger generation.<br><br>I count myself fortunate to have had the chance to interact with some ministers and officials. And, well, let's just say that there is quite a big difference among them.<br><br>I find it harder to relate to the more seasoned minsters. They seem set in their ways and not very open to new ideas.<br><br>On the other hand, the younger ministers I have met are willing to talk to you as a person, no hierarchy involved, much like the way modern CEOs interact with their staff. I can relate to them and I see passion in what they are doing.<br><br>This is not to say that the older ministers are not passionate, but they just don't seem to show it. This could be due to our culture, and their upbringing.<br><br>But had I never met any of them and merely read or heard what they said, I would have simply brushed it aside as propaganda.<br><br>Having said that, I think we should allow for some diversity and not just bring the scholars and the high-flying entrepreneurs into the scheme of things.<br><br>Get the 'average Joe' into the picture too. You just might be surprised at his point of view.<br><br>[name deleted]</blockquote>Source: ST, 30/9/04<br><br>Doesn't this sound familiar?

            <div class='col-md body'>To:  Iveco,<br><br>It can be seen from all the news that Singapore is no longer economically competitive or socially stable.<br><br>The only way for Singapore to compete and stay vibrant is to change its past policies and practices to level up to countries like Japan, South Korea, China, Thailand, Malaysia etc.<br><br>Obviously, the old guards have still a very strong influence on the current leadership who are afraid to change some of the past thinking - mainly top down presumptuous ones expecting people to endure and support government efficiencies like paying more and continuing to listen.<br><br>If the so-called mindset changes to bring about new economic competitiveness or social amerioration from past draconian policies cannot happen, it will be for the younger populations to take over and show the old guards alternatives and workable new ideas from elsewhere.<br><br>Without all the social draconian measures and policies, many countries can still compete on their own in-house talents and self-reliant measures like Japan and Korea. There is no reason to keep entrenching in old policies that do not work any more in today's world.<br><br>Let more young people decide what they want with their own future. It is a good idea to suggest nominations of election candidates and NMPs to be of age range of 25-35.

Each country shd adapt and come up with a democratic system that suits it best.<br>2. Qitai on 6/9 1204am: We have. We can vote down PAP.

Tidalwave3333 on 6/9 0707pm : robertteh's 7-point definition of a 'true democracy', while inspirational, also smacks of idealism (and possibly naivety). The American political model certainly does not possess all of those virtues. In fact, I would go so far to add that those prerequisites are set so high that pragmatically, no country can ever satisfy them adequately.<br>7. Himbo on 6/9 0722pm: I applaude your balanced point of view as well asÂ…..Yeah....what he said..Â…<br>8. av98m on 7/9 0914pm: like the Singapore model better.<br>9.

Gohmengseng on 16/9 1100am: The system of democracy must be both a system of selection as well as elimination.<br><br>The other forumites like iveco, Atobe, reyes, men_@_arms, oldbreadstinks expressed their opinion on singapore politics but I can't see any opinion from them supporting yr 7 pts of democracy. Scorps125 posted something just to let off his frustrations. After yr long answer explaining the 7 pts to gregorsamsa you must have expected him to say hurray, great plan! but we have not seen his response.<br><br>I don't have to rubuke yr 7 pts. In fact, I learned from these postings and I am more convinced now that these 7 pts is a piece of shit.<br><br>So singaporean have spoken, not all of us are happy with the present system, but we know what we want, definitely not the 7pts of democracy.

On 10/9 You posted a Conclusion in which you mentioned there are general concensus, can you advise how you reached those concensus? You were asked if you ever consider to walk your talk, are you ready to answer? You also have not answered the question if you were prepared to fight for Singapore or you will flee as soon as there is problem here.<br><br>Btw, are you here to collect info to write another book?

SO it is not wise to use their posts to substantiate their viewpoints.<br><br>My post that you quoted was meant to argue against Proportional Representation, not against the Seven Points. In fact, I think the Seven Points are quite intelligent.<br><br>I could rebut TidalWave's claim with this: The prerequisites may seem high, but then the idea is to follow them to the best of your ability; aim for 100% even if it seems impossible. I do not believe that Robert's Points are idealistic. What makes people think they are idealistic is the over-pragmatic culture that the Government has spawned over its past reign of 45 years. In fact, I believe strongly that this prevailign pragmatism is what keeps the spirit of innovation and creativity low down here. After all, to the over-pragmatic, any new idea is impractical and impossible to implement.<br><br>About the 14b loan, go check out TVD or Sintercom or Sammyboy. You should find evidence, first-hand and second-hand, that you need.<br><br>I don't know about Iveco or reyes, but I know that elsewhere on this forum, Atobe has mentioned one-man, one-vote and transparency and accountability. In fact, I think you have poseted stuff on the latter as well.<br>men-@-arms is in the same league as Paperchicken: see what he posted about sending poor juvenile delinquents to military academies? As for oldbreadstinks, I think that implications of teh Seven Points come up frequently in his posts elsewhere as well.<br><br>GohmengSeng is a WP cadre, so his opinion would be, like the rest of teh opposition, geared toward fairness in elections, thus the post you posted is irrelevant to the discussion in this thread. (Or is electoral fairness one of the Seven Points?)<br><br>the same thing applies  to those forumnites you quoted whom I did not refer to as does to TidalWave.<br><br>and btw, it's insulting to call pple's hard work "bullshits", even if you don't find them to your taste.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>the Pikamaster (at "o" levels year)</div>

Even Mahathir has admitted again in his recent lecture to the Singapore Management University that despite certain perceived shortcomings, democracy is still the best form of government as proven by history of civilization.<br><br>Singapore leaders had tried to justify its particular form of authoritarian rule on the basis of confucianistic principle or alternatively Asian values but after the great Asian Financial crisis and seeing that the particular model of meritocracy practised in Singapore could not help to solve its deepening crises and unemployments and high cost problems, Singapore leaders had of later years backed away from its persistent championing of such values or societal approaches.<br><br>Once again, events have proven that there exist civilizations which have done well with democratic practices. It may be worthwhile for Singapore to learn from experiences lately of modifications of democracy in European countries like Sweden, Switzerland and Finland which obviously practised a more equitable and flexible electoral system to ameriorate the danger of authoritarian domination by one party. If Australian has similarly succeeded in ameriorating the excesses of FPTP system, why can't Singapore learn to adapt its present FPTP electoral system to evolve the system further.<br><br>The younger generations will definitely have to decide in the next election or sooner whether the continual domination by one-party domination is progressive or desirable for the people.<br><br>More researches of how other countries have modified and adapted the FPTP system may be helpful. For the views of all truly pro-Singapore younger Singaporeans please.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

While they tend to be academic at times, his posts are still highly readable.<br><br>Iveco is another favourite although I can't say I am a firm believer of the PR-system. Still he has managed to remain calm-headed and persuasive where I am concerned.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng writes well- but I have not made up my mind about him. He seems to tread between relevant and unrelated issues.<br><br>But the highlight of this thread must be Robertteh- I cannot help but be amused by Robertteh's insistence that many people are supporting his 7-points. (Many people certainly support this thread by contributing, but that's a different issue). These "supporters" must be phantom/ghost fans since most forum participants have pointed out Robertteh's obvious evasion of crucial issues, factual errors, or just plain illogical conclusions. Or perhaps he chooses to ignore the evident situation (as many have pointed out repeatedly) that consensus is lacking here, especially with regards to whatever he has said. (Sorry robert- this is not a personal attack, but just my sentiments).<br><br>There is an entire literature on the pros/cons on FPTP/PR. Both are used in many countries all over the world, and the use/exclusion of one does not make a country more or less democratic.<br><br>What has been generally left unsaid is that Singaporeans <strong>genuinely</strong> support the incumbent party. All governments engage in some form of electoral stunt or gerrymandering- it is not exclusive to any one country. Singaporeans are educated and have a right to choose the party they think is in the best position to lead.<br><br>Ironically, Robertteh who praises the American system may want to look at how the American electoral system failed in 2000 (chads and complicated ballot slips, missing ballots, overseas ballots uncounted, registered black Americans barred from voting, antiquated voting procedures and equipment, the role of Fox News in concluding results before the counting had even ended, the role of Jeb Bush's governor of Florida and brother of George W Bush etc), and today's news (29 Oct 2004) about 58,000 ballots going missing in Florida.<br><br>That's my piece.</div>

Still he has managed to remain calm-headed and persuasive where I am concerned.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng writes well- but I have not made up my mind about him. He seems to tread between relevant and unrelated issues.<br><br>But the highlight of this thread must be Robertteh- I cannot help but be amused by Robertteh's insistence that many people are supporting his 7-points. (Many people certainly support this thread by contributing, but that's a different issue). These "supporters" must be phantom/ghost fans since most forum participants have pointed out Robertteh's obvious evasion of crucial issues, factual errors, or just plain illogical conclusions. Or perhaps he chooses to ignore the evident situation (as many have pointed out repeatedly) that consensus is lacking here, especially with regards to whatever he has said. (Sorry robert- this is not a personal attack, but just my sentiments).<br><br>There is an entire literature on the pros/cons on FPTP/PR. Both are used in many countries all over the world, and the use/exclusion of one does not make a country more or less democratic.<br><br>What has been generally left unsaid is that Singaporeans [b]genuinely</strong> support the incumbent party. All governments engage in some form of electoral stunt or gerrymandering- it is not exclusive to any one country. Singaporeans are educated and have a right to choose the party they think is in the best position to lead.<br><br>Ironically, Robertteh who praises the American system may want to look at how the American electoral system failed in 2000 (chads and complicated ballot slips, missing ballots, overseas ballots uncounted, registered black Americans barred from voting, antiquated voting procedures and equipment, the role of Fox News in concluding results before the counting had even ended, the role of Jeb Bush's governor of Florida and brother of George W Bush etc), and today's news (29 Oct 2004) about 58,000 ballots going missing in Florida.<br><br>That's my piece.[/b]</blockquote>NineGrains,<br><br>you missed me out.<br><br>I do not think that Signaporeans genuinely support the Ruling Party. Where did you get that information from? How can you tell that since a large proportion of voters do not vote ine very election, since their constituencies happen to be walkovers. It's not valid to say that these people support/ not support the govt.<br><br>I find TidalWave333's postings well-written, although they are a little too aquid pro-quo. And I have explicitly stated MY support of the "7 points". For people who say that they are too idealistic, i would tell them that they are too pragmatic, and that over-pragmatism from such pple in govt or out is what is killing our country. Or perhaps I am a "phantom"? haha. Pls check your info b4 you post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>As for the American System, I do agree that it is not purfect, but the way you write seems to imply that our electoral system is flawless, which definitely cannot be the case, especially since it si government-controlled, which raises doubts about its integrity.<br><br>After three years in forums like these, I have observed that "evasion of crucial issues", "illogical conclusions" and the like are usually unsupported excuses provided by social conservatives who just can't stand change. So I am afraid that you should provide justification for such..errr...criticisms, or else they are really nothing except personal attacks, regardless of all disclaimers you give.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: NineGrains,<br><br>Hmm, interesting to read another summing up of discussions on this topic: "Definition of true democracy"<br><br>Such summing up pardon me for saying offers nothing of significance to the main points at issue in this topic which I am sure you will agree require real engagements when points of relevance were exchanged.<br><br>Everyone has the equal opportunity to put his point of variance or agreement across. Equally, for whatever reason, if anyone supporting or against democracy is to choose to leave the discussion for whatever reason, we can respect his wishes.<br><br>If TidalWave333 had continued with his main argument that there exists more desirable or enduring system than democracy as practised by the west chiefly the US/UK models, so be it. There would have been more debates and discussions to their most logical conclusion.<br><br>If he had not continued with his rationale, it would be deemed that he had allowed the argument that there was no more enduring or sustenable political system other than democracy despite certain shortcomings with democracy. This point was openly admitted by Asian leaders themselves like Mahathir in his recent lectures at the Singapore Management University attended by many Singapore ministers and leaders.<br><br>Apart from the above-stated observation, I agree with you that several people in the posting including Tidalwave333 had been eloquent and their points are highly readable.<br><br>To come in at this point to offer after-thoughts perhaps cannot add as much real value to the points stated above that democracy and democratic political system has been superior and sensitive and sensible to the wishes and aspirations of people over the centuries.<br><br>BUT, certain democratic practices like the First-Past-The_Post election system need certain modifications so as to overcome problems. It is essential to avoid domination by one party which has the knack or ability of legally bending the one-man-one-vote universal suffrage resulting in cornering the election processes to perpetuate their rule.<br><br>Iveco had been consistent in putting forward his key point that PR-system will help to prevent such one-party domination. Yes, I agree with your observation that Iveco had posted very good views on the PR system particularly his comments on the more flexible Australian modified FPTP election system. Singapore leaders may well wish to look further evolvement of our own democratic election system along this line as practised by Australia, Finland, Sweden or Switzerland if not the 7 points of true democracy per se.<br><br>When it comes to political evolvement, it would be the primary responsibility of all truly loyal citizens to think national and not just the status quo under the existing system which allow legalistic tweaking to perpetuate one-party domination.<br><br>I feel that so far despite all the academic views given, there was no creditable objection to the practicality of the 7 points of true democracy.<br><br>Think in terms of an increasingly educated and younger generation. They have the aspirations and needs and perceptions about one-party rule too. The many imagined fears or paranoid painted of so-called lost ballot boxes or street riots under democratic systems whether in US, Indonesia or Taiwan are weak attempt at justifying the status quo.<br><br>There has been selective news all the time that criticise democratic practices as being too free, too liberal resulting presumably in disorders or unrest and consequently impeding development of a country.<br><br>I have answered to all the arguments offered along this line of anti-democracy critics and asked whether there was any alternative better or more capable of satisfying the needs and aspirations of people but there was no concrete replies to my queries.<br><br>No authoritarianism or sem-authoritarism has been upheld as superior or more superior as compared with democracy. Such systems might have succeeded erratically and occasionally depending on the particular leaderships and circumstances. However there is no doubt that there is a great deal of disadvantages as such system has been highly vulnerable to abuses and problems especially after the beneficial great autocrats or leaders leave the scene.<br><br>Heritage had been alternatively upheld as principal ingredient of certain democratising countries like Japan or Indonesia. There was no substance to the heritage argument too as the point of heritage was uncertain. However anti-democracy critics could not quite justify their reason why the world and civilizations have been evolving towards democracy despite their criticisms against democracy.<br><br>Ironically, Singapore is still compelled to follow democratic framework despite trying to tweak the framework to justify leadership and what have you. It is not the anti-democracy critics had anything substantial to offer to justify their arguments. They nevertheless have selectively taken armbrage with certain minor or peripheral shortcomings to make their particular preference look good. Points about missing of 58,000 ballots in Florida are nothing if one is to consider that without democracy there will be no ballot boxes to begin with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>That's my piece.[/b][/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello PikaMaster and Robertteh<br><br><strong>Responding to PikaMaster first,</strong><br><br>I did not refer to <strong>ALL</strong> forum participants objecting to Roberteh's 7-points. That would be foolish of course. I am aware of your support, as well as a few others who generally agree with Robert. What I am pointing out is that the majority disagree with what Robert said- your views, and a few others belong to the minority. I am sure it is not your intention to twist my words.<br><br>The support that the PAP enjoys is not a spurious one. While you are quite accurate in stating that there were many walkovers (in the last election), it would also be foolish to conclude then this is real evidence Singaporeans are anti-PAP. You imply that if there had been NO walkovers and every constituency was contested, the PAP would have suffered a bloody defeat.<br><br>1. Where the opposition have contested in new wards, they have not managed to even come close to gaining a majority vote.<br>Example: Hong Kah- PAP 96,450; SDP 24,513<br>Jalan Besar- PAP 68,309; SDA 23,391<br>Jurong- PAP 84,742; SDP 21,511<br><br>2. Incumbent opposition MPs Mr. Chiam and Mr. Low have seen their support REDUCED in terms of percentages in 2001. They won by tiny margins.<br>Mr Chiam won with a vote of 52.43% (or a win by just 751 more votes);<br>Mr Low won with a vote of 54.98%<br><br>3. I would also like to point out that the overall total vote garnered by the PAP increased to 75.3%, its best result since 1980 (when it won 77.7%).<br><br>I have stated and backed up my assertions using just numerical facts, and avoiding all the usual controversial issues about electoral stunts, or opposition disunity/infighting.<br><br>If you wish to imply OTHERWISE- that the majorty of Singaporeans do NOT support the PAP, or that the opposition would have won soundly had there been no walkovers, the <strong>burden of proof is on YOU</strong> - to prove that the opposition would have won, and the opposition enjoys the support of Singaporeans.<br><br>As for my sentiments regarding evasion of issues, illogical conclusions on the part of Robertteh, examples litter the thread. Surely it is not too difficult for you to concur that despite the objections raised, Robertteh chooses to blindly and explicitly ignore these objections. Instead he continues to <span style="font-style: italic;">pretend</span> that he has the support of the majority.<br><br>I did not imply that Singapore's electoral system is "purfect". Those are your words, and your assertion. What I did was point out the evident flaws and controversies surrounding the last American election in 2001. Again, the flaws I pointed out are factual, and are well documented in newspapers, books and journals.<br><br>Why you wish to link the very real flaws in the last American election to Singapore's electoral system, and THEN attribute them to me..... is a mystery only you have an answer to.<br><br>You keep repeating <span style="font-style: italic;">ad nauseum</span> that TidalWave's points are a manifestation of his 'over-pragmatism'  The problem is the "7-points" (as noted by many here) are NOT criteria for democracy at all. They are merely Robertteh's wish-list for changes to the political system. With over 200 years of democratic development, NO country can be said to be <strong>perfectly democratic</strong>. It is simply a political utopia, an ideal humans aspire to, but will <strong>NEVER </strong>achieve.<br><br>To <strong>recognise, acknowledge and accept</strong> this fact is not being 'over-pragmatic' (if there is such a word to begin with), but to be <strong>realistic</strong>. Your insistence that a country can reach perfect, superb democratic heaven is the real IDEALISM (if not naive stupidity) here.  If you continue to delude yourself otherwise, you will ultimately end up bitterly disappointed.  Any political science student worth his salt knows the right term is 'polyarchy'- as the <strong>IMPERFECT democratic systems </strong>in US, UK or Australia are known.<br><br><strong>Turning to Robertteh,</strong><br><br>My last post was <strong>NOT</strong> to sum up what has been said in 6 pages of this thread or to contribute further to the discussion on "true" democracy. Were you truly unable to even grasp my ONE point? Or are you setting the stage and deliberately misinterpreting me- in order to put your pre-determined points forward?<br><br>It is merely to point out the irony and your insistence in making conclusions that are contrary to what has been discussed. The majority of people disagree with what you said, yet you pretend they agree with you.<br><br>Your conclusions merely repeat what you WISH to read, not what you have ACTUALLY read.<br><br>It is like someone presenting you with two red apples, and then you insisting that what you see are four oranges. This is highly farcical, and reminds one of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Emperor's New Clothes</span>. The only person being deluded is you- you only think and see what you want to think and see, ignoring the realities of what has been said.<br><br>And even if I had something contrary to say, would you have wanted to read it correctly? If I had said something contrary to what you wish to read, would you have continued to pretend that I agreed with you, thus deceiving yourself again?<br><br>Or perhaps this is a game or a drama that you are indulging in? With no real good rebuttals/answers to the points raised here, the only solution is for you to continue with this pretence. I certainly hope this is not the case.<br><br>It's highly bizzare indeed, and defeats the whole point of a good serious discussion! No wonder Tidalwave decided to stop contributing.<br><br>Learning from the right example, I leave this thread as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Robertteh,<br><br>I am not sure if Ninegrains will respond to new points in your post since you changed your original post <strong>AFTER</strong> he replied to you. I read what you wrote earlier, and your new post now.<br><br>I don't think this is good posting etiquette- to change your original post <strong>AFTER</strong> someone has already responded. In fact, it gives the impression that what he said made so much sense to you that it prompted you to cover your tracks, just in case more people are swayed by his argument.<br><br>In addition, amending your original post after someone has replied will definitely confuse other readers since what they read- your NEW amended post, and NineGrains reply to your original post- will not make full sense.<br><br>And it is appalling to read your flippant response to 58,000 <strong>MISSING</strong> ballots.<br><br><blockquote>Points about missing of 58,000 ballots in Florida are nothing if one is to consider that without democracy there will be no ballot boxes to begin with. </blockquote>Considering you portray yourself as one who values democracy, surely one missing vote is unethical and even illegal, much less 58,000! And with the controversies surrounding the last American election, this is certainly highly suspect, especially when it happened in Florida (again!), where George Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, is governor.<br><br>Your logic is also twisted. So if someone is accidentally hanged after being given the death sentence...it doesn't really matter because without a judicial system, hangings wouldn't have taken place anyway????!?<br><br>Besides your English which genuinely made it difficult for other readers to comprehend fully what you wrote earlier, you may also wish to aquaint yourself with some European political history, especially Sweden (in particular the Swedish Social Democratic Party) since you keep bringing it up.  You will change your mind about dominant party states (not one-party states) then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello WindyDay,<br><br>Not to worry about what Ninegrains had posted. What he had done was to express his afterthoughts about certain postings he had read and insisted on giving his own opinions. He did not quite add anything of significance to this debate and he had made it clear that he did not wish to. I would leave it at that.<br><br>To your point about posting etiquette, I wish to say that whatever had been posted are subject to changes or amendments by individual forumites. Anyone is given this facility by the wonder of technology of the net. There is nothing surreptitious as whatever was someone's original post, it could be captured by quotation by a simple click in another's reply to that post. The original post would then be captured on record.<br><br>No one can really subsequently amend his original post to cover his tracks in any way as you had put it. If still doubtful, you could check that out how forumites preserved others' original post replied by simply clicking the subject post within quotes.<br><br>It would seem that you had come in with Ninegrains to re-open this topic. Go ahead if you are not convinced about democracy still, to start a new thread like "democracy is a sham and communism once condemned in the similar fashion or autocracy is a better system".<br><br>As for the missing 58,000 ballot boxes, I am sure you can see for yourself that any ballot boxes could be missing in any country for a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with merits or demerits of its political system. Go and check this out yourself with any definition of democracy anywhere to see missing ballot boxes are part of the definitio.<br><br>After reexamining all the relevant posts of Pikamaster and Iveco, and others like Goh Meng Seng, I am sure you will see that the argument for democracy is objective and definitely strong.<br><br>Your idea of support appears to be based on quick or straw poll of some kind depending on many reply in "yes" or "no". Arguments offered by Pikamaster or Iveco to you appear to be not that important. I beg to differ that my logic of democracy or the 7 points of democracy was twisted.<br><br>As for standard of English, or style of writing, it would appear you had written reasonably except that the logic at times does not quite fall in proper place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Robert,<br><br>My point was not about the wonders of technology which allows forumnites to amend what has been said.<br><br>It is about the etiquette of amendment- doing so <strong>AFTER</strong> a response has been made. It is true that quoting the original post in the response puts it on record- but you avoid the issue in this context.<br><br>Your amendments came <strong>AFTER </strong>reading Ninegrains' response. You also knew he did not quote you verbatim. That, in essence changes the direction of the discussion since it effectively confuses any new reader.<br><br>I wouldn't go so far as to label you 'surreptitious' (to borrow your language), but it does smack of a lack of common posting courtesy.<br><br>I don't know Ninegrains in person. Neither have I communicated with him. Any cladestine conspiracy you try to serve up about us "coming in together to reopen this topic" is a figment of your over-active imagination.<br><br>Looking at your next remark:<br><blockquote>As for the missing 58,000 ballot boxes, I am sure you can see for yourself that any ballot boxes could be missing in any country for a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with merits or demerits of its political system. Go and check this out yourself with any definition of democracy anywhere to see missing ballot boxes are part of the definitio. </blockquote>I wonder if this is another deliberate misinterpretation of a perfectly ordinary sentence about missing ballots, <strong>NOT</strong> ballot boxes. It was clearly written in previous posts <strong>BALLOTS</strong> went missing, <strong>NOT BALLOT BOXES</strong>. Anyone who reads/watches the news knows that close to 60,000 absentee ballots went missing in Florida i.e. registered voters did not receive their ballots and hence could not vote. This is the same controversial state in the last American election. It is the state which George Bush's broher, Jeb Bush leads as governor. It is the same state that saw vote-counting stop mid-way in 2000. If ballot boxes go missing, new ones can be made and no votes would be lost. but if ballots go missing and new ones are not replaced in time, close to 60,000 voters would have been deprived of their constitutional right- and that has the potential to change results.<br><br>Easy to understand? In this instance, the most fundamental principle about the individual's right to vote would have been violated. So your (deliberate?) misinterpretation has little to do with ballot boxes, and it really is you who needs to put on reading glasses and read carefully. Either that, or check your textbook definitions of democracy and see if voting has anything to do with it.<br><br><blockquote>Your idea of support appears to be based on quick or straw poll of some kind depending on many reply in "yes" or "no". Arguments offered by Pikamaster or Iveco to you appear to be not that important. I beg to differ that my logic of democracy or the 7 points of democracy was twisted. </blockquote>What am I supposed to be supporting based on a straw poll? I have not said anything about supporting anything or anyone in my last post.<br><br>Perhaps you are again (deliberately) confused about what you are writing, and who you are writing to? Is this the support for the PAP that <strong>NINEGRAINS </strong>referred to? DO you lose track of things so easily, or get easily disoriented? I hope you are not dyslexic- and I mean that seriously, not as a snide remark.<br><br><blockquote>As for standard of English, or style of writing, it would appear you had written reasonably except that the logic at times does not quite fall in proper place</blockquote>Which sentence is illogical? One expects to be presented with a real example, rather than an accusation made out of thin air?<br><br>I think this is one reason why serious contributors simply refrain from posting here. You have a propensity to misread, misinterpret, and misquote. This happens at great regularity, and have become expected where you are concerned. Surely you realise that when it happens once or twice, people may not notice, or leave it at that. But when it happens every time you respond, it only invites contempt since it gives the impression you are incapable of giving an honest reply- even for just once. I suggest you take time to read responses carefully, check what you have typed before posting it. These efforts make for a more productive discussion here.<br><br></div>
