            <div class='col-md body'>PROPOSED OVERHAUL OF CURRENT CONSTITUTION,<br><br>The current constitution (Singapore) is too general and vague. There is no specific definition or protection of citizens' rights and integrity of one-man-one-vote election process. In the hand of rogue government, it can be easily twisted or tweaked to suit the narrow interest of whoever the political parties in power.<br><br>Is it desirable to allow differing interpretations of the rights of citizens or power of the government and differring branches of government?<br><br>The answer is obvious: people and government is bigger than the parties and parties should be elected as government to represent people's collective views and interests.<br><br>Therefore upholding of citizens rights and checking of the performances of government should be the desirable ends of the constitution.<br><br>By virtue of the above-stated final goals and objectives of the constitution, it should be a document that spell out the basic rights of citizens, defining the duties and roles of government and their responsibilities to safeguard social, cultural and economic vibrancy particularly in the following areas:-<br><br>(1) To safeguard the One Man One Vote principle so that only the best individuals are elected into political office and there will be complete accountable and transparent check on power of executives by the people.<br><br>(2) To ensure multi-racial representation, to provide that 20% of seats of parliaments will go to the racial groups for allocation to those receiving the highest percentage of votes counted in the one-man-one-vote election return whenever the number of candidates elected fall below any racial representation ratio passed and reviewed by parliament every 10 years.<br><br>(3) To prohibit use of block- or group-representation voting system to avoid impediment or shackling of the one-man-one-vote universal electoral system.<br><br>(4) To safeguard the Basic rights of all citizens irespective of race, culture, religion of tenets including freedoms of speech, political beliefs, right to stand for election or right to make criticisms of policies or practices of government in power.<br><br>(5) To refer all situations of conflicts of interests among the government executives, legislature, judiary and civil service to independent panel with representations from a cross section of people so as to Establish Rule of law, justice, fairness and equity in conduct of laws without fear or favor to the government in power.<br><br>(6) To Establish a low-cost independent panel open to observers from UN agencies to oversee election process and political participation by citizens.<br><br>(7) To Establish powers and procedures for Investigation and adjudication by an idependent sub-court of reported conflict of interests<br><br>(Cool To safeguard the citizens against prosecution for defamation by the government in power for speeches made in the course of election campaigning or criticising policies or actions of government in power.<br><br>(9) To fundamentally safeguard freedoms of speech, choice and association as conditions essential to encourage further growth of social, cultural and economic vibrancy, entrepreneurship and creativity of citizens.<br><br>It is recommended that adequate safeguards be provided so that citizens would be the masters of their destiny which they could participate fully in all aspects of nation building. It should uphold citizens' right to participate in all aspects of nation building and protect them against any inquitable prosecution by any govenrment in power.<br><br>Such a constitution will be proactive and open up the processes for citizens to take part in social and cultural and economic activities to contribute to creativity, entrepreneurship or participations in election, giving feedbacks or gerrymandering of election processes.<br><br>Singapore's democracy is still young and it has not fully developed and matured into one which will motivate and encourage all to participate in nation building. It will be too prematured to rely on some bad experiences with democracies in less successful south east asian democracies to stop its further evolvement. The final objective of ensuring the constitution is to open up participation in all aspects of nation building to citizens to bring about entrepreneurship and creativity accountability and transparency in the governing of the country irrespective of belief, cult, race, religion or political views or inclinations.<br><br><a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com</a><br><br>(amended on 4.9.2005)<br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://www.towncrier.com/2006.calendar.gif"></a><br><br><a href="http://www.imbuddy.net&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.imbuddy.net<img src="http://www.imbuddy.net/buddyicons/u/u9571320647-IMBUDDY.gif"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Paperchicken,<br><br>A true deomcracy comprising the 7 essential ingredients of fundamental rights of citizens, rule of law and accountability and transparency is not idealistic.<br><br>It is attainable and will bring immense benefits to Singapore next stage of progress for the following reasons:-<br><br>(1) Singapore is a young or relatively young country. It has only experienced one part of progress as a nation for the first two to three decades of its nationhood so far.<br><br>(2) It has not experienced as yet the unleashing of creative energy of masses made possible under truly democratic system as the Americans have experienced.<br><br>(3) It is too early to pass judgment whether its present control-based top-down system with a group of talents or presumed talents leading every aspect of national life from the front is indeed the best and sustainable system.<br><br>(4) Given the control-based or guided system, there already existed many problems - high costs, elitism, loss of economic competitiveness to mention just a few.<br><br>(5) There is no immediate prospect of reversing the present high costs without involving the masses in participating in creating entrepreneurship and economic competitiveness. There is much reluctance to toe the control line or policy on the part of youths or masses and many have migrated.<br><br>(6) A critical re-examination of the present control-based policies will be essential to cater to rising expectations and aspirations of youths and people as a whole.<br><br>(7) Leadership, confucianism and Asian values have been tried but as proven by the Asian Financial Crisis, such values are abstract tenets and assumptions unlikely to create better governance but may even give rise to more abuses.<br><br>A guided or controlled democracy will not produce desirable long term benefits needed by a more educated society. Instead, it will lead to alienation with people generally switched off from participating in national affairs or wellbeing.<br><br>A truly democratic system of the ingredients as posted will help to assure the whole population of their support as what people want is tangible participation, freedoms and accountability and transparency not presentation or justifications.<br><br><a href="http://www.imbuddy.net&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.imbuddy.net<img src="http://www.imbuddy.net/buddyicons/1/11109115.gif"></a></div>

There are signs that among young people this feeling of political alienation is so far-reaching that it is expressed in a general scepticism in relation to the very idea of democracy.'

It is directed at the entire country.<br><br>A true democracy allows people to have choice.<br>A partial demorcracy also allows some choice.<br>A dictatorship also allows people to have choice.<br><br>The choice remains, the key is whether the people choose to take it.<br><br>At present, choice comes in many ways: in voting, participation in elections, and not participating at all. Each of these has its consequences, good and bad.<br><br>Singaporeans often complain that we have no choice, yet when strong arm tactics and unfair gerrymandering is used by the PAP to curb the opposition, all remain silent.<br><br>If no one wants to signal that they want the opposition to play a bigger role, then can you blame the opposition for being unable to attract talent?<br>If you do not wish to vote for the opposition, please don't complain and the ruling party comes up with unpopular policies. Please don't complain when life gets toughter and they remain the world's  highest paid politicians.<br><br>Singaporeans have had choice, always had choice.<br><br>If you want the PAP and treat them as infallible by all means give your vote to them and join them even for tea coffee or even milo! But stop complaining about them. because if you do you are a hypocrite.<br><br>If you want opposition and opposition not strong, take the step to make them strong.<br>If you can only vote .. make sure you give your vote to them and dont fall for the PAP goodies near election.<br>Dont talk cock and then vote for the PAP when election time comes. Because if you do you are a hypocrite.<br><br>Singaporeans must learn to take responsibility for their own actions. We have too many kao pei pao bu (cry father cry mother) types and little doers. Too many hypocrites.<br><br>I salute the opposition, they are trying the best they can in a very hostile and ingorant environment and against tremendous odds. My vote goes to them 100%.<br><br></div>

Afterall human nature is such that we are selfish.</div></blockquote>Its true human nature is selfish,thats why in a democracy environment,a person gets to develop his/her character n career base on his/her own experience,rather than get fed by the government on "out-dated" n "untrue" information in a socialist system!<br>Take a look at our country,when ever the government want to implement a policy,or urge us to do this or that,we can only "shake our tails" n welcome those policy,like a dog like that!Is this really what we want?If like that,I rather have a chaotic democracy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>robertteh's 7-point definition of a 'true democracy', while inspirational, also smacks of idealism (and possibly naivety).

This question has been debated for centuries by the likes of Bentham, Mills and Rousseau. In fact no liberal democracy in the West can be said to be perfectly democratic...hence the term 'polyarchy'.<br><br>The US has had two centuries to develop its political model while European nations have had even longer (more than four centuries) as pointed out in postings under 'American Electioneering'. It's interesing to note that American democracy granted the vote to only white males who owned property initially, before this was given to women in 1920, and black Americans in 1964. And if one thinks of how the previous American election between Gore and Bush was played out (problems with voting paper i.e chads, the manner of counting votes, the influence of media, the large numbers of disenfranchised legal voters, the status of American votes from overseas etc)  or the Guantanamo Bay controversies, or the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, or the passing of the Patriot Act etc,...many questions must occur to those who have always placed great faith in the infallibility of American democracy.<br><br>How many former American colonies or countries which adopted the American political model have succeeded spectacularly politically *and* economically anyway? Latin America? South America? Closer to home, the Philippines makes an interesting case study.....even after the end of the Marcos era, the Philippines continues to be embroiled in political corruption, people power coups, political dominance by prominent land-owning families, personality politics (especially movie stars and celebrities), the influence of the Catholic church in politics etc etc. Economically, it is near collapse under the Arroyo administration with poverty and unemployment everywhere.<br><br>When one turns to European (especially British and French) colonies, how many can be said to have succeeded too? Of the more than 40 former colonies, only Singapore and Hong Kong stand out as economic successes. This is not due to *only* colonial legacies like the bureaucracy, rule of law and governance which our former British masters left us (and indeed left with former African colonies and India as well), but also and more importantly, the hard work of those who were granted independence.

As for Hong Kong, what can I say except that it was only returned to China in 1997, and that the British had a change of heart and realised the virtues of democracy only a few years prior to the handover (and after more than 150 years of colonial rule!) Despite the benefits democracy confers, can you blame the Chinese for feeling betrayed at this unilateral change of (British) heart?<br><br>I certainly wouldn't disagree that Singapore has lots of areas to see to where political liberalisation is concerned.

This is not to say that the incumbent government is doing badly - indeed, there have been concrete steps in liberalization (however gradual) for a long time, especially now.

Political evolution cannot be rushed- it has to happen at its own pace...the Europeans (includng the Brits) had 400 years, the US had 200 years, the Australians had more than 100 years, surely it's not too much for Singapore to be given more time, given that the country only celebrated its 39th birthday recently? One only has to look to Russia or former Eastern European states to see how things can go terribly wrong if this is not handled properly.

The answer is obviously no.

You painted a world of democratic love, peace and joy but i think u can agree that's not the true reality. Yes, the failure of some countries to implement successful democracy due to their own pitfalls cannot be use to penalise the ideals of which, but it is still true that this is no easy solution and not quite realistic. In theory, communism is also beautiful and wonderful, but we also recognise that it is not realistic.<br><br>Is democracy "obviously successful"? Has democracy "triumphed over dark forces existing in all political systems of one kind or another"? Those are very very sweeping statements which borders on being presumptuous. On what do you base these statements? There are still a few monachies that enjoys more prosperity and stability than many democratics. Granted, that doesn't means monachy is a better system, but it does show that democracy isn't the only way to go.<br><br>Western (esp amercian and hollywood) media has hyped the ideals of democracy beyond it's merit. It doesn't mean democracy doesn't work, it just means it's been very over-rated. And that it's not the end to itself, rather a means (among other options, singapore's socialist styled republic including).<br></div>
