So I'm telling you, assume a compliant government, a government that is formed under the New System I'm proposing.<br><br>Obviously, this education system I'm proposing won't work under the Old System.<br><br>4)<br><br>[1] An independent elections commission, not an ELD, will monitor and manage all elections, including the hiring of campaign managers. So that each House will have its own Elections will be a fact.<br><br>[2] the most familiar argument, I must say. You're just missing one point: Taxes are still controlled by the House of the Miscellaneous, which controls most things anyway. The prevention of Houses from combining together is to improve effectiveness, rather than to kill it. It is to ensure that the leaders of teh Three Houses are kept separate and are not unduly influenced in any way prejudicial to the people they are representing. EP will function like IP; Misc will function as Parliament fucntions now. Like I believe, education and politics should not mix, just as wage-determination and politics should not mix. Healthcare and politics (such as anti-homosexual tendencies) should not mix either, but unfrotunately it's very hard to construct representation for hospital patients, sicne you can't really have a leader for patients, not in any sense I can think of anyway. The primary reason for the existence of government is to provide security for its citizens, so that's what is given to the House of the Miscellaneous. EP will be purely representative: feedback from students is directly reported by the EP reps. And it will still be efficient; there are many levels which these information pass through, adn each level will deal with stuff it can deal with: the class with class stuff, the council with campus-specific stuff. So only the stuff which these cannot deal with will be returned to the top-level EP. And since there is decentralisation, things can be dealt with more efficiently. the School of Languages will deal with syllabuses regarding its subjects, and so on; the deans will handle their sub-deans, who will handle the teachers. It is very effective in that sense. Likewise, Estate Management deals with all the non-syllabus stuff, adn teh Coordinator deals with Finance.<br><br>Sim Wong Hoo once said: in Singapore, talents are scarce only because SIngaporeans do not recognize talent. Anyway, we don't really need talent in EP, apart from the Deans, since it is purely representative.<br><br>5) Precisely why we need to have Education separate from political machinations of adults - to prevent such oblique directions from influencing policies in undesirable ways. The issue of Economic Relevance will be solved by having the University Deans on the Council of Deans as rapporteurs and advisors to EP in general, in the sense that they will tell EP all the current trends, and most likely if teh students don't respond, the teachers will favourably. So there.<br><br>6) The following people are not included in EP: P 1-3 kids and Uni students. Like I said, EP will not provide representation to Uni Students. Since each university is unique in inclination, each will have its own quasi-EP made up of the Student Union/Society and the Lecturers' Union.<br><br>I believe that teachers may know what a student needs, but they can never know the need better than the student himself/herself. An easy example: a student cosntantly fails tests, so a teacher creates remedial; unfortunately, what the student requires is psychological counselling, becasue s/he is in a state of nervous breakdown and depression; yes, she needs academic help, but not so much as emotional help. But the ignorant teacher does not understand. So teh poor student gets remedial after remedial until she jmps and kills herself out of frustration that nobody understands her. And then, at coroner's inquiry, teacher says: Well, she should have told me. But the prob is teh teacher failed to see the most crucial sign of all in the first place.<br><br>And as I told you already, there will no longer be any more Ministry of Education!<br><br>why would they know better? because they are down on the ground experiencing it all, that's why! Isn't that common sense??? Now, that's an example of unique non-thinking. the reps still ahve their normal fucntions: student union reps still study and the teacher union reps still teach. SO tehy ahve the experience and probably can understand the situation better than a Minister who sits in an air-conditioned room reading reports, with perm-sec, and only coming out occasionally to pilot-test some new policy, without staying to observe the long-term results.<br><br>I don't intend the kids and teachers tob e politicians; I intend them to be leaders. Don't you understand this point????<br><br>So I still don't see why it is anti-relevant.<br><br>Kindly Qualify.<br><br>the (confused) pikamaster<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Elfred,<br><br>1) Actually, the point is - I don't really care if Singapore is unique or not. Uniqueness in size is extremely trivial if you want to look at the large picture. Uniqueness in development cannot really be used to justify policies crafted for the future.<br><br>In fact, Uniqueness is actually a very propagandic argument i.e. one that is more rhetoric than substance. And more dangerously, it can become a kind of wall to shield ourselves from teh outside world, the same way that papal infailiability doctrine has becoem a fortress for the Roman Catholic Church (and btw, I'm Roman Catholic myself) , such that even now the Vatican uses it as  front against protests against conservatism in the Church. And that seems to be exactly what Singapore is doing. Our alleged "uniqueness" has become a horrid veneer which the government uses as a fortress against "attacks" on its authority from the outside, whether local or foreign. Increasingly, the govenrment's arguments utilizing this "uniqueness" element have become flawed, because they fail to provide any other evidence other than this for that.<br><br>"Uniqueness" is an argument with much emotional appeal, but like any other emotional appeal, it lacks rational thought.</blockquote>Well, if you insist on that, what'd I have to say? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>2) You try to elevate yourself on a pedestal and look down to me from there, but as far as I see, you still haven't given me a proper explanation for which I can use to debunk my own arguments. You call me naiive and ignorant, but doesn't teh fact that you haven't yet responded with a proper set of explanation that I can understand (since I appear to be very lost) show that you too, are somewhat ignorant yourself?<br><br>And I shall make it clear, your position isn't enhanced by requests from you to ask me to meet you at YP.</blockquote>You sound as if I am trying you offer you something or debunk you. Nope, I obviously suggest you go ahead and try your ideas, Pikamaster. What proper explanation would you want, Pikamaster?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You see, Pikamaster, not that I have not tried to explain, but you have kinda miss or prefer to look at things in another way. If you insist on being so, it's up to you.<br><br>Me? Yup, I may be ignorant. It doesn't matter.<br><br><blockquote>3) What is necessity? Who decides what is necessary?<br><br>Necessity is defined as the want of a majority in any grouping. Since each grouping might be in a different situation, thus situation affects necessity. For eg, a neighbourhood school might need computers but an independent school would not sicne it already has them.<br><br>The more crucial question is: who decides what is necessary? That is always the stickler point in this kind of debate, and even in moral debates, like that over euthanasia.<br><br>I believe that a person would know his needs more than anyone else around him, even his parents, if he were given all the information about his situation. In fact, I aim to make transparency one of the key features of the system I'm designing. But of course, there are certain basic needs everyone must have: education, food, water, shelter. And that will of course be provided. And these are the basic kind of necessities I suppose.<br><br>I notice that our discussion/debate/argument has moved on to contend over the type of education a person needs, particularly the scope. The scope, as I have explained earlier, will be determined by students' decision. The issue of definitive wants and non-definitive wants will self-resolve. Non-definitive wants are wants that exist okeonly temporarily, fading off for wahtever reason there is. In line with following the student's passion, the student will be allowed to drop courses s/he is not interested in, or courses that s/he used to have interest, but lost interest in, later. So, non-definitive wants will be accomodated.<br><br>Saying that "Vagueness is the way it  has to be" conveys the impression that you don't really know so much about the subject matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </blockquote>No comment. So do as you see fit then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>4) I have told you - I'm not using loaded connotations of any word, merely using the neutral manner.<br><br>Industries do not share everything across the board, not externally at least. But at the same time, they do not share nothing at all, thus there are always stuff like joint projects between different companies, or sponsorships or something like that. For example, Software doesn't seem to ahve much to do with F&amp;B, but why then is Microsoft a stakeholder and sponsor of Coke?<br><br>Also, in an extremely interdependent world such as ours, firms increasingly have to consider more bottomlines than just one, like eg. a chemical firm has to know the environmental effects of it products. An educational firm needs to know the impact of its decisions on society i.e. what kind of people it is nurturing eg. A Northern Irish educational agency will have to ensure that its educaitonal layout does not bolster religious intolerance.<br><br>Anyway, education is not just about preparing people for a career, it's also about training them for life.</blockquote>Well...<br><br><blockquote>5) So what do you think are the other aspects that I have neglected? Facilities? People? All these interact with the systems. We need good initial people to run good systems, to ensure that the systems are good. But we need to produce good people from good systems too, so that the quality of the systems can be maintained, thus the system itself which is being run has to be good too.<br><br>How have I been derailed? qualify the statement please.</blockquote>I decided that it's not really workable for such exchange. Very simple, Pikamaster, your <span style="font-style: italic;">thinking</span> is carrying too much stint of the local Education system.<br><br>Well, what can I say but go and try, and re-read our exchange. You'd find little has changed.<br><br><blockquote>6) The rest? Yes, I anticipated that question.<br><br>The scenario is this currently: a student needs to get good grades in his PSLE in order to get into the SPorts School or a good Secondary School. Because favours (like integrated programmes and facilities and teachers) are given to good schools, the other schools lose out, and so only the top school students gain tremendously. What results is that at the next weeding-out-session, thsoe from the "top schools" come up top again, and sometimes we shouldn't even consider that. Since those who do extremely badly in Secondary School are forced by the system into a specific "Normal" stream, where opportunities are reduced, and not solely in the academic field, but in other stuff such as field trips etc., there is a reason for them to feel inferior and therefore  the term "losers" comes out. For example, they cannot go to the Sports School even if they are very good at sports, because the School tries to achieve "holistic development" despite the niche it has claimed for itself. So these "Normal" students have become discriminated by a system that compromises them on many opportunities that they may want because, adn solely because, of their assumed academic disability. Despite the fantastic ads put out by ITEC, even from a cursory glance at its website, you can see that it only gives courses in "technical skills" and "service skills"; clearly these do not offer very good job prospects. And the students would no doubt feel cheated (unless they are brainwashed YP pple), since they see the other better opportunities offered to their neighbours in polys or JCs. And of course, the meritocratic society is such that it awards the best jobs to those who are most academically qualified, and show, in your sense of definition, credible social aptitude. SO thus, we see the weakness.<br><br>In my system:  Every course is possible as a choice to the student, so everyone has equal footing. The student cannot blame anybody else except himself/herself if s/he does not take up a course s/he likes. In the sense, there is no such thing as "CMI" people, sicne everyone will be able to find something s/he can make it at, and achieve the best at it, whether it is art, sports, life science, econs or wahtever there is. Even if that person is just good at technical skills, at least he knows he is doing this because this is what s/he is truely good at, and not because this was the last option available to him/her. And no, I do not look down on technical skills. Everyone will have their won niche which they can find and like, so they do not have to involuntarily condition themselves into a line they dislike, and end up to be grumpy pple like some pple around these forums.<br><br>That there are "winners" and "losers" is merely a social mindset. Tell me, is Thomas Edison a winner or a loser? In our educational terms, frankly, he is a loser.<br><br>In otehr words, there is a win-win situation for everybody, becasue everybody can find a satisfying job.</blockquote>Sigh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Winners and losers are not merely what social mindsets. In fact, this mindset itself is a nothing about <span style="font-style: italic;">merely</span>. You have underestimated too much too far. If you don't join YP, it's your choice. Don't expect me to be too enlightening here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>6) hmmm...<br><br>There's that suggestion that you can go and retrain, or better still, take a double degree or triple degree or something. You'll only be left with no option if you do not have grounding in the other subject areas. But that will be what the system I'm proposing gives. so the job mobility will be greater in my new system.<br><br>the neutral definition I am using for "niche" is the biological one: a role and a position for the organism [person] in a system. I'm not including any factor of uniqueness within the defintion, as you see. So the only way a niche can become outdated is if that occupation becomes a vanishing trade.<br><br>But the point is, we will always need chemists, physicists, engineers, and the like. Even if we have a fully roboticized society, we still need engineers to run the robots and direct them what to do, or to improve on the design of robots, and their functionality for certain jobs. Not that that is so likely to happen in the next century, though we must keep an open mind. Life Sciences might die out, or dot-com may crash, but still it does not mean that biologists and IT specialists are not needed.<br><br>The only real danger comes when you get an ivory-tower graduate who knows nothing but the knowledge in his field. But the precise architecture of my system aims to prevent that, so there.<br><br>And if you wish to say that I didn't understand you, please provide qualification i.e. what you actually meant in plain English.</blockquote>Too simple... you're really assuming this Education thingy is some kinda production line. You see, there's a whole lot of issues you missed out. It isn't so simple as '...doesn't mean that X Y Z are not needed...'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Do you know that Singapore itself can also be a <span style="font-style: italic;">vanishing trade</span>? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>7) Ok... I shall make it clearer... the system will aim, through the environment it provides, to nurture people that can think in every field.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Please re-think.<br><br>9) Well, if I don't get it, it's becasue you have not explained it properly enough and completely enough.</blockquote>1st, systems don't think. What it produces seldom think because of systems. Actually the more you get successful due to systems, the more you don't think. But systems will make you have that illusion you're thinking.<br><br>2nd, I will never explained directly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If you ever read COE, you'd find that it's so hard to understand the more you are successful in the system. All you'd see is seas of words and some simple ideas (of what you think it is). If you can't think, reading my book will make you more and more confused. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>10) ???<br><br>11) Wrong. If it doesn't hit me, means that you don't understand what you claim to know fully, and hence are unable to explain to me. A great test of understanding is the ability to explain your understanding to other people who don't share the same understanding.</blockquote>That's what you assume.<br><br>Do you know how much time and people takes to understand what Einstein is thinking, for example? He'd have his own way of explaining, but not necessaily you'd understand fully. So Einstein don't understand what he claims cos he can't make you understand, or due to some reasons, keep to himself?<br><br>When MM was talking 'bout Malaysian Malaysia, instead of gaining recognition, he got hatred and misunderstanding, instigated or for what purpose.

The prevention of Houses from combining together is to improve effectiveness, rather than to kill it. It is to ensure that the leaders of teh Three Houses are kept separate and are not unduly influenced in any way prejudicial to the people they are representing. EP will function like IP; Misc will function as Parliament fucntions now. Like I believe, education and politics should not mix, just as wage-determination and politics should not mix. Healthcare and politics (such as anti-homosexual tendencies) should not mix either, but unfrotunately it's very hard to construct representation for hospital patients, sicne you can't really have a leader for patients, not in any sense I can think of anyway. The primary reason for the existence of government is to provide security for its citizens, so that's what is given to the House of the Miscellaneous. EP will be purely representative: feedback from students is directly reported by the EP reps. And it will still be efficient; there are many levels which these information pass through, adn each level will deal with stuff it can deal with: the class with class stuff, the council with campus-specific stuff. So only the stuff which these cannot deal with will be returned to the top-level EP. And since there is decentralisation, things can be dealt with more efficiently. the School of Languages will deal with syllabuses regarding its subjects, and so on; the deans will handle their sub-deans, who will handle the teachers. It is very effective in that sense. Likewise, Estate Management deals with all the non-syllabus stuff, adn teh Coordinator deals with Finance.<br><br>Sim Wong Hoo once said: in Singapore, talents are scarce only because SIngaporeans do not recognize talent. Anyway, we don't really need talent in EP, apart from the Deans, since it is purely representative.</blockquote>What Mr Sim said is quite true. I am gonna add something. The nation doesn't improve because of focus on economic or chasing what trend, it's because of talents (that Singapore won't recognise).<br><br>We're getting weaker and weaker because of this.<br><br><blockquote>5) Precisely why we need to have Education separate from political machinations of adults - to prevent such oblique directions from influencing policies in undesirable ways. The issue of Economic Relevance will be solved by having the University Deans on the Council of Deans as rapporteurs and advisors to EP in general, in the sense that they will tell EP all the current trends, and most likely if teh students don't respond, the teachers will favourably. So there.</blockquote>Gosh... you really think it's possible...? Hehehe...<br><br><blockquote>6) The following people are not included in EP: P 1-3 kids and Uni students. Like I said, EP will not provide representation to Uni Students. Since each university is unique in inclination, each will have its own quasi-EP made up of the Student Union/Society and the Lecturers' Union.<br><br>I believe that teachers may know what a student needs, but they can never know the need better than the student himself/herself. An easy example: a student cosntantly fails tests, so a teacher creates remedial; unfortunately, what the student requires is psychological counselling, becasue s/he is in a state of nervous breakdown and depression; yes, she needs academic help, but not so much as emotional help. But the ignorant teacher does not understand. So teh poor student gets remedial after remedial until she jmps and kills herself out of frustration that nobody understands her. And then, at coroner's inquiry, teacher says: Well, she should have told me. But the prob is teh teacher failed to see the most crucial sign of all in the first place.<br><br>And as I told you already, there will no longer be any more Ministry of Education!<br><br>why would they know better? because they are down on the ground experiencing it all, that's why! Isn't that common sense??? Now, that's an example of unique non-thinking. the reps still ahve their normal fucntions: student union reps still study and the teacher union reps still teach. SO tehy ahve the experience and probably can understand the situation better than a Minister who sits in an air-conditioned room reading reports, with perm-sec, and only coming out occasionally to pilot-test some new policy, without staying to observe the long-term results.<br><br>I don't intend the kids and teachers tob e politicians; I intend them to be leaders. Don't you understand this point????<br><br>So I still don't see why it is anti-relevant.<br><br>Kindly Qualify.<br><br>the (confused) pikamaster</blockquote>It's gonna be another misrepresented problematic parliament... no offence.<br><br>Let's just say, I can't agree with you.<br><br>I suppose I can't help you. Cos what I do, I dislike qualify this qualify that. You either let me help you do it, or not.<br><br>When next time you have a party of your own, maybe you'd understand certain thingy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>[a reply to your alst post regardign EP]<br><br>1) There must always be channels and mediums through which information is passed. In EP's case, the medium, or the "Gatekeeper" between EP and the House of the Miscellaneous is the coordinator. S/he does not decide, as you imply, but rather forwards the decisions made by the root to the Misc, and fights for the root's case as given to him. As in, before the Budget Debate, EP will meet and forecast what money they will need, with the help of economic analysts. EP will extract what is wanted from the Student populace, and the reps in EP will merely forward that in EP "debate". the "debaters" will come with observers, who will offer their views. But in the end, an indepednent committee of students and teachers who are not involved in the proceedings, will make the decision by voting. students and teachers in the committee will of coruse select before hand whoa re their substututes, and then the information will be chanelled to teh substitutes. Or even better, we have a Council of uni students who make the decision according to the points they beieve to be persuasive, and each voter votes independently; no voter-committee meeting.<br><br>Don't worry, OEA will finalize that point.<br><br>2) no, let's not forget it. Repeat your point and explain to me where I misunderstood it...<br><br>3) ok, I'm waiting for lesson#1. But please, I have a request: tell me what I should be and should do, not just what I should not be and should not do.<br><br>4)Agree with you. OMG, if we agree on the same basic principle, then y can't we agree on the specifics?<br><br>Yes, we need talent, but how are we going to achieve talent or identify talent? Are we going to try and do so by chance? I am simply trying to tell ypu, unless we have a procedure to follow, we'll be stuck without talent. And any procedure requires a system in which to function; In fact, the definition of a system is precisely a set of procedures by which to follow. And thus, we need a good procedure to produce good talent.<br><br>Look at Finland. Nokia was started by university students who were graduates, not school dropouts. Which proves that a good education system can produce talent.<br><br>How else to select or producetalent, let me ask you?<br><br>5) At least shielded from politicking. Yes, it's possible, because there are going to be very stringent rules of conduct, and these shall be enfoeced by no toehr institiution but the police, or as they shall be called, the House Guard.<br><br>Power play is the last thing wanted in Educational Parliament.<br><br>6) No offence taken.<br><br>Why will it be a misrepresented Parliament? you really think that adults know more about the kids or teens than the teens and kids themselves? Why then are there so many communciation breakdowns between generations today?<br><br>How is it misrepresented and problematic? Explain.<br><br>I want to have a true and genuine discussion; I want an open discussion, not one where you are trying to evade every single question by taking on an air of superiority.<br><br>I'm not asking you to qualify your stand for the sake of appeasing some sadistic curiosity of mine. I really want to understand what you are thinking, and what you feel [about the issue], and what makes you think the way you do.<br><br>This is merely to facilitate a better understanding so I can engage with you on the core stuff, isntead of spending time pruning the crown of the tree in an attempt  to find the worm in the sap. If you clearly relate to me the core of your thinking regarding this issue, then perhaps we can engage more properly, and we can start handling the real deep misunderstandings that we seem to be having about each others' positions.<br><br>I am speaking the above paragraph with utter sincerity. I really want to have a proper discussion/debate/lesson with you, and not a degenerate flaming competiiton like I ended up having with EC when he consigned himself to thinking I was an absolute idiot.<br><br>Honestly, I am having trouble engaging with you because you are not, to me, listing out your core arguments in plain sight, the way I have listed out mine to you for your scrutiny, which you ahve attacked many times without producing the concrete basis for your attack. No offence, but you seem to be hiding behind a mask of supposed wisdom more and more, and in fact it's becoming a wall. And walls are inimical to healthy conversation between any two parties. Walls are tehr eason why our nation does not make progress in terms of politics; our politicians scramble behind walls of "uniqueness", "Asian Values", "sensitivity", "social disharmony" to justify policies that are out of date or decisions that are irrelevant to the situation.<br><br>So I wish you to be more transparent please, so that I don't have to repeat this post again. If you want to be a good teacher, a good teacher has to be able to explain his student's mistakes in a way that the student will understand and not repeat them. The teacher has failed the student if teh student still repeats the same mistake, over and over again, which is precisely what you are implying I am doing.  Sadly, I don't understand your comments on my mistake. Yet, when I want you to explain, you either clsoe up, or ask me to refer to your previous explanations again, although obviously I don't understand those explanations, so they are of no use to me.<br><br>Oh, and btw, I consider transparency to be the requirement of a good leader. A good leader should not be one who hogs the limelight of "Finding the way" by himself always. This is not a leader; this is a dictator. His followers must understand the way in which he is going; he msut connect with them properly.<br><br>Hope there are no misgivings.<br><br>the (sincere) pikamaster (who wants to engage in a fruitful discussion which ends up in a benefit for myself and for you)<br><br>P.S.: most unfortuantely, we seem to be ending up in a debate, with neither side yielding his position. A debate where we are trying to push for the other to accept our POV, without even clarifying our own POV.  Each of us, in other words, is trying to outlast the other, and this is not aiding discussion adn pushing it forward. yes, I'll admit, I lapsed certain times too. So can be please rewind and resume our discussion on a proper, objective, fact-based note? I really want this discussion to yield truth, and not poor feeling on either side. I'm becoming increasingly disenchanted, I'm telling you frankly.Evasiveness really does not help discussion.</div>

We are vanishing, dear Pikamaster. Only that very few people are aware of it. You see, if we go the Robert way, no offence Robert, we'd be in big trouble.

Then we'd have to let the papers support the nation. It's not some charity that people will be grateful, my boy. No system in history will be thanksful. No system in history pushes nation to prosper. Dump what democracy or autocracy out of the picture first, it's always the talents that decide fate, and the system, if needs be.<br><br>You'd have to realise this point first, before you have your own party later on after your school. You can't rely on hoo-haas nor papers to do much.

In EP's case, the medium, or the "Gatekeeper" between EP and the House of the Miscellaneous is the coordinator. S/he does not decide, as you imply, but rather forwards the decisions made by the root to the Misc, and fights for the root's case as given to him. As in, before the Budget Debate, EP will meet and forecast what money they will need, with the help of economic analysts. EP will extract what is wanted from the Student populace, and the reps in EP will merely forward that in EP "debate". the "debaters" will come with observers, who will offer their views. But in the end, an indepednent committee of students and teachers who are not involved in the proceedings, will make the decision by voting. students and teachers in the committee will of coruse select before hand whoa re their substututes, and then the information will be chanelled to teh substitutes. Or even better, we have a Council of uni students who make the decision according to the points they beieve to be persuasive, and each voter votes independently; no voter-committee meeting.<br><br>Don't worry, OEA will finalize that point.<br><br>2) no, let's not forget it.

But their shared principle in waging war obviously didn't mean they'd agree on the specifics. See? This question is not appropriate.<br><br><blockquote>Yes, we need talent, but how are we going to achieve talent or identify talent? Are we going to try and do so by chance? I am simply trying to tell ypu, unless we have a procedure to follow, we'll be stuck without talent. And any procedure requires a system in which to function; In fact, the definition of a system is precisely a set of procedures by which to follow. And thus, we need a good procedure to produce good talent. </blockquote>It's rather pretty simple, Pikamaster. But the issue is not identify talents, it's how to handle talents.<br><br>Then in your ideal situation, whereby I definitely don't fulfill your system when I definitely sort of boycotted it, I'm much lousier than you and I'm not a talent.<br><br>And of course, there is one God in YPForum, the infamous Modeus who claimed to excel and so on, he'd be talent (eg) you'd need. Hahahahahahaha...<br><br>Very simple, Pikamaster, unless we have a proceedure that'd definitely return true, then you can claim this production of talents thingy. But, as I said, there is no such sure-win system nations can follow. And in reality, rules and proceedures usually end up stuckar in time changes that requires talents to override it. Which is why you have Singapore. MM and his batch sets the rules (eg) on religions and races, on your chances to get into education and so on. In their time, they set the rules, not rules set them. See?<br><br>Hence, where'd you expect talents to come from? Systems? <span style="font-style: italic;">No</span>, my dear.<br><br>No good proceedure can guarantee production of what good talents. Because the fundamental is Singapore is not a dominant in the world. Mr Sim WF is not a product of system/proceedure. He's a lucky victim, which makes his story so heroic. His talent doesn't come due to the system, else all who go through what he went through within the system would be Mr Sim WF-s already.<br><br>The '...unless we have a proceedure to follow...'  also implies you'd have a political issue over such belief/thinking. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Look at Finland.

The more stringent, the more the impact and magnitude possible.<br><br>If the police comes in, the politicians comes in on eithers. Politicians control the police (eg) by controlling the rules. And politicians make noise over the acts of the police. Someday, maybe you'd realise it.

You'd ask your teacher about it.<br><br>You see, it's very hard to ever make a balanced or well represented parliament for the matter.

Not so simple.<br><br><blockquote>I want to have a true and genuine discussion; I want an open discussion, not one where you are trying to evade every single question by taking on an air of superiority.</blockquote>There is no air of superiority, Pikamaster.

The system is never more perfect than the God who creates man. Hehehehe... Alright, (eg) in Singapore's context, it ends up that the <span style="font-style: italic;">talents</span> it produces is to support the system's existence and not the nation. Whereby, come on, the paper talents should generally cost lesser than what return obtainable.

What you are doing is not the way. Listing out what? I have nothing to list out in exchange, see?<br><br>One thing is correct, I have built that wall, just as I have installed a mechanism in COE to lock things up. You can <span style="font-style: italic;">sense</span> its there, just as the system would, but you can't reach it.<br><br>I beg a difference from your saying. The nation is not progressing where it should have been, because it's relying religiously on a system, instead of talents, to push it through. Technically, hehehe... there are no walls. The systems are very open. You score 8, who cares whether you think Singapore is Finland or USA or whatever, it's open to you. See? What wall?<br><br><blockquote>So I wish you to be more transparent please, so that I don't have to repeat this post again.

Sadly, I don't understand your comments on my mistake.

MOE has rejected me application, I suppose systematically. There's no need to even try educating what Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Not true. The teacher has necessarily not failed if the students repeat the same mistake in such environment, in such issue. Take MM vs Jamie Han as an example. MM's unable to convince Jamie Han doesn't mean LKY is a jerk or a failure. See? It's not necessarily means that the teacher will necessarily be bad, but when you end up ina certain situation or even a certain (incompatible) people, it's bonkers.

If I'd have to have any meagre chance of prospering the way Mr Sim WF could, I'd have to re-plant myself somehow elsewhere, after which I prospered, maybe can decide to follow Mr Sim who didn't migrate or just ensure my kids won't have my problems out there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>[a reply to your post about EP]<br><br>1) Ok. I shall withhold comments till later.<br><br>2) ok, point taken.<br><br>3) Sim WF came from HC, you know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Right, I shall agree that the core issue is how to handle talent. But what is "handle"? This word is vague.<br><br>Typically, (inform me if I am wrong), "handle" means : "identify", "identify/accomodate" and "promote". I'm not giving an ideal situation; I'm giving something which is understood as the norm as practical. We definitely need a method to identify the talents so that we can allow them to be harnessed effectively and independently, so that geniuses such as Mr Sim and Einstein are not shunned out of mainstream society. And when we ahve that method, we need a framework in which to implement it in. And the thing I am telling you is, once you ahve a method and a framework, you have a rudiimentary system. Therefore, to handle talent, as you put it, wes till need a system.<br><br>But anyway, You accuse me of being a product of the system. Guess what? The same accusation could be thrown back at you. Laughably, you have just proven yourself not to be a talent, since I don't think you can be in the same category as LKY, Einstein or SWF, or at least SWF. The quote I gave you was one SWF was using to say that Singaporeans are all talents, it's just tt none are treating themselves as so. And I know why he thinks that: 'cos anyboady can become an entrepreneur. The biggest hurdle to entrepreneurship is not lack of talent or lack of resources; teh biggest hurdle is the fear factor SWF mentioned and its accompanying inferiority complex. Or are you now going to say that he is not a thinking person?<br><br>Your precise definition and perception of talent comes from the system you claim you yourself are dissociated from. That idea of talent being a group of people isolated from the rest of society, having certain techniques or features that nobody else possesses. THis is elitist thinking, and this sort of elitist thinking unfortunately stems from the root of our education system.<br><br>Mind you, I DO think, and this is what I have surmised, no ofeence please:<br><br>you are somebody who has been brought up in an elitist system down here. The system here is called meritocratic, but I think you rightfully managed to imply that meritocracy is but a guise, since clearly the system is not properly identifyinh talent like Mr Sim, albeit you approached it from the incorrect side.<br><br>You have tried to break free of the system, which is commendable in itself. People like Mr Sim broke away from the system already; I guess it is simpler for them since they were rejected. I, too, have more or less dissevered myself from the system itself. I can assure you, wahtever I think of, that has been said in my previous posts don't at all come at all  from anyhting the system says, that is, what the teachers teach in the Core Curriculum, what I like calling the "Truth Core", which is a core of half-truths and fabricated facts. My dissociation comes from a personal feeling of estrangement and disillusionment, which I do not wish to discuss in further detail, since those are sensitive personal issues. But what I take note of, observe if you like, are people's feelings and attitudes, even the teachers' towards waht s/he is teaching. And my classmates' too. And of course I listen intentently to their experience. THinking doesn't come from thin air. You need something to think about.<br><br>But coming back to the issue, talent is not something that is either there or not there. it is something that needs to be nurtured. Think about it - There are the talents of Marie Curie and Karl Marx,  who studied at universities. There is the talent of Plato, who was tutored under Socrates.<br><br>What I recognize, like Einstein does, is that everything is relative to a common set of Fundamental Laws, and everything rests on a spectrum. There is no certainty apart from the certainty that there is no certainty. So for every skill, there is a proficiency spectrum. People whom you call "Talent", and whom btw, sry to deflate your ego, the system calls "Talent" too, are those who start off with a certain inborn level of proficiency in that particular skill. But like the story of teh Tortoise and the Hare, it is possible for tortoises in this sense to catch up with the hare. They might need to put in more effort than the hare, but if they are willing to work hard and expend time, they can still beat or at least catch up with the hare as the hare advances. Talent is not an absolute have or have-not. All you need is the right  environment, and you can develop any talent you want.<br><br>The reason why the perception of talent as a unique group exists is due to the fact, that we are pummelled, from an early age, to accept that only those at the top are those with ability and talent, which I am glad to say you have managed to throw away.<br><br>Unfortunately, you have substituted it with what American acclaimed political writer Alan Toffler (of whose works both me and Robert read) calls the "Messiah Complex", only in a different sense from what he refers to in his book.  Since you have removed the academic qualification that is used as the justification in the System, you replace it with some sort of "Invisible Hand" theory, which purports that talent exist, therefore they are, adn they do not fit inside any system. That, may I inform you, was the same type of crisis early Christians  faced. Saints exist, they beleived, and they do not fit into the Roman Social  System, so anyone who is a Christian cannot be a Roman. This was only partially resolved when Christianity became the State Religion. Even up till present though, Roman Catholic Church still has problems grappling with that issue.<br><br>The Messiah Complex does not help in secular matters either; in fact, that gives rise to irrestrained idealism or, as in your case, passive cynicism.<br><br>So look at things wiht a more open mind, please.<br><br>But I'm glad that you were transparent in sharing this fact.<br><br>4) see my above reply.<br><br>5) But Politicians cannot make noise if the Constitution does not allow them to, especially a Constitution that is permanent, subject to will of the public.

Without it, nothing can flourish.<br><br>You are hence right in recognizing the futility of our crappy system. The problem with our system is that it is a tight system that lacks requisite variety to deal with all the different kinds of people in it, thus resulting in that it cannot handle talent when talent arrives, and cannot utilize the talent which can help it improve. Look at the resistance to reforms in the Streaming System, for eg. But if the system can include a self-checking mechanism tt enables all the requisite variety of information to filter through, then it can succeed in transforming itself, or rather utilizing the thinkers to transform itself. Like everything else in SIngapore, Education is too authoritarian; as a result, it constantly resists steps in reform, which results in its deterioration.<br><br>The Problem with Education is complexity. It needs to deal with the academic and economic knowledge, as well as the social relationships. the fault of our current system is that it fails to note the social relationships, by simply ignoring the entire matter, and relegating students to mere economic units. Unsurprisingly, social relationships are the best way to engender change, especially healthy social relationships. Sadly, teh Minister, perm-sec and all teh officers choose most of the time to hole themselves out in their offices, poring through data analyses, which are grossly poor ways of formulating social relationships.<br><br>When there are good social relationships, people will be more able to communicate and be more open to each other, thus opening more chances to recognize true talent, rather than spend time, like what most  countrymen do now, grouching about teh state of affairs and the uncaringness of officials, whilst officials on their part grouch abt the insensibilities of the populace.<br><br>what we need to do is replace rigidity with informality.<br><br>What is COE anyway?

LKY was a visionary; unfortunately he is no longer one. Even he recognizes that: this is why he is giving the younger leaders a chance. But he is old, and a little stubborn too; he is fixed in the past, and henceforth does not see into the future,or rather, even when he sees into the future, he sees it from the eyes of the past instead of the eyes of the present. Jamie Han, from my perspective, was merely advocating progress which LKY doesn't recognize as such, not because he has some mysterious unique mystic insight or revelation that tells him as such, but becasue as an old man, he is highly resistant to change. So no, The Jamie-Han-LKY exchange does not show that LKY is a jerk or failure, but neither does it show that Jamie Han is a jerk or failure himself.<br><br>Besides, what they were having was not a lesson; it was unfortuantely a debate, where LKY was pushing his view as forcefully as possible, and han was perhaps doing the same.<br><br>12) They must understand what they are following.<br><br>ya, you are right in saying that it's not always true that the guy who follows will in any chance understand the guy who leads,but I'm talking about what should be, not what is.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Elfred,<br><br>[a reply to your post about EP]<br><br>1) Ok. I shall withhold comments till later.<br><br>2) ok, point taken.<br><br>3) Sim WF came from HC, you know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Right, I shall agree that the core issue is how to handle talent. But what is "handle"? This word is vague.<br><br>Typically, (inform me if I am wrong), "handle" means : "identify", "identify/accomodate" and "promote". I'm not giving an ideal situation; I'm giving something which is understood as the norm as practical. We definitely need a method to identify the talents so that we can allow them to be harnessed effectively and independently, so that geniuses such as Mr Sim and Einstein are not shunned out of mainstream society. And when we ahve that method, we need a framework in which to implement it in. And the thing I am telling you is, once you ahve a method and a framework, you have a rudiimentary system. Therefore, to handle talent, as you put it, wes till need a system.<br><br>But anyway, You accuse me of being a product of the system. Guess what? The same accusation could be thrown back at you. Laughably, you have just proven yourself not to be a talent, since I don't think you can be in the same category as LKY, Einstein or SWF, or at least SWF. The quote I gave you was one SWF was using to say that Singaporeans are all talents, it's just tt none are treating themselves as so. And I know why he thinks that: 'cos anyboady can become an entrepreneur. The biggest hurdle to entrepreneurship is not lack of talent or lack of resources; teh biggest hurdle is the fear factor SWF mentioned and its accompanying inferiority complex. Or are you now going to say that he is not a thinking person?<br><br>Your precise definition and perception of talent comes from the system you claim you yourself are dissociated from. That idea of talent being a group of people isolated from the rest of society, having certain techniques or features that nobody else possesses. THis is elitist thinking, and this sort of elitist thinking unfortunately stems from the root of our education system.<br><br>Mind you, I DO think, and this is what I have surmised, no ofeence please:<br><br>you are somebody who has been brought up in an elitist system down here. The system here is called meritocratic, but I think you rightfully managed to imply that meritocracy is but a guise, since clearly the system is not properly identifyinh talent like Mr Sim, albeit you approached it from the incorrect side.<br><br>You have tried to break free of the system, which is commendable in itself. People like Mr Sim broke away from the system already; I guess it is simpler for them since they were rejected. I, too, have more or less dissevered myself from the system itself. I can assure you, wahtever I think of, that has been said in my previous posts don't at all come at all  from anyhting the system says, that is, what the teachers teach in the Core Curriculum, what I like calling the "Truth Core", which is a core of half-truths and fabricated facts. My dissociation comes from a personal feeling of estrangement and disillusionment, which I do not wish to discuss in further detail, since those are sensitive personal issues. But what I take note of, observe if you like, are people's feelings and attitudes, even the teachers' towards waht s/he is teaching. And my classmates' too. And of course I listen intentently to their experience. THinking doesn't come from thin air. You need something to think about.<br><br>But coming back to the issue, talent is not something that is either there or not there. it is something that needs to be nurtured. Think about it - There are the talents of Marie Curie and Karl Marx,  who studied at universities. There is the talent of Plato, who was tutored under Socrates.<br><br>What I recognize, like Einstein does, is that everything is relative to a common set of Fundamental Laws, and everything rests on a spectrum. There is no certainty apart from the certainty that there is no certainty. So for every skill, there is a proficiency spectrum. People whom you call "Talent", and whom btw, sry to deflate your ego, the system calls "Talent" too, are those who start off with a certain inborn level of proficiency in that particular skill. But like the story of teh Tortoise and the Hare, it is possible for tortoises in this sense to catch up with the hare. They might need to put in more effort than the hare, but if they are willing to work hard and expend time, they can still beat or at least catch up with the hare as the hare advances. Talent is not an absolute have or have-not. All you need is the right  environment, and you can develop any talent you want.<br><br>The reason why the perception of talent as a unique group exists is due to the fact, that we are pummelled, from an early age, to accept that only those at the top are those with ability and talent, which I am glad to say you have managed to throw away.<br><br>Unfortunately, you have substituted it with what American acclaimed political writer Alan Toffler (of whose works both me and Robert read) calls the "Messiah Complex", only in a different sense from what he refers to in his book.  Since you have removed the academic qualification that is used as the justification in the System, you replace it with some sort of "Invisible Hand" theory, which purports that talent exist, therefore they are, adn they do not fit inside any system. That, may I inform you, was the same type of crisis early Christians  faced. Saints exist, they beleived, and they do not fit into the Roman Social  System, so anyone who is a Christian cannot be a Roman. This was only partially resolved when Christianity became the State Religion. Even up till present though, Roman Catholic Church still has problems grappling with that issue.<br><br>The Messiah Complex does not help in secular matters either; in fact, that gives rise to irrestrained idealism or, as in your case, passive cynicism.<br><br>So look at things wiht a more open mind, please.<br><br>But I'm glad that you were transparent in sharing this fact.<br><br>4) see my above reply.</blockquote>I don't suppose I'd comment on Education.<br><br>But about me brought up in this system... Hahahaha... I very much doubt so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>5) But Politicians cannot make noise if the Constitution does not allow them to, especially a Constitution that is permanent, subject to will of the public.

Constitution may even put a stop on the surface to certain thingy, but that doesn't mean nothing goes on.

There are many ways Singapore can renew itself.<br><br>Singapore has established itself as a Island state with some degree of success by the 1970s or so.<br><br>After 1970s, it has been a long and mostly fumbling downhill. From the 1980s, it was the middle and lower income who have to suffer the high costs due to high direct and indirect taxes and recovery of costs of services.<br><br>Singapore has not succeeded as a genuine vibrant economy. It has become over-dependent on foreign investors and the government sector is tifling the growth of its own domestic economy. The local economic sector is languishing from high costs and many of the SMEs and local businesses cannot survive.<br><br>People have become poorer due to bursting of the asset bubble. CPF savings meant for retirements were mostly wiped out. Wages have come down and CPF cut. Many foreigners are given preferences to take over jobs from the locals.<br><br>The constant manipulations of political participation process has totally stuffed the country of any political talents. The GRC election system and electoral boundary redrawings has totally killed off all political participation by the citizens.<br><br>Therefore it is now critical for the citizens to take stock of the current political manipulation and the system that taxes to the hilt and yet recovers all costs to full market prices.<br><br>The 7 points of democracy has been put together as a practical platform to assure citizens of political participation in a more level field, equity,  rule of law and accountable and transparent governance.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with democracy but through political manipulations, democracy has been made to look like a problem to frighten citizens of demand for open and accountable participation.<br><br>The state-controled media is singing the tune of the establishment with political justifications and presentations to make all government policies and decisions look good and cover up all shortcomings.<br><br>It is the people will now decide whether they want to continue to live with such a system of government - to stuff the people of political rights, and participation and at the end only to benefit the rich and the top echelons or elites. To do anything at all, people as a whole must decide whether they want to live in such a control system or do they want to move forward with greater democracy with people exercising their rights so that they will not become brainwashed or joining ruling party for the sake of personal benefits.<br><br>Decide on using your vote and do not get confused by the gerrymandeering or little immaterial benefits and go for change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The problems of autocracy, for example, may be solvable, but we just haven't come up with the solution yet. Democracy does have certain weaknesses like efficiency as mentioned in CrazyMonkey's thesis or Control by Popularity instead of Ability, as Elfred has pointed out, and thus it is not right to say that there is nothing wrong with democracy as a political system.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Pikamaster,<br><br>Elfred did not establish anything like you mentioned to my mind. I have repled to his various comments of advantages of other systems of government and found at the end that his reference to finding of good people  is not a system.<br><br>I am not so sure if Crazymonkey has established any points against democracy (the USA/UK model) either. If there exists a more advanced, progressive and equitable political system like democracy these gentlemen would have identified them but so far Elfred and Crazymonkey have not done so.<br><br>So it is clear to me that no other political system or system of government can offer the advantages rivaling those offered by democracy.<br><br>The nearest rival system like Socialism and Communism have weaken over time. Monarch has mostly been modified by now to more democratic forms. Autocracy and totalitarianism have lost their favor.<br><br>The truly democratic countries like USA, UK and EU are faring much better as compared with non-democratic countries all over the world as under such system of government the civic participation of people have brought about increased standards of living, advances in science and technologies and economic competitiveness and social cohesions.<br><br>If anyone wants to say anything adverse about democracy it is necessary to look at the big picture first before there can be reasonable comparison. So without such comparison when Elfred goes about saying the democracy is no good full of inefficiency or whatnot, his arguments do not necessarily establish that democracy is undesirable. If there is any points in his arguments, it is the fact that democracy is not perfect. It can be bent and manipulated to serve the purpose of the party in power. Finding of good people can be better done in a democratic system than one largely by chance as posted by him<br><br>So I would maintain that it is important to compare apple to apple when any comparison is to be made. Many have forgotten that we have started out as a democracy but it is now becoming autocratic and a closed system. Speeches and information are controlled. Rights to vote have been sidelined by GRC and electoral boundary redrawing etc.  It is necessary to evolve our system of pseudo-democracy to true democracy incorporating the 7 points posted so as to bring back the right ingredients to succeed in a democracy.<br><br>We have to iron out wrinkles and pockets of problems at working levels of democracy to prevent manipulation and powerplay within the system.<br><br>If there is no basis of comparison nothing can be established as there is no proper objective views about democracy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But, dear friend, even if contested, will (say) SDP surely win? It's still democracy. People's gotta vote when they gotta. </strong><br><br>China and Taiwan are opening up and democratising their governance as far as all can see. Mainland Chinese are enjoying more freedoms of speech and expression now compared with before. If you are claiming that it is practising autocracy and is succeeding as an autocracy think again. They are doing the reverse of autocracy now although it will take time for it to eventually democratise. Therefore it is not borne out by fact that China has succeeded as an autocracy. At least it does not have to confine speakers to a speaker corner or control the newspapers the way we do. They don't sue citizens for standing for election. It is not correct to assume too that Mahathir has succeeded as an autocracy. Mahathir has openly admitted that democracy is still the best political system in a speech delivered to the Management University of Singapore in 2004. Have Suharto practised democracy during the 7 terms he was in power in Indonesia. You have ascribed to Indonesia as a democratic country during Suharto and therefore claimed failure of democracy in Indonesia. Go and check your facts again. Indonesia has not practised democracy during the whole period. It has some sorts of election of president that is all but there was no practice of all other features of democracy during Suharto in respect of decisions of government which was run on president's edicts. So let me correct your wrong assumptions about Mahathir and Suharto.<br><br>From the above-stated facts it should be clear to you that your assumption that China has successfully pursued autocracy or what-have-you or that autocracy has been successful in China or Taiwan is a wrong assumption. For one thing, if autocracy has succeeded in China why is it moderning and democratising.<br><br><strong>Again, what I still am saying is... don't trust system religiously.</strong><br><br>Reply: Of course every system needs men to run it. So when you keep saying that our system is a system based on chance occurrence of good men or good fortune of finding good men, it does not prove anything - whether autocracy is a good system, chance finding of good men will continue.<br><br>What we have been looking at here: is autocracy a better system than democracy based on established USA/UK model to provide objective and good corporate governance.<br><br>Since autocracy up to this point in our discussion is explainable by finding of good men it is therefore clearly not a system or sustainable system. Therefore what you have earlier admitted is correct. It is merely self-centredness or chance occurrence.<br><br>Democracy has been well established over the past four centuries. Many more countries are following democracy even China a traditional communist country. Democracy offers a good objective and accountable governance that can be sustained not autocracy or system based on a few good men.<br><br>In our case the claim so far made by protagonists of autocracy is that it has succeeded. If autocracy is so sure that it can sustain itself effectively, why not just run everything by edicts.<br><br>The principal problem with autocracy is that good men too have private agendas and self-interests. How are the good men to be completely trusted to ensure that they will not govern to benefit themselves or their followers or cronies ? So when you claim that systems are not perfect men are worse, don't you see? A momentary self-interests in any decision may ruin the whole country and undo any good works under an autocracy.<br><br>The fact our autocracy has to be couched somewhat in democratic westminister style of election and legislative processes shows clearly that by it is not capable of standing on its own right. Good people are needed to run the system but under autocracy, it cannot find enough good people to run complex modern-day knowledge-based economy at all levels. We are now badly short of entrepreneurs to keep it going and competitive in this new knowledge-based world.<br><br><strong>Yeah... many people have, unthinkingly, proudly boast of our good, marvelous system. If the system is so good, why need People? Why need PAP? Why need WP or SDP or what party? Any donkey can be in power cos there...! There we have the gold-sent system.</strong><br><br>Reply: Your definition of success of our system of pseudo-democracy or autocracy is weak and unsubstantiated. We may want to boast to the outside world that we are clean and corruption free but we are over-paying the whole governing elitism resulting in a high-cost problem weighing heavily on the people. People are going through a hard time with lower standard of living due to dropping wages and bursting of assets. Look again at the 20 problems of autocracy as posted to think again whether our leaders can justifiably claim that we have succeeded as a country. I would agree that it has succeeded at one time up to 1970s. Since then the economy has been becoming very uncompetitive and people are suffering from high costs and lower wages.<br><br>The government can claim whatever success it still can command purely because it has been able to run a tax-and-recover system of governance. People are struggling to keep maintaining the high costs of the governance. The convoluted self-justified picture painted on the canvas of controlled media is certainly not a success.<br><br><strong>But the truth is... system is not definitely gonna give you what prosperity than the promise it's definitely made to offer. It's as if believing facts and figures and you won't make many wrongs. But that's the biggest error to be made. Cos neither man nor system are gods. </strong><br><br>REPLY: In the same vein, if system is no god neither is man god. This is a superfluous statement.<br><br><strong> So I am satisfied believing good people to do good things, not what systems or Gods. There's no best system to get good people or remove lousy people, cos black cat white cat, cat which catch mices is good cat. Democratic removal or selection, rebellions,  natural take over, promotions bla bla bla. No best fixed way, or system. Only good people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos there's no such thingy as best, nor perfect.</strong><br><br>REPLY: Of course we know why you and the incumbent are self-satisfied with the present system of autocracy. It is so obvious that I do not have to give any reason.<br><br><strong>Best man only occur in wedding ceremony, and that's just a title, not a specie.</strong><br><br>Good luck or good fortune has nothing to do with good corporate governance or political system. Autocracy has no right of place among political system. If it is a chance occurrence as you have admitted earlier then you cannot recommend it to be something we should rely on for evolving or self-renewal. If is doubtful autocracy will survive in a knoweledge-based new world where everything happens very fast due to accelerating advancements of technology.<br><br>Under such conditions, a few good men at the top is insufficient as such a new world economy needs the applications of knowledge and new technology by the masses and practically every citizen. Any country that cannot succeed in motivating and unleashing the talents of people as a whole simply cannot catch up.<br><br>Our autocratic system is one that is based on taxing citizens at the highest market value for housing and vehicle ownership and utilities etc with corporatization to the highest possible fees and charges to recover all government costs. Such a pay-and-pay governance have resulted in government running up good surpluses which it claim to be primary factor of succcess.<br><br>People are suffering from high costs of living and the domestor business sector are languishing from loss of competitiveness. Bankruptcies are now at the highest in history. There is still an absence of truly competitive and entrepreneurial economic master plan to take the economy to the next level. Real leadership abilities have to be satisfying to the people not the media or self-justifications. The lack of true ability to handle the economy was clearly reflected in the general helplessness during the last two decades.<br><br>Please get real for once and not utter good presentations or justifications.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>[to your reply regarding EP - well, supposed to be regarding it anyway]<br><br>1) Well, what were you brought up in then? Or perhaps you were brought up in Europe or elsewhere in Asia?<br><br>2) Yes, I do know the maxim "rules are made to be broken". Ok, I'm calling it a constitution, but I have realized, as I started writing it, as there were many tacit rules, customs and traditions if you like (not ethnic and religious ones) that needed to be established first, and the procedures for their establishment fall within a certain grey area which Law can do very little to reach. So the law is meant to provide a framework in which these kind of traditions and rules of engagement (not formal ones) can be established as a subtender of an informal network. The end result, the network, in strict technical sense would be considered a system, but in the terms that we (more often you than I) have been using in this discussion, the network will not be a formal rigid bureaucratic system that you have raised intense criticism about. Indeed, bureaucracy is usually self-defeating. But the inherent characteristic of a network is of its extensibility, what I call the plugin capability. It can integrate new things fast. We don't need to look far for examples. Treat this forum as some kind of network. At certain times, though not always, the forum here receives news faster apparently than the main media outlets. SPH disseminates news slower than all the independent news forums throughout the net. Editorials you can receive on the online NYT at 5.00 pm on Monday, if they are used, will only appear at 6.00 am on Tuesday's Straits Times. Of course, everybody knows that the media in Singapore is merely one large bureaucracy.<br><br>The new (intellectual) Act is meant not so much to regulate and restrain, which would result in politicking as you ahve suggested, but to provide a basis upon which preliminary informal structures can be built. Remember, the atmosphere within any school is mainly informal. Yes, there is the formal interaction of the teachers teaching the students, and perhaps of prefectorial boards or student  councils issuing directives. But at the lowest level, the classrooms, there is a large amount of informality. Teachers can joke and chat with students, and get to know them better. Students can interact with each other and perform peer pressure for favours to be bequeathed, at the same time making friends. of course, friendship is significantly built upon fulfilment of requests. These informal networks are built out of the individual's desire to assimilate into his/her peer group, (so that homework can be copied easily<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) as well as the desire to maintain a certain level of independence: obviously friends will agree to give each other some privacy in certain matters. What EP, and by extension the news edcuational framework I'm proposing, aims to do is to build upon these ties and links and more importantly link up all these networks, which are currently disseparate even within a single school, into one large network to facilitate interaction between students, and henceforth cementing of better ties, which would no doubt bolster harmony. As seen from posts at the various political dsicussion forums , and even school discussion boards like TJC's, and from feedback to the papers and to the online feedback unit, we can see that forced collective events (such as CIP) and the streaming system engendered by the bureaucracy of MOE is not very effective in bolstering such social harmony. In fact, the latter seems to have resulted in the growth of a highly elitist class, which despite the romantic notions of the Ministry, is clearly not beneficial for society in the social sense. In teh former, students from the same school, and in fact, from the same class or CCA group trend to band together, by tacit agreement or by their schools' logistical decisions. This is not very good in bolstering informal networks, which are the fastest manner in which information can be spread nowadays, especially with the incidence of SMS's and emails.<br><br>Thus, in that spirit, I think I'll rename EP to EC - the Educational Conference or Convention, which will be much more of a dialogue body than a debative body.<br><br>Futher down the level, there will be stuff like the Monthly General Assembly of the School, presided over, though not controlled by, the Estate Manager, replacement to the HM and DHM, who is complemented by the Representatives of Knowledge.<br><br>Lowest down, there will be the IEGCs - Integrated Education Group Committees, student committees which fucntion at classroom level, with the normal monitor, secretary and treasurer, though each has different processes of selection: monitor by weighted voting, secretary by random selection, and treasurer by standard majority. But ya, classroom decisions will still naturally be held in discussive format, since there is always implicit peer pressure within a school environment. This peer pressure will counteract forces of politics, which would mainly be student politics of popularity. Besides, there won't be practical influence by the IEGC on decision-making, except as like any other student.<br><br>3) ??? don't see any relation to the quote.<br><br>4) indeed, indeed.<br><br>5) ok...but...<br><br>6) Well, COE can't be the proper full name of your book right? I ahve friends in YP; if you tell me the name of the book, I will ask them to get it for me, then I can read it and comment on it.<br><br>authoritarian implies an attitude, and only thinking sentient beings can have attitudes, and thus can be good or evil. A system is like fire, entities which does not naturally possess any attitudes.

The education system selects "talent" and propels them into the control centers.So of course, there is no good talent, but this is due to a poor selection function in the educational system. The System has been done by people, but these people have been selected to be incorporated into the running of the System by the System itself. That is the complexity of edcuation's relationship with the rest of society.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> true.<br><br>9) Hmmm...don't Great-standard lawyers do great-standard one-side pushing as well?

It's as if believing facts and figures and you won't make many wrongs. But that's the biggest error to be made.

There's no best system to get good people or remove lousy people, cos black cat white cat, cat which catch mices is good cat. Democratic removal or selection, rebellions,  natural take over, promotions bla bla bla. No best fixed way, or system. Only good people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos there's no such thingy as best, nor perfect.<br><br>Best man only occur in wedding ceremony, and that's just a title, not a specie.</div></blockquote>Elfred,<br><br>1) neither. It is a pseudo-democracy, somewhere in-between, though closer to the side of autocracy.<br><br>2) Democracy? I thought Suharto came to power in a military coup???<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>3) Yo, who said that Malaysia was a democracy? Singapore and Malaysia and Indonesia are similar in many aspects politically. None fo the three are true democracies in the way Philiippines or UK is.<br><br>4) It is very frustrating that people who treat democracy as anarchy always cannot see beyond the same few examples. Oh, and your depiction of Taiwan isn't very accurate either. My Taiwanese friend told me that Jiang Jie Shi's tiem and the time that his son ruled in Taiwan through elections was a good time for Taiwan; in fact, Taiwan was very close to, if not in, the Five Dragons of Asia, Singapore was one too, in case you forgot. The havoc only actually started recently when CSB came to power. It was not perpetually there since 1950s. She lived and grew up in Taiwan; she should know. And oh well, actually she is one of my mother's friends.<br><br>5&amp;6) no comment.<br><br>7) I thought you are smart enough to know?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ...<br><br>9) lol. What is "overshooting" and "catching up" to you? China is catching up in economy, yes, but is it catching up socially? Look at wealth disparity; look at poor rural people; look at the mining accidents and poor provisions for workers' welfare in factories; of course, low literacy rate; Look at how CCP handled SARS. China is not catching up in ALOT of things, and in fact economic success which is overwhelming might just be its downfall. Guess why they are trying to curb inflation.<br><br>10) i'll leave Robert to answer this; actually I think he already has.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>11) Who knows? People vote because they want to, not because they "gotta".<br><br>12) Well then, don't trust people too religiously either. To be good, we need both satisfactory people and satisfactory system; no aiming for ideals here.<br><br>13) haha...actually Elfred, I just realized that both of us, in our earlier discussion, forgot one thing: People are part of the System too. if they are running the procedures of the system, they are part of the system since they are the inputs to the system; A system consistes of inputs, processes and outputs.<br><br>So I'll throw back at you: System? why need system? Why do pple like LKY and Jefferson and Qin Shi Huang spend so much time to create systems which are bound to fail anyway, if what you say is true? We can just dump one set of people in no particular order and one good leader together in a mish-mash and expect success in whatever terms we wish to put forth... after-all, we have the god-sent leader.<br><br>Or put it another way: The last Emperor of China came up with the wonderful Hundred Days of Reform Plan to modernize China; he was a visionary indeed, who managed to see what needed to be done. in other words, he possessed all the qualities of a leader you have mentioned. he had the political courage, foresight, flexibility etc., but Yet the Plan couldn't be implemented successfully. The Monarchical System postulated that the Empress Dowager had teh most power to reject regualtions in the system, as she was the one who gave birth to the Dragon or Son of Heaven. And unfortuantely, the Empress wasn't a Good leader; she alcked all the qualities her son ahd, and hencedforth rejcted all the plans for reform wholesale. If the Emperor had managed to implement the plan w/o resistance, China would be better off and the Qing Dyanasty probably would have survived till today. The Emperor had the political will; he still implemented a significant deal of reforms despite opposition from the Dowager, but the Dowager exercised her power given by the System to hamper the reform process, such that in the end many reforms were half-complete or twisted into something else entirely. So you see, having a good leader in a system that blocks him from leading is definitely not equivalent to success.<br><br>14&amp;15) Right, statistics are not all the story. But I have refrained from giving statistics; what I've been telling you are down-to-earth situations.<br><br>16) Don't you catch your own irony? By using "good" in the context you're using it in, you have been consistently implying that the people you are having as leaders are perfect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But in the same way, as I did above, I can turn your statement against you though modified slightly:-<br><br>There is no best person to get good people or bad people or good systems or bad systems; black cat or white cat, as long as it catches the mouse, it is a good cat. Regardless of academic qualification or lack thereof, regardless of race, language, religion, age, gender, sexuality, level of experience, supposed creativity and thinking ability, regardless of personal background or lack thereof, regardless of wealth and popularity, as long as a person can identify and solve problems and come up with proper procedures of prevention that work in practice and fulfill the aim(s) s/he has, s/he is a good leader, cos black cat white cat, any cat that catches mice is a good cat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos there's no such thingy as best, nor perfect.<br><br>17) Indeed, indeed. That is something for you to remember. 'Cos the only constant in this world is change. There is no person that can be a good leader universally for all eras, just like there are no systems that can be perpetually effective successes. Everything must change in time. Good people do not always stay good forever; like everything, including systems, they decay. Look at LKY. From the fiery visionary progressive in 1959 arguing for social change, he has deteriorated into the conservative fighting for the status quo in 2005. Thus, good leaders select good leaders to surround them only when they are in their prime. After the prime, you get people like Tharman and Raymond Lim and Vivian Balakrishnan coming up as "potential leaders", people who don't know the true way to connect with others, and thus only seek to maintain the status quo.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

But, dear friend, even if contested, will (say) SDP surely win? It's still democracy. People's gotta vote when they gotta. </strong><br><br>China and Taiwan are opening up and democratising their governance as far as all can see. Mainland Chinese are enjoying more freedoms of speech and expression now compared with before. If you are claiming that it is practising autocracy and is succeeding as an autocracy think again. They are doing the reverse of autocracy now although it will take time for it to eventually democratise. Therefore it is not borne out by fact that China has succeeded as an autocracy. At least it does not have to confine speakers to a speaker corner or control the newspapers the way we do. They don't sue citizens for standing for election. It is not correct to assume too that Mahathir has succeeded as an autocracy. Mahathir has openly admitted that democracy is still the best political system in a speech delivered to the Management University of Singapore in 2004. Have Suharto practised democracy during the 7 terms he was in power in Indonesia. You have ascribed to Indonesia as a democratic country during Suharto and therefore claimed failure of democracy in Indonesia. Go and check your facts again. Indonesia has not practised democracy during the whole period. It has some sorts of election of president that is all but there was no practice of all other features of democracy during Suharto in respect of decisions of government which was run on president's edicts. So let me correct your wrong assumptions about Mahathir and Suharto.<br><br>From the above-stated facts it should be clear to you that your assumption that China has successfully pursued autocracy or what-have-you or that autocracy has been successful in China or Taiwan is a wrong assumption. For one thing, if autocracy has succeeded in China why is it moderning and democratising.<br><br><strong>Again, what I still am saying is... don't trust system religiously.</strong><br><br>Reply: Of course every system needs men to run it. So when you keep saying that our system is a system based on chance occurrence of good men or good fortune of finding good men, it does not prove anything - whether autocracy is a good system, chance finding of good men will continue.<br><br>What we have been looking at here: is autocracy a better system than democracy based on established USA/UK model to provide objective and good corporate governance.<br><br>Since autocracy up to this point in our discussion is explainable by finding of good men it is therefore clearly not a system or sustainable system. Therefore what you have earlier admitted is correct. It is merely self-centredness or chance occurrence.<br><br>Democracy has been well established over the past four centuries. Many more countries are following democracy even China a traditional communist country. Democracy offers a good objective and accountable governance that can be sustained not autocracy or system based on a few good men.<br><br>In our case the claim so far made by protagonists of autocracy is that it has succeeded. If autocracy is so sure that it can sustain itself effectively, why not just run everything by edicts.<br><br>The principal problem with autocracy is that good men too have private agendas and self-interests. How are the good men to be completely trusted to ensure that they will not govern to benefit themselves or their followers or cronies ? So when you claim that systems are not perfect men are worse, don't you see? A momentary self-interests in any decision may ruin the whole country and undo any good works under an autocracy.<br><br>The fact our autocracy has to be couched somewhat in democratic westminister style of election and legislative processes shows clearly that by it is not capable of standing on its own right. Good people are needed to run the system but under autocracy, it cannot find enough good people to run complex modern-day knowledge-based economy at all levels. We are now badly short of entrepreneurs to keep it going and competitive in this new knowledge-based world.<br><br><strong>Yeah... many people have, unthinkingly, proudly boast of our good, marvelous system. If the system is so good, why need People? Why need PAP? Why need WP or SDP or what party? Any donkey can be in power cos there...! There we have the gold-sent system.</strong><br><br>Reply: Your definition of success of our system of pseudo-democracy or autocracy is weak and unsubstantiated. We may want to boast to the outside world that we are clean and corruption free but we are over-paying the whole governing elitism resulting in a high-cost problem weighing heavily on the people. People are going through a hard time with lower standard of living due to dropping wages and bursting of assets. Look again at the 20 problems of autocracy as posted to think again whether our leaders can justifiably claim that we have succeeded as a country. I would agree that it has succeeded at one time up to 1970s. Since then the economy has been becoming very uncompetitive and people are suffering from high costs and lower wages.<br><br>The government can claim whatever success it still can command purely because it has been able to run a tax-and-recover system of governance. People are struggling to keep maintaining the high costs of the governance. The convoluted self-justified picture painted on the canvas of controlled media is certainly not a success.<br><br><strong>But the truth is... system is not definitely gonna give you what prosperity than the promise it's definitely made to offer. It's as if believing facts and figures and you won't make many wrongs. But that's the biggest error to be made. Cos neither man nor system are gods. </strong><br><br>REPLY: In the same vein, if system is no god neither is man god. This is a superfluous statement.<br><br><strong> So I am satisfied believing good people to do good things, not what systems or Gods. There's no best system to get good people or remove lousy people, cos black cat white cat, cat which catch mices is good cat. Democratic removal or selection, rebellions,  natural take over, promotions bla bla bla. No best fixed way, or system. Only good people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos there's no such thingy as best, nor perfect.</strong><br><br>REPLY: Of course we know why you and the incumbent are self-satisfied with the present system of autocracy. It is so obvious that I do not have to give any reason.<br><br><strong>Best man only occur in wedding ceremony, and that's just a title, not a specie.</strong><br><br>Good luck or good fortune has nothing to do with good corporate governance or political system. Autocracy has no right of place among political system. If it is a chance occurrence as you have admitted earlier then you cannot recommend it to be something we should rely on for evolving or self-renewal. If is doubtful autocracy will survive in a knoweledge-based new world where everything happens very fast due to accelerating advancements of technology.<br><br>Under such conditions, a few good men at the top is insufficient as such a new world economy needs the applications of knowledge and new technology by the masses and practically every citizen. Any country that cannot succeed in motivating and unleashing the talents of people as a whole simply cannot catch up.<br><br>Our autocratic system is one that is based on taxing citizens at the highest market value for housing and vehicle ownership and utilities etc with corporatization to the highest possible fees and charges to recover all government costs. Such a pay-and-pay governance have resulted in government running up good surpluses which it claim to be primary factor of succcess.<br><br>People are suffering from high costs of living and the domestor business sector are languishing from loss of competitiveness. Bankruptcies are now at the highest in history. There is still an absence of truly competitive and entrepreneurial economic master plan to take the economy to the next level. Real leadership abilities have to be satisfying to the people not the media or self-justifications. The lack of true ability to handle the economy was clearly reflected in the general helplessness during the last two decades.<br><br>Please get real for once and not utter good presentations or justifications.

It is a pseudo-democracy, somewhere in-between, though closer to the side of autocracy.</blockquote>So what it's pseudo or liberal democracy...? Hehehehe...<br><br>Closer side to autocracy? Like how? By the way, exactly which sphere I have laid are you drawing your conclusion from? China (as Robert was shooting at)?<br><br><blockquote>2) Democracy? I thought Suharto came to power in a military coup???<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></blockquote>That's what you thought. Many people said many things. But surely, he didn't have seven coups for seven terms. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>3) Yo, who said that Malaysia was a democracy? Singapore and Malaysia and Indonesia are similar in many aspects politically. None fo the three are true democracies in the way Philiippines or UK is.</blockquote>Hahahaha... Wait wait wait... You know (eg) the Third way is not exactly the same as the 3rd way, just as the state and nation is not exactly the same.<br><br>What Malaysia was not democracy? You mean before Mahathir or post-Mahathir??? Do you know what is 'democracy' in the first place?<br><br><blockquote>4) It is very frustrating that people who treat democracy as anarchy always cannot see beyond the same few examples. Oh, and your depiction of Taiwan isn't very accurate either. My Taiwanese friend told me that Jiang Jie Shi's tiem and the time that his son ruled in Taiwan through elections was a good time for Taiwan; in fact, Taiwan was very close to, if not in, the Five Dragons of Asia, Singapore was one too, in case you forgot. The havoc only actually started recently when CSB came to power. It was not perpetually there since 1950s. She lived and grew up in Taiwan; she should know. And oh well, actually she is one of my mother's friends.</blockquote>???<br><br>Don't just listen to your Taiwan friend, Pikamaster. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> And please stay focus of what I am talking about. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>5&amp;6) no comment.<br><br>7) I thought you are smart enough to know?</blockquote>???<br><br><blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ...<br><br>9) lol. What is "overshooting" and "catching up" to you? China is catching up in economy, yes, but is it catching up socially? Look at wealth disparity; look at poor rural people; look at the mining accidents and poor provisions for workers' welfare in factories; of course, low literacy rate; Look at how CCP handled SARS. China is not catching up in ALOT of things, and in fact economic success which is overwhelming might just be its downfall. Guess why they are trying to curb inflation.</blockquote>Are you preferring them to stay the way they were 30years back? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>10) i'll leave Robert to answer this; actually I think he already has.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>11) Who knows? People vote because they want to, not because they "gotta".<br><br>12) Well then, don't trust people too religiously either. To be good, we need both satisfactory people and satisfactory system; no aiming for ideals here.<br><br>13) haha...actually Elfred, I just realized that both of us, in our earlier discussion, forgot one thing: People are part of the System too. if they are running the procedures of the system, they are part of the system since they are the inputs to the system; A system consistes of inputs, processes and outputs. </blockquote>Nay. I didn't forget. Which is, if you re-read again, I did mentioned something as 'system doing people or people doing system'. It seems people, not only you, don't digest beyond reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  No offence.<br><br><blockquote>So I'll throw back at you: System? why need system? Why do pple like LKY and Jefferson and Qin Shi Huang spend so much time to create systems which are bound to fail anyway, if what you say is true? We can just dump one set of people in no particular order and one good leader together in a mish-mash and expect success in whatever terms we wish to put forth... after-all, we have the god-sent leader.</blockquote>No need to throw back what question. MM's system, people are talking about it now. Qi Shi Huang, his system never last his empire beyond his second generation. Jefferson (if you are refering to the 1st US Secretary of State), I don't think he is a good example, he's more of/associated with ideology than a stuckar system.<br><br>I never say we should dump what set of people and one good leader. And expect success. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I suppose you miss the point.<br><br><blockquote>Or put it another way: The last Emperor of China came up with the wonderful Hundred Days of Reform Plan to modernize China; he was a visionary indeed, who managed to see what needed to be done. in other words, he possessed all the qualities of a leader you have mentioned. he had the political courage, foresight, flexibility etc., but Yet the Plan couldn't be implemented successfully. The Monarchical System postulated that the Empress Dowager had teh most power to reject regualtions in the system, as she was the one who gave birth to the Dragon or Son of Heaven. And unfortuantely, the Empress wasn't a Good leader; she alcked all the qualities her son ahd, and hencedforth rejcted all the plans for reform wholesale. If the Emperor had managed to implement the plan w/o resistance, China would be better off and the Qing Dyanasty probably would have survived till today. The Emperor had the political will; he still implemented a significant deal of reforms despite opposition from the Dowager, but the Dowager exercised her power given by the System to hamper the reform process, such that in the end many reforms were half-complete or twisted into something else entirely. So you see, having a good leader in a system that blocks him from leading is definitely not equivalent to success. </blockquote>Wait a minute, Pikamaster. You seem to mix puppet and leader in this instance... (???) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Besides, don't defocus on the issue, System vs Good People.<br><br>In that time, the system is itself a whole huge load/burden on good people. It only serves my point.<br><br><blockquote>14&amp;15) Right, statistics are not all the story. But I have refrained from giving statistics; what I've been telling you are down-to-earth situations.</blockquote>Emm... I suggest, sincerely and no mischief, you get help on history.<br><br><blockquote>16) Don't you catch your own irony? By using "good" in the context you're using it in, you have been consistently implying that the people you are having as leaders are perfect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But in the same way, as I did above, I can turn your statement against you though modified slightly:-<br><br>There is no best person to get good people or bad people or good systems or bad systems; black cat or white cat, as long as it catches the mouse, it is a good cat. Regardless of academic qualification or lack thereof, regardless of race, language, religion, age, gender, sexuality, level of experience, supposed creativity and thinking ability, regardless of personal background or lack thereof, regardless of wealth and popularity, as long as a person can identify and solve problems and come up with proper procedures of prevention that work in practice and fulfill the aim(s) s/he has, s/he is a good leader, cos black cat white cat, any cat that catches mice is a good cat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos there's no such thingy as best, nor perfect.</blockquote>I never said there are perfect man or woman, you have missed the point again. In fact, I have said, just, that <span style="font-style: italic;">best man is a title, not a specie</span>.<br><br>Wait wait wait, Pikamaster, you have exhibit a too unstable foundation and totally miss the points. Discussion cannot go on with total misunderstanding.<br><br><blockquote>17) Indeed, indeed. That is something for you to remember. 'Cos the only constant in this world is change. There is no person that can be a good leader universally for all eras, just like there are no systems that can be perpetually effective successes. Everything must change in time. Good people do not always stay good forever; like everything, including systems, they decay. Look at LKY. From the fiery visionary progressive in 1959 arguing for social change, he has deteriorated into the conservative fighting for the status quo in 2005. Thus, good leaders select good leaders to surround them only when they are in their prime. After the prime, you get people like Tharman and Raymond Lim and Vivian Balakrishnan coming up as "potential leaders", people who don't know the true way to connect with others, and thus only seek to maintain the status quo.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>the pikamaster</blockquote>True. The one constant is change. That's the basic principle of Chaotic Righteous people as myself. But the way you get your conclusion is quite chaotic itself... Which is not Chaotic Righteous... Whatever.<br><br>Emm... No comment, for good reasons, on the names mentioned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Gosh... Where did you guys get your thinking on politics one???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elfred,<br><br>[on our third discussion thus far]<br><br>1) A pseudo-democracy is a country with a facade of democratic structures eg. the ballot box, courtrooms, a press that does not contain working govt officials in uniform etc., but operates in practice like an autocracy i.e. Govt owns most of the press, has overly strict libel laws that crush opposition, practices gerrymandering to a high degree, has former Security officials in the press, has a large economic stake in the press, judges and high corporate/press officials which have clientage or kinship with the government. A liberal democracy is a true democracy, that is one w/o the shadowy mechanisms of a pseudo-democracy.<br><br>2) One coup is enough for him to sieze power and rewrite the Constitution to give him a dictatorship. It was enough for him to crush the press and kill off thugs using personal militia not part of the standard Security Forces. And Militia is always a feature of autocracy.<br><br>3) Malaysia was not a democracy either pre-Mahattir or post-Mahattir; it still isn't a true democracy. Yes, i do know what democracy is, or I wouldn't dare to have such a discussion with you, and I can tell you, democracy is far more than just the ballot box or parliamentary elections using e-voting machines. I suggest you read up more on democracy.<br><br>4) I trust more pple who ar on the ground, like my Taiwanese friend. Because local media is extremely biased, and only focus on scenes of violence which is almost never what the entire protest or demonstration contains. Episodes of violence are sporadic and isolated; they are not in any way related to the general protesting mass.<br><br>Anyway, I am staying focused on the discussion. You gave your example of Taiwan, and I came up with evidence to counter your example.<br><br>5) nvm.<br><br>6) In a way, China is still largely socially similar to 30 yrs back; The only thing improved in China, as I said, is its economy.<br><br>7) ok.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Well, to me, no offence pls, it seems that you have been idolizing leaders a bit too much, and totally disregarding the improtance of systems.<br><br>So what is your point then? Can you summarize it again for my benefit?<br><br>9) Hmmm... do you know what a puppet is? A puppet doesn't defy orders. The Emperor did, so he is not a puppet.<br><br>I'm not defocusing. I'm simply saying, as I have always been: Systems and Good People are both essential to the functioning of any society.<br><br>You are arguing: Good People are more important than Systems in the Functioning of society?<br><br>Get my stand now?<br><br>10) hmmm.... which historical fact of mine is inaccurate?<br><br>11) Right, I got that point. But it seemed to contradict what you seemd to imply earlier, that's all.<br><br>Fine, in what way is my foundation unstable and in what way do I show "total misunderstanding"? If I show total misunderstanding, it shows that your explanations thus far have been unclear. And I have been, for teh alst few posts at least, consistently begging you to provide clear explanations haven't I?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Gosh, do you really think you are like Einstein?<br><br>I am always willing to learn, but only if you tell me what I need to learn when I can't see that on my own.<br><br>12) Haha...Don't you think Einstein's thinking is chaotic too?<br><br>So, what is "chaotic righteous"? (pls answer with "'Chaotic Righteous' refers to...")<br><br>I don't know where Robert got his thinking on politics from, but for me:-<br><br>1) Mills' <span style="font-style: italic;">The Power Elite</span><br>2) Alan Tofflers' <span style="font-style: italic;"> the Third Wave</span><br>3) personal observations and experiences and listening to grown-ups' conversation<br>4) currently reading <span style="font-style: italic;"> the Political Context of Urban Education</span><br>5) Amnesty International<br>6) Reporteres Sans Frontieres<br>7) The Bible<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Sintercom<br>9) SGForums<br>10) the International Herald Tribune<br>11) the New York Times<br>12) Thinking and self-reflection...<br>13) History Encyclopaedia<br>14) Albert Eisntein's Special Theory of Relativity<br>15) Systems Theory<br>16) Amaryta Sen's <span style="font-style: italic;">Asian Values and Human Rights</span><br><br>Let me ask you: where did you get your thinking on politics from?<br><br>btw, "for good reason" is no good reason.<br><br>thx.<br><br>The pikamaster (who is sad)</div>
