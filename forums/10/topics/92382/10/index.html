            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by robertteh:<br>REPLY:"According to your judgment, the viability of bipartisan system of democracy may be affected by size of population. Yet, viable size is subjective or relative. To a true democracy like Switzerland or Finland, which like Singapore is small, size does not matter. To my mind, our autocratic governance does not allow bipartisanism to arise and it is now difficult to cultivate one after all the crunching. Size may now be conveniently given as reason to override bipartisanism as something not viable. Such rationale may sound like hypocrisy as while claiming to be democratic, our system is bent at snuffing out bipartisanism.</blockquote>Size is subjective.  Efficient size however, is objective, and optimal government is certainly affected by the head count.  As I am not Singaporean, I do not claim Singapore to be <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> democratic.  Neither do I think the suppression of bipartisan politics a great idea.  But I do lay out the facts, a governing system should be optimised with respect to the size of the proletariat.<br><br><blockquote><br>If Singapore's particular autocratic system is a sustenable system, that will outlive the founder why not call it by its own name such as LKY Guided Democracy, semi-parliamentary or semi-democratic Confucianistic Socialism.<br><br>I have replied to similar points raised by Tidal Wave (are you him?) who had posted similar questions as you. I asked him whether Singapore's autocracy can be an alternative to democratic political system. He referred to heritage and culturalism as the sustenable factor hehind democracies practised by Japan and others. However, he was not able to enlighten me at which point should such heritage be the factor - after the War or some older heritage."</blockquote>I have never heard of Tidal Wave.  My participation on sgforums is recent, I have only started properly posting since December.  As to whether autocracies are sustainable, I point towards Taiwan &amp; China as past &amp; present examples respectively.  They can be sustainable, and no doubt I think the PAP will remain in power for at least several decades after LKY's time.  Both examples have seen smooth peaceful transition from one leader to the next.  If an autocracy governs well, and is able to decide/plan its successors, then it is sustainable, the labels of what you call it mean little.<br><br><blockquote>REPLY:"As admitted, in the above, Singapore's particular autocratic system of governance has led to "restrictiveness of the political system and PAP's crunching of the political opposition parties. It follows that since it is clearly not a democracy, being all out to crunch democratic institutions like bipartisanism. If it is not a democracy, why are we discussing it as if it is on par with democracy? We can honestly say that it is a supposedly democratic system which has been modified by the sheer personality of its founding father."</blockquote>Singapore practises a pseudo-democracy, I never compare the island with Western democracies.  It does not mean non-democracies are doomed to fail.<br><br><blockquote>REPLY:"If you disagree that there is any system that depends on mass participation and knowledge application by the people, then I presume that you are maintaining that Singapore's particular meritocracy is the way to go where the brightest are indeed effective and had succeeded in running the whole system.</blockquote>I keep hearing "mass participation and knowledge application", which till now I find quite rhetorical.  You will have to explicitly exemplify what you mean.  All it looks like to me is you want the people to be more involved in politics.  As for Singapore's meritocracy, I believe the gist is correct.  The sourcing of talent to lead the nation, but the definitions of talent are limited somewhat.  There are indeed two types of succession.  One that is nurtured, and one that is fought over.<br><br><blockquote>If so, may I ask: have our brightest and the best brains helped Singapore solve the its many problems  - high costs, discriminations against the non-A_grades in schools and lack of entrepreneurship, a fact admitted by ministers and economic review committee during the Asian Financial cirisis and the last two recessions. </blockquote>I don't think Singapore has high costs, particularly compared to other developed countries.  Singapore's problem is it's a middle-man trading port.  If the costs are high (which is respect to other ASEAN economies), then the obvious strategy is to widen the margin, ie ensure that you add value to your exports.  As for discrimination against non-A schools, I find this incorrect.  All schools in Singapore as far as I know are well-funded to provide the student with sufficient access/facilities to compete fairly.  The exception is independent schools, but they are not in the government's administration (thus the government can't be accused of discrimination) and capitalism in education is practised world-wide.  What is a problem however, is the typical mentality of the average Singaporean &amp; Hongkie.  People look very much upon "branded" schools and "local" schools, psychologically differentiating &amp; judging students by where they study.  That is a Chinese mentality, not a government bias.<br><br><blockquote>It would appear that Singapore has deteriorated in its economic competitiveness due to lack of vibrancy of its domestic-sector economy and a serious lack of entrepreneurs needed to sustain further growth. Talents have not quite succeeded at both macro-economic and micro-economic governance.<br><br>On the other hand, academic talents have limited choice and produced high-cost and consequently loss of economic competitiveness in its domestic- sector economy.</blockquote>I agree that Singapore's economic competitiveness has deteriorated, but not due to the lack of entrepreneurs.  'Competetiveness' in its economic essence means the ability to compete with other nations.  Countries such as Malaysia are rapidly catching up &amp; pushing huge incentives for foreign investment.  Yet you scorn the over-emphasis in attracting foreign investments that sacrifice local enterprise.  Singapore's competitiveness lies in its ability to attract foreign investment, not the competition of its exports (which are low-cost based!).  Hence there is a contadictory trade-off in your stance.  The lack of strength in the domestic sector however, can be correctly attributed to the lack of entrepreneurs.  However, I don't think Singapore's economy is sufficiently large for new businesses to find much scope to exploit in the market.  Partly this is due to the GLCs' domination, but also because of the lack of depth &amp; scope in the domestic market itself.  Singaporeans in general aren't risk-takers, there is little individuality that I can find.  Most Singaporeans I see are conforming &amp; like-minded thinkers.  There is not one Singaporean that I consider outside the box, aside from those that have been exposed to living overseas.<br><br><blockquote>The talents have produced a tax-plus-cost_recovery governance. Based on data released by the media in 2003, it became quite clear that it is the masses that produce all the budget and off-budget surpluses amounting to billions to allow the government to claim success. </blockquote>Correct.  One thing that I am critical of is the taxing of the population to feed the government's investment losses.  Yet in Western democracies even, this is common practice.  There could be alternatives such as bond issues, but I am not aware if Singapore provides such financial assets.<br><br><blockquote>An average household had paid HDB about S$200,000 to accumulate into the nation's off-budget surplus of S$14 billions over the last 20 years. Lands were acquired using tax-payers funds, transferred to the State Land and re-sold to the HDB to charge the citizens at market price. </blockquote>Indeed the government's fundings are however ploughed back into society.  No where in the world have I seen the collective excellence of public transport, education, grants, social amenities, libraries &amp; state housing.  The paranoia however means the government is emphatic over extra reserves for safe-keeping.  Yet it has tried not to let the reserves idle away, but to invest.  I think it is a risky stategy to invest heavily if you're a government.  Investments should be stable &amp; the risk should be carefully managed.<br><br><blockquote>The double or triple taxes on vehicle at import, COE and ERP are costing the citizen S$600,000 over his working life thereby depriving him of retirements.</blockquote>As far as I know, not many people drive cars.  Those that can are likely to be the top 30% of the salary bracket.  If they can't retire, the rest of the population I presume are long dead?  It's too expensive to have a car in Singapore, given the quality of public transport and the limited small number of places to actually get to.  It does however reduce air pollution, the costliness may be an excuse for more government revenue.  But it has a green policy that environmentalists agree with.  I am in the middle stance on this issue.<br><br><blockquote>Bipartisanism has been elbowed out by the GRC system. Had it been existed, we might have a better than tax-and-recover system leading to demise of domestic sector economy. There would be competitions and better solutions to our many problems. </blockquote>Perfectly true.  The re-bordering of the electorial breakdown is a sham.  Any tinkering with the election process is obviously to the PAP's benefit.  They cannot justify it, and the reasons of 'minority participation' are farcical.  It points to the fact that the government claims Singaporeans to be race-motivated in their voting (racists) and is a loophole of meritocracy to deliberately ensure the safety of its own candidates.  The minority-participation ruling is undemocratic, unmeritocratic, &amp; its usefulness to the PAP clearly goes beyond the supposed objective.<br><br><blockquote>As pointed out by Ngiam Tong Dow in his article to the Straits Times sometime ago, the Spartain system of governance has resulted in unquestioned auto-piloting of such autocratic policies until disaster strike.</blockquote>That is true.  If the system itself does not have the mechanisms to check the government, there is no guarantee that the current PAP may deteriorate in future.  You are not relying upon the mechanisms of the political system but more upon the pragmatism &amp; dynamicism of the party...Yet these people will be replaced over time, and somewhere there may be a hitck in the party's clockwork.  An accountable system will lessen the likelihood of such damage.  However, some argue that it could also prove to be the Pandora's Box.  Both are valid predictions.  But I believe the government's kiasu-istic mindset when it comes to political reform will not consider the long-term interests of a dynamic political system over a dynamic political party.<br><br><blockquote>A knowledge-based economy requires the total support of all endeavours in every field through motivation and recognition of worth or everyone civil servants, students, ordinary workers and businessmen. </blockquote>That sounds much like capitalism, which I believe is practised in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Although entrepreneurs cannot be created as they are usually born or matured naturally, it can be stifled by lack of motivation or environmental support. Broad-based education policy for example will help to prepare school goers to be strongly based in knowledge and skills application while young based on wider syllables. When the young is encouraged and motivated in practical applications in this manner, they will be better equipped to contribute to society in application of practical knowledge in all fields beyong textbook knowlede and everyone will find their level of worth to strive for his or her own excellence. </blockquote>Yes.  A wider syllabus is a must.  All Singaporeans think alike, because their scope, skill set, &amp; learning environment are exactly the same.  It creates a uniformed playing ground for students of all classes, but at the same time it creates uniform-minded people.<br><br>I think non-A students must be encouraged to succeed, because grades do not necessarily reflect their true potential.  Creative Technology's founder is a prime example, few government scholars could likely match his success.<br><br><blockquote>Needless to say, certain errors of judgment like the MT-CL1 university admission have been admitted. MOM has just reversed the past persistent Pro-Grade education which has caused a big brain drain of many of our educated talents. Our pro-foreign investment and tax-and-recover policies have discouraged entrepreneurs and start-ups in our own land. </blockquote>As I am not Singaporean and have not lived there for 4 years now, I am not aware of the admission process.  New enterprises should be encouraged and given incubation periods for them to strengthen.  What must not happen though, is protectionism.  Even Singapore's GLCs prove by their overseas performances that protectionism is highly detrimental when it needs to compete with global firms.<br><br><blockquote>REPLY:"You may not believe the current selection process is entirely IQ-related, but I would put it this way: IQ or academic grades in terms of number of "As" has been the main measuring yardstick in streaming students from primary to secondary and from secondary to pre-university and university. Certain Junior colleges and NUS/NTU have been the feeders to top-civil service selections and government scholarships. </blockquote>The yardstick of academic grades is the yardstick for all the world's top institutions all over the world.  It's application has proved the correct yardstick for Singaporeans, who make up one of the largest foreign student populations in places Harvard, MIT &amp; Oxbridge.  The only exception are business schools, which truly look at "knowledge application".  However, you need at least 5 years experience before you can prove your worth, and you still need top grades in scholastic tests.<br><br><blockquote>Such social engineering had not solved our problems as although public administration does need a certain number of brightest career officers, this whole pro-grade and pro-scholar mentality has produced only redundant highly educated unemployed leaving a vaccuum in our private sector.</blockquote>On the one hand, you are highly critical of the government's definitions &amp; selection of talent.  Yet on the other, you also blame this policy for draining the private sector of bright minds.  This is a contradiction, for it means the government does have a sound idea about recruiting competent individuals.<br><br><blockquote>REPLY: "You are right in saying that as our scholars highly proclaimed as talents, should not just ride on external market indices or favorable conditions. They must out-perform the mediocre. At best times, they can take advantage of market trends and take a good ride and at worse times, they must know how to maximize use of available or under-used resources to equip all businesses of readiness to eek out a living and rebound as quickly as possible. However, if you are to read the ministers' speeches during the recessions, they would rather not talk about their solutions but keep harping only on external unfavorable conditions."</blockquote>Yet for the government to out-perform the mediocre would only promote its overbearing weight in the domestic economy &amp; act as a catalyst for further revenue-generation from the population.  As I have believed from the start, Singapore's governing system has indeed provided efficiency, stability and a very wealthy government.  However, there are negatives on the other side of the weighing scale, which I think can be found in all governing systems (especially Western-style democracy).<br><br>Singapore's autocracy has resulted in stagnation in creativity, not just in the private sector, but also in government.  Every successful dynamic team that I've seen combines a wealth of different skill sets in each individual.  They can be grouped together to work out productive value-creation with their alternatives views &amp; experiences.  In Singapore though, everyone, even including the scholars, is just another 'number' that is shaped to fit into the government's idea of an ideal system.  Whilst the PAP is a high performer, its potential &amp; dynamicism is definitely limited.  Much as the government may believe likewise, its value-creation to Singapore has latently resulted in much value-destruction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>QUOTE:"It would appear that Singapore has deteriorated in its economic competitiveness due to lack of vibrancy of its domestic-sector economy and a serious lack of entrepreneurs needed to sustain further growth. Talents have not quite succeeded at both macro-economic and micro-economic governance.<br><br>On the other hand, academic talents have limited choice and produced high-cost and consequently loss of economic competitiveness in its domestic- sector economy." UNQOUTE<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"I agree that Singapore's economic competitiveness has deteriorated, but not due to the lack of entrepreneurs. 'Competetiveness' in its economic essence means the ability to compete with other nations. Countries such as Malaysia are rapidly catching up &amp; pushing huge incentives for foreign investment. Yet you scorn the over-emphasis in attracting foreign investments that sacrifice local enterprise. Singapore's competitiveness lies in its ability to attract foreign investment, not the competition of its exports (which are low-cost based!). Hence there is a contadictory trade-off in your stance. The lack of strength in the domestic sector however, can be correctly attributed to the lack of entrepreneurs. However, I don't think Singapore's economy is sufficiently large for new businesses to find much scope to exploit in the market. Partly this is due to the GLCs' domination, but also because of the lack of depth &amp; scope in the domestic market itself. Singaporeans in general aren't risk-takers, there is little individuality that I can find. Most Singaporeans I see are conforming &amp; like-minded thinkers. There is not one Singaporean that I consider outside the box, aside from those that have been exposed to living overseas."QUOTE<br><br>REPLY:"It is not a case of Singaporeans lacking entrepreneurial or thinking out of the box but incorrect policies in the past such as the following:<br><br>(a) Overzealously implemented meritocracy policy at the expense of broad-based education and knowledge application,<br>(b) Pro-foreign investment stragies to the neglect of its own domestic sector of the economy.<br>(c) Government going full-scale into businesses to compete against locals.<br>(d) Over-zealous non-welfarism led to tax-plus-recover fees and consequent high costs.<br>(e) Over-regulations and bureaucracy.<br><br>It should not take long for anyone to realise that everyone of the above-stated autocratic policies has produced certain undesirable fallout or negative effects. Auto-piloting (because none dares to change these policies) of these policies made the matter worse by the years. People become brainwashed due to press control and believe in justifications to entrench status quo. Thus Singapore entrepreneurship or mass participation in every aspect of national life cannot grow unlike those in Taiwan and Korea or Hongkong. It is now running short of entrepreneurship as was found out by the economic review and remaking Singapore committees during the past several economic crises. However, despite the so-called openness being talked about, the tendency is not change but basking in past glory. There will be claims as soon as world economy recovers that autocracy and leadership of founder have resulted in all the material wellbeing without new solutions to new problems. Comparisons after comparisons will be made with the worse countries and fears will be driven into the mind of men about liberalising and participating in democratic processes and bipartisanism. Justificaions will be made to entrench status quo or one-party domination. If the world economy cannot recover or falters, scholars will be lamenting of citizens' failures or attitude in not making changes or accepting lower wages. Original or out-of-the-box solutions? Hardly any.<br><br>QUOTE:"The talents have produced a tax-plus-cost_recovery governance. Based on data released by the media in 2003, it became quite clear that it is the masses that produce all the budget and off-budget surpluses amounting to billions to allow the government to claim success. UNQUOTE<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE" Correct. One thing that I am critical of is the taxing of the population to feed the government's investment losses. Yet in Western democracies even, this is common practice. There could be alternatives such as bond issues, but I am not aware if Singapore provides such financial assets.<br><br>REPLY:"Finally thanks for your impartial views on the real problems - high-cost due to over-zealous tax-plus-recover system of charging citizens under the name or guise of non-welfarism. At last, people will realize that Singapore has become extremely uncompetitive due to auto-piloting of many out-dated and presumptuous policies over the last 10 years due to all kinds of constraints and negative impacts of autocratic system of governance.<br><br>No matter what actions are being taken, the local businesses just cannot survive. The only solution is to remove all the autocratic policies of the past that no longer serve any useful purposes even if they have been successful for some years in the past. Let everyone have the opportunities because of government's co-investments in promoting broad-based education and mass participation in political process and works. That is the only way to save Singapore."<br><br>QUOTE:"An average household had paid HDB about S$200,000 to accumulate into the nation's off-budget surplus of S$14 billions over the last 20 years. Lands were acquired using tax-payers funds, transferred to the State Land and re-sold to the HDB to charge the citizens at market price. UNQUOTE<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"Indeed the government's fundings are however ploughed back into society. No where in the world have I seen the collective excellence of public transport, education, grants, social amenities, libraries &amp; state housing. The paranoia however means the government is emphatic over extra reserves for safe-keeping. Yet it has tried not to let the reserves idle away, but to invest. I think it is a risky stategy to invest heavily if you're a government. Investments should be stable &amp; the risk should be carefully managed.UNQUOTE<br><br>QUOTE:The double or triple taxes on vehicle at import, COE and ERP are costing the citizen S$600,000 over his working life thereby depriving him of retirements.UNQUOTE<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"As far as I know, not many people drive cars. Those that can are likely to be the top 30% of the salary bracket. If they can't retire, the rest of the population I presume are long dead? It's too expensive to have a car in Singapore, given the quality of public transport and the limited small number of places to actually get to. It does however reduce air pollution, the costliness may be an excuse for more government revenue. But it has a green policy that environmentalists agree with. I am in the middle stance on this issue."<br><br>QUOTE":Bipartisanism has been elbowed out by the GRC system. Had it been existed, we might have a better than tax-and-recover system leading to demise of domestic sector economy. There would be competitions and better solutions to our many problems. UNQUOTE<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"Perfectly true. The re-bordering of the electorial breakdown is a sham. Any tinkering with the election process is obviously to the PAP's benefit. They cannot justify it, and the reasons of 'minority participation' are farcical. It points to the fact that the government claims Singaporeans to be race-motivated in their voting (racists) and is a loophole of meritocracy to deliberately ensure the safety of its own candidates. The minority-participation ruling is undemocratic, unmeritocratic, &amp; its usefulness to the PAP clearly goes beyond the supposed objective.UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY:"From your above-stated responses, it is clear that the rights of citizens to free and fair election might have been tampered as follows:-<br><br>(a) GRC has deprived Singapore of bipartisanism are appreciated.<br>(b) Re-bordering of electoral breakdown is a sham<br>(c) minority-participation ruling is undemocratic<br>(d) PAP clearly goes beyond the supposed objective are refreshing.<br><br>Changes to electoral process led to entrenchment of the same party for time. Many changes were made in the name of protection of minority rights or other perceived advantages. These changes led to the demise of bipartisanism. Many policies sound "Good" under autocratic tampering to electoral choice etc but the loss to democracy is much bigger. To sustain prosperity of a country government policies and doings must not be at the expense of its own domestic businesses or local talents. Governmental efficiencies for its own sake and surpluses may not benefit the people. As can be seen at close-up, many policies of the past have produced negative impacts and stifle local entrepreneurship and growths.<br><br>Singapore cannot renew itself unless all the actions of government such as meritocracy, efficiency, and government's surpluses are properly balanced not to create so much problems to the locals and are objectively managed"<br><br>QUOTE"As pointed out by Ngiam Tong Dow in his article to the Straits Times sometime ago, the Spartain system of governance has resulted in unquestioned auto-piloting of such autocratic policies until disaster strike.UNQUOTE<br><br>RESPONSE"That is true. If the system itself does not have the mechanisms to check the government, there is no guarantee that the current PAP may deteriorate in future. You are not relying upon the mechanisms of the political system but more upon the pragmatism &amp; dynamicism of the party...Yet these people will be replaced over time, and somewhere there may be a hitck in the party's clockwork. An accountable system will lessen the likelihood of such damage. However, some argue that it could also prove to be the Pandora's Box. Both are valid predictions. But I believe the government's kiasu-istic mindset when it comes to political reform will not consider the long-term interests of a dynamic political system over a dynamic political party.UNQUOTE<br><br>QUOTE:A knowledge-based economy requires the total support of all endeavours in every field through motivation and recognition of worth or everyone civil servants, students, ordinary workers and businessmen. UNQUOTE<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"That sounds much like capitalism, which I believe is practised in Singapore. Yes. A wider syllabus is a must. All Singaporeans think alike, because their scope, skill set, &amp; learning environment are exactly the same. It creates a uniformed playing ground for students of all classes, but at the same time it creates uniform-minded people. UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY:"Knowledge application is produced by a broad based education system with wider syllables as you have put it. Hence, mass participation of all citizens whether in schools or at works will contribute to the rise of a greater and more vibrant nation and assure it of entrepreneurship.<br><br>In place of streaming of students into the brightest (EM1) and not-so-bright (EM2/3) and so many interventions with free economic forces to serve government efficiency and create surplus, Singapore has a chance through openning up to accept more ideas and options from the natural motivation of men and women to develop and nurture entrepreneurship in schools or at works to increase the competitiveness of the economy.<br><br>Top-down autocracy now is aimed at producing efficiency to obtain surpluses which do not necessarily come back to benefit the people in terms of costs of living or business vibrancy. It is more to sustain itself at a high price. It has largely failed as a system if it is looked at critically during its last ten years of performance. The majority of EM2 and EM3 quitters are sidelined as quitters and there is a lack of original solutions to motivate all to nurture competitiveness and entrepreneurship needed badly to  take the country forward."<br><br>...TO CONTINUE<br><br></div>

Certain Junior colleges and NUS/NTU have been the feeders to top-civil service selections and government scholarships.<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"The yardstick of academic grades is the yardstick for all the world's top institutions all over the world. It's application has proved the correct yardstick for Singaporeans, who make up one of the largest foreign student populations in places Harvard, MIT &amp; Oxbridge. The only exception are business schools, which truly look at "knowledge application". However, you need at least 5 years experience before you can prove your worth, and you still need top grades in scholastic tests.UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY:"Generally academic results may be employed elsewhere in recruitments of personnel, but look again: It is only in our system that NUS and NUT and certain full-time recognized university degrees are recognized in recruiting senior positions in the civil service.

What talents can be more in demand than entrepreneurship, creativity and middle-management excellence represented by results as practised by Fortune-500 companies.<br><br>How could the masses be expected to contribute to society or entrepreneurship given such overwhelming and whole-scale protectionism of employment opportunities for the academic talents. This would not have happened in the private sector where performance is the key criterion. The only outcome of meritocratic practice sadly is not increased economic competitiveness or entrepreneurship but high costs the citizens have to pay to sustain the mandarin control-directed system without corresponding results or excellence expected of mandarins as seen in the last two recessions.<br><br>QUOTE":Although public administration does need a certain number of brightest career officers, pro-grade and pro-scholar mentality has produced only redundant highly educated unemployed leaving a vaccuum in our private sector.<br><br>YOUR RESPONSE"On the one hand, you are highly critical of the government's definitions &amp; selection of talent. Yet on the other, you also blame this policy for draining the private sector of bright minds. This is a contradiction, for it means the government does have a sound idea about recruiting competent individuals."<br><br>"You are right in saying that as our scholars highly proclaimed as talents, should not just ride on external market indices or favorable conditions. They must out-perform the mediocre. At best times, they can take advantage of market trends and take a good ride and at worse times, they must know how to maximize use of available or under-used resources to equip all businesses of readiness to eek out a living and rebound as quickly as possible.<br><br>However, if you are to read the ministers' speeches during the recessions, they would rather not talk about their solutions but keep harping only on external unfavorable conditions."<br><br>Yet for the government to out-perform the mediocre would only promote its overbearing weight in the domestic economy &amp; act as a catalyst for further revenue-generation from the population. As I have believed from the start, Singapore's governing system has indeed provided efficiency, stability and a very wealthy government. However, there are negatives on the other side of the weighing scale, which I think can be found in all governing systems (especially Western-style democracy).<br><br>Singapore's autocracy has resulted in stagnation in creativity, not just in the private sector, but also in government. Every successful dynamic team that I've seen combines a wealth of different skill sets in each individual. They can be grouped together to work out productive value-creation with their alternatives views &amp; experiences. In Singapore though, everyone, even including the scholars, is just another 'number' that is shaped to fit into the government's idea of an ideal system. Whilst the PAP is a high performer, its potential &amp; dynamicism is definitely limited. Much as the government may believe likewise, its value-creation to Singapore has latently resulted in much value-destruction. UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY:" I did not dispute the benefits of promoting talents which are needed in certain numbers. What I am really concerned is that by auto-piloting one-track-minded pursuit of the few academic talents, the whole system has neglected promotion of broad -based practical application, entrepreneurship and innovations.<br><br>If you still think that Singapore's business or people living costs are not high, just look at our government cost. It has been steadily increasing and has exceeded 10% of GDP. Its top civil servant's salary is equated to the highest paid in the private sector and has exceeded the pay of Alan Greenspan on the ground that higher pay will prevent corruptions. In other words, the whole mandarin system is now underpinned by pays or material rewards.<br><br>The only thing the talents or scholars know is to offer investment opportunities to foreigners with all kinds of tax havens. This old economic strategy is now better done by the Thais and Malaysians up North. Apart from such old economic strategy - attracting foreign investments, there is no coherent economic master plan now for many years. The mandarins or leaderships have run short of ideas for promoting businesses or reviving its moribund domestic economy suffering for many years. The controlled media would continuously harp on leadership and talents once the world economy recovers. It is doubtful that any GDP growth is produced by original solutions or creativity. More taxes or lowering of workers' wages may be resorted to to produce any competitiveness.<br><br>In your views, it is clear that you have regarded creativity or individuality can be hampered by autocratic governance. This may be the result of a serious error of judgments in auto-piloting the past pro-foreign and academic talent. So far, only CL1/MT policy has been admitted by MM Lee - due to external pressure or circumstances like in the case of PSA/SIA's being forced to reduce their rates to survive competitions.<br><br>In the meantime, the only solutions in reviving the downtrending economy is to keep milking the cows without any original plans to produce more cows. If a government only knows its power to get surpluses or government efficiency, can it be successful in the eyes of its own citizens? The huge trade-off of such a system now is a lacklustre governance. Much more will have to be done over the superficial openness to solve persistent serious problems. These problems are certainly not caused by poor attitude of the people. Does such an autocracy hold a future for Singapore if it continues to ignore people needs, aspirations and entrepreneurships to justify its own presumptuous excellence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

They are only blinded by "A" grades and equate everything with proofs or evidences of an academic score but not practical passions, possibilities or probabilities. The are too bookish and arrogant of their grades and are not too interested in trying or practical application of existing knowledge or skills.<br><br>Entrepreneurs are not recognized until they become famous. There is no supportive environment to support people with ideas. Anyone with ideas may have his ideas passed on to some departments to try them out thereby killing entrepreneurship. Tenders and quotations would be obtained only from those with established names.<br><br>While the practical talents are thinking about how to use mundane non-university knowledge into practical applications like products and services to eek out a living, the academic talents are commanding from their ivory towers on their endless assumptions and presumptions.<br><br>The practical talents are the woman who cycle to the factories to try out her water-purifying system or the man who dreamt of making his poh-piah skin to common food garnish in the westerner's restaurants.<br><br>Our education is not aimed at producing entrepreneurs but recognition or personal glory. These academic talents are among the social climbers or dreamers but not seekers or means of making a living.<br><br>Education for education sake or aimless education is as good as non-education at all.<br><br>Too many people are saying that if they don't try to get a degree, they will be left behind the others. The system is responsible for such an attitude.<br><br>If we do want to upgrade talents, we must not train them to become social climbers who boast of grass roots connections or those who are seeking self-glory through academic excellence.<br><br>Try an out-of-the-box planning. Embrace the EM2 or EM3 or quitters like the "Winston Churchul", "Bill gate". Give them opportunities currently only given to academic talents to find a break and many of them will be excelling to take Singapore out of the economic woos.<br><br>Make a change to the way of inducting talents into politics or public service.

The reason not being that we don't want to see how practical they are in efficiently carrying out their role, but because their profession necessitates a certain degree of knowledge, literacy, understanding, and problem-solving.

The insistence of these parents for a 'report card' baffled the Canadian educators.

What kind of idiocy is this?UNQUOTE<br><br>Answer: Yes, people may be at fault for supporting a particular system or wrong doing. If all are to recall, from the early days of independence, our government has been promoting scholars and meritocracy. In itself, this is not a bad policy. Overzealous pursuit of such a policy may prove to be our undoing. It is not the environmental or people factor exactly which caused the society to believe totally in academic talents.<br><br>The end result today after 39 years of promoting academic talents whether in jobs, grooming the future leaders, school streaming, university degree recognition or recruitment practices, everything is based on academic talents. Like what ex-civil servant Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow has put it: meritocracy has been auto-piloted to the exclusion of promoting entrepreneurship or diversity.<br><br>So, look at the fact, ours has been a system where everything is measured according to a person's academic abilities.

Look at what the academic talents have done. They cannot bring about a economic re-structuring nor do they have a master plan or strategy that will help to muster our national resources into results and gains.<br><br>Every idea not found to be well established will normally be written off before it even gets a hearing. This is as far as I can agree with your observation about environmental factor.<br><br>We only want ready academic talents or foreign investments but wil not allow someone with ideas or passions an opportunity to become successful in Singapore. More likely, those with 2 "O"s will have to go elsewhere and become somebody before being invited to tea.<br><br>Leaders only want instant academic talents but do not listen to anyone unless he is a success story.<br><br>QUOTE:"Having studied with, though under my own steam as a person who left Singapore with barely 3 O level passes, some of the said persons whom you presume blind, I believe more can be said about them as human beings then simply administrators. You ask if they come with a master plan; my retort would be that I'd query which master plan will suit ALL citizens? Which would suit both you and I? Do you have a master plan?<br><br>Ans: I am not in the government or a top civil servant in a position to conceive an economic master plan. This does not mean that master plan or strategy is far-fetched or unrealistic.<br><br>If I am in a position to conceive such a plan, I will not hesitate to introduce a mass participation process management approach to allow all opportunities to excell in any particular area of works or services. I will not hesitate to marshal all our collective practical talents as long as they have the ideas or passions and will encourage them to put up all their passions or schemes to work in work place or governance.<br><br>I will keep the academic scholars to maintain established systems to take advantage of their specialised or particular training and will not necessarily put them in responsibilities for the nation until they have proven themselves. These academic talents may be needed for certain professions but they are not automatically the right people for creating jobs or supporting domesic economic competitiveness.<br><br>Innovations are excelled in by ordinary people with particular inclinations due to exposure or skills not taught in schools. Such people will be recognized under process hands-on applications. Anyone will be given opportunity to test his ideas in the actual work place. The teamwork culture will finally be created in work places. This teamwork will be the greatest improvements or entrepreneurship that can be created to take Singapore one step forward to revive its presently high-cost economy.<br><br>Read more about this idea of mass participation and practical knowledge application in www.sgforum.com under the topic: "Practical Guide to Efficiency and Productivity".<br><br>However, I do notice that we do not yet have a culture to support such mass participation or knowledge application. This adventurous spirit is rare as our people are over-pragmatic. They don't want to listen to something not already working or workable. Who is at fault. I think the gen "X" and "Y" have been brainwashed by our pro-talent system so much so we have become a conformed people and nothing said here will be listened to even by people least by the government. Nothing will change. This conclusion is not from me but many people especially foreigners who work with Singaporeans.<br><br>QUOTE:"Brings to mind a childhood taunt: 'Takes one to know one!'<br><br>It is my express opinion that mistakes made today are the nett result of the 'old guard' still in positions of power - regardless of appearances to have 'youthified' the government. The same practices still go on ... endless and hectic preparations for 'big shots' (BS) coming to visit; perfection achieved at ridiculous prices despite the law of diminishing returns on resources and manpower; 'respect' of 'elders' and BS to the point of rolling out a brand new red carpet trimmed with gold and inlaid with diamonds everytime a BS comes into the foyer even if only for 5 minutes; 315 man hours worth of meetings to cater to a 45 minute visit by a BS; the ceaseless politicking to spend the entire ministrie's/departments budgets on silly events simply to utilise funds prior to budgeting periods to ensure that 'cuts are not made' ... the list goes on ... the 'scholars' mostly simply bypass this stage on move on to the BS stage. So who is to blame? Who does not want to feel good at the expense of others (read the taxpayers)?<br><br>Thing is, Mr. Teh, some of the blame for the perpetuation of these practices come from you and me as well.

As talents they should have no excuse being highly paid too for not knowing that we have been brainwashed into inactions or blinded by conformity culture.<br><br>Government is today totally powerful.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Diesel.Okini:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't see how the guides in your book can't already be applied in businesses.  Everything I do as an individual, is probably objective and through a process of various stages.  That however, is also a sign of rigidity.  Thus how one adopts their processes/steps is their own instinct with which to shape, not from a book.<br><br>Did you write some sort of thesis or something?  That's not what the Singapore government needs.<br><br>And whilst I agree with trade-offs in Singapore's system, I'd rather you don't put words into my mouth by inserting your conclusions onto the ends of my analyses.<br><br>Practical application can't work in top white-collar professions.  You need top grades in order to qualify to study as a doctor, likewise for a lawyer, an engineer, a tax advisor, an accountant, and many other areas where people must first be trained before "practical application" or whatever.  The reason not being that we don't want to see how practical they are in efficiently carrying out their role, but because their profession necessitates a certain degree of knowledge, literacy, understanding, and problem-solving.  Hence all they need to do is make the classroom more dynamic.  That's the learning area.  You can't apply this to choosing politicians, don't think it works that way.<br><br>You're starting to lose my attention.  We're talking about how Singapore's system can be better improved, not just a blatant move to Western democracy just so that you can support the conditions for a "practical guide to efficiency and productivity".  And objective-steps processing can still be applied even within an autocracy anyway.  Your proposal is just a guideline, nothing more, and definitely not a cornerstone of universal business application.</div></blockquote>Hello, Diesel.okini,<br><br>Process management as explained in "Practical Guide to Efficiency and Productivity" will relieve the leadership and talent approach to governance in the sense that goals and policies are no longer floating in the air or from meetings to meetings but translated into processes that can be genuninely followed through in accountable and transparent manner by all irrespective whether the works are of white collar, blue collar or some other description.<br><br>All people have their own past prejudices. I suppose it will take a while for them to see the advantages of translating intangibles to tangibles, abstract to doables in governance of a country.<br><br>Despite the fact that the minds of doctors and lawyers may be smart, they alone cannot coordinate or lead to practical applications by all. This can be seen by many of the look-good past policy like reaching a Swiss Standard of living translated into attainable small goals backed up by processes.<br><br>Work site safety, reviving the neglected talents, brain drains of thousands of talents and many problems still persisted. High costs will affect economic and social wellbeing. Pro-foreign investment policies have to be made more balanced or traded off in such a way as to benefit locals and domestic economic sector.<br><br>Purely selling to the citizens that talents and educations are the keys are not something that can be monitored or managed. Like in football game, we need to have captains and strikers plus the rest of the team working in harmony to strike goals. For sometime people have given feedbacks that we need mid-fielders.<br><br>This process management thing will help people to understand how to build the whole team excellence. My posting is not aimed at supporting foregone conclusion as you have mentioned to suit my thesis of some kind to support mass participation or practical knowledge application.<br><br>My posting has reasoned out why autocracy alone without the support of practical participation and knowledge application of all will not be sustenable. Even if it has worked in the past, it does not mean it will work all the time. Just look at past seven years of mediocre performance and the excessive number of educated unemployed as proofs that academic talents promotion or education alone is not the answer. It is a matter of common sense as apart from the government and small percentage of people, Singaporeans as a whole do not benefit from such autocratic academic talent system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, forumers,<br><br>Many of you must have taken part in various discussions in this forum on topics like democracy or autocracy or actions of government affecting education, costs of living, policies or decision on casino that affect our lives.<br><br>Well, if you are one of these active citizens who care more about the country and have views and opinions on nation building or political evolution, then read on.<br><br>Pertinent ssues raised by forumers may be summarised below:-<br><br>(1) Talents and leadership of government leaders. (Read "Practical Guide to Efficiency and Productivity" at "Market Place" of this forum)<br><br>(2) Their policies and actions affecting daily lives of citizens. (Read topics like Is HDB Prices high, Fee Increases at NUS/NTI etc)<br><br>(3) Political evolvement - whether the present autocratic system shoud continue unabated or open up for mass participation by all for future self-renewal. (Read various debates under this topic)<br><br>(4) Rights or wrongs of past or certain past policies and whether these should continue as they are or change or be modified. (High costs at PSA, SIA recognized but how about that of civil service and government as a whole)<br><br>(5) The pace of change - evolvement is the answer - so as to keep up with accelerating changes in the environment.<br><br>(6) Involvement of citizens in political renewal to stay relevant - how will this be accomplished.<br><br>(7) Practise a proactive electoral process as stated in the 7 points of true democracy to assure citizens of change: (a) Non-persecution of political participants for defamation in the course of political participation. (b) Non-interference with political renewal process. (c) Constitutional guarantee of free and fair contest of election and protection of bi-partisanism. (d) Non-redrawing of electoral boundaries (e) Abolition of GRC followed by practical measures for equitable participation of minority race, (f) Non-tampering or amendment to one-man-one-vote system. (g) Freeing up of control of press and media.<br><br>So far, there is hardly any changes to past policies which brought about high costs or divisiveness of society. If the educated citizens cannot take part in a more open and liberal political process, if there is no revival of the weakening domestic sector of economy soon, there can be no vibrancy or competitivenss to assure the younger generation of a future here.<br><br>If there is no proactive changes, as urged by all in the debates under this topic, to some or all of the above-stated seven aspirations, then it is clear that there will be no real change. The so-called building a just and inclusive society or respecting of views of active citizens as promised in PM Lee's inauguration speech will be just a pipe dream. Or is it just another speech or series of policies designed to win another election or to perpetuate one-party domination.?<br><br>If there is no change, then let the citizens know how they can benefit from all the measures or policies being implemented or how they can have their  earnest aspirations answered one way or another.  If all these reasonable expectations cannot be answered then is this kind of autocracy beneficial or sustenable as argued by defenders of status quo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

So it is not possible to achieve success just by considering political systems alone.<br><br>However, in my opinion, political systm has a large influence on social and cultural development of a people. Politics affect social and cultural characteristics of a people needed for success.<br><br>Politics therefore should be viewed in the larger sense of how it empower people to attain competitiveness and vibrancy beyond the narrow confine of electoral process, freedoms of speech and choice, or a legal framework of legislature, executive and judiciary.<br><br>Educational system is one of the practical means of influencing social and cultural qualities of a people. It not only imparts knowledge to the people but empowes the people to excel in works and development as a cohesive or entrepreneur society etc. Whether a people will become caring as well where the higher echelon will help the lower to enjoy better standard of living etc depends on how politicians go about their governance of a nation.<br><br>A system of promoting meritocracy and talents is one employing a narrow approach. There will be difficulties in areas of entrepreneurship. Now after many years of promoting strongly the elites of grade "A's to take over public administration, the middle and lower rungs of the people from which a nation draws its entrepreneurship and innovative culture and practical applications, business start-ups, essential to making Singapore competitive have been neglected.<br><br>Singapore loses large number of entrepreneurs to other countries.

It is self-justifications and inward looking. The domestic sector of the economy is now very weak even if the government is able to attract foreign investments.<br><br>Foreigners will not necessarily stay with Singapore. Structural unemployments would be caused by them leaving in large numbers in bad times. Right now our economy is very dependent on America and world recovery. There should be more resilience by building up from the bottom brand names like what Taiwan and Korea are doing.

            <div class='col-md body'>...continued from previous post:-<br><br>Now that the external economic conditions have improved, it is probably timely for autocracy to make its claims that it has been successful.<br><br>Whether autocracy has produced a more vibrant domestic economic sector is a question mark.<br><br>What is clear is that the high costs charged by HDB, PS, LTA, at an average of S$600,000 - S$800,000 per household over the working life of citizens are collected into the national surpluses or reserve allowing ruling party to claim success.<br><br>Other than tax-and-recover governance, there is no sign of any master economic plan or strategy successfully implemented to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy. Dr. Goh Keng Swee might have done it at one time when he envisioned the building of Jurong. Lately despite all the claims of foreign investment success, such records are falling behind every other country in the region. The domestic sector of the economy is weakening from high costs and lack of supports as given to foreign companies.<br><br>In other words, where there is a general claim or justification of talent, there is a lack of good goal scoring to show for it.<br><br>I do not know whether anyone will call such a system sustenable or successful.<br><br>The Americans may have many shortcomings but certainly, there was no closing down of discussions or limiting of options or choice. Through greater options or choice, citizens can excel in greater ways and in a more in-depth manner. The real talents will then arise from the whole populations. Americans don't keep uttering talents or world's bests but they are the ones who have pioneered many advancements in many areas of human endeavours.<br><br>Singapore system apart from its ability to tax-and-recover has not produced active or proactive management excellence yet to turn citizens into its assets. A swallow does not make a summer. A few talents failing to turn the two recession recently around till the whole world recovers are not that talented. The journey to talented management is a longer one than what is made out to be.<br><br>The people who has sustained the high costs do far are the real talents but they are the unsung heros so far.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>...continued from previous post:-<br><br>Ans: To say that Americans are blessed by their vast natural resources or their singular superpower status is one of the many constant justifications given to the citizens to pain a picture of ountry's presumed success.<br><br>If a survey is to be conducted of happiness or satisfaction with costs of living or standard of life over the past 10 years among the citizens, there will be true answers.<br><br>Under the GRC and politically closed system of governance now practised, the re-election of leaders years after year does not make it a true success story.<br><br>If there is a open and fair election, without all the redrawing of election boundaries or other impediments to political bipartisanism or participations by all, credits may be given to the ruling party's re-election success as fully expressing the wills or true satisfaction of the people.<br><br>So it will be fallacious to consider autocracy or the status quo as a success. If credits should be given they should be given to the hardworking people who keep sloggging to pay for the high costs of  homes and vehicles in Singapore without any prospect of decent retirements.<br><br>However, over the last ten years or so, most people in the middle and lower classes have lost their dream being crushed by high costs of living and serving the high mortgage loans due to state's double-charge on land and vehicular costs. These people are now waiting for new solutions and in a state of shock or stupified existence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not wrong, the main points of your argument is to show tat singapore have made many decisions which u felt was wrong. However frankly speaking, purely democractic is not an error free system either. If singapore is a purely democratic system and not the one we r having now, these problems may not dissappeared either. Philipines and indonesia r rated being more democratic than singapore, however r they spared from the asian fiancial crisis ? In a democratic system , they too only use talents for their party line out. In fact all big companies prefer to use talents. U also bring out the education system and say it do not mention anything about bringing knowledge to good use. But then again, a lot of countries do practise tis form of education in the past and even if singapore is "democratic", our education system may probably be the same as well. Tis is especially so since they need a lot of engineers. In fact now singapore still need to bring in foreigners to work as engineers.<br><br>Though some problems may not exists, but note tat some problems may arises due to tis as well. I agree with your point tat maybe fewer options r explored when it is an autocratic system, but then democratic have its ills as well.<br><br>1. Democratic tends to make policies tat is popular but hard to sustain in future. Some examples r the healthcare system for some european countries<br><br>2. Democratic system may result in slow implementation of policies, especially difficult but necessary policies<br><br>3. Democratic system tends to overspend its available resources.</div>
