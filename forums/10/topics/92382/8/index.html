            <div class='col-md body'>Every other day, we will be coming across more news on inefficient performance due to lack of accountability and transparency at various departments.<br><br>For example, not long ago, we have been listening to big news from ministers about introduction of A1 toilets in the housing estates.<br><br>What happens. The latest radio listeners' survey by radio 958 proved otherwise - toilets in various estates are getting worse by the days.<br><br>We have been hearing big news sometime ago how ministries have been introducing work safety standards in work sites.<br><br>What happens?

There is still no news of our having put up an Business Master Plan or strategy as the MNCs would have done. How to create more jobs and save jobs from abuses of employers in indiscriminate employment of foreigners? How to keep up with changes that will re-vitalise the down-sliding economy?<br><br>There have been much talks about changing mindsets and doing away with past unworkable policies or work practices.<br><br>What happens? Take a look at Town Council's estates. Many of them have degenerated into dumping grounds of all kinds with karung guni stuff of all kinds stored at the rear of premises causing great fire risks. No wonder we are seeing so many fires recently as reported weekly over the TV news.<br><br>There is no time to lose in introducing accountable and transparent governance.

So, how to be accountable and transparent when simple facts cannot be provided on basic issues of survival.<br><br>The way Singapore now is being run, it is only continuing to produce an affective divide as Dr. Catherine Lim has aptly described it - the ordinary people in one sector and the government and big businesses in another.<br><br>In short there is a affective divide consisting of a well-to-do meritocratic sector in one camp and EM3 non-government sector in another.<br><br>The government leaders, civil servants, the employees of GLC and big businesses are very happy enjoying high growths, high salaries, high bonuses and countless perks and therefore there is no reason to rock the boat or change anything. Just say it loud and often enough and every one will believe at the end that the economy is good and sound.<br><br>Ask any one of the employees in the EM3 sector,he or she will tell you - I don't know whether I may still get the thirteenth month or increment. If I am employed till next year, I would be very happy.<br><br>With media under the control of government, how could anyone disagree with facts. Read the termination of journalist of ST who dares to write something candid about a particular institution and the answer to accountability or transparency will be obvious. So would anyone dare to write negative reports for the newspaper ?  Is this state of governance accountable or illusory ?<br><br>The ex-President Ong was a true people's president. He cared enough about every one in his constituency and took a lot of trouble to follow through any one seeking for help until he or she really gets settled down when he was helping as an ex-MP for Kim Keat.<br><br>Do we have caring people in the government MPs like him now? Instead, we are seeing justifications of all kinds in the media in order not to let government lose face.<br><br>Unemployment or structural unemployment problem cannot be solved during the recessions and the blame was put on the weak world economy. Very soon when the world economy goes a bit a better, it will be deemed solved by government policies or talents.<br><br>So, the press will paint a different picture of the current unemployment - a reduction in retrenchments. But what about the currently unemployed.<br><br>Masses are badly hit by high costs. Government fees increases are announced for several services including the utilities and tuition fees. Double charges on land and vehicles continue to enrich the government at the expense of EM3 sector.<br><br>If what Singaporeans are asking is not 100% democracy but practical accountable and transparent governance.<br><br>The engineer who committed suicide due to his premonition of impending disaster did not get so much as a mention in the Nicol collapse inquiry.<br><br>Is accountable and transparent governance so difficult to practise  and so harmful? Read the 7 points of true democracy as posted. They are but simply basic stuff democracy is made of or communism or communalism precepts. So I don't see why with so many scholars in the government, such a simple request cannot be looked into seriously before the next election bugle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If the political landscape is a divested one of many parties, the stability of a small city-state can be rocked simply by a few individuals.

The top-down approach is indeed a restricted view, for you only have a certain kind of 'personality/mentality' in the PAP, there is no room for deferrence.

According to Mark Twain, Â“The secret of getting ahead is to get started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex and overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.Â”<br><br>Today, it is well proven that many tasks can be more efficiently performed in divided, attainable and smaller tasks e.g. on-line banking, real-time accounting, e-trading, travel-ticketing, tradenet, computerized logistics and telecommunications etc.<br><br>DOABLE WORK PROCESSES<br><br>OBJECTIVE-STEPS PROCESSING (OSP) is the World's First and Only one-page hands-on doable managing process enabling management to perform tasks in smaller steps of : (1) Study of Ideas, (2) Enquiry, (3) Securing Contracts and (4) Contract Administration (Operations).<br><br>No matter how complex is a business, operations can be delegated in planned core activities in departments: 1.(General) 2.(Human Resource) 3.(Revenue) 4.(Accounts) 5.(Marketing) 6.(Services-all outsourced activities) 7.(Facility) 8.(Enforcement) 9. (Production) 10.(Compliance) as follows:-<br><br>1. Identify 3-4 Core Activities for consistent and focused performance.<br>2. Assign 2-3 quality-time-cost parameters to each core activity.<br>3. Perform Core Activities in sequential workflow detailed in work<br>form to attain parameters.<br><br>Thus, in operations tasks consist of simple core ativities set in time-activity schedules in one-page Department Reports (checklists) to attain hands-on performance and results.<br><br>Furthermore, quality-time-cost parameter-defined system generates quantified and reliable feedbacks Â“1Â”, Â“2Â” or Â“3Â” (or percentages) representing Â“non-attainmentÂ”, Â“attainmentÂ” and Â“excellent attainmentÂ” for corrective actions by all.<br><br>Administration and operations are integrated by two-way interaction variance task-lines to facilitate corrections and problem solving at three levels : (1) administrative forms, - head office (2) department reports - operations (3) work forms - knowledge application doing away with intuitions or guessworksor complex judgmental approaches, self-centredness and inefficiencies.<br><br>Everyone can contribute creative ideas based on logical idea-enquiry-contract thought processes to make the organization participative and truly knowledge-based to ensure success.<br><br>Therefore, hesitate no more.

What you need is a system that can recognise talent and be able to assign it a suitable responsibility.

The UK, the US in particular, HK, China.  However, Singapore's 'executive' is the presidency, and it has no powers.  The scope of the PAP has always been all-powerful, I don't advocate because I find the weigh is increasing, but more simply for a change.  Those changes however should not be too radical and need to be taken with caution.<br><br><blockquote>There is a gradual loss of effectiveness and solutions in recent years and all the scholars and talents are not producing any further solutions as witnessed in Asian Financial crisis and last two recessions.

Trust me, never over-estimate the plebian.  I've seen talent and creativity is difficult.  That would in fact result in greater class differentiation, believe it or not.  The USA &amp; HK are good examples of a huge income gap.<br><br><blockquote><br>Therefore, unless the present top-down system is changed, there can be no more new ideas supported by people to create wealths, vibrancy or resilience like the South Korea or Hong Kong.</blockquote>Singapore seems to be trying to create new wealth, but I don't believe it's happening.  That's not due to the top-down system, but more due to Singapore's culture and its education/values.  No one in Singapore thinks outside that box, and when I say nobody, I damn well mean it!  Zilch.<br><br><blockquote>New economic success can now only happen if government is still in people's control from mass participation and practical knowledge application to practices of accountability and transparency.</blockquote>No, new economic success relies on several things:<br>1. Favourable, calibrated government policies<br>2. Positioning in industry &amp; technology<br>3. Investment in human capital, plus research &amp; development<br>4. Innovative solutions &amp; creative ideas<br>Accountability &amp; transparency give for a more-rounded society, but does not answer economic problems.<br><br><blockquote>A broad-based competitiveness is what is badly needed for survival in the future.</blockquote>Please be more specific.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me share with all a posting on the risk of top-down governance as posted to feedback unit<br><br>Hi, Black Knight,<br><br>Mass participation and practical knowledge application as posted is not a castle in the air or idealistic.<br><br>It is an established practical platform which allow tasks to be performed in teamwork with organizational efficiency (as opposed to individual efficiency), accountability and transparency.<br><br>Such practical mass-participation work processes incorporate performance parameters and prerequisites from internal and external feedbacks.<br><br>Once goals and tasks are so established, they will be performed with lesser reliance on intuitions or judgmental approaches. Remember the old saying: "Powers corrupt and absolute powers corrupt absolutely."<br><br>In this historical and human context, top-down governance processes, where decisons are concentrated in a few top leaders should be made open to inputs and citizens' participations.<br><br>Top-down approaches emphasize on producing scholars to run the public sector. However, scholars for a fact do not have what it takes to solve the many problems as witnessed in Asian Financial crisis and last two recessions.<br><br>The scholars still tell us that they have solutions to massive retrenchments, or the ability to restructure the high-cost economy to meet new challenges.<br><br>Singapore now needs large number of entrepreneurs in private sector. This and the above-mentioned problems cannot be solved by the scholars or a few top-down leaders.<br><br>How to make everyone in companies and work places more participative so that works will be performed more efficiently without over-relying on a few bosses. This management excellence is possible and attainable as posted.<br><br>Chinese has a saying: san ke choa pi chiang (three humble cobblers) shen koa Ee ke Chu Ke Liang (will excel over the grandmaster)<br><br>So, mass participation is not that idealistic or undoable as work processes. It is a system of doable work processes built on teamwork or participation by all employees. It empowers all employees to contribute in practicable tasks and ideas to build on success. It allows tasks to be decentralized.<br><br>To prevent the risk of putting all the eggs in one basket or decisons affecting all to be concentrated in the doing of a few, such a system should be developed for governance. Such a system will offer a practical platform to enable democracy to thrive.<br><br>If the top-down system is justified and exist longer, more harms may be caused and it may then require a supreme exercise of political will to make changes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has often been described as a "nanny-state." This profile has often drawn criticism from Western democracies. So it was with much amusement that I observed recently on the BBC programme "Dateline London," the talk which turned to the nanny state issue.<br><br>The panel of four, who spent literally 90% of the airtime disagreeing with each other about everything on the topic being discussed finally reached the topic of whether a democracy could be a nanny state and not diminish its democratic identity (it was in the context of Britain imposing regulations on alcoholic consumption in public places). The concensus, quite amazingly was a resounding "yes!". Mind you, these were all pro Western-style democracy advocates (two Brits, one French and one American, I think). They added this caveat however: While nanny states are great, finding a good nanny isn't very easy.<br><br>Singapore is a great nanny state. We should be thankful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. all forumers, Merry Christmas,<br><br>To share some ideas on whether there is any recent improvement like openness. change of mindsets or self-renewal as posted to feedback unit:-<br><br>QUOTE: Actually the youths have posted many good views here.<br><br>Singapore has many local talents. The issue is, who are listening to them.<br><br>They youths know that "citizens should be given the right of choice" and religious or moral objections may in themselves be narrow or self-conflicting within their own precepts.<br><br>For example, there are many forms of gambling and people are already exposed enough to gambling. Share trading and property investments have caused more social problems and bankruptcies. Unemployment due to downslide in economy can cause worse problems if there is no alternative way to revive or revitalise the down-trending economy.<br><br>Many people have posted ideas to extend and integrate the existing business hubs already created to all-embracing value-adding up-stream and down-stream ones but do the leaders understand and what are they doing about these ideas?<br><br>What is seen is the rehashing of same old conceptual and unworkable policies causing loss of ecoonomic competitiveness of the domestic sector. MNCs and GLTs may be enjoying growths because they have the advantages of unlevelled playing field.<br><br>Consequently, Singapore's domestic sector is experiencing a big brain drain. The pro-foreign employment and investment policies both stifle the growths of good local companies and drain of local talents.<br><br>MNCs and foreigners are given tax holidays and are being supported by extra cost/tax burdens imposed on locals.<br><br>Pro-foreign employment S-passes were introduced without prior check on availability of local qualified personnel.<br><br>Can the youths be blamed for being idealistic as they are being told by younger ministers or being apathetic as compared with youths of China or Vietnam?<br><br>No wonder, our youths are saying that they have been told by their parents: "No one will listen to the youths" unless they become famous first.<br><br>Essentially, what is wrong is past undoable and conceptual policies are too entrenched. Even Ngiam Tong Dow is saying the same. Who cares? The present attitude seems to be if there is noting wrong and "don't fix it" as demonstrated in the case of PSA, SIA.<br><br>After SIA fiasco, there is no sign of pruning down of unduly high salaries of incumbent of excessive annuities of retiring leaders to the point of driving up the whole business costs. Did the leaders go about pruning Departments carrying high costs and redundant staff after HDB and SIA fiascos?<br><br>Hospitals and HDB, JTC, and Power Supply are seen to continue levying monopolistic cost-recovery charges to build off-budget surpluses amounting to billions as they have done in the past.<br><br>Singapore's success story actually is built on tax-and-recover system at S$200,000 per household over the years without which there can be no success to talk or write about. The general helpless during Asian Financial crisis and past recessions proved this fact.<br><br>That is why, Singapore is experiencing high costs.<br><br>The whole system is inflexible governed by over-conservative thinking from the past era.<br><br>Many have posted that entrepreneurship cannot created by a education system that will recognize only the grades or scholars. There ought to be better treatment of EM3 talents to bring about resilience through broad based education and practical knowledge application.<br><br>Although the cost of government is currently 15% of GDP, is it trying to back double sets of staff running the estates and Town council - PA, CDC, HDB and LTA, URA etc which can easily share staff and resources.<br><br>Because of such wastages, our economy cannot be upgraded. Civil servants are being overpaid - their pays are higher than that of V President of USA or Alan Greenspan.<br><br>MT/CL1 have been over-simplistic causing brain drains and top-down or high-cost tax-and-recover policies are stifling entrepreneurship and resilience of the domestic sector economy.<br><br>The GLCs and big businesses may have grown. HDB estate shop keepers and most of the domestic sector companies have not yet benefited.<br><br>What do JTC and HDB do - continue to increase costs and revert to past way reversion to past rentals without investigating whether the rentals have been intrinsically high due to past increases.<br><br>Do the leaders really know about economy that they are killing the domestic economy by government taking over businesses and running up costs to compete against them?<br><br>If there are really talents in government, they should have put together a comprehensive plan to integrate the proposed casino to create full spin-offs to the business hubs.<br><br>There is not enough forwards or strikers to score goals and support domestic economy to grow from here. So far the recent talks by younger ministers are full of status quo or protectionism. The calling on youths is aimed at finding new candidates to join the party but are the youths going to join the party for their own benefits or of the nation. Idealism of governance is sel-centred.<br><br>In the past election, there was all the same fanfare about younger team or calling on youths to join governance. What happened? Some kept a low profile in order not to affect their own prospects. Some have quit finally feeling they cannot do anything about past system.
