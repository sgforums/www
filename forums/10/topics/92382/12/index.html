Too often are scholars too engross in what politics they learned from universities...<br><br>There are two main proper political mindsets: a. Selecting of leaders; b. motivating politicians in the <strong>right</strong> manner.<br><br>(2) Any system comes along with problems. Once rooted, problems will be extremely hard to settle.

People <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will </span>always be concern</strong>. Some more relevant issues include one: The assessment of the people and hence the reactions. Eg.

Russians towards communism)<br><br>If a nation's assessment is done by great minds, or a society with majority wise people (which is not normally possible), and reacted, the nation will likely prosper.

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry for the late reply. I am back for a while<br><br><blockquote>It is very obvious that apart from waiting out till the world economy recovers, there was nothing autocracy can do to rescue Singapore's high-cost economy from external competitions whether from China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan , Korea or even Vietnam. </blockquote>Is it obvious tat with democracy, the situation will be different ? Why don't u come out with a solution other than complaining about it ?<br><br><blockquote>Citizens have to pay high costs for all essential government services to sustain high public sector wage costs. Ministers are paid millions without first being tested for their true worth as private corporations to whom they are being compared have done - launching of successful companies or projects. </blockquote>I will be frank about tis. There r a big fraction of the people here being civil servants. If their pay is high, we expect the private sector to follow and give higher pay to the people. If u talk about  minister pay, I will be frank here as well. Their pay is about the same as those given to COE of private companies here. Do u think the COE of HP in tis region doesn't get multi million pay ? Do u think tat Shell COE of local branch get a few thousands back home a month ? Face it man, those at the top management get high pay. If u want high pay then go for the top management lah ! The minister pay is not totally not significant to singapore economy at all. Buying a war plane for defence is already higher than their whole combined pay for a year.<br><br><blockquote>(1) Bureaucracy in civil service.<br>(2) High costs of essential government services e.g. medical, utilities, housing, transportation, education, etc, etc<br>(3) Growth Triangles<br>(4) Affective divide due to lack of understanding of people's views and aspirations.<br>(5) Work site safety problems (Hotel New World Collapse's blue paper was not effectively implemented)<br>(6) Deliver a Swiss standard of living<br>(7) Asset enhancement scheme fiasco<br>(8 ) Unit trust investment fiasco<br>(9) Foreign relation fiascos<br>(10) Non-formulation of a value-adding investment strategy<br>(11) Double-charging on lands (paid by taxpayers yet charged back to them at full market prices) and triple charges on vehicles.<br>(12) Meritocratic education policy that backfired - brain drains of thousands<br>(13) Mother tongue - CL1 admission fiasco<br>(14) Reaching World Cup soccer league by 2010 - no sign of getting near.<br>(15) Investment losses by thousands of citizens from CPF funds.<br>(16) Spiraling of government ministers' and civil servants' salaries.<br>(17) Failure to implement accountability and transparency in respect of investments of citizens' monies in overseas investments.<br>(18 ) Loss of economic competitiveness due to high costs.<br>(19) Neglect in promoting entrepreneurship<br>(20) Neglect in nurturing the domestic sector of economy.</blockquote>U r blaming all the problem we have to our political system and not because we r singapore. We r small, have a limited population and have no resources. We cannot influence much to the world yet we r easily influence by them. I believe no matter wat political system we r in, we will see some of these problems. Why don't u come out with a solution instead ? I mean complaining is so easy...<br><br>Lets use an example of a rich man and a poor man son. The rich man son can have a car when he was 18 while a poor person have to work to support their family. Can u just take at face value and blame the poor man son for being poor, and have to work continuously in order to survive ? Is it because the poor man son have a character flaw and thus remains to be poor ? Isn't tat wat u r doing now ? U blame the gov for not achieving its goal when it is because we r inherently at a disadvantage compared with other country.<br><br><blockquote>The Asian Financial Crisis and large-scale corporate scandals in the aftermath in America and elsewhere have finally exposed the myth about leadership, Confucianism or Asian Values</blockquote>really ? is china affected by tis fiancial crisis ? It sure do have malpractise and abuses mroe than singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Traditional leadership approaches have been increasingly overtaken by motivational processes permitting all to perform tasks with efficiency coordination and knowledge applications e.g. online banking, real-time accounting, e-trading, travel-ticketing, logistics, telecommunications etc enabling companies and businesses</blockquote>I see tat singapore had implemented a lot of these as well. Its government use of IT and service had made other country following it as a role model<br><br><blockquote>Do more and talk less. With greater coordination (teamwork) and knowledge application (mass participation) Singapore can do better</blockquote>Tat is right. Do u think it should apply to the people as well ? R we really into teamwork when all we do r just complain and complain and complain and always doubting the leaders in their suggestions. When asked for suggestions everyone keep quiet. When got problem everyone complains.<br><br><blockquote>So far apart from saying that here and there that autocracy is a good alternative, all the arguments put forward sound like individualism or self-justifications</blockquote>I have mentioned about the problems of democracy and the strength of autocracy. But u clearly just aviod it altogether and keep harping tat democracy is perfect. U just totally treat it as though it was never mentioned. In fact, u never answer the point raised by other but keep repeating on the same thing through and through. It doesn't sounds convincing<br><br><blockquote>Autocracy is not a system. It is just someone who says that I have done it. My ideas are like this or like that. If anyone does not listen or disagree to the individual's ideas, they would be subjected to all kinds of controls, GRC, justifications with the help of controlled media or other inconveniences</blockquote>Tat doesn't seemed to apply to singapore. When some MP suggest casinoes, u can see some PAP MP to raise questions and doubts about it as well. Is it really like wat u described ?<br><br><blockquote>Politically China is more free than it used to be in 1989</blockquote>Tat is right. I see china opening up itself gradually as well. So does singapore. Why rush into something where the others have used 100 over years to develop ? But then again, u will never talk about tis at all and drone on your usual points again.<br><br><blockquote>Singapore may be successful to a certain extent in the initial years that does not mean that it has been successful since the 1970s for having built social cohesion or a entrepreneurial and competitive society. </blockquote>It may means tat it is harder to progress beyond tis point with our limited land size as well. Even america is struggling to with competition such as china and japan. In the early years america also have the highest growth and technological edge. Now it is gradually eroded by countries such as japan where its technology is on par with them. Does tat means the gov of america is worse off compared with the past ? No ! It just meant tis time now every country is fighting hand and foot for economy development, it is harder to gain a foot hold or maintain its status.<br><br><blockquote>Please keep in mind that the same cat might now be too weak or old to catch another mouse. In the eye of majority of citizens the high costs of running the place is a problem. Just look closer at the high costs of living and the frustrations of people or loss of economic competitiveness of the domestic sector of the economy, it will be seen that the autocratic governance is far from a success. </blockquote>Or maybe there r too many cats around with too little rats on the run. The high cost of living is a problem for most countries, not just singapore. U think life in taiwan, hong kong, tokyo or shanghai is better ? Japan is a democractic country as well, do u think cost of living is cheap ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Can you show us the breakdown on how are our health care and medication cost so high???</blockquote>I can only show u the fact tat healthcare costs r rising throughout the world. Tat is the point I am driving through. Please view the technological improvement tat resulted in increase in costs.<br><br><a href="http://www.fepblue.org/faq/faqhealthcarecosts.html#1" rel="nofollow">http://www.fepblue.org/faq/faqhealthcarecosts.html#1</a><br><br><strong>What are the major factors of rising healthcare costs?</strong><br><br>1. An aging population Â— The average age of our members is 47 years old. By 2008, about 15 percent of the general population in the US will be 65 years of age or older.<br><br>2. Lifestyle choices Â— Seven out ten Americans do not exercise regularly. Inactivity is one of the leading causes of many chronic diseases.<br><br>3. Prescription drug costs Â— Many sources say that the increase in prescription drug costs accounts for about 20 percent of the overall increase in healthcare costs.<br><br>4. Cost Shifting Â— When patients don't have health insurance or their health insurance does not pay for all the care they need, the cost of the care is shifted to those patients with health insurance.<br><br>5. Medical Technology Â— Medical technology helps diagnose conditions earlier allowing for better recoveries. But, it has a big price tag.<br><br><strong>How do hospital services contribute to the rising cost of healthcare?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>One of the key drivers of the rising cost of healthcare is hospital care. Between 2001 and 2002, the cost of outpatient services was the fastest growing part of healthcare, increasing by about 15 percent. Inpatient hospital costs, which make up the largest single component of healthcare costs, rose by six percent.<br><br>Most researchers agree that the primary reason the cost for outpatient care has increased is because the cost of using the outpatient setting for medical procedures is no longer less expensive than having procedures done during hospital admissions. Inpatient hospital cost increases are due to the increase in the use of more expensive technology, higher labor costs because of the growing shortage of nurses, hospital consolidation and increasing costs for hospital admissions even though the length of hospital stays has decreased.</strong></span><br><br><strong>What is the impact of medical technology and medical advancements on the rising cost of healthcare?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>New medical technology, such as MRIs, allows doctors to see inside the body and more accurately diagnose conditions. They also let doctors diagnose conditions earlier, leading to a more complete recovery for the patient. New surgical techniques involving little or no cutting are also improvements related to medical technology. New therapies and treatment improve the quality of life for patients suffering from chronic or terminal conditions. New vaccines also offer better prevention and are now part of routine child medical care.<br><br>However great the medical technology, it does come with a price in the form of increased costs to consumers in how much they pay for medical care. For example, MRIs have replaced X-rays in many situations but they are also more expensive. About 20 percent of the rise in inpatient hospital costs is due to medical technology and it accounts for about 18 percent of the increase in outpatient hospital costs.</strong></span></div>

Talents or abilities or extraordinary abilities suggest the abiltiy to forge a teamwork with the whole population so that all the people will willingly apply their practical as well as academic knowledge in all aspects of works and in every field of human endeavours to bring about a vibrant economy.<br><br>So far, sadly, despite all the proclaimed talents and abilities, only justifications or excuses are given for non-solutions to the 20 long-standing problems.<br><br>People are often told that "they are complaining complaining and complaining." Leaders forgot that they are paid the highest sallaries to solve problems and it is their duty to solve problem and not push them back to the people in this manner with excuses to no end.<br><br>They should behave like "servants of the people not as their lords or masters" They should be humble in service and not keep talking down on people. They should respect good ideas without protocol. After the feedback protocol there would be more hurdles or protocols and as a result many ideas or suggestions will not be implemented. People don't see their ideas being implemented until one day for a different reason the top leader decides it is time to admit one idea finally. This has happened to the change to meritocratic education policy- too little too late. How to save the economy from downtrending when past unworkable ideas are too entrenched holding back mass participation and innovative knowledge application.<br><br>The autocratic system is inflexible much as its protagonist likes to believe otherwise. That is the main reason for Singapore to lose out in entrepreneurship over the past 30 years now. Emporor obviously cannot see his own lack of clothe and no one dares to tell him lest he might bring misfortune to himself. This is the main reason why Singapore is losing out its competititiveness as problems cannot be corrected by people under autocratic governance.<br><br>To make matters worse, the system tends to produce a system of dependent beneficiaries being highly paid who will have to tread carefully to avoid destablising their own careers or promotions.<br><br>Remember, our lack of entrepreneurs or teamwork is not something created by the people but an education system that favor class divisions into "EM1" "EM2 and "EM3". How could this divisiveness so purposely created for political expediency be people's fault. It has also resulted in an affective divide between elites and ordinary people.<br><br>So you would rather blame the lack of teamwork on the people.<br><br>A broadly based education system emphasising on wider syllables or subjects in schools and practical application of existing knowledge should have been implemented years ago. Such broacly based education has been successfully implemented by Finland and Switzerland. Fortune 500 companies were known to be practising EQ to motivate their workers. So isn't it clearly proven that autocracy emphasising on talents of a few will not lead to mass participation or innovative knowledge applications by all.<br><br>However, you would now rather blame the lack of entrepreneurs on the people. You have asked" isn't teamwork and mass participation something to be complied by the people? Why is this so when government should have introduced broadly based education and practical application to bring about teamworks and results.<br><br>If you insist that creating teamwork is not government's responsibility then may I ask again, are they not the talents who possess such ability. Isn't it the fact that a system emphasising on grades for too many years has done so at the expense or to the neglect of mass participation and innovative knowledge application. Had Singapore proceeded with broadly based education system years back, many more people would be able to contribute to solutions to problems including the 20 long-standing problems as posted.<br><br>...to continue <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Can a private hospital match tat ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>It is a straightforward topic - Definition of True Democracy. I have tried to keep all the views objective by comparing autocracy and democracy as a system comparison. My main points are : by practising the 7 practical points as posted at the opening statement, Singapore will do better.<br><br>The 7 points of true democracy includes non-prosecution of political participants, non-interferencing with the rights of citizens to elect their representatives freely, accountability and transparency etc etc.<br><br>Your postings consist mostly of repeated claims that our autocracy has been successful by making comparison with worse off countries. When confronted by examples of autocracy's failure to solve 20 long-standing problems as posted above you avoided answering this matter objectively but insisted again that no country in the world is perfect or without problems.<br><br>You have totally failed to answer to my views and examples about our unique lack of social cohesion and competitive domestic sector of the economy.<br><br>I observed that you preferred to carry on and on with your claims by repeatedly pointing out that other countries too are having problems ignoring my main point that Singapore autocracy has failed to solve the 20 problems and prove its world's best talents and leadership have indeed the calibre to solve the 20 problems.<br><br>As long as you keep insisting that there are other countries which are worse off and no country is perfect, then it is clear that your opinions or views about Singapore autocracy is biased or slanted. You have nothing substantial or objective to offer to reply to my points that the so-called talented or leadership management has failed to solve many problems.<br><br>Such constant denials and justifications in short represent the gist of your posting and you have so far nothing concrete in your arguments in support of success or presumed success of autocracy. If you are still interested in continuing with your views how successful autocracy has been all these years and whether it is a sustenable system and what will make it sustenable, try to answer to my above-mentioned views objectively and stop making all kinds of selective comparisons or giving excuses after excuses that no government in the world is perfect or can solve the 20 problems as pointed out.<br><br>The most important point in the whole argument you have put forward is autocracy has succeeded in Singapore. Why don't you show that it is indeed successful in the hearts and minds of majority of the citizens in terms of economic vibrancy and social cohesions - just two factors will be good enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Autocracy is not a even a system as such. Even if it is indeed definable as a system, it has had several opportunities to prove its effectiveness in solving problems in the modern and knowledge-based economy of today.<br><br>However as witnessed by the Asian Financial crisis and last two deep-troughed recessions, it was helpless in addressing major problems due to lack of open and supportive participation in entrepreneurship and creativity in all fields by the masses caused by entrenched closed governance.<br><br>The ground and middle levels are essentially emptied of creativity or motivational prccesses. Whereas several Asian countries were recovering from the worse 1997-2003 recessions, Singapore was lagging behind. Therefore, now that the world economic forces have changed due to ending of Irag war and recovery of US, to give Singapore economy a lift finally, credit should not be attributable to autocratic good leadership.<br><br>The past governance over-emphasised on only meritocracy or academic talents at the expense of nurturing passions or abilities of the masses required to increase entrepreneurs.<br><br>The lack of entrepreneurs in Singapore has been identified by Economic Review Committee and Remaking Singapore Committee as the key problem affecting Singapore's survival as a nation. The past policies have only emphasised on building up meritocracy and granting of incentives or goodies to foreign companies. If these two past policies continue, Singapore may get more foreigners and foreign investments but the whole domestic sector of the economy and locals will have to keep migrating.<br><br>Autocracy has only such limited solutions or ideas as stated in the foregoing. This exclusive leaderships of a few men at the helm will not bring about competitiveness in the modern knowledge-based economy. Every citizen counts.<br><br>In a democracy, it is normal for citizens to question established ideas or policies and really have larger solutions thrown up through accountable and collective decision making process.<br><br>Such accountable and transparent decision and work processes are regarded by protagonists of autocracy as hindrances to decision making process despite autocracy's ineptitude in solving 20 long-outstanding problems as posted under this topic.<br><br>Protagonists of autocracy cleverly regard western democracy as full of contentiousness by selective comparisons with those worse-off cases of democratising countries governed in the past by autocracy who need to contend with change-over practical problems.<br><br>Autocracy has probably succeeded in very limited cases in history. The question to be asked even if it has succeeded is: at what price. In Singapore case of autocracy - the middle class has gone extinct and citizens are coping to pay the world's most indebted mortgages. Beneficial autocracy even if it has happened could probably happen only once in a blue moon during initial periods when particular leaders needed support from people.<br><br>After obtaining power, all kinds of theories were often put up to sustain continuing rule. Autocray is centred at self or individual leaders. As such, it is prone to immense problem encountered in receiving feedbacks which are normal but narrowly regarded as criticism or excessive demands of the people. In objective and final analysis, such problems are attributable to over-sensitity or fear to  lose face.<br><br>In democracy, the starting point is: people are the assets. People will possess within them immense creative solutions for great leaders to unleash.<br><br>Even though the world is not perfect, and no political systems can solve all problems, at least in democracy, there is a better chance to solve them for the good of the majority. There is a common saying: two heads are better than one. By implication, this saying also means: more heads are better than only a few heads.<br><br>The Chinese has a saying "san ke choa pi chiang sern koa yi ke chu ker liang" - three lowly cobblers may outwit the best grand master.<br><br>Think again. If anyone believes honestly (not connected to autocracy) that autocracy is the best form of governance and will serve the people best, ask himself one question: will the ideas of a few men at the helm be more superior than the collective highly educated workforce or population as a whole in term of producing knowledge application or entrepreneurship in an accelerating technological age? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
