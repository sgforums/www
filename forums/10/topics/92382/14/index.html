Like someone says, it's very low in standard in Singapore, but just obtained the <span style="font-style: italic;">facts and figures</span>, that's it.<br><br>You cannot assume some nations on democracy are biased comparisons. This is rubbish because if suddenly their economy revive, nation prosper, then for one, I'd bet you'd use them as <span style="font-style: italic;">good examples</span>. Hehehehe...<br><br>Just as people used to comment lousy governance during Malaysia's time, now people suddenly use PM Badawi's Malaysia to be the next growing powers in Asia for example.<br><br>And Robert, let's just get very very very real. Democracy is merely one ideological system that is participated by not-so-ideological humans. It's still who you end up with that's important, not what system. Those who are lousy but willtry any legitimate or illegitimate manner to stay in power will do so with or without democracy.

Without citizens identifying themselves with the country's agendas, sure there will be troubles ahead for Singapore.<br><br>Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow has given his perspective. As an ex-senior civil servant, his views should be valuable. But autocracy is autocracy. Nothing can change because in such a situation, loss of face or self-esteem ranks no. 1 above everything else. Look at history. Wars occurred and empires collapsed due to the same thing. If autocracy is unaffected by face values and has been open and accountable, some of Ngiam Tong Dow's views should have been taken up. Have they? This is in relation to your mention about doing the right thing.<br><br>Unfortunately autocracy of the present shape and potence is still an unalterable fact of our political landscape.

This change came about because internet is a fact of life. No government can really stop its own citizens from posting their opinions about governance anywhere.<br><br>Singapore was compelled to show to US that it is a democratic society in allowing speaker corners to be set up due to ongoing FTA negotiations and other alliances for the governance own sake etc. SIA's and PSA would not have relented on their high cost system had it not for imminent losses due to SARS etc. Even the change to HDB was not from self-enlightened spirit but due to great losses sustained and pressures from outside the party during the downturns.<br><br>I feel that young potentials with political ambitions might be gathered around YP to contribute views naturally pleasing or biased towards existing policies and governance. It is good to let youthful enthusiasm grow. Let them carry the cause of YP or the party and eventually come out to the deep blue water to test their true ability.<br><br>News media you will notice does not change yet as critically factual letter of challenge to status quo have been witheld.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Actually it is more dangerous to keep to self-centred management where policies or decisions were sweeping and general and leaders repeat them often and thereafter anyone not following or seen to be infringing were taken to tasks. Civil servants will be compelled after a while to obey all kinds of unspoken rules and wishes of the leaders. Examples: MT/CL1 policy cannot be changed until Singapore lost out thousands of its own non-grade but important practical talents to outside world.

Accountable and participative processes are not far fetch even though it cannot be acknowledged due to self-centredness in autocratic system. The 7 points of democracy offers a practical way to balance the need for leadership against the need to be open, accountable and participative as recommeneded in postings to FU. So it is not an issue to open up and be more inclusive. Why want to go back making only promises but not willing to open self or self-ness to discussion and scrutiny by citizens. Without scrutiny and balancing self against rights and interests of all, leadership may take on more dangerous tendency as "power corrupts and absolute powere corrupt absolutely. Then chaos will happen. Not opening up is far more dangerous than getting citizens to contribute through process participation as posted under "Practical Guide to Efficiency and Productivity". Give and take. Good thing does not happen overnight. It takes a number of steps to establish acccountable and participative governance. Don't be so paranoid about some past achievements of certain past leadership approach, but don't carry on that further as it may lead to worsening of problems and eventually more desertions and affective divide and migrations of citizens and  chaos. !!!<br><br>...to continue<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

When in fact, the roots of the issue has sorta never been a major concern over what economic concerns. Whereby it's clear that economic concerns is only a part of national concerns, simple focus religiously fixed mainly on one concern means respecting the root issues? Hahahahaha...<br><br>Robert: People have given ample views that they would support multi-racial and multi-lingual and mass education policies. There is no need to keep emphasising on what they already accepted over the years. Yes, our leaders have done certain things right, but relax. Don't use any single incidents to justify the whole regulations and actions to carry on the past autocratic rule. Views and opinions as given are quite reasonable so far. Is there an willingness to change from past one-track assumptions of all kinds when the population has moved on the contemplaing competitiveness in an globalised world. Is this a case of leaders not changing or people not changing?<br><br>If people want a casino, they would give their views rationally. If they don't they too give their views rationally. Sometimes, government has to decide, that all would agree. Casino is a test to see whether now it will sincerely let people participate in decision affecting all and not let the leaders take their own views and make their own assumptions and final decision in the name of interests or other reasons for the people. This is one example of mass participation in governance as posted which you have disagreed so far. There is always some practical problems. These include the 20 problems created under autocracy as posted. There should be no justifications and look-good presentations or challenges to people to form political parties but professionalsm and service to people. There should be no compromise of professionalism under the label of leadership or constant comparisons against worse off countries. Remeber Singapore leaders are presumably world's best and paid the best salaries and should answer such questions. Casino involves implementation of an overall strategic economic blue print or new social compact. Let government come up with such compact so that casino decision will not go wrong again due to autocracy. lol:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>...to continue</div>

Quality of decisions, luck all play a part. Human beings make mistakes. This we also know. However if we want to say that a system that runs on the ideas or intuitions of a few men in charge is a system, I would disagree completely. Such intuitive or ad hoc approach is self-centred or individualistic. It is not a system to begin with. It is contingent on "which side of the bed the leader wakes up from this morning". The men in charge are liable to self-centredness etc. Many problems have been created as posted. Problems will not be acknowledged until disasters as men by nature will not admit mistakes and will resort to justifications or excuses to explain away problems.<br><br>If accountable and transparent corporate governance is introduced through democratic institutionizing and professional work processes, then there is a greater probability of solving our particular problems.<br><br>Intuitive judgmental or ad hoc management is fraught with dangers. Didn't the government leaders say they will institutionalize accountable and transparent corporate governance standards before to outlive the initial attainments after LKY.<br><br>If this is what our political renewal process is all about - marrying good points from socialism and leadership into the advantageous and well proven democratic processes. Change. There is no need to bring back the past glory to justify anything or challenge Jamie Han to form political party.
