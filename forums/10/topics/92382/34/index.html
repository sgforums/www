We should be demanding for such changes , and there's no excuse that our demands need to be delayed for another five to ten years.

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter what actions the government takes on racial remarks by a few youngsters, government must not forget to government the country fairly and objectively.<br><br>When it is able to show to the people that it understands the people's wishes and aspirations then it does not need to worry so much about the behavior of the people. The people will behave and accept leadership and conduct themselves. The key issue is: does the government understand all these and how to achieve the nation building goals and objectives.<br><br>Very often, we have heard our leaders talking about the importance of leaderships, talents, or ideas in running a business or country.<br><br>What is leadership or talent ? Is it eloquence, or good-looking presentation of concepts or ideas.<br><br>It would appear that traditional leadership is conceptual employing assumptions like risk of welfarism or about the need for disciplining of human beings and control over the people in order to create change.<br><br>Will such conceptual assumptions really lead to efficiency, competitiveness, excellence, reliability, justice, empathy with the poor and needy, the underdogs or socially handicapped for the greater social and economic wellbeing of all ?<br><br>How will concepts and assumptions lead to certain course of action to empower the people to behave, work together for common good or greater efficiency and values or harnessing technologies, technological start-ups and economic growth.<br><br>While leadership might of the conceptual kind might have helped in the past in achieving independence has the government forgotten and neglected key factors such as people's aspirations, and their daily needs, or facilitating development of their skills or broad-based practical education and widespread application of technology and knowledge.<br><br>In the fast-paced technological age of internet and instant telecommunication, the tasks of the government is to facilitate the educated workforce to develop their skills and knowledge to be creative, entrepreneurial and proactive, and seize opportunities at practical applications of knowledge by all in every field.<br><br>Conceptual policies and assumptions have failed to create the needed value-adding economy still being mired in leaders' conceptual complexities and uncertainties. There has been a general neglect of broad-based entrepreneurial knowledge applications, mass participation and empowerment.<br><br>The conceptual approach of govenrment has caused the slow down of the economy and unhappiness of the people. As a result, govenrment has to extend controls and regulations, and increasing the taxing and recovering of costs to the full market values thereby causing hardship.<br><br>Today's technology-age leadership should consist of the following criteria:-<br><br>(1) Translate goals and objectives and policies into implementation processes to empower all workers to maximize their knowledge applications, to create competitiveness, technology start-ups and jobs.<br><br>(2) Collective leadership and good corporate governance to avoid self-centred narrow top-down conceptual management that stifle mass participation in knowledge application, implementation of ideas and growth.<br><br>The only way for Singaporeans to level up for themselves in skills that will value-add their competitiveness and stop listening to past conceptual leadership and talents. If they are in business, they should strive to get their people and workers to become true partners and involve them in decision making and working towards results as a team.<br><br>Leaders must set themselves as good examples of servants of people and shareholders and be prepared to accept criticism and be proactive and efficient to oversee tasks with coordination and practical knowledge.<br><br>Leaders should not be so arrogant and aloof and divide themselves from people as elites who are entitled to all the rewards but good example in applying practical knowledge at every level.<br><br>In this way they can persuade people to leverage their individual strengths and overcome our constraints so that collectively people will realize technologicial start-ups and value-add economic competitiveness which currently could only be talked about.<br><br>Only when leaders can effectively translate all ideas and concepts into actions and nurture entrepreneurs and technological start-ups and create jobs will the economy upgrade and become more competitive.<br><br>No matter how brilliant, top-down leadership is too narrow in scope and radar range to cover the whole spheres of social culture and economic exchanges and leveling up of competitiveness. Not only that, it encourages self-interests and controls which are not consonent with the majoirity's vibrancy and growth.<br><br>Process management can be set up to lay the foundation for people to work collectively with coordination and application of knowledge at all level to attain results on their own without hindrances from all the media hype, justfications and look-good presentations and defensiveness.</div>

They have been sold the ideas of "control is good and no-control is chaos" and all kinds of imagined fears intended to make government do what they please.<br><br>People are being told many falsehoods about democracy just because of certain countries' unrest due to other root causes that were created by undemocratic practices in the first place.<br><br>They over-sold the fear about welfarism for 40 years until people accepted all the cost recovery to ful market prices when taxes become surplusss to enrich the salaries and bonues of politicians and sivil servants. Can any one imagine paying millions to talk and push pens and act arrogant with a weakening economy and dropping asset value. There have been practically little results in technological start-ups or creating international brands or restractuing the economy.<br><br>People have to suffer the consequences for their own compliance and unthinking subservience. It is now too difficult for them to differentiate rights from wrong and good from bas.<br><br>This kind of mental block will make our assets and economy go downhill. No wonder the costs keep going up and ministers keep giving excuses to cover up inactions and inefficiency and more laws are being passed to control every small behavioural faults.<br><br>It is the people who make the government and finally they will have to pay the price and are still paying in the years ahead because I cannot see any change. It is true, we just have to go away and forget what we have said</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Survived the country did and leaders can be credited for some good works done in 1965-1970s.<br><br>After that they ran out of solutions except the simple ones like taxing and recovering full market prices from all citizens. Economic restructuring and many other policies failed and we are now falling behind in technology start-ups etc and there are no concrete plans or strategies to catch up.<br><br>Why they failed from the 1970s? They practised the wrong policies of regarding themselves as talents and failing to nurture local practical talents and entrepreneurs in all fields.<br><br>Now we are reaching a point where the competition is getting more intense with each passing day and Korea and Taiwan technology start-ups are overtaking ours basically foreign-dominated and GLCs economy. The failures of our economy is mainly caused by a long period of believing that a few leaders can do the job. It is mass participation in knowledge application that could give Singapore the edge.<br><br>We are still practising the old policies of relying on a few academicians called scholars in making assumptions to lift the moribund economy. All the look-good self-promotions and media hype and grand money spending projects have failed to work before and will be unlikely to work again. Big efforts have to be made to concentrate in getting real competitiveness like what Dr. Goh Keng Swee once has done in making Jurong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>robertteh, I am puzzled by the subject of your thread: "definition of true democracy".<br><br>Is there a "true democracy"?<br><br>1) Democracy is a concept of politics created over many years of philoshophical thinking, conceptualisation, implementation, evaluation and, improvisation and/or correction. It is no wonder that democracy has varying models in different nations. It is modelled to fit different circomstances. It is the same for other forms of governance. There is no one form of government where all nations practising it conform to the exact same model. Since each nation has its own needs, it will modify its government to fit itself. So, whose interpretation of democracy do you consider the "truth"?<br><br>2) Since democracy and its interpretation differs amongst its practisers, where can we find its true form? Bear in mind that something that is "true" is a fact, undeniable and undisputable. Do you actually claim, then, that your definition of democracy is an undeniable and undisputable fact? What, may i ask, is the basis of your claim?<br><br>Your thread pertains to governance in Singapore, which leads to the next question: Should we be seeking a "true" form of democracy?<br><br>3) The goal of the science of politics is the creation of a system which will be best able to run a nation. Democracy was a genre created to describe a certain number of systems which have similar characteristics. It is a system which has produced a number of notable successes globally. That is undisputable. But, strictly speaking, our goal is not democracy. Our goal is whatever form of government is ideal in our land. So should we focus our efforts on fitting our way of government into a strictly and rigidly defined concept?<br><br>4) This means that democracy is similar to a scientific theory. In science, theorists produce an approximation to the truth and produce evidence to support it. The evidence is in the form of experiments which is as close as possible to perfect conditions. However, the assumptions made during the experiments prevent the experiment from being the exact representation of perfect conditions, only the nearest. Scientists then go on to provide further evidence in support of the theory or to debunk it. Democracy may have been successful in certain circumstances, but we cannot claim it to be The one and only way. We can, at most, pronounce it ideal under the conditions which it has been tested. Isnt this so?<br><br>acotis</div>

Words backed by the people can change the government or perhaps even topple it. The citizens can only discuss thier dissent among each other, but they will need a true leader such as you. No matter if you dont have the political talents , what is politics ? one such as u should know well enough. To improve the lives , you n i cannot do it if we are below the food chain. But to be on TOP of the food chain, you can mold and sculpture ur ideals. Think about it...think of about the people. THere are many out there that needs a leader. Be the voice of the people!</div>
