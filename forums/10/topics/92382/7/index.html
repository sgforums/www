            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, TKHAN,<br><br>The state of democracy that currently exists in more advanced countries has probably been quite well summed up by Pilamaster in the previous post as:<br><br>1) Federal Democracy (as practiced by USA and to a lesser extent UK, AU)<br><br>2) Central parliamentary Democracy (practiced by Eastern Europe and Russia)<br><br>3) Socialist Democracy (practiced by germany and I guess Scandinavia)<br><br>4) Direct Democracy (practicd by Swiss)<br><br>These democratic countries may be practising varying degrees of democracy but as a whole, these are democratic systems in terms of one-man one vote, equal rights of citizens, non-prosecution for anyone taking part in electoral process etc.<br><br>These countries have achieved significant progress and prosperity or advancements in social, cultural or economic terms. No other system has yet stood up to the superiority of democratic system of government as posted previously under this topic.<br><br>Those states that claim to practise other systems cannot quite offer such strongly based openness, accountability and transparency as exist in these democratic countries. Asian values, family values upheld for sometime have since the Asian Financial crisis been found self-oriented or self-centred which could have brought about malpractices at the end.<br><br>Civilization over the past four centuries has achieved mcuh progress under democratic system of government. Democracy has triumphed over pure socialism, communism, autocracy, dictatorship, guided-democracy, and pseudo-socialism or pseudo-democracy.<br><br>It signifies better scientific progress through mass participation, openness made possible under democracy. As a result, people who are free to vote and practise government accountability and transparency attained higher standard of living, economic, educational and social advancements after adoption of such system of government.<br><br>Some latest democratised countries might have experienced practical difficulties due to certain exceptional and temporary circumstances but given time and fine-tuning, their people, these newly democratised countries will attain their goals and objectives and aspirations as compared with non-democratic or pseudo-democratic ones because democracy is more reliable in the longer term than ad hoc beliefs or practices.<br><br>The 7 points of True Democracy are the practical extracts (therefore they exist as facts and not fiction) of democratic government worth practising particularly by those on the threshold of democracy as mass participation of people will bring about progress and it will help to avoid "U" turn or justifications.<br><br>Singapore has tried to follow such a system but is probably affected by self-justifications. Citizens can see and will feel the goodness of democracy only the beneficiaries cannot see these reasons. So, there is nothing doubtful about the 7 points of TRUE democracy as they are worth practising and working hard for.<br><br>They can stand up to scrutiny but not those in favour of other theories not yet proven by civilization and who are protective of status quo or entrenched in one-party interests.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Fellow forum friends:<br><br>I just registered and I am seeking help from you guys.<br><br>I am an undergraduate student from the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, Washington, DC. I am currently doing a country report for my Comparative Political System class. I chose Singapore to be my topic. So during my research, I found out about this forum, which I think I can get the most reliable and trusted information and reference.<br><br>My paper is basically a analytical one about Singapore's political and electoral structure, backed by supporting data and calculations. However, since Singapore is a single-member plurality (majoritarian) democracy, and the PAP is the only major dominant party in the parliament, all my analysis and calculation regarding issues such as seat-allocation would be fairly simple. Therefore, my professor told me to find out <strong>other important data </strong>to support my analysis, which is to identify a challenge or problem the country faces as a result of its political system.<br><br>However given Singapore's impressive prosperity, high rank of GDP per capita, and stability, personally I really want to argue for the benefit of such a political system. (This stance is really for the sake of my paper, because I've never lived in Singapore and i don't want to sound subjective)<br><br><strong>But so far I am not successful at all in finding out any "hard data", such as survey, public opinion polls, or statistics, that indicate Singaporeans (voters)' satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the existing electoral system, or satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the governance of the ruling party.  So I would be extremely appreciated if you would provide me any available web or non-web sources of (or links to) such survey, opinion poll or statistic information. </strong><br><br>This will be a crucial element in my paper to prove my argument. (So far I have already checked on the Singapore Statistic Bureau's website, the SINGOV information site, and sites of various international agencies, such as World Association for Public Opinion Research, The Worldwide Association of Reserach Professionals, Transparency International, and etc.)<br><br>Last, I am also interested in finding out how "the Chinese value toward governance" is having an impact on the PAP governance. Perhaps any information on that would help too.<br><br>Thank you very much and I really appreciated if any of you wouldn't mind to help<br><br></div>

You'd have to register as a member of their mailing list though, on some mysterious caveat that doesn't seem to benefit anyone. Well then, the press happens to be under govt control and ownership too. *sigh*<br><br>Don't expect to find any public opinion polls or surveys done by independent organaizations. Polls were banned in this country in 1975. The govt believes it is too subjective, and arouses unnecessary emotion, which is inimical to national security and racial and religious harmony.<br><br>You could however, check websites like Freedomhouse, Amnesty International (unless you are as biased against it as the govt is), ThinkCentre, Singapore Review, Reporteres Sans Frontieres' reports, the Sydney Morning Herald, the International Herald tribune, Asiaweek Magazine, and FEER (if its archives still exist). GDP is but a small segment of everything. oh yeah, you could check the US State Department's Annual Reports as well. I provide a list of the URLS as an appendage. At any rate, ThinkCentre has additional links which you might find interesting.<br><br>As for the "Chinese Value", I would like to help you, but I have no idea what you mean. Do you mean Confucianism?<br><br>the willing pikamaster<br><br>P.S.:<br><br>RSF: <a href="http://www.rsf.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsf.org</a><br>ThinkCentre: <a href="http://%20http://www.thinkcentre.org" rel="nofollow"> http://www.thinkcentre.org</a><br>FreedomHouse: <a href="http://%20http://www.freedomhouse.co.uk" rel="nofollow"> http://www.freedomhouse.co.uk</a><br>Amnesty international: <a href="http://%20http://www.amnesty.org" rel="nofollow"> http://www.amnesty.org</a><br>Singapore Review: <a href="http://%20http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sgreview/" rel="nofollow"> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sgreview/</a><br>Singapore Elections: <a href="http://%20http://www.singaporeelections.org" rel="nofollow"> http://www.singaporeelections.org</a> (check THinkcentre for the correct url)<br>TalkingCock: <a href="http://%20http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow"> http://www.talkingcock.com</a><br>P.P.S.:<br><br>Perhaps your "Chinese Value" refers to "Asian Values".

            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee who was just elected as the Secretary General of PAP has called on Singaporeans again, this time both the old and young to join PAP to serve the nation.<br><br>However, what he seems to have again forgotten is to address the most critical issue of all - whether he would unwind the autocracy system of the past to allow more people to practise entrepreneurship or make meaningful contributions.<br><br>Entrepreneurship was repeatedly found to be sorely lacking in our economy as can be seen in recent recessions. Without freeing up the controls and tight reins on ideas and choices, how can any one contribute to building a great nation.<br><br>Further procrastination will cause Singapore to lose out on mass entrepreneurship culture essential for continual success.<br><br>Thus the call can be seen as at best a meaningless rhetoric.

What do they see but same docile yesmen in parliament.<br><br>What Singapore society needs badly now are people with ideas and daring to speak up their minds and do something about the current high costs that have resulted in our loss of economic competitiveness?<br><br>So will the new crops of candidates said to be full of promises are indeed any different in terms of such daring spirit to make changes to existing unworkable hardened policies like meritocracy for a few or pro-foreign attitudes in employment or business promotions.<br><br>One needs to ask oneself this question " will the current candidates be any different from the past? Do they have the daring to face the behemoth of restrictions and constraints and to work towards free flow of ideas, choices and solutions.<br><br>Among the PM Lee's first tests will be the unequivocal dismantling of past draconian press control as witnessed in the episode of sudden termination of the ST pressman reported in this forum.<br><br>Talk is cheap.
