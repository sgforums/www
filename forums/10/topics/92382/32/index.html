            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by archon1234:</div><div class="quote_body">From the recent devleopment at Sg, we can see that there are several "incidents" that pointed out our hidden weaknesses:<br><br>1) Citiraya scandals that involved many high position Sg executives in many MNCs. This also exposed the weakness of our banking sector control mechanisms. The CAO incident further proven the point. All our honesty image had gone down the drain after so many years of effort. There is simply too little transparency in our system.<br><br>2) Poor education system. Now Sg media finally bring the spot light to the young singaporean. The new generation singaporean are really too open in sex but too poorly educated in protecting themselves. They only care for having fun; in the end many young boy &amp; gals had kenna STD liao. </div></blockquote>A system that tries to promote elites has got all the elites in troubles from insider trading to CBT in one instance after another. Obviously the leaders have forgotten something very important than elites and intellect - morality and EQ.<br><br>The most important criterion is not scholars or meritocracy. It is corporate accountability and setting of personal example among the leaders so that everyone in society will contribute in a more acceptable manner and not helping themselves to dig as much as possible for their own benefits and private enrichments. NKF is just the tip of the iceberg. If all care to look there will be more abuses and malpractices that the two cases you mentioned.<br><br>Has our system of meritocracy or leadership imparted the right value and succeeded in nation building despite all the hype about leadership and talents of those in charge ?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Just look at the young kids around your neighbourhood, how many of your young neighbours bother to say "hello" to u. This gen of Singaporean too self centred (or "performance oriented" in gov word), they do not usually see the importance of "Guan Xi".  Worst of all, the school kids nowadays are more daring, sometimes even dare to challenge their teachers to one-on-one duel. Female students made false report on their teachers molesting them!!</strong></blockquote>So the young just looks at the leaders and what they say every day in the media - dog-eat-dog society with elites taking all and laughing all the way to the bank. People and people problems are pushed away by all the look-good rhetorics without solutions.<br><br>What will the young learn the right way - humility and service to the nation or care for the poor and needy?<br><br><blockquote><strong>3) NKF case. I agreed that Mr Durrai should get a decent pay for running NKF. But not to the extend that drawing $600K yearly payout, with golden tap in personal toilet. It is sad to learnt now that NKF actually spend more than 40% of the budget on staff pay-roll, rather than supporting the needy.<br><br>4) Our most talented young grads are more interested to get involved in the working out the stock trading options, rather than working hard to set-up a successful business in IT or life science. We can see alot of dynamic young people in Taiwan, HK and Korea, involving setting up new business ventures at high tech sectors such as IT, Chip Design, Life Science. Thus, this explain how come Singapore is losing her competitive edge in attracting new FDI in manufacturing sector.<br><br></strong></blockquote>The elites are promoted to absurdity of collecting handsome rewards while the poor and needy continue to be trampled under fallacious policies about reserve and talents. These are the real lessons learned from the NKF. Because of malpractices and potential crimes, there is no alternative but to conduct public inquiry. Why wait until problems become uncontrollable before taking actions in so many cases? The simple solutions is to be proactive and put in  the right ministers who are problems solvers to crack at all the problems and dig up all the worms.</div>

However, I agree, in principle at least, that it should deal with racists, although jailing them might be a bit too harsh. A hefty fine should be good enough.<br><br>And I agree with what Tony Blair said; but rmb, he is the head of the government who recently passed a law extending rights of government to carry out detention w/o trial, which just shows that he doesn't practice what he preaches.

For leaders to be effective they should demonstrate extra quality and ability and willingness to understand people and be prepared to lead by example and subscribe to principles of accountability and transparency. If leaders are unable to be objective in applying sedition law to non-mass circulation electronic dairy like blogging, people will see them as less than objective or reasonable and will grow wary and unwilling to support such leaders.<br><br>So far our leaders over the past forty years or so have passed many ISD-like draconian laws. They are not prepared to rationalise and be objective or lead by example in making themselves accountable in invoking and applying sedition law to personal blogging.<br><br>By failing to show such objectivity in applying sedition laws to bloggers' immature remarks over the net, it shows that they are not leading by example.</div>
