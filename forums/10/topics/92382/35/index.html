            <div class='col-md body'>Reply to forumer Master Servant as posted on 7.11.2005 at <a href="http://www.findsingapore.net/forum" rel="nofollow">http://www.findsingapore.net/forum</a><br><br>I agree that there is no ideal system. We can only try to be as practical as we can. We can try to recognise the fact autocracy and totalitarianism will finally lead to suppressions, injustice and suffering with no check or insufficient check on power. The ancient truth is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I wonder when will people ever learn this truth.<br><br>We should strive for a practical widely practised system which is most desirable for maximum progress, peace, fairness, justice and equity. Of course even the most desirable system like democracy is not perfect and has to be constantly guarded against potential abuses. Democracy also has its pitfalls and many shortcomings.<br><br>Singapore is a modified form of parliamentary Westmister Democracy where the executive has become over-confident as if it is always right and does not admit error easily even in the face of all the wrongs.<br><br>If our autocracy has been for the good or benign, citizens will accept autocracy. Unfortunately from 1970s onwards it has become less objective or benign but drifted to be self-centred with a lot of promotion of elitism or ego of the leaders. It has degraded to become less and less acceptable to the people especially in view of the persistent self-ness and lacking of accountability and transparency.<br><br>Our benign presumably democratic system is no longer as objective and pro-people as it once was. To that extent it has failed in my view despite past success. People are now demanding change so that the system will evolve to be more open and accountable with major decisions and implementations made for the good of the people and not like the NKF. There should not be so much taxing and recovering of costs to full market prices like the corporation as people are paying taxing and surpluses belong to all which should be used for people to tide over problems in bad times.<br><br>It is wrong to keep building surpluses from higher and higher taxing and cost recovery just to justify paying higher and higher salaries to ministers with lesser and lesser results. The system is no longer able to live up to people's expectations and are found to be with little accountability until disasters strike retarding our responsiveness to change.<br><br>The major policy errors have been posted in other thread including paranoid about welfare producing the opposite of a high-cost society, over-emphasising on academic education to sustain an elite system to the neglect of mass participation and practical knowledge broad-based education needed to produce entrepreneurial society.<br><br>Singapore without the democratic underpinning, can never have been what it is today as whatever Singapore leaders wants to claim for its so-called leadership could not have gone very far.<br><br>Already leadership or autocracy has produced high costs and problems to the majority only benefiting the top few percentage of population. So our system will not last until finally it is replaced by more accountable mass participation by the people.<br><br>That is where democracy can do better. It is time to bring back accountability with all major decision making which should be more like the democratic practice in widely practised democratic countries like collective decision process within cabinet as well as parliament.<br><br>The PM and his senior ministers should try to use its leadership in providing wisdom and guidance and finally make decisions with accountable consultations. Can't this kind of modified democracy be practised instead of one based on the ability or ego of one man or a few men even if we really want to evolve our own version of democracy.</div>

Thanks for reproducing this supremo's constant self-adulations about their assumed ability to rebut criticisms of shortcomings. But let us just go back a  little to examine the criticisms of the people in the case of NKF and Nicol Highway Collapse..Up to now I still haven't seen any good rebuttal of the people's criticisms about the negligence of the ministers or lack of proactive preventative actions after the Hotel New World collapse findings.<br><br>So it is clear that our Leaders are kind of retreating into their shell and hope people will forget all their challenges to answer to criticisms meeting arguments for arguments. This is how robust the leaders' arguments that they are the leaders who never flinches from debunking of criticisms. Robustness has again lost their its true meaning....</div>
