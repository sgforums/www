            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by crazy monkey:<br><strong>[b]Democratic Society</strong><br><br>QUOTE: Democracy is more than a set of constitutional rules and procedures that determine how a government functions. In a democracy, government is only one element coexisting in a social fabric of many and varied institutions, political parties, organizations, and associations. This diversity is called pluralism, and it assumes that the many organized groups and institutions in a democratic society do not depend upon government for their existence, legitimacy, or authority. UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY:The so-called pluralism in a democracy will flourish only in a society where people are free to pursue private citizens' interests of associations in arts, social, cultural, educational and professional activities. The more social and cultural and other common interests, the more diversified and vibrant will be the community.<br><br>Community organizations like trade unionism, educational and professional bodies have been too tightly controled  in the past. These controlled civic associations were perceived by citizens with suspicions as serving the interest of government.<br><br>Government has regarded them with suspicions setting controls and regulations to prevent subversiveness or perceived anti-govenment activities.<br><br>Such controls have brought about a rather sterile community where finally the citizens are only interested in economic wellbeing and selfish pursuits of the 5-Cs. In the new age, society will become more de-massified and diversified, with more and more interests and trade NGOs growing out of trades or professionalism.<br><br>True community bonding or mutual helps will not happen with Government sponsored community clubs and Residents Committees as citizens perceive the hands of government behind such associations.<br><br>Only spontaneous participation will lead to true diversities and social and cultural richness.<br><br>Singapore will become increasingly boring and dull without any vibrancy from community social and cultural ballast unless there is a major change of this paranoid control freak with government controlling the internal working of civic bodies under licensing and other means. As a result there is a lack of NGOs and people are loose footed and keep to themselves.<br><br>QUOTE: Thousands of private organizations operate in a democratic society, some local, some national. Many of them serve a mediating role between individuals and the complex social and governmental institutions of which they are a part, filling roles not given to the government and offering individuals opportunities to exercise their rights and responsibilities as citizens of a democracy. UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY: These various NGOs will over time throw up social and community leaders in their respective fields with some influential enough to offer candidates for public office. Many may take part in debating issues, and trying to influence policy decisions. Is there an objective policy of the government towards formation or growths of NGOs within  the communities.<br><br>The maturity of our political system require broad-minded inculcation of NGOs be it charitable organizations, religious bodies or educational social or cultural grouping of one kind or another.<br><br>Over time if these NGOs field candidates to stand for election in public offices with some turning to support opposition political parties such happening must be tolerated as such growths of political consciousness is good for maturing of society and vibrancy and competitiveness in the long term interest of th nation even if it means a certain concessions to oppositions.<br><br>A change of mindset is urgently needed in our current political landscape to encourage growths of active citizenry through growing of more NGOs the start of political maturity many are talking about  - objective nurturing of supportive democratic institutions.<br><br>To encourage growth of diversities and vibrancy, the first step is to nurture the growth and formation of associations and civic bodies the way it was done for formation of management corporations, for management of common property in strata titled landed developments. Nothing will be subversive if the births of associations were conceived in an objective manner without all the hidden agenda and government control.<br><br>So pluralism in a democratic society, will require fresh perspective and objective good corporate governance which only an enlightened government can provide. It is the duty of the government to promote growth of NGOs to build a vibrant and self-relient society.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <strong></strong></div>

The midnight knock of the secret police has no place in a democracy.<br><br>No person shall be held under arrest without explicit, written charges that specify the alleged violation. Not only are persons entitled to know the exact nature of the charge against them, they also must be released immediately, under the doctrine known as habeas corpus, if the court finds that the charge is without justification or the arrest is invalid.<br><br>Persons charged with crimes should not be held for protracted periods in prison. They are entitled to a speedy and public trial, and to confront and question their accusers. UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY: In our case past beliefs by the government seem to be that the state needs all the special laws and presumptions to deal with accused or contain communism, subortage and communalism etc. Arguments have been one-sided in favor of government to handle crimes. This has resulted in people feeling a sense of helplessness and eventual lack of confidence in the state's conduct of the rule of laws and justice. One-sided conduct of justice or security of state is not likely to go down well with citizens in the long term interest of orderly development. Such mentality on the part of state should change.<br><br>It has taken civil societies many years to realize that while there is a need to maintain laws and order or rule of laws, there existed potential for abuse of power by the police authority. The higher officers of the state need not resort to oppressive means to get after prisoners to prove a case against him. Through professional investigations, it is possible to establish prima facie and eventual prosecutions based on actual evidences or circumstances.<br><br>The state should not be over-zealous or anxious to secure efficient convictions without full and accountable procedures being followed. The need to prevent miscarriage of justice has probably not been felt to the same extent as a more established society. So far there was an non-committal attitute or policy towards to exercise of prisoners' rights in accountable Habeas corpus etc because we are a younger country not experiences problems as yet with oppressions or abuse of police powers.<br><br>Instead in our particular case, the state tends to put up a strong case to extend polciing to deal with so-called threats or security problems from outside sources like terrorism, communism or communalism etc. As a result of all such state beliefs or agenda, the rights of accused might have been discounted in favor of the state. Even if the state has a duty to maintain laws and order it owes a concurrent duty too to its citizens to do so professionally and not to extract confessions from the accused by denying him the recourse of protection against wrongfulness by way of Habeas corpus etc. to cause likely abuse or police high-handedness which happened in an imperfect world.<br><br>For proper evolvement of professional conduct of law and order, as against justice and equity for all, the rights of the accused (innocent till proven guilty and evidential procedures etc) should be not only respected but seen openly to be observed by all including the higher up at all times.<br><br>If two sets of laws must be maintained with one set under presumptions of guilt or circumstances on the part of ISD, such use of extraordinary powers should be exercised under special supervisions to prevent abuse with external independent audit if needed to give confidence to citizens of professionalism.<br><br>This move to segregate use of emergency powers of the police to cope with outside or serious threats will restore the confidence of citizens and protect innocents from intuitive or presumptuous prosecution due to hidden or unclear motives on the part of any one in government.<br><br>It is not in the interest of political leaders to keep extending special intuitive powers to any police departments to make their jobs easier and presumptuously simple open-and-shut chores.<br><br>Police should be subjected to penalty for negligence in investigation resulting in innocents being wrongly prosecuted. Habeas corpus should be professionally issued by more independent judge unconnected with the case or department to ensure justice.<br><br>If there is such openness and accountable conduct of law and order, the world would be less likely to abuse or oppressions by the states. Image of government will be corrected when there is clear willingness to balance police powers with recognized evidential and investigation procedures already well established in more matured societies.<br><br>QUOTE:The authorities are required to grant bail, or conditional release, to the accused pending trial if there is little likelihood that the suspect will flee or commit other crimes. "Cruel and unusual" punishment, as determined by the traditions and laws of the society, is prohibited.<br><br>Persons cannot be compelled to be witnesses against themselves. This prohibition against involuntary self- incrimination must be absolute. As a corollary, the police may not use torture or physical or psychological abuse against suspects under any circumstances. A legal system that bans forced confessions immediately reduces the incentives of the police to use torture, threats, or other forms of abuse to obtain information, since the court will not allow such information to be placed into evidence at the time of trial.UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY: Civil society does not need to resort to force to extract confessions. The professionalism and skills of police and prosecutions must be developed to go after real criminals not anyone else. Political opponents or Innocents should be freed from any presumptuous interpretations or intuitive applications of laws. Don't over-rely on trust of police officers as they might get carried away or act on impulse being human beings themselves. Any lack of evidence should be recognised straight-away to avoid injustice to innocent under protection of proper accountable professional procedures.<br><br>QUOTE<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">ersons shall not be subject to double jeopardy; that is, they cannot be charged with the same crime twice. Any person tried by a court and found not guilty can never be charged with that same crime again.<br><br>Because of their potential for abuse by the authorities, so-called ex post facto laws are also proscribed. These are laws made after the fact so that someone can be charged with a crime even though the act was not illegal at the time it occurred.UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY: For the same reason that Singapore is a young country which has not come across grievances and injustices due to police' s abuse of the scale as found in matured or bigger countries, it is essential to recognise that such laws and procedures regarding investigation and prosecution of crimes should be allowed to evolve to greater professionalism to give confidence to investers and outside world dealing with us (e.g. Micheal Fay and others) that we are not a police state with state having all kinds of presumptuous powers to facilitate investigation or trial.<br><br>QUOTE<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">efendants may possess additional protections against coercive acts by the state. In the United States, for example, the accused have a right to a lawyer who represents them in all stages of a criminal proceeding, even if they cannot pay for such legal representation themselves. The police must also inform suspects of their rights at the time of their arrest, including the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent (to avoid self- incrimination).<br><br>A common tactic of tyranny is to charge opponents of the government with treason. For this reason, the crime of treason must be carefully limited in definition so that it cannot be used as a weapon to stifle criticism of the government.UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY: The authority with professionalism and abilities to conduct affairs of governance does not need hidden powers. When professionalism is achieved there is no reason the guilty will escape. On the other hand criminals may be easily established and dealt with due to greater diligence and due process.<br><br>After all the percentages of escaped cases need to be studied. As long as balance is achieved, there should be no undue concern about likely use of clever lawyers to cause escape of miscreants or making of the works of policing more difficult. Even if some gulity cases might escape, it is one risk that should be allowed for rather than granting of intuitive or presumptive power to police which might cause oppressions or abuse which at the end will be counter-productive.<br><br>QUOTE:None of these restrictions means that the state lacks the necessary power to enforce the law and punish offenders. On the contrary, the criminal justice system in a democratic society will be effective to the degree that its administration is judged by the population to be fair and protective of individual rights, as well as of the public interest.<br><br>Judges may be either appointed or elected to office, and hold office for specified terms or for life. However they are chosen, it is vital that they be independent of the nation's political authority to ensure their impartiality. Judges cannot be removed for trivial or merely political reasons, but only for serious crimes or misdeeds--and then only through a formal procedure, such as impeachment (the bringing of charges) and trial in the legislature.UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY:It is my conclusion that because of past circumstances and certain historial threats from external sources, our laws initially have been pro-state giving state greater intuitive or presumptive convenience to deal with miscreants. Over time people have felt controlled or feared losing confidence in the justice system. It is time to let go and be objective. It would be well to start afresh and respect the fact that police or prosecutors are no angels and can make mistakes.  The government should be seen to go after real and recalcitrant criminals and be fully aware of the above-mentioned need for professionalism in prosecuting suspected persons to prevent police or state abuse (for whatever reasons) which may cause bigger wrong like injustice or oppressions.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>[list=]<ul></ul> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Although I really feel that even the existence of a defamation act is rather archaic. I have realized, after doing thinking, that defamation suits are always pre-emptive strikes.

SO technically, I believe a flat fine will be unfair to any defendant, and definitely a jail sentence. but anyway, I'm writing the new legal structure in such a way that judges and juries will ahve complete autonomy on what punnishments they want to have; let's give them the chance to be creative. For all you may know, the creative solutions may be more effective than the standard fines or jail sentences in reducign the crime. In the case that creativity becoems too cruel anyway, we will always have the Court of Religious Justice to ensure the justness and moral appropriateness of the punnishment inflicted.<br><br>4) hehe... think along the lines of "Industrial Parliament"<br><br>5) yes, though many protections will already be enshrined in the Constitution itself.<br><br>6) yeah, well, thanks<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.

As Thomas Jefferson wrote: "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never shall be." UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY : Society needs only a certain percentage of generalists or academics. However, it will require a large number of sufficiently literate people well versed in practical applications of technological knowledge to bring about a competitive economy. In the past the education policy was too narrow emphasising only on producing more and more generalist education unrelated to manufacturing or services earning export dollars and creating jobs.<br><br>The great number of generalist academics cannot be absorbed by the economy and many become unemployed or less employable as found in the last two recessions. This kind of educational system is too academic and without strategic competitiveness to serve the new economy. It is education for education sake.<br><br>What society needs to encourage good-grade students to go into areas of education related to knowledge application to produce economic competitiveness. Some efforts have been made but the education received at Polys or ITEs should be directed towards turning classroom teaching into innovations and applications to prepare students to go into businesses. A person educated academically to study all subjects and gain high grades are good to have to maintain the economy but generally he is not adept in application areas and end up being employed or expecting employments as managers or administrators.<br><br>Appropriate balance of academic versus vocational or entrepreneurial skills from the polys and ITEs should be the new educational policy to take the economy to a higher level. Any shortage in management and administrative personnel can be made up by non-graduates or others but not technologists or engineers ought to be fully trained in practical courses to excel in economic competitiveness and nurturing entrepreneurs in various disciplines.<br><br>The lack of strategic educational policy has resulted in our having to rely on foreigners for such practical skills in many fields. In a diversified world with new technologies being introduced at high speed, we will lose out if we keep producing traditional lawyers, accountants and generalists to serve the higher end of general administrative personnel without realizing that such an educational system causes us shortages of future technology applicators and entrepreneurs. It is wrong to propagate higher academic education for the education sake or for social recognition or political control and conformity.<br><br>Some people say that university education will produce questioning, and analytical minds but larger number of generalists are already produced and unemployed.<br><br>QUOTE: Vanderbilt professor Chester E. Finn, Jr., said in his address to educators in Nicaragua: "People may be born with an appetite for personal freedom, but they are not born with knowledge about the social and political arrangements that make freedom possible over time for themselves and their children....Such things must be acquired. They must be learned." UNQUOTE<br><br>Vanderbilt clearly confirmed the importance of practical knowledge application. But how can the state go about making educating people to do likewise. The answer is obvious - let practical broad-based education be prioritized from schools and let such practical education relate to jobs in the industries and not push students into academic or general education as of now. Award higher degrees to people who are practical innovators in one field or another and get them to impart applications to more students at tertiary levels.<br><br>I agree that Education transmits values, creative and independent thinking. But more important is the aspect of guiding students while studying basics towards application of existing and new knowledge in all fields. It is important to recognise entrepreneurs often come from schools and polys emand not from the academic or general higher academic education.<br><br>QUOTE: "Education plays a singular role in free societies," Finn states. "While the education systems of other regimes are tools of those regimes, in a democracy the regime is the servant of the people, people whose capacity to create, sustain, and improve that regime depends in large measure on the quality and effectiveness of the educational arrangements through which they pass. In a democracy, it can fairly be said, education enables freedom itself to flourish over time."UNQUOTE<br><br>REPLY: Authoritarians tend to use education as a political or economic tools with attention given to conformity and standardization to serve their own purposes. Over time, such conformed education process emphasising on grades and prescribed academic areas causes neglect in broad-based technological application leading to shortage of entrepreneurs in technological fields to compete for real economic growths.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Far better to train our students to be more innovative, flexible and adaptable with less rote learning and memory work; students should be graded accordingly. Also, it is not to say that specialization at institutions of higher learning is no longer necessary. Simply put, it may be better for students in general to be trained in wider breadths rather than in greater depths (with the exception of those going into research).

This is a development due largely to economic forces rather than as a deliberate policy of gov due to the shift towards a service economy.  UNQUOTE</strong><br><br>REPLY: It may be true that the quality of engineering students has dropped or economic forces are largely the criteria determining our success or failure in endeavors. It is precisely because of uncertainties due to market forces that there is a critical need to produce future graduates more adept in practical knowledge application to suit the need of the future taking into account new and accelerating technological developments in various fields. When education policy is re-adjusted suitably to correct the current lop-sided emphasis to produce generalists by creating a better recognition and rewards of vocational and professional technological areas the quality of students in engineering will naturally go up. It is related to government's policies of recruitments, university entrance criteria and manpower structure in the civil service as well.<br><br><strong>QUOTE: I accept your point in general about the need for more entrepreneurs to drive the economy of the future. However, I believe, market forces will dictate what industries will flourish in the future; and these are not likely to be in traditional engineering. The correct strategy IMO is not to put our bets into particular industries (our gov tends to do this). Far better to train our students to be more innovative, flexible and adaptable with less rote learning and memory work; students should be graded accordingly. Also, it is not to say that specialization at institutions of higher learning is no longer necessary. Simply put, it may be better for students in general to be trained in wider breadths rather than in greater depths (with the exception of those going into research). My 2 cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> UNQUOTE</strong><br><br>REPLY : If to be general is better and more competitive than to be in-depth, than our general academics will be our saviours in creating more jobs and making Singapore more vibrant and competitive. I am not sure after many years of producing top-notch scholars whether we have indeed achieved the desired objective. I hope nevertheless our future education will emphasise on knowledge application and innovation to prepare students to be the future technopreneurs who are the true talents in my view for the economy. If we do not do this re-adjustment fast enough we will then have to continue to rely on foreign engineers and technopreneurs to create jobs and investments.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

A graduate in accountancy or business adminstration do not know enough about technology and are not trained enough to apply business concepts in them. We now have many academic graduates in various discipline who cannot get rightful employments or are under-employed.<br><br>Technology changes very fast in various fields. Those not trained in them cannot do anything as they might not understand the finer points of technology. By technology or engineering I do not mean over-specialising them to become narrow and inflexible. Our engineers and technologists can be trained more broadly inclusive of management knowledge.<br><br>The move to excel in engineering or technology does not mean that we do not need generalists or academics for the general economy. It is just that Singapore's past policy has tilted towards over-producing generalist or academics leading to unemployments of many highly educated graduates.<br><br>If we train our general industrial engineers with wider and adaptable all-round syllables to prepare them to become techno-managers and technopreneurs, it may be better and more competitive than to produce more accountants and business graduates more suitable for non-technology environment. In my view the future lies in technology and engineering and to meet challenges, past education policy has to be adjusted to produce more technopreneurs and engineering managers and not the great number of academics and generalist graduates. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE CULTURE OF DEMOCRACY<br><strong>QUOTE:A Civic Culture<br>Democracy is more than the sum of its institutions. A healthy democracy depends in large part on the development of a democratic civic culture. Culture in this sense, points out Diane Ravitch, does not refer to art, literature, or music, but to "the behaviors, practices, and norms that define the ability of a people to govern themselves. </strong><br><br>REPLY: Democracy as established over the past four decades is a political system consisting in essence certain predictable accountable check-and-balance processes e.g. electing good people, freedoms to participate in election, and functional divisions of government into legislative, executive and judiciary to lead the masses to progress based on the premise or precept of governance of the people, by the people and for the people.<br><br>The quality of democracy referred to i.e. whether it works well or it will lead to better social and cultural norms and behaviours of the people is another matter. If people in a democracy do not have opinions, are simple-minded, complacent or easily hook-winked by pre-election goodies, pretentiousness, justifications or denials of high costs and other problems, then there is not much future with such a country whether or not democracy is practised.<br><br><strong> QUOTE: "A totalitarian political system," she writes, "encourages a culture of passivity and apathy. The regime seeks to mold an obedient and docile citizenry. By contrast, the civic culture of a democratic society is shaped by the freely chosen activities of individuals and groups. Citizens in a free society pursue their interests, exercise their rights, and take responsibility for their own lives. They make their own decisions about where they will work, what kind of work they will do, where they will live, whether to join a political party, what to read, and so on. These are personal decisions, not political decisions." UNQUOTE</strong><br><br>REPLY: A totalitarian regime is self-centred and not people-centred. There is "no governance of the people, by the people or for the people" to begin with. Because of self-centredness decisions will be made mostly not necessarily to benefit the masses not to benefit the leaders and confederates in powers. It is as simple as this.<br><br>If totalitarian regime does anything good, it will be like a lottery or highly exceptional. Once in a while history might throw up a benevolent dictator who will take control but is willing to sacrifice his own power or wellbeing for the good of countrymen.<br><br>Deng Xiao Peng was such an exception. He was in a position to assume supreme leadership, take power into his own hand and stubbornly claim credit and authority to tower over others and become an autocrat.  But he was benevolent and recognize that for the good of China he ought to democratize succession.  Mendela did the same. Such leaders were Great Leaders.<br><br><strong>QUOTE:Literature, art, drama, and film--the artistic expression of a society's culture--also exist independently of government. A democratic society may support or otherwise encourage artists and writers, but it does not set artistic standards, pass judgment on the worth of artistic endeavors, or censor artistic expression. Artists are not employees or servants of the state. The primary contribution of a democracy to art is freedom--to create, to experiment, to explore the world of the human mind and spirit. UNQUOTE </strong><br><br>REPLY: Quality of democracy can improve all time. Where people are truly free and democracy is practised with accountable checks and balances and institutions are in place to lead the whole country to greater vibrancy and resilience, arts literature, drama and artistic expressions mentioned will flower. Without a supportive environment people will struggle to live and have no disposition to practise arts, or finer things in life.<br><br>Democracy has often been mixed up with quality of governance. The former is a structure of decentralised processes for accouintable political governance. The latter is the final results of sustained good corporate political governance.  The western democracy framework that has been established today ensures free and fair election and accountable check-and-balance governance but does not guarantee quality governance.<br><br>But as a system, so far it is the best, better of all the political systems as Winston Churchull has put it as compared others like dictatorship, autocracy, totalitarian and theocratic or other highly ideological systems. Success ? Records of success: democratic countries enjoyed progress, stability, fairness, equity, justice and technological and scientific advances over the past four decades as compared with other systems. Autocratic governments have no match for such records. They have to go along with democracy and try to give the appearance of such to sustain power hold. Some elements of mass participative governance will be good but in the long run, truly democratic processes will be sustainable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Legislations should be more open to embrace greater choices and possibilities while setting new directions for growths.<br><br>Talentocracy should embrace practical knowledge application to allow innovations to growth so that each student can pursue his or her inclination or interests in simple and mundane knowledge like cooking, football, entertainments, arts and casino management etc.<br><br>Multi-level feeders are extended from practical businesses to interrelate with schools' curricula and practical broad-based teaching in class. Personal career goals are aligned to learning and work processes. To excel for self becomes synonymous with education and work goals. When one pursues excellence for self, he is doing so for education and works at the same time.  Integration and interaction between knowledge application for self or work are established within the same sets of logically knowledge-application work processes.<br><br>Vibrancy and resilience are ingrained in every citizens because as long as he or she pursues knowledge applicaiton, it will help him grow in making both career, education and work all at the same time.There will be emancipation of self or self-ness to allow growth of group synergy or organizational efficiency to reach economic competitiveness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
