It clearly shows the success of the Governemt in dulling the minds of most Singapore Citizens, and create the constant dependence of Singaporeans for a steady guiding hand from the Government, who have purposefully encouraged dependency so as to make themselves permanently indispensable.<br><br>How did you come to believe that Chee Soon Juan can only speak balderdash, and can only be disruptive to any discussion ?

How many can afford broadband and are still stuck with the modem ? How many can still afford to stay in a 5 Room HDB, and prefer to DOWNGRADE in order to survive into their old age, or to make ends meet during this recession period ?<br><br>Are we better off today - even with our strong Singapore Dollar, that is supposed to give us a COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE over our agricultural based neighbors ? Or are we getting less and paying a higher price despite the fact that our Singapore Dollar is stronger, and which should give us a BIGGER COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE vis-a-vis our neighbors ?<br><br>Are the numbers of Singaporeans falling into the LOWER INCOME BRACKET growing in size, while the MIDDLE INCOME GROUP is shrinking with each retrenchment exercise and as long as the FOUR PERCENT unemployment persist through 2005 ?<br><br>Can you seriously compare the meer possession of material goods with the actual QUALITY of LIFE ?<br><br>Such simplistic and materialistic views reflect a generation that is accustomed to economic growth, and have yet to face the stark reality and challenges of retrenchment - a result of the MIND being DULLED with all the goodies, and unable to discern the difficulties that the Government is concealing while they are facing this mind boggling challenge in resolving the crisis in Singapore that has persisted since 1987 recession.<br><blockquote>Originally posted by runningismylife:<strong><br>even in europe, most of the scandinavian countries practises Socialism Democracy. and for your info Atobe, the reason why we were nearly kicked out of the clique of social democracy league, is because of our reluctance to give a PENSION SCHEME, a NATION-WIDE FREE HEALTH SCHEME.<br><br>schemes which are bringing many european countries to their knees.

BRITAIN.<br><br>thus, the foresight shown back in the 1970s show that our leaders were right. a pension scheme coupled with a nation-wide free health scheme would have killed Singapore post 1998 and sars. </strong></blockquote>Sorry to say this, but where did you get your brief from, concerning the reasons behind the sacking of Singapore by Socialist International ?<br><br>This piece of information is certainly "balderdash" - to accurately apply your term.<br><br>Do you seriously expect us to believe that a serious organisation such as the Socialist International will want to expell Singapore simply due to the reluctance of the Singapore Government to bring the Pension Scheme and implement a Nation-wide Free Health Scheme similar to Europe ?<br><br>This is a very new angle in viewing Singapore's expulsion from the Socialist International membership.<br><br>See the referenced site:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International</a><br><br>Will such an 'august' organisation as the Socialist International - with so many leading countries that believe in SOCIALISM and DEMOCRACY - be so UNDEMOCRATIC and INTOLERANT towards Singapore, as to seek her expulsion from this organisation over the mundane issues of health and pension scheme ?<br><br>This is a fantastic point of view, and certainly takes the cake in thought process from a 'dulled' mind.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many of your questions are factual, and the answers publicly available, acknowledged and written/analysed in various academic texts, journal articles and legal commentaries. I will answer them simply leaving you to read up if you are genuinely interested.<br><br>robertteh writes,<br><blockquote>Did Indonesia develop its present democracy from its heritage? </blockquote>Indonesia's first experience with democracy was in 1945 when it gained its independence and promulgated its first constitution. Strong president, weak legislature. That's its 'heritage'.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>Did Japan, Taiwan or India take advantage of its heritage in coming to their present electoral democracy ?</blockquote>Japan- American Occupation (1945-1952) reformed its entire political system, but also left a place for the Japanese monarchy.<br>Taiwan- based on 1946 constitution which was drawn up for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entire</span> China (incuding mainland).<br>India-British granted independence in 1947, constitution written three years later, runs a bicameral parliamentary system and draws extensively from British and American liberal democracies.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>I understand what you are trying to say that there are many problems affecting countries trying to practise American democracy, What I had pointed out is clear - that the problems you mentioned with Taiwan, or Philippines are not necessarily attributable to system failure. Many intervening factors may be involved to explain why other democratizations do not work as well. Time is one factor as I am sure you will agree. </blockquote>Actually some democracies are unable to function properly simply because they were badly designed in the first place e.g strong executive, weak legislature, multitude of parties in parliament all protecting their own agendas without compromise, strong personality-based parties due to weak party system etc. Of course other factors may exist, but this does not diminish the importance of a well-designed constitution.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>I have merely tried to tell you to look at endurance of democratic system of governance from a historical perspective to show that despite all the criticisms against American or UK model nonetheless, democracy has developed and been accepted by increasing number of countries</blockquote>I have said repeatedly I agree with you that American presidential and British parliamentary democracies are universally acknowledged as liberal democracies (see my many previous posts which state those sentiments in exactly the same words!), but that while they function well in their respective countries, it is because they evolved over centuries according to the unique historical circumstances. It is 'accepted'  in the sense that other countries realise that these are two democracies which have bits here and there worth emulating, but they are <strong>NOT</strong> accepted in the sense that the two models have been copied wholesale elsewhere.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>Critics of American liberal democracy (as you would like to call it) did not fully grasp its goodness but only look at it as full of problems which in the final analysis may be just the same everywhere or worse elsewhere. </blockquote>You have made your judgement about American democracy and its "goodness". For you, two hundred years is probably an adequate period of time. Has it served the American people well? I have pointed out the fracas in the last American election in 2000 in my previous posting (6 Sept 2004). Those are facts and events which have been (over)commented/analysed in the international media and televised- if facts cannot convince you, perhaps you are so steeped in American "goodness", probably nothing much else will. Let me also add that various Senate enquiries, the various scandals of ties between VP Dick Cheney and Halliburton, the expose of the neo-convservatives and their agenda have only served to highlight the fraility of current 'democratic' practices and dented the credibility of the current US administration. (to put it mildly!)<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>If critics are so intent on criticising American or UK democracy, surely it is not too much to ask them to define which is the model best suited to a particular circumstance other than just heritage or something loose or changeable.<br>Surely they can come up with some 7 points too for useful discussions. </blockquote>Of course it is good to have something to work with. I can do that but I also have to add that there is no "true model" per se that exists. All politcal scientists generally agree that democracy should consist of: law and order, a functioning bureaucracy, civil and political rights, universal suffrage, defined territorial borders which confers citizenship, clearly defined responsibilities and relationships of/between executive, legislature, judiciary and constraints in the use of violence against citizens. (Browse any texts/journals and you will find roughly the same guidelines.) Perhaps it was crucial that you should have read up (even if just from the internet) first, instead of writing in a offhand/loose fashion your 7-point criteria and then expecting some form of quaity debate.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>The substance behind their contention that there is no point to discuss or there is no such thing as democracy or true democracy is not presented so far despite my repeated request. </blockquote>As you can see, many people have participated in this subject, and it still remains at the top of the forum even as I write. One works with what is available, without expecting too much. It's a public forum afterall.<br><br>robertteh writes<br><blockquote>In my opinion, true democracy may be idealistic, and different country may need to approach it from their own perspective and circumstances</blockquote>I have noted that you tend <strong>NOT </strong>to answer the specific questions I pose in previous postings, preferring to bring up new questions (and old ones  I have already responded to) or prevaricate. I asked previously, what is 'true democracy'? 'True to you or the people who have to live under it?'.<br><br>It is meaningless to say that 'democracy has been accepted and developed' by many countries. That much is common sense. Even North Korea calls itself <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Democratic</span> People's Republic of Korea. What is crucial is to grasp its intrinsic intricacies and to apply it to unique national situations. Harping on American 'goodness' and resorting to cliches (as you have done in your various posts on this subject) without a critical eye serves no other purpose than reveal your own (misplaced) inclinations and preconceived preferences.<br><br></div>

(For a definition of electoral democracy, I leave you to do a Google yourself) You won't find a book that describes those systems as such, just like there is no serious academic text which will describe Sweden as a communist state.

Of course, the fact that robertteh keeps harping on the 'goodness' of American democracy also means I have to put my points to him on the same ground. If he chooses to talk about Swede democracy, naturally I will turn my attention to Sweden.<br><br>iveco writes<br><blockquote>proportional representation is common and nobody has an absolute majority. The latter should become the norm as democracy, IMO should be about power-sharing and equality.<br>I pull no punches in my advocation of proportional representation as i feel it is a much better way to go about governing the country.</blockquote>You are quite right in pointing out the benefits of proportional representation (PR) system that is practised in countries such as Australia and Japan. But there are many flaws inherent in this too: a complex vote-counting method, the inclination among various parties to resort to inter-party bargaining, intra-party bargaining among politicians of the same party to be given first priority on party preferences, a multi-party system in a parliament which is slower to reach compromise and more likely to remain obstinate, increased likelihood of personality-based politics where voters vote for the individual, rather than the party agenda or platform etc. So many examples of these defects can be observed in combined PR/FPTP systems.<br><br>Reagrdless of whether first-past-the-post system (FPTP) is practised or the the PR system is practised, my opinion is that it has to suit the national circumstance. For me, it really isn't about 'equality' or 'power-sharing'. It's about voting in the party that individual voter wants. My opinion is that a simpler voting method is always preferable, especially in small countries with small populations- no need to jostle for party preferences or backroom bargaining. But of course, your preferences are as good as mine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART ONE</strong><br>pikamaster writes,<br><blockquote>Have you been taking too much of the Straits Times' (biased, pro-govt) reporting on local affairs? Go read the article on CSJ more carefully. He didn't flee; he was merely going to a congress. For all his faults, he never flees. </blockquote>Pikamaster is not wrong in pointing out that the ST is pro-government. Indeed, the newspaper admits to that freely, seeing its role as more of a partner in 'nation-building' than as an agenda setter, and guardian of the social conscience as one conventionally assumes of the Western media.<br><br>Having said that, it is not uncommon to find partisan Western newspapers or media that sides with one party -pro-Bush Fox News is a well-known example. Other interesting facts: Italy's Prime Minister S. Berlusconi has US$10 billion worth of personal business stakes in most of the country's media outlets. The Thai Prime Minister, T. Shinawatra's Shin Corp has also bought over many of the country's media outlets, adding to his own telecoms empire.<br><br>It's far too easy to dismiss the ST as biased and prejudiced like many Western critics. The ST faces its own constraints and media regulations, and has found itself in hot water on many occasions e.g Business Times journalists Patrick Daniel and Kenneth James being penalised under the Official Secrets Act. These are well documented in Cherian George's <span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore: The Air Conditioned Nation</span>. Is the ST that bad? I doubt it. Leaving its domestic news section aside, its coverage of international and regional news are on par with its counterparts in the West. This was acknowledged when it won the Newspaper of the Year 2002 from the Sydney-based Pacific Area Newspaper Publisher's Association (whose membership includes more than 300 newspapers in the Pacific region, including Australia and New Zealand). This also excludes the various technical awards the paper has also won.<br><br>ItÂ’s always a good thing to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism when reading news, including domestic news. But it is unnecessary and unpleasant to run down the local sections simply because you think everything you read is untrue, nonsensical and propaganda. Let others think and judge for themselves. The ordinary Singaporean has access to 5000 periodicals and newspapers, the internet, and major cable news networks. To dismiss anyone who reads the ST as ignorant, uninformed and provincial smacks of arrogance and a decidedly condescending attitude. It's simply a sweeping generalisation that mirrors what Western critics do when looking for a convenient and easy manner to talk down to Singapore and Singaporeans without bothering to hold up substantive evidence.<br><br>I wonder where pikamaster got the news that Chee Soon Juan missed his trial session because of a congress in Taiwan from, if not the ST. Was it the New York Times or the South China Morning Post? I had a look at the ST myself before writing this, and (gasp!) I found the ST reporting the very same story too, besides indicating the chronology of events. It's hardly a big secret that Chee did get his facts wrong <strong>again </strong>(although my opinion is it was intentional) when he demanded to know where a $17 million loan that was never made to Indonesia had gone. The fact is simply there was <strong>NO</strong> loan made, and the issue publicly debated and televised during the financial crisis.<br><br>pikamaster writes<br><blockquote>For example, a Mr Ong...., who somehow came up with a stupid conservative idea that Giving Birth is national duty. Or our Ex-Education minister who did nothing that made the core essence of the education system easier for students to bear, or our current Education minister who hasn't really made any true changes to the Education system; he only made a couple of surface changes. Or our dear PM, who is still reluctant to ease rules on public political debate and crapped about "western-influenced liberals"? </blockquote>These are merely your personal grouses. They are subjective and hardly heinous crimes. From a national perspective, not having babies is a serious issue, even though it is inherently one of individual choice. Why would it be portrayed as a 'national duty'? Perhaps because the majority of Singaporeans may not want to find themselves outnumbered by foreigners one day? Perhaps because the government does not want to depend on foreign labour and foreign talent for good (thus giving a lot of people here another reason to whine and complain). Perhaps because without enough citizens, the economy simply cannot function? Perhaps because if there are not enough Singaporeans, Singapore would simply cease to exist, and become extinct? Who knows? Do you care? Some people with some sense of rationality, and bonds to their birthplace obviously do.<br><br>As for education, I can almost hear your complaints about it being too tough, too uncreative, too much rote-learning, too long hours in school, too much homework and so onÂ…..but thatÂ’s precisely why so many changes have been made. Your claims about the lack of Â‘true changesÂ’ and only Â‘surface changesÂ’ is not supported by evidence. Some have in fact complained about too frequent changes (like implementing SAT, and then making it optional, or the six year programme skipping O-levels). Are you going to complain that there are too many changes in your next post then? Or that tinkering with the education system to maintain economic competitiveness and meet industry needs is too hard on students? Or that the government is indecisive? The bottomline is change are necessary and unavoidable. While I sympathize with students who are actually the ones bearing the burden, it cannot be helped. Such is the harsh reality of life- not just in school, but in careers where constant learning will be required in the future.<br><br>Public political debates- What do you call forums like this? ItÂ’s public, and itÂ’s political. The decision to do away with permits for indoor talks which was announced recently? You are a senior member of this forum. I am sure you have observed the content, tone and maturity of many of the posts here. As I pointed out repeatedly in many previous posts, political socialization takes time and loosening of controls needs to be gradual before an educated, and well-informed populace can give constructive comments instead of turning against each other, and resorting to petty insults and taunts.<br></div>

And of course, you have the Political Donations Act, and frequent gerrymandering by the RUling party to take into consideration.</blockquote>I think you have half-baked ideas about political labels. There is nothing Â‘derogatoryÂ’ about calling members from the non-governing party Â‘the oppositionÂ’. It is used widely all over the world, including the UK, Australia and Canada. Mark Latham is frequently referred as the Opposition Leader (Labour Party) in Australia. It is a term used with respect and normality. I have absolutely no idea why you think itÂ’s disparaging and belittling to the recipient. Perhaps you need to read more foreign newspapers or something. As for Â‘shadow cabinetÂ’, the UK does not adopt Â‘shadow parliamentÂ’ democracy. The UK adopts Westminster parliamentary democracy. A shadow cabinet merely refers to the opposition party appointing one member to monitor his cabinet counterpart closely. Some countries practise this, others donÂ’t.<br><br>All countries practice the Â‘carrot and stickÂ’ approach before elections. You may have a good opinion of Mr. Chee despite his many Â“faultsÂ” as you acknowledge yourself, but many Singaporeans have simply wised up. There is no need to elaborate at length the headlines he has made.<br></div>
