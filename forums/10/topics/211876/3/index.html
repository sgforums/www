The industrial sector, which was until recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products.  Services, especially banking and other financial exports, account for the majority of economic output. Agriculture is based on small, family-owned farms. Luxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands  and as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the open European market.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mahathir simply cannot justify his statements about Malays being marginalised in Singapore.<br><br>We do not maintain university quotas limiting Malays entry into universities. We do not maintain quotas on scholarships based on racial identity.<br><br>Malays in Singapore are allowed to bear arms right from the start at BMT. I will admit that within the military force, malays are some sort marginalised in more sensitive formations and leadership positions. But this is not true for the rest of the government services.<br><br>Mahathir is just trying to stir up trouble on all fronts. At home, he picks a fight with Badawi. Within the region, he antagonises not only Singapore, but Indonesia somewhat as well. Internationally, he always criticises US and its allies.<br><br>You know how the saying goes. If 2 persons disagree and are having problems with each other, then it is hard to determine who's being diffcult. But if this same person is having problems with 5 other parties, then it becomes more obvious his troublemaking behaviour.<br><br>His friction with Singapore is, to a certain extent, understandable.
