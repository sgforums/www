            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Texcoco II:</div><div class="quote_body">Mahathir Slams Kuan Yew As Arrogant<br><br>KUALA TERENGGANU, Sept 22 (Bernama) -- Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad Friday slammed Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew for his insulting remarks about Malaysia and Indonesia's treatment of their Chinese minorities, describing him as arrogant and disrespectful of neighbouring countries.<br><br>The former premier said Lee was arrogant because he felt he was in a strong position.<br><br>"He's not bothered with his neighbours. That is why he deliberately raised something he knew to be sensitive in our country," he told reporters after launching the building fund of the Kemaman branch of the Ex-Servicemen's Association and the district Warriors Day Campaign at Awana Kijal, Beach and Spa Resort in Kijal.<br><br>Lee on Friday told a forum held in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund conference in Singapore that Malaysia and Indonesia had problems with their Chinese minorities because they were successful and hardworking and therefore they were systemically marginalised.<br><br>He was reported to have said that the attitude of Malaysia and Indonesia towards Singapore was shaped by the way they treated their own Chinese minorities.<br><br>They "want Singapore, to put it simply, to be like their Chinese -- compliant", he claimed.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said Malaysia could question Singapore's marginalisation of its Malay minority.<br><br>"We could ask about the status of the Malays in Singapore, why they are not allowed to bear arms in the military or train to handle weapons. Why is it that the Malays in Malaysia are so capable in the military field but the Malays in Singapore cannot hold high posts (in the military)?<br><br>"Why is it that the Malays in Singapore are marginalised to the extent that they have no status at all? This is done deliberately by Singapore. There is no other country that does it like them," he said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said Lee's allegation about the Chinese in Malaysia being marginalised was untrue because there are Chinese holding high posts, for example in the armed forces.<br><br>"The Chinese in Malaysia can join the military and rise to become general, major general and so on. But what is the per capita income of the Malays in comparison with the Chinese in Singapore?<br><br>"We should have an independent investigation on why the Malays are left behind in Singapore. It is not because they are lacking compared to the Malays in Malaysia but because they are pressured, marginalised and oppressed. That is the kind of government founded on the views of Lee Kuan Yew," he said.<br><br>In his speech earlier, Dr Mahathir told Lee not to feel smug about what he had said.<br><br>"You should just guard your own rice bowl. You are not that clever. In a small group, perhaps you seem clever.<br><br>"But when he goes to China, the Chinese there don't want to listen to him. The Chinese in China don't think much of him and it is a fact that he is marginalised by Chinese in the world," he said.<br></div></blockquote>This is also utter rubbish. I don't know how many leaders around the world have spoken about their admiration for LKY's leadership in the past, including one of the prime ministers of Britain. Most recently, the former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, now an economics professor at Harvard, also spoke about his admiration and respect for LKY during the IMF-World Bank Meet. I wonder who has ever spoken about Mahathir in this regard?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kecang_puteh:</div><div class="quote_body">This is complete bullshiit. How about managing a small country with no resources whatsoever and bringing the country's economy to be one of the best in the world? If LKY had been in charge of Malaysia, he would have done the job ten times better than what Mahathir did. We have nothing, but the government brought us forward. Malaysia have so much natural resources and yet they could not make good use of them. Check out Singapore's international rankings: http://www.sedb.com/edb/sg/en_uk/index/why_singapore/singapore_rankings.html<br><br>Where is Malaysia? Duh</div></blockquote>Mahathir is quite simply (though brashfully) pointing out a distinct fact: that Malaysia is a few 100 times the size of our little island. Respect UMNO for what they have done so far. Not only has their long term alliance with the MCA reaped dividends, it has held firm the unofficial truce between malaysian malays and malaysian chinese.<br><br>With a country as small as us, LKY merely 'talked the talk' and allowed visionaries such as Goh Keng Swee and Hon Sui Sen to 'walk the walk'. It is far easier to control the borders in a small island nation, as compared to the porous borders of our malaysian neighbours.<br><br>Would LKY have performed a better job?<br><br>We will never know, seeing as how Malaysians as a whole, rejected his meritocracy campaign during the brief merger with Malaya.<br><br>Now, having managed to bring us from 3rd world to developed (not yet first world), no doubt he deserves the plaundits for his achievements. But along with his status comes his increasingly common streak of arrogance.<br><br>Like George Bush, he enjoys 'meddling' into the affairs of neighbours just because he met success in his field. Passing uncharacteristic comments such as those he made last week are mistakes he would not have made 20 years ago.<br><br>Are you so sure he would have done <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">'the job ten times better than what Mahathir did'</span></span>? LKY's first action, had he led the then Federation of Malaya, would have been to permanently abolish the bumiputra policy that favours malays, and instill his famed 'Malaysian Malaysia' campaign, something the malays would have refused to accept.<br><br>How many demonstrations and racial riots would he have to supress during his supposed reign? With his hardline, no-nonsense approach, one can be forgiven if LKY will likely run Malaysia the way Deng Xiao Ping ran China back in the days of the communist politburo.</div>

I have malay friends who are getting influenced by the papers that they are being marginalised here in Singapore. That small comment has the ability to put Singapore into the state it was in 40 years ago, a time when communalism existed. Truthfully, it's sad to see a great leader giving such a comment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not wrong, in 1965, when Singapore leaves Malaysia at 9th of August, Malaysia will have thought that Singapore, with no natural resources cannot survive and will return back to Malaysia to rely on this "hinterland". However, it is PM Lee and many other great pioneer leaders such as Dr. Goh Keng Swee that transfrorm Singapore from a fishing village to a cosmopolitian city with well equipped infrastructure.</div>

May be the highest in peninsula Malaysia. Not sure about Sabah and Sarawak. Do you think the government will want to develop the state any more that it is. It's deputy chief minister (who's malay obviously) is far more powerful that the chinese chief minister. What does that say?</div>
