              <p>preference to work for the elderly should be something that they choose to do; not brainwashed or shove down their throat by the government. if some prefers to wind down and prefer to pursue personal interests, they should be allowed to do so.</p>
              <p>the government's recent mindless rant about how continuing working is the only option to stay alert and productive is crap. there are so many other ways the elderly can contribute to singapore.</p>
              <p>however, if a 65 year old choose to tend to his gardening day in and day out, i think it is his right. he earns it after slogging for a large part of his life.  </p>
              <p>however, the reality in singapore is a large proportion of the baby boomers today and in the near future are ill-prepared for old age and living well. the intent of cpf is now a near farce; everything about it got suck back to you-know-who.</p>
              <p>if the government is broke, then i think it is a different discussion altogether. but this chaps here are flushed with cash, so much so that they can `throw' money overseas and yet keep their distance to fulfill their commitment to the elderly citizens who have contributed a HUGE part to singapore's success today is almost criminal.</p>

              <p>Poor old thing, do you know that our old singaporeans are being laugh and joked by foreign young workers and talents.  One of my PRC gal asked me, why your country so old already still working,,,so funny. Then at a hawker stall, i saw a bangala shouting at a old man collecting plates to work faster. OMG! we are a laughing stock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ironic here is most people are HDB or condo dwellers, surrounded by cements and contretes, when they retired,  there isn't much things to do, except sitting at the void deck, by the pool or by the park waiting for their funneral.  Unlike other countries, whereby you can have a large kampong house, a piece of land you can cultivate plants,  garden, vege, rearing animals and enjoy a free and peaceful old age with good natural air, old kampong buddies and atmosphere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore our oldies tend to carry on working as there is no other way out. And that is where the govt can psycho our old peoples or going to be old people to work longer, if everyone one of us hv a kampong to go to, land to take care, I think at 55 yo, most already retired.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Retirement means death'</span></p>
              <p>Clarissa Oon - The Straits Times,  Mon, Jan 14, 2008</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">THE three words 'retirement means death' reverberated around the Suntec Convention Centre theatre yesterday as Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew addressed the problem of an ageing society at a dialogue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">'We've got to educate those about to retire: Don't retire, work. Retirement means death,' said MM Lee with a laugh.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">And he meant every word of what he said to participants at the Silver Industry Conference and Exhibition (Sicex).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB">'I would not be able to speak to you in this way if I had not led a very active life, connected with many people throughout the world and tried to interpret it to make sense for Singapore,' said the elder statesman, who turns 85 this year. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Like many developed and fast developing countries around the world, Singapore has an ageing population due to longer lifespans and declining birth rates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">'Maybe if we had not started family planning, it would not have been so bad. But then we would not have (economic) growth,' quipped Mr Lee to much laughter from conference participants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Earlier in the 70-minute dialogue, which revealed a light-hearted and more personal side of the MM, he said that Singaporeans who believed they could stop work at 55 to drink wine and play golf were 'done for'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">'If the mindset is that 'I'll reach retirement age at 62, I'm old, I can't work anymore, now is the time I enjoy life,' I think you're making the biggest mistake of your life.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Research has shown that those who retire and lead sedentary lives 'die off very quickly', said the man who started jogging regularly in his 50s and now also keeps fit by swimming and cycling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">'With nothing to do, no purpose in life, you'll just degrade, go to seed. The human being needs a challenge.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">He maintains a packed schedule of international travel, including official trips every year to regional powerhouses China and India.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">MM Lee was sharing his experiences of active ageing with Sicex participants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">The four-day conference, which ends tomorrow, explores ways to grow the seniors' market in Singapore and the region.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Asked by Dr Kanwaljit Soin, who runs a non-profit organisation for older women to age successfully, if Singapore could do away with its retirement age of 62, Mr Lee said he personally did not believe in such a concept.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">However, he said it was very difficult to deviate from international practice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He suggested that a senior citizen 'go on working for as long as he can, but changing the nature or the intensity of the work as he ages'.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Lee also defended Singapore's Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme and argued against pensions for the elderly, which have to be supported by tax revenues.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">The CPF scheme, he said, helps Singapore to remain competitive, saying it aims for 'minimum tax rates and maximum self-sufficiency'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">'This way you are not passing the burden (of caring for the elderly) to the next generation,' he added.</span></span></p>
              <p>(ha ha, more like won't pass burden to PAP so they can continue to draw obscene world class super high pay.   That is why they make buying of annuity compulsory.)</p>
