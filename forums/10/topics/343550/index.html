              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore will need to develop new arrangements to help the elderly work as long as they can. 
              <br> <br> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said one such feature in place is
              getting companies to rehire workers aged 62 years for another three
              years till 65. But that could mean taking up a different job at a lower
              pay.
              <br> <br> Housekeeping is not the most sought-after job, but someone has to do it.
              <br> <br>66-year-old Lee Lai Eng has been working as a housekeeper for over
              20 years. The grandmother of four chose to continue working six days a
              week, eight hours each day, even after retirement. <br> <br> Even though she gets the same pay as her younger colleagues, the former
              nurse feels empowered by her added responsibilities as a housekeeping
              trainer. She is also glad that being employed means her medical needs
              are taken care of by the company.
              <br> <br>Madam Lee said: "My children have asked me to stop work, but it is
              hard." She said she prefers to be independent financially. "I prefer to
              be free."
              <br> <br> "Pay is important, but I feel that I don't need so much money since I'm so old," said Madam Lee. 
              <br> <br> That is something Prime Minister Lee will be glad to hear.
              <br> <br> Speaking at Singapore's first Retirement Conference on Thursday, he said social attitudes must change.
              <br> <br>"The job of hotel attendant may be a humble one, but it is an
              honourable employment. We should not discourage anyone from taking on
              such jobs. To do so would limit his options to be active, engaged and
              to earn an income," Mr Lee said.
              <br> <br>"They need to be ready to adjust to different responsibilities, and
              possibly lighter work and less pay and understandably, these
              adjustments are harder to accept," he added.
              <br> <br>Besides attitudes, Mr Lee said wage structures - where workers get
              paid according to the number of years on the job - must also change
              with the times, so that companies will hire more older workers instead
              of younger and cheaper ones.
              <br> <br>The labour movement is working with companies to make older
              workers' wage structure more competitive so that it is easier for them
              to stay employed.
              <br> <br>NTUC deputy secretary-general, Heng Chee How, said: "For the older
              workers, you are looking at aspects of health, you're looking at
              aspects of skills, you're looking at aspects of job performance.
              <br> <br>"And all these are specific areas that must be further enhanced
              because as the population ages, you'll have more and more older
              workers. They'll have to work longer and they'd want to work longer."
              <br> <br> The unions are also working with companies to help older workers find and keep jobs during this downturn.
              <br> <br>Union leaders say they are working with companies to encourage them
              to send not just the younger workers for retraining but the older ones
              as well, as part of the government's S$600m skills upgrading scheme.

              <p>Has it ever occur to this godly elite that when u get older, u do not have the strength and ability to handle more menial chores + a pitiful salary.  I cannot imagine letting my mom lift those heavy mattress up and then having to change so many beds everyday and walking around doing the tough job. It's not that we think the job makes us lose our faces or what but it hurts to see our old parents still working such a hard up job. The elderly folks are getting  weaker as they progress and they shouldnt be doing all these menial chores, can their body take it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one is like his papa who has a luxurious life of sitting in a 18 degree aircon room and earning millions a year, why not let his papa do it? why not practice what he preach b4 opening his stinky mouth?</p>

              <p><br>that's why gah-men now kept emphasizing on ageing population..implementation of plans to take care of this problem by delaying retirement age..increasing the min. amt to be saved in CPF a/c, encouraging the elderies to work in order to support themselves etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and, their on-going campaign to encourage S'poreans to give birth to more babies with the Baby bonus bait, childcare leave etc..so that when these batch of babies grow up, the burden of taking care of the elderies will fall on them...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and, so that the gah-men will be rid of ageing population problem =D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bt seriously..not all employers will want to hire the elderies..like what u said..only Govt-Linked companies or subsidiaries..but what kind of jobs can they offer? Pantry jobs are better..the rest will be like cleaner..imagine how tough it is for an eldery to bend down his backbone to scrub the floor, slippery floor &amp; elderies have the tendancy to fall down easily..</p>

              <p>The guy at the counter there tells him that there is about $5000/- in his CPF.</p>

              <p>So while someone in the back room was preparing the cheque, the counter guy keep trying to tell my ah sir, not to take out the money lah, keep some in the cpf account lah, buy this insurance, buy that plan lah.</p>
              <p>Ah sir got fed up after a while and say, in his normal nice voice to the counter guy:</p>
              <p>"I dont need all these stuffs lah, see that (point to wife.)  I not taking the money out to feed china women,  my wife is here."</p>
              <p>To which, the wife snorted and speak up: "$5k nia, china women also wont be interested lah."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, when he relate how the counter guy shut up about trying to sell whatever scheme to my ah sir, we laughed.  Then I jokingly tell my ah sir</p>
              <p>"Sir, not enough to feed china women, but enough to feed me lah.  You give me that 5k feed me lor; I can even return interest."</p>
