              <p>Sinkaporeans normally welcome all kinds of people, as Sinkaporeans likes to travel so they have a very broad knowledge of different cultures. The problem now is that our country is overcrowded at this point, everyone is jostling for space, plus the unstable future facing locals because of over importing of foreign labour which ranged from the low skilled all the way to even executives and manager positions, so they are feeling the heat at the moment.</p>
              <p>Generally if you have the right skills and you prove yourself to be a hardworking guy who will respect our culture, I don't see why you will not be welcome here. Locals are not blind, the problems with some of the so called foreign talents is that they can't really perform their jobs adequately and some even have a more atrocious command of English than me, and they are sometimes paid more than locals.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I believe that everything has a limitation, a threshold point before the bubble burst, today, the economy is brewing well, and that almost everyone is employed, be it top or low jobs, with paid, most will spend and therefore consumer index will be good, and that help to further strengthen the economy. However, as said, once a the threshold is met, everything will tumbles down, the rich leaves, the poor go jobless, the business become poor. In most of our recession, we had managed to get of it on our own, meaning Singaporeans tightened their belts, bite the bullet, take the cut and get over the tide of recession, we had seen the last one in 2009 where we had a difficult times and the lost was tremedous, the most worst of the decade recession. But not to worry, we will be getting a far more worst one coming soon, cos recession aren't going to be like those years where singaporeans are willing to give and take, the next recession will affect the FT, FW or so call 40% of Foreign workforce, how they react will be totally different from singaporeans. I bet most will go home and leave an empty shell here for singaporeans to pick up.</p></div>

               Democracy has been betrayed by Capitalism. Democracy nutured and protected Capitalism from Communism but Capitalism has grown too big for any country to handle.</p>

              rich people. We will be exploited even more by them and I think

              revolution to overthrow the rich and the powerful, to upset the balance 
              of power once more, this will happen when the boiling point has been 
              reached, but I don't think I'll be around. It is currently not obvious 
              yet.</p>
              <p>One of the most glaring problem is that everyone talks about 
              democracy like it's free and everyone can use it, well, it's not. 
              Sometimes sacrifice have to be made.</p>
              <p>I applaud Google co-founder 
              Sergey Brin to show his disapproval of China censorship of the internet,
               but I'm not sure how long can Google withstand those kind of pressure. 
              Will Google eject their co-founder when their earnings start to drop big
               time? Already the Baidu chairman is gloating about how his company has 
              profitted from Google China exit. A very rich China guy openly 
              throttling Democracy, tramping on the civil rights of his own country 
              men for the sake of profits. I see more dark times ahead for people 
              anywhere around the world and when more rich businesses starts to run 
              China and when that China extend its diplomatic pressure around the 
              world, woe be unto all nations.</p>
              <p>These are big times for big leaders, leaders who will have to 
              walk an even tighter road than what History has been written so far to 
              balance the integrity of a Nation, the survival of a Nation without 
              losing her soul to the money men.</p>
              <p>We, as citizens, despite all 
              odds, still have to remind those people to remember their duty to 
              safeguard the nation at all times, and with a sense of self-sacrifice to
               the nation.</p>
              <p>So far from what leaders we have, I can only give them a big "F". They are only money faced little people.</p>
              <p>And, yeah, regarding the Mexican flag thing, the 
              First Amendment has been rightly abused by aliens, no respect at all for
               the country that hosted them. I, myself, don't really go out much, too 
              much aliens around in my country, but I like China girls, they are cute.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>well, frankly speaking, my china gals also prefer singapore men, they are more clean, well behave, timid, easily con and got money to spare.</p>
              <p>not to worry about capitalism and the exploitation of poor, history shall repeat itself, it just take another mao or stalin to overturn the table again, in the earlier 1900++ china also have big rich business people in peking, nanjin, shanghai etc , and those rural area are full of poor peoples, that gives mao the chance to recruit all these poors to stage a revolution by promising a fair share of wealth. Now, back to the same again, so those who fought and died in the earlier revolution must be cursing and crying if they see what happen today, same same, just different leaders and type of rich and poor. It just take one man to stand out to lead the revolutionary flag of justice, fair and impartial rules, maybe you can be one of them.</p>

              <p>FYI: no matter how terribly dsiappointing democracy has been, it has never been worse than communism. look at history. this fact alone has proved itself in countless times. it is in human nature that fair distribution can ever be achieved, for it is in the fact that some get paid higher than others that society manages to function successfully. greed will always stand in the way of communism, so while many suffer cos of democracy, many others enjoy the benefits of it while in communism, EVERYONE SUFFERS while the hypocrites at the top laugh and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>in communism, fair equality is supposed to work, but what happened? look at stalin, look at vietnam, look at cuba. what happened? the top enjoy life, the rest suffer.</p>
              <p>democracy may be lousy, yes, but that's the way of life. communism can never succeed because basic human instinct forbids it.</p>

              <p>I just think all systems will fail in the end but, humans will not stop trying to realign the balance of powers when either side becomes overwhelming. The realigning of powers is happening and is still happening, through seen and unseen changes happening in our world, many different areas, ex. businesses, workforce changes, natural disasters, the different changing fortunes of countries, all these will <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;"><span id="topstuff" style="visibility: visible;">accumulate to the formation of humans reaction to many different factors, some factors require immediate attentions, some factors are not even known at that particular time. </span></span></p>
              <p>The human factor is the one that always sets the ball rolling and is also always the one that destroys it. Democracy has served us well, but if you look at how China has sucessfully sidestepped the West democratic overtures, I would just say that certain principals of democracy is just not working. China has read the West move very well.</p>
              <p>We, at current time, cannot envisage, another form of system that will be used in the future, but Time has always been full of surprises. I'm not advocating that communism is a good system but those welding communism have adapted far better to the current situation than democracy, so these will be interesting times.</p>

              <p>Communism is actually a very good and better system than democracy, the hindsight is that the creator fail to understand that human with all their greed and carving, cannot take up such system. It shows that the fall of communism is human faults. The creator had created communism merely out of a idealogy/theory, in practice, it failed.</p>

              <p><br>   It seems to me that communism is good for backward countries as it forces everybody to become educated but once the population is educated then maybe it is time to move on. If the west hadn't aided the taliban during the Russian invasion then islam would have been wiped out and the population would be too educated to go back to what it is now. Most Afghaistanis don't even know why the Americans are there . These bearded fanatics are pretty clueless. Plus their sexual attraction to young boys is a disturbing fact that they want keep quiet as nobody wants to help people like them and they know it</p>

              <p><br>it is not the communism belongs to backward countries, not just becos you see those commie country become poor, it represent communism is no good, in fact, at University, people study more on communism than demorcracy, they wanted to know how come communism dun work, and the findings were, as i said before, human cannot take such a stringent/strict system, human are an indiscipline lots who like to flirt, free, win, have pride, egos, rich, money...sex...be served and so on.</p>
              <p>Even when you talk about religion, no one on this earth can live up and said I follow my religion truthfully, but that does not mean that the religion is bad, just that human cannot take the strict rules of it. You can see priest having sex with minor, you can see muslim drinking, you can see monks raping young gals, you can see indian stealing and fighting each other,...and so on.</p>
              <p>People must understand that a system is a system, but if people cannot follow or live up to it, it is not the written system fault, is it human fault, they choose to want a more easy going, can con and cheat world, so they take democracy.</p>
