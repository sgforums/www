              <p> </p>
              <p>And poor local boys, after graduation, still need to go 2 yrs of ns. By the time they rod, already 24 yr old.</p>

              <p><br>Not really, it is still very much a man working world out there, men still top the high management position, we gals still have to get marry, go for maternity leaves and care for children. Ns should not be an accuse for falling behind in term of position and earning power, it should be taken as a chance to be leader, protect the country and learn to be a true red and white gentleman of Singapore.</p>
              <p>As far as I noticed since moving in from taiwan, the typical downturn of Sg men is that when they fail on something, they tend to blame on this and that, and especially the govt will get the most blame, but they fail to blame themselves for the failure. Such blaming culture should be omitted from Sg men mentality. In taiwan, one man action is one man responsible, blaming the society and govt are only accuses</p>

              <p>Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- After luring investor <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Jim+Rogers&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Jim Rogers</a>,
              actor <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Jet+Li&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Jet Li</a>, Filipino maids and Bangladeshi construction
              workers with one of Asia’s most open immigration policies,
              Singapore is becoming a little less welcoming to foreigners.</p>
              <p>Singapore almost doubled the rate it grants citizenship and
              permanent residence in the past five years to counter a falling
              birth rate, and let firms bring in thousands to work at hotels,
              shipyards and restaurants. The move saw foreigners make up one
              in every three people. The government plans to slow the inflow
              to avoid being “overwhelmed,” and unveiled higher levies for
              overseas laborers, cooks and janitors in its Feb. 22 budget.</p>
              <p>The effort is part of a shift in economic policies designed
              to ease discontent in the aftermath of the deepest recession
              since independence in 1965 and to shore up public support before
              elections that must be held by February 2012. The danger is that
              the changes may make Singapore more expensive for companies to
              operate in and less attractive to investors.</p>
              <p>“The economy generates more jobs than can be filled by
              locals and it wasn’t that long ago the government was arguing
              vehemently that we need foreign talent to ensure strong and
              sustainable growth,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Song+Seng-Wun&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Song Seng-Wun</a>, an economist at CIMB-
              GK Securities Pte in Singapore. “They’re trying to soothe
              Singaporeans’ anxiety that the whole island is swamped with
              foreigners. It’s politics.”</p>
              <p>Election Timing</p>
              <p>The government’s shift, which includes higher school and
              medical fees for non-citizens, has spurred speculation that an
              election may be called as early as this year. Prime Minister <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lee%0AHsien+Loong&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee
              Hsien Loong</a> on Feb. 17 directed the Elections Department to
              update electoral rolls with eligible voters and for the process
              to be completed by March 31. A day later, a government gazette
              published the boundaries of new and existing polling districts.</p>
              <p>Lee’s People’s Action Party was co-founded in 1954 by his
              father, former Prime Minister <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lee+Kuan+Yew&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, and it has been in
              power since 1959. Its politicians currently hold 82 of 84
              elected seats in parliament. Prime Minister Lee in a speech on
              Jan. 25 noted a speculation “fever” of early elections, while
              adding that it’s not imminent.</p>
              <p>Support for long-serving governments in Asia has diminished
              in recent years. At the last Singapore election in 2006, Lee’s
              party won about 67 percent of ballots, 8 percentage points lower
              than the previous vote. In neighboring Malaysia, voters reduced
              the ruling coalition’s majority to a record low in 2008. Japan
              in August saw the ouster of the Liberal Democratic Party, which
              ruled the nation for almost all the postwar period.</p>
              <p>Hit to Economy</p>
              <p>Singapore’s economy contracted 2 percent last year as the
              global slump reduced demand for goods, hurting the island’s
              exports. The trade ministry last week said it expects an
              expansion as much as 6.5 percent in 2010.</p>
              <p>Policy makers in Singapore say productivity is a
              cornerstone of their economic blueprint for the next decade,
              aiming to reduce the island’s dependence on exports. The
              government has blamed some industries’ use of cheaper, low-
              skilled foreign labor as a reason for low productivity in the
              past 10 years.</p>
              <p>“We’re not against foreign workers,” <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lim+Swee+Say&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lim Swee Say</a>, a
              government minister and secretary-general of the National Trades
              Union Congress, said at a Feb. 1 media briefing. “But just like
              drinking wine, wine is good but too much wine is bad. Foreign
              workers are good but too many foreign workers growing at too
              fast a rate is no good for the economy because it dilutes our
              focus on productivity.”</p>
              <p>Birth Rate</p>
              <p>Immigration had been a key component of Singapore’s
              population and economic strategy, given the failure of other
              incentives offered since 1987 to arrest a birth-rate decline --
              such as tax breaks, subsidies and cash bonuses. Singapore, which
              has one-quarter the land area of Rhode Island, has no natural
              resources and the government relies on the skills of its
              populace to drive growth.</p>
              <p>The government insists it’s still welcoming foreign talent,
              suggesting it will aim to reduce the inflow of lower-skilled
              workers rather than bankers, scientists and athletes. The
              laborers who build office towers and ships and serve at the
              city’s restaurants and hotels are mostly not allowed to apply to
              be permanent residents or citizens.</p>
              <p>The influx of foreigners, both skilled and unskilled, has
              boosted sales for property developers such as   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=CAPL:SP">CapitaLand Ltd.</a>,
              transportation providers including   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MRT:SP">SMRT Corp.</a> and telephone
              companies such as   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=ST:SP">Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. </a>It’s also
              helped consumption, given the birth rate has been below the
              level needed to replace the population since the 1970s.</p>
              <p>Citizenship, Residence</p>
              <p>About 20,513 people became Singapore citizens in 2008, and
              another 79,167 were given permanent residence. The tally is
              three times more than the 32,423 babies born to citizens that
              year. <strong>Of the 4.99 million population, about 1.8 million are non-
              citizens. </strong></p>
              <p>Disgruntled Singaporeans say the immigration policy means
              more competition with newcomers for jobs, public housing and
              places in choice in schools for their children. In the past few
              months, the government has lowered <a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/">healthcare subsidies</a> for
              permanent residents, increased public school fees for non-
              citizens, and tweaked a balloting system to give Singaporean
              children twice the chance of getting into the educational
              institution of their choice.</p>
              <p>To address the flood of workers brought in by companies
              such as   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SMM:SP">SembCorp Marine Ltd.</a>, the world’s second-biggest oil-rig
              maker, and casino operator   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GENS:SP">Genting Singapore Plc</a>, the government
              now plans to increase levies on foreign labor.</p>
              <p>Levies on Workers</p>
              <p>Singapore will raise the monthly charge for foreign workers
              in manufacturing and services industries by an average S$100
              ($71) over the next three years, while construction companies
              will see a larger increase because there is more room for
              productivity improvements, Finance Minister <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Tharman%0AShanmugaratnam&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Tharman
              Shanmugaratnam</a> said Feb. 22. The first increase from July will
              see a rise of as much as S$30 a month per worker, he said.</p>
              <p>An employer currently pays the government between S$50 and
              S$470 monthly per foreign worker. Professionals and executives
              who earn more than S$2,500 fall under a separate category that
              doesn’t require a levy.</p>
              <p>The government’s latest move may cost SembCorp Marine,
              which estimates it has as many as 20,000 foreign workers and
              sub-contractors, an additional S$600,000 a month, said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ong+Poh%0AKwee&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Ong Poh
              Kwee</a>, the company’s deputy president.</p>
              <p>“It will add on to the cost of operations,” Ong said.
              “This is the catalyst to driving productivity and adds to the
              urgency” of becoming more efficient.</p>
              <p>The levy increase will slow economic growth and raise
              business costs, said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Alvin+Liew&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Alvin Liew</a>, an economist at Standard
              Chartered Bank in Singapore.</p>
              <p>‘Hollowing-Out’</p>
              <p>“The new policy on foreign workers may place a
              disproportionate burden on certain sectors, posing risks to
              their profitability in the next few years,” Liew said. “The
              most obvious victim is the construction sector, followed by low-
              end manufacturing and labor-intensive services   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=FSSTI:IND">industries </a>like
              hotels and restaurants.”</p>
              <p>Higher costs may also accelerate the “hollowing-out” of
              some manufacturing industries, which may move to cheaper
              locations in the region, he said. For consumers, Singapore will
              likely become a more expensive place for hotel stays and
              restaurant meals, he said.</p>
              <p>Singapore cannot slow down the intake of foreigners too
              much because it will hurt growth even as locals complain of
              competition in schools or congestion in trains, buses and public
              areas, <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lee+Kuan+Yew&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, now known as Minister Mentor, said at a
              community event Feb. 18.</p>
              <p>In an interview with National Geographic last year, he
              called the country’s recent migrants “hungry” and “determined
              to succeed” compared with locals who are “less hard driving
              and hard-striving.”</p>
              <p>“We tell them, look, they have to work harder or they’ll
              become stupid,” the elder Lee said of Singaporeans. “It’s just
