              <p>As far as I noticed since moving in from taiwan, the typical downturn of Sg men is that when they fail on something, they tend to blame on this and that, and especially the govt will get the most blame, but they fail to blame themselves for the failure. Such blaming culture should be omitted from Sg men mentality. In taiwan, one man action is one man responsible, blaming the society and govt are only accuses</p>

              <p>Is not Sg men mentality, it is all men mentality to blame. Women blame too you know. You of course will support PAP because of their immigration policies. If you imagine all the PRC and India people go to Taiwan and steal you jobs and lower the salary rate, how will you feel?</p>
              <p>Sometimes I wonder, protect the country from what? Straits Malacca Pirates? Nobody wants to invade Sg. We have no resources but except for chio bu here who are in same par with Ipoh chio bu.</p>

              construction workers with one of Asia’s most open immigration
              policies, Singapore is becoming a little less welcoming to
              foreigners.</p>
              <p>Singapore almost doubled the rate it grants citizenship and
              permanent residence in the past five years to counter a falling
              birth rate, and let firms bring in thousands to work at hotels,
              shipyards and restaurants. The move saw foreigners make up one in
              every three people. The government plans to slow the inflow to
              avoid being “overwhelmed,” and unveiled higher levies for overseas
              laborers, cooks and janitors in its Feb. 22 budget.</p>
              <p>The effort is part of a shift in economic policies designed to
              ease discontent in the aftermath of the deepest recession since
              independence in 1965 and to shore up public support before
              elections that must be held by February 2012. The danger is that
              the changes may make Singapore more expensive for companies to
              operate in and less attractive to investors.</p>
              <p>“The economy generates more jobs than can be filled by locals
              and it wasn’t that long ago the government was arguing vehemently
              that we need foreign talent to ensure strong and sustainable
              growth,” said <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Song+Seng-Wun&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Song Seng-Wun</a>, an economist at CIMB- GK
              Securities Pte in Singapore. “They’re trying to soothe
              Singaporeans’ anxiety that the whole island is swamped with
              foreigners. It’s politics.”</p>
              <p>Election Timing</p>
              <p>The government’s shift, which includes higher school and medical
              fees for non-citizens, has spurred speculation that an election may
              be called as early as this year. Prime Minister <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lee%0AHsien+Loong&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee Hsien Loong</a> on Feb. 17 directed the
              Elections Department to update electoral rolls with eligible voters
              and for the process to be completed by March 31. A day later, a
              government gazette published the boundaries of new and existing
              polling districts.</p>
              <p>Lee’s People’s Action Party was co-founded in 1954 by his
              father, former Prime Minister <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lee+Kuan+Yew&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, and it has been in power since
              1959. Its politicians currently hold 82 of 84 elected seats in
              parliament. Prime Minister Lee in a speech on Jan. 25 noted a
              speculation “fever” of early elections, while adding that it’s not
              imminent.</p>
              <p>Support for long-serving governments in Asia has diminished in
              recent years. At the last Singapore election in 2006, Lee’s party
              won about 67 percent of ballots, 8 percentage points lower than the
              previous vote. In neighboring Malaysia, voters reduced the ruling
              coalition’s majority to a record low in 2008. Japan in August saw
              the ouster of the Liberal Democratic Party, which ruled the nation
              for almost all the postwar period.</p>
              <p>Hit to Economy</p>
              <p>Singapore’s economy contracted 2 percent last year as the global
              slump reduced demand for goods, hurting the island’s exports. The
              trade ministry last week said it expects an expansion as much as
              6.5 percent in 2010.</p>
              <p>Policy makers in Singapore say productivity is a cornerstone of
              their economic blueprint for the next decade, aiming to reduce the
              island’s dependence on exports. The government has blamed some
              industries’ use of cheaper, low- skilled foreign labor as a reason
              for low productivity in the past 10 years.</p>
              <p>“We’re not against foreign workers,” <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lim+Swee+Say&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lim Swee Say</a>, a government minister and
              secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, said at a
              Feb. 1 media briefing. “But just like drinking wine, wine is good
              but too much wine is bad. Foreign workers are good but too many
              foreign workers growing at too fast a rate is no good for the
              economy because it dilutes our focus on productivity.”</p>
              <p>Birth Rate</p>
              <p>Immigration had been a key component of Singapore’s population
              and economic strategy, given the failure of other incentives
              offered since 1987 to arrest a birth-rate decline -- such as tax
              breaks, subsidies and cash bonuses. Singapore, which has
              one-quarter the land area of Rhode Island, has no natural resources
              and the government relies on the skills of its populace to drive
              growth.</p>
              <p>The government insists it’s still welcoming foreign talent,
              suggesting it will aim to reduce the inflow of lower-skilled
              workers rather than bankers, scientists and athletes. The laborers
              who build office towers and ships and serve at the city’s
              restaurants and hotels are mostly not allowed to apply to be
              permanent residents or citizens.</p>
              <p>The influx of foreigners, both skilled and unskilled, has
              boosted sales for property developers such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=CAPL:SP">CapitaLand Ltd.</a>, transportation providers including
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MRT:SP">SMRT Corp.</a> and telephone companies such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=ST:SP">Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.</a> It’s also helped
              consumption, given the birth rate has been below the level needed
              to replace the population since the 1970s.</p>
              <p>Citizenship, Residence</p>
              <p>About 20,513 people became Singapore citizens in 2008, and
              another 79,167 were given permanent residence. The tally is three
              times more than the 32,423 babies born to citizens that year.
              <strong>Of the 4.99 million population, about 1.8 million are non-
              citizens.</strong></p>
              <p>Disgruntled Singaporeans say the immigration policy means more
              competition with newcomers for jobs, public housing and places in
              choice in schools for their children. In the past few months, the
              government has lowered <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/">healthcare subsidies</a> for permanent residents,
              increased public school fees for non- citizens, and tweaked a
              balloting system to give Singaporean children twice the chance of
              getting into the educational institution of their choice.</p>
              <p>To address the flood of workers brought in by companies such as
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SMM:SP">SembCorp Marine Ltd.</a>, the world’s second-biggest
              oil-rig maker, and casino operator <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GENS:SP">Genting Singapore Plc</a>, the government now plans to
              increase levies on foreign labor.</p>
              <p>Levies on Workers</p>
              <p>Singapore will raise the monthly charge for foreign workers in
              manufacturing and services industries by an average S$100 ($71)
              over the next three years, while construction companies will see a
              larger increase because there is more room for productivity
              improvements, Finance Minister <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Tharman%0AShanmugaratnam&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Tharman Shanmugaratnam</a> said Feb. 22. The first
              increase from July will see a rise of as much as S$30 a month per
              worker, he said.</p>
              <p>An employer currently pays the government between S$50 and S$470
              monthly per foreign worker. Professionals and executives who earn
              more than S$2,500 fall under a separate category that doesn’t
              require a levy.</p>
              <p>The government’s latest move may cost SembCorp Marine, which
              estimates it has as many as 20,000 foreign workers and
              sub-contractors, an additional S$600,000 a month, said <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ong+Poh%0AKwee&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Ong Poh Kwee</a>, the company’s deputy
              president.</p>
              <p>“It will add on to the cost of operations,” Ong said. “This is
              the catalyst to driving productivity and adds to the urgency” of
              becoming more efficient.</p>
              <p>The levy increase will slow economic growth and raise business
              costs, said <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Alvin+Liew&amp;amp;site=wnews&amp;amp;client=wnews&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;filter=p&amp;amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Alvin Liew</a>, an economist at Standard Chartered
              Bank in Singapore.</p>
              <p>‘Hollowing-Out’</p>
              <p>“The new policy on foreign workers may place a disproportionate
              burden on certain sectors, posing risks to their profitability in
              the next few years,” Liew said. “The most obvious victim is the
              construction sector, followed by low- end manufacturing and
              labor-intensive services <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=FSSTI:IND">industries</a> like hotels and restaurants.”</p>
              <p>Higher costs may also accelerate the “hollowing-out” of some
              manufacturing industries, which may move to cheaper locations in
              the region, he said. For consumers, Singapore will likely become a
              more expensive place for hotel stays and restaurant meals, he
              said.</p>
              <p>Singapore cannot slow down the intake of foreigners too much
              because it will hurt growth even as locals complain of competition
              in schools or congestion in trains, buses and public areas,

              at a community event Feb. 18.</p>
              <p>In an interview with National Geographic last year, he called
              the country’s recent migrants “hungry” and “determined to succeed”
              compared with locals who are “less hard driving and
              hard-striving.”</p>
              <p>“We tell them, look, they have to work harder or they’ll become
              stupid,” the elder Lee said of Singaporeans. “It’s just they don’t
              see the point of it. Why race when you can canter and save your
              energy and do other things? A regular inflow of migrants without
              too huge a deluge will keep” a society “on its toes,” he said.</p>

              <p><br>Yo dude, actually the service is only one year, the other one year is mend of the waiting, sitting and standby time, which the SAF, i believe is very good at delaying and waiting. So, the actually training is only 1 year, you need to give them the allowance for those waiting and getting ready time. And bear in mind, i believe the army takes one year to prepare for the NDP</p>

              <p>The foreigners who whoreship the MIW and joined the MIW will be running the show in Sinkapore in another 10 years time as more of our citizens retire, so citizens prepare to emigrate or starve, this is what Sinkapore will be, overrun and taken control of by foreigners without a shot being fired. Likewise foreigners will be in higher positions as they have more work experience by then and also have the power to hire more of their own kind.</p>

              <p>I believe that when ppl talked about the 60/40 ratio, the 40 refers to those neutralised foreigners, ie the pr and newly minted citizens. </p>
              <p>It should not include the transient foreign workers ie s pass holder, work permit and those professional foreigners who have no intenttion of settling.</p>
              <p>I believe forumites are talking about the sum of total singaporeans vs the sum of total foreign borns. If that is the case, than the transient workers have to be included.</p>
              <p>So the ratios of 30/70 or 40/60, as experienced by forumites out in the street, depending where they are, are also realistic pictures.  </p>

              <p>The problem is not we have FTs per say, but fundamentally with the kind of FTs we are attracting, which is not the highly-skilled person that sees Singapore as a place to add value to and sink roots in, but as a stepping stone to places elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Basically a place to exploit.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day do they actually add value? It's a stopgap measure by the PAP to boost the workforce due to falling birthrates but at the end of the day it's not a long-term solution. Worse, attracting mercenaries instead of true team players ultimately finds you screwed even more at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>Our nation needs FTs, but we need the RIGHT kind. I am not really sure what's up with a large proportion of the lot we're attracting nowadays. MM Lee say FTs keep us on our toes right? Maybe the PAP also need some lost votes to keep them on their toes...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>it is quite sad how our government approaches foriegn talent, and yess, i guess it is getting worse in singapore, but apparently, globalisation hasnt spared the rest of the world either, i mena, look at cambridge, harvard, yale, and all the ivy league universities in USA and britain. more than 60% of them are dominated by foriegners. look at the big shots in sillicon valley like apple, even NASA, where already, half of the researchers are indians or asians, no exception. 60% of the time, an american loses in his bid to enter the universityt, the same goes for cambridge and stamford. look at MIT in particular. it is sad, that foriegn taleant sometimes does more harm than good, and our governments arent doing enough to curb this to a reasonable level.</p></div>

              <p>There is a different between globlisation and attracting foreign talent. Other countries go globlisation, they recruited the best talents but do not attract them.  Singapore is in a way where, unrecognised Universities or some forest high schools are also taken in as talent.</p>
              <p>Other countries are talking about getting the best talents, Singapore is talking about increasing the population to make more money ya</p>

              <p>this is probably already underestimated statistics.</p>
