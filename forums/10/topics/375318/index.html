              <p>Insights article from Saturday (12 Sep 09) Straits Times.</p>
              <p>The title stirred interest, but it's a patchwork full of quotations from ministers, economists and business leaders.</p>
              <p>No independent view from the SENIOR Political Correspondent, Mr. Goh Chun Lian who wrote, or (compiled?) this article.</p>
              <p>Flipped back to Page A2 of the papers and we have an article by Poltical Correspondent, Mr. Kor Kian Beng, who offered his or at least an independent view(?) on the political mire of PKMS with a strong title "Opposition group has to get its house in order".</p>
              <p>Brush aside all those state-controlled stuff, readers of Straits Times should have access to quality contributions, when it comes to matters of the country.</p>

              <p>Chinatown is not big enough for these PRCs living here.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Balance is the state in which other sides are not upset. when there is pulling and pushing, they are not in balance; they are in a state of change. Change is the only constant in the universe, the art is how you manage the impact of the change. When everything is balanced, its not the end, its in equilibrium.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">That is supposed to the the job of the opposition in a truly democratic society. Protestation without political support is not recommended, given the appartus available to the govt (ISA, laws, weak representation of alternative parties etc.).</span></p>
