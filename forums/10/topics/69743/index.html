Pul-lease. Do you think Singaporean food in uniquely available in Singapore? Absolute rubbish. I was in Melbourne for 4 years from 1999-2003, while I was there me and my girlfriend had Mee Rebus, Laksa, Mee Siam, Fried Rice, Char Bee Hoon, Chee Cheong Fun, Nasi Lemak, Chicken Rice, Beef Hor Fun and mooncakes. Most were made by ourselves using ingredients easily available in Australia and just slightly more expensive. Hell we even made pickled green chilli. It tasted great, out Singaporean/Malaysian friends and even the Australians friends who were lucky enough to try it loved it and couldn't get enough. And no, we're not natural chefs by any stretch of the imagination<br><br>Friends? What makes you think you'll not make friends over there? The Australians are less likely do not judge a book by its cover, and will make friends with you if you show sincerity in wanting to assimilate with them. If anything, I find Australians much more receptive to foreigners than the average Singaporean. Hell a lot of Singaporeans I know and seen don't even want to mix with Singaporeans of other races! Of course, there are racists there, but to such low-life pricks, I just give as good as I get.<br><br>As for keeping in contact with your local friends, whats email and the phone for? And theres always regular visits to each other, with air travelm particularly in the off-season, relatively cheap.<br><br>I have labeled such excuses not to leave despite claiming a desire to aspathetic in another topic, and I stand by those views. You're merely depriving yourself of a shot at a better life on such shallow concerns.</div>
