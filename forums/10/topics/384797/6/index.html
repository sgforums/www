              <p>u remind me of a japanese movie of a evil female ninja jumping confidently from tree to tree killing good ninja.her life as a evil ninja ended right after she met more evil people who one in a guise as a middle aged monk rippedpff her clothes and bite off her neck while the evil monks frend laffed at female ninja.sure u might have other ninja frends but they will all be piled deadnext to you that somehow died after your shocking encounters with middle aged evil monk.</p>

              <p><br>what research u want??? our daily life is a research by itself, your experiences, your skill, your visual your etc etc is already a research, the human mind is alway wondering and get fascinated by this n that, what and why, how and when etc etc</p>
              <p>Unreasonable is also reason to issue. You heard many peoples saying/gossip govt is no good and they are lousy etc etc...the reason why they are doing that, is because they are unreasonable people, that is the reason.</p>

              <p>the opposition supporters dont have to propagandize too much if the PAP really screwed things up. If they truely cock up this time round, no matter what kind of track records PAP has over the past 50 yrs wont be able to keep them in power. People have eyes to see around what the present govt has actually done for its people. And these grievances will definitely push more supporters to the alternate parties to increase its membership.</p>
              <p>but alas! even as the talk is fierce here and there before elections, the oppositions really are usually such a big letdown, contesting only in a few insignificant wards, with the oft heard excuse that they cant find enough good candidates to join them.</p>
              <p>Question is then asked, why are there many talks on the sidelines and when the big crunch comes, not many step forward to join them to form enough to contest in all wards? Why the usual pathetic walkovers conceded to the MIW even before the war begins?</p>
              <p>Or maybe the oft heard excuse will be that i dont want to be involved, i dont want to be identified and marked! Oh really? Or could it be that your conviction isnt that strong enough to make you stand forward to contribute as you are too busy making money in this peaceful conducive place that our govt has provided.</p>
              <p>Instead of thumping your chest trying to pump up your own ego and trying to look cool not being a "conformist", it will be great if you stand forward and take up the gaunlet and fight for what you believe and cease to be a keyboard warrior here. Or are you afraid to be seen still? </p>
              <p>Hmm..i really wonder if any of you with all your vitriolic criticism here has actually join an opposition party even as its uncontesting member or again it is all wayang only here.</p>
              <p>the truth is, most of us are politically apathetic is because we are victims of our own progress in this short impressive history of our country, looking back, which most of us cant deny.</p>
              <p>Me? I am contented with the present ruling party at this moment and i trust them to do a good job </p>
              <p>and YES, i shall be voting for PAP too!</p>

              <p>advanced system of education as in high rates of school enrollment etc. schools in secondary level teaches the students only sci/eng/humanities etc etc.i feel it does not help much in understanding about politics. and after secondary level, most people wont be bothered to touch things about politics. hence, i feel its hard for them to understand the reasoning.( this is where the other reason is, the 'bochap' attitude) IMO, economics may help a little. lastly, one need not to have high education level to understand such things. they just need to be exposed to it correctly , gain interest and learn about it, and uphold personal responsibility to make the wise choice. if this can be attained, i guess that is when pure democracy sets in. but it's going to be a long way.....</p>

              <p><br>hey, dun think the youngs like us do not understand politics, too much negative input can paint a bad image on the youth about politics leading to society chaoism, a smart young person in Singapore is not some bo chap people, he/she understand and treasure what he/she has now, peace, harmony, education, technology, stability and entertainment in Singapore can challenge countries around this region. The events in the 60s already told you clearly that Singapore must come under one rule, the fragility of this state cannot afford to have a 2 or 3 face govts, it will be diseaster for all. And we youngs know that too much powerful parties ruling a state will most likely end up in riot, protest, self interest and struggling of each parties to gain power will neglect a concentration on the real national issues.</p>
              <p>Singapore is unique in a way that one party rule can make it progress, we, the youngs had attained that understanding, and regret that the older generaton living for so long under PAP ruling still do not understand the important of peace to a country, the ironic of older generation in most countries tends to make comments and critics on their own govt, same goes to HK when i was there, Taiwan, my native land, thailand, malaysia etc etc, when you discuss about politics, they alway blame their govt, same goes to our Sg Uncles and aunties, but deep inside, deep inside them, they know that PAP, like it or not, has in a way brought about so much progress and peace for the nation. Envying of their paid and ever increasing of cost aside, 70% of these uncles and aunties who are forever criticising govt in way that become a norm in all kopitiam talks, will vote for PAP.</p>

              <p>Every countries have their own problems, our is cost of living, which is normal in most countries, everywhere you go, peoples will say money no enough, that is nature of it, but if you look deep into it, it is the only problem facing us, and it is not a problem that cannot be solve, unlike countries who had more problems than us, their society safety nets are full of holes that you can drop dead anytime on the street.</p>
              <p>Think of way to reduce your living cost, it either you use or spend wisely, or you upgrade yourself, make yourself valuable to the market, so that you get more well paid and that will reduce your cost of living. It is not problem that can't be solve, if you got the determination, the guts and the willingness to change, nothing is impossible.</p>
