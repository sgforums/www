              <p><br>I dunno lor, words are like sweet, just like boys courting me, they can come in with all kinds of sweet and pleasant words, even raining day also bring umbrella to you, wait for you outside public toilet holding your Gucci female bag, open door and car door for you, light up your bedroom with flowers, chocolate, cakes and bears on your birthday etc etc...but if you look at those couple after 10 years of marriage, husband walks in front, wife walk at the back, a few words only, not happy liao, start quarrelling and with kids around, more worst, feel like killing each other, and some dun even remember that birthday existed.</p>
              <p>Opposition is behind a curtain, till now, it is all words against the ruling, nothing of a manifesto on what are going to do, they can bill increased, but what are they going to do if they are the govt, decrease it?? can decreasing it sustain the economy??? etc etc. So, we have yet to witness opposition in action. As for PAP, it is real term, we living in it and seeing it. You can judge them easily.</p>
              <p>It is like seeing someone making laksa, you think it is easy and find that the person making it is stupid and he should do this and that, add more this and that, ...but when you are making it yourself, you will really feel the word you said going against you, and someone else will be commenting and criticising your laksa or mee siam mai hum.</p>

              <p>Yes, certainly, that is what demorcratic is about, you hv the freedom to flock to another new laksa seller, but if more peoples are still going back to the original old laksa seller after tasting and pondering over other new sellers, it is their choice, and you have to respect that, and if the situation said that the best seller will rule over all the laksa shops in Singapore, the old seller will still be the nos 1.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-large;">Malaysian doctor: Singapore should be grateful to Malaysians for its success</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">December 6, 2009</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">A Malaysian doctor by the name of Chen Jiayi who had chosen to return to Malaysia after working for a number of years in Singapore wrote in the Malaysian Chinese newspaper Sin Chew yesterday that Singapore should be grateful to the Malaysians for its success today.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Dr Chen did not reveal the reason behind his return except that “the answer would be revealed in time to come.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">When he first came to work in a Singapore government hospital as a house officer, Dr Chen soon realized that he was working with many of compatriots, some of whom are his highest level superiors. Even the Singapore Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan was a former Malaysian citizen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the press that half the number of medical specialists at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital are Malaysians during his recent visit to Singapore to attend the APEC Summit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The exact number of Malaysians doctors working in Singapore is not known. About 5 to 10 per cent of the each year cohort of medical students are Malaysians.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">While some Malaysians graduated from NUS, others like Dr Chen join the Singapore public healthcare service after they finished their studies overseas when they are lured here to work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Dr Che was told by colleagues that Malaysian talents were the most sought after in Singapore and it not a surprise as due to cultural similarities between the two nations, Malaysians find it easiest to assimilate themselves into Singapore society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">During his years of working in Singapore, Dr Chen noticed that young Singapore doctors are encountering difficulties communicating with the older generation of patients due to language barriers.</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">“Due to their educational system, the younger generation of Singaporeans are proficient in English, mediocre only in Chinese. For Malay language, they are largely outsiders; as for Chinese dialects, that will have to depend on whether their gandpas and grannies are still around.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>As such, young Singaporean doctors face communciation problems when they encounter aged patients, resorting to hand language at times just to get their messages across,”</em> he wrote.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">As a result of a chronic shortage of doctors in the public sector, the Singapore Ministry of Health has turned elsewhere to recruit foreign doctors.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The polyclinics employ many doctors from other countries like the Philipines, Vietnam, India, Thailand and Indonesia, some of whom are unable to speak Chinese or Hokkien, the lingua franca of elderly Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Most Singapore doctors will leave the public sector upon the completion of their mandatory 5-year bond if they are local graduates unless they decide to specialize further.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The meagre pay, long working hours and job satisfaction are often commonly cited as reasons for their departure and yet little has been done to retain senior medical officers within the public sector over the years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Dr Chen ended his letter with a smug remark that Singaporeans should be grateful to the Malaysian (doctors):</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">“The more successful Singapore has become, the more I feel proud of my Malaysian compatriots who have crossed the Causeway to serve in the Lion City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">But sometimes I would have this perverted idea: You Singaporeans need to be grateful to us, the “Made in Malaysia” yet forsaken lot, for what you have achieved!”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">As a matter of fact, Dr Chen should be thankful to Singapore for giving him an opportunity to succeed in life. Had he not come to Singapore, he would have to serve his internship in a Malaysian hospital which is much busier before being packed off to a remote corner to serve a rural community for three years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">After working in Singapore for a number of years, Dr Chen will probably be able to retire in his homeland with little financial worries for the rest of his life like many of his compatriots who enjoy the best of both worlds by being a Singapore PR and Malaysian citizen at the same time.</span></p>

              <div>
              <p><span>December 5, 2009</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>By Chen Jiaqi from Sin Chew Daily</strong></span></p>
              <div>
              <p>I met up with some old classmates several times since my university graduation, and discovered that over half of my Form V classmates had gone to study, work, or even settle down in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I knew many of the top talents from my school ended up in Singapore, but I was not aware that the number could be so big.</p>
              <p>Those secondary school classmates of mine were among the most brilliant in school, and Singapore was more than happy to bring these independent Chinese secondary school students there so that they could get the opportunity to advance their ambitions.</p>
              <p>Still on my internship at a government hospital here, I had a mixed bag of feelings, and to my own disbelief, I joined their rank several years later.</p>
              <p>Only a few days in Singapore, I was told by my superior that there were plenty of my compatriots around me.</p>
              <p>Indeed, beginning with my colleagues and looking upward level by level, I found that many of my highest level superiors were Malaysians.</p>
              <p>They were doing their work conscientiously and had contributed significantly towards the success of the tiny city-state.</p>
              <p>I suddenly had that feeling of pride that Singapore owed much of its success to the contributions made by Malaysian citizens.</p>
              <p>I was told by colleagues that Malaysian talents were the most sought after in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Due to cultural and geographical proximity, we are actually that group of foreigners who can best assimilate themselves into the Singapore society.</p>
              <p>This can’t be more true, as the two countries were forced apart by nothing but politics!</p>
              <p>Due to the nature of my job, I came to know many patients. Singapore is a multicultural, more so a multinational country. To these migrant workers, fundamental communication is never a problem: Chinese Malaysians are well versed in three languages plus an array of Chinese dialects.</p>
              <p>Not all Singaporean doctors have this linguistic gift! Due to their educational system, the younger generation of Singaporeans are proficient in English, mediocre only in Chinese. For Malay language, they are largely outsiders; as for Chinese dialects, that will have to depend on whether their gandpas and grannies are still around.</p>
              <p>As such, young Singaporean doctors face communciation problems when they encounter aged patients, resorting to hand language at times just to get their messages across.</p>
              <p>To Singapore, Malaysian talents are what they are most avid to tout for.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s meritocratic system knows no skin colours. But if it does, I could have bagged in more perks.</p>
              <p>I later decided to return to my country. Many have asked me why I wanted to come back to Malaysia, which is filthy, messy, hard to make a good living, and plagued with partial government policies.</p>
              <p>Why did I make such an unnatural decision? Perhaps the answer would be revealed in time to come, I was thinking.</p>
              <p>The more successful Singapore has become, the more I feel proud of my Malaysian compatriots who have crossed the Causeway to serve in the Lion City.</p>
              <p>But sometimes I would have this perverted idea: You Singaporeans need to be grateful to us, the “Made in Malaysia” yet forsaken lot, for what you have achieved! <em>(By Chen Jiaqi (reader)/Translated by DOMINIC LOH/Sin Chew Daily)</em></p>

HDB flat prices have risen almost 40 per cent over the past three years.<br><br>The Resale Price Index (RPI) hit 150.7 in the fourth quarter, up from the third quarter’s 145.2 and far beyond the previous peak of 136.9 achieved in the fourth quarter of 1996.<br><br>According to property analysts, the sky-rocketing prices is due to demand outpacing supply, fueled particularly by PRs over-paying for resale flats in prime areas.<br><br>One Indonesian PR paid $653,000 for a 4-room resale flat in Queenstown when he could easily afford to buy a condominium.<br><br>Singapore PRs are allowed to purchase HDB flats in the open market and sell them for a hefty profit years later.<br><br>There is no minimum period of residency in Singapore before a foreigner can apply for PR or to buy a HDB flat.<br><br>The ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy, especially towards the PRs enable them to exploit loopholes in the system to their own benefits.<br><br>There are stories of PRs, especially Malaysians, who retire comfortably back to their homelands with a lump sum from the sale of their HDB flats in Singapore.<br><br>An earlier report by ERA Real Estate Agency reveals that 40 per cent of its buyers of resale HDB flats are PRs.<br><br>PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail said that permanent residents estimated that PRs made up 20 per cent of his agency’s total HDB sales.<br><br>The managing director of C&amp;H Realty Albert Lu claimed that PRs account for as high as 50 per cent of all HDB resale transactions.<br><br>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan told parliament lately that PRs are “under-represented” in the HDB resale market without substantiating his statements.<br><br>He subsequently admitted that he has been “caught off guard” by the relentless rise in the prices of HDB flats.<br><br>However, he was quick to reassure that HDB flats remain “affordable” to ordinary Singaporeans and it is a “good thing” that prices continue to rise as it “generates wealth” for Singaporeans.<br><br>As the prices of new HDB flats are pegged to that of resale flats, the prices of BTO flats have hit a record high as well.<br><br>A recently launched project at Queenstown fetched prices of over $500,000 and $600,000 for four and five room flats respectively.<br><br>One financial consultant warns that only couples who has a combined monthly income of more than $7,500 can consider buying these flats and even then, they will have to deplete their CPFs on top of forking out a few hundred dollars in cash just to finance the housing loan.<br><br>While public housing is being increasingly priced out of reach of Singaporeans especially the young, the Ministry is busy building low-cost public housing for the mainland Chinese in the Tianjin Eco-city, a joint project between the Singapore and Chinese governments.</div>
