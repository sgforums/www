              <p></p>
              <div class="byline">By Mavis Toh</div>
              <div class="byline">
              <p>THE engineer, 36, was cutting his way across the dance floor of a Clarke Quay club earlier this year when a 23-year-old woman accused him of touching her buttocks.</p>
              <p>The bouncers stepped in. The police showed up. And though he claimed he did not touch the woman, he ended up paying $8,000 to settle the case.</p>
              <p>'I didn't want trouble and I didn't know what my company and wife would think if they found out,' he said in an e-mail reply to The Straits Times. 'That was my only way out.'</p>

              <div class="sidestorytitle">When a case can be settled out of court</div>
              <p>PROVISIONS in the law allow for minor offences such as simple molestation cases, wrongful restraint or causing hurt to be settled out of court.</p>
              <p>This happens only if the victim agrees to drop the matter in place of some form of compensation.</p>
              <p>Any offer to compound the offence must also require the sanction of the judge.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Subordinate Courts said that a person accused of such offences may apply to the court for the offence to be compounded, if the complainant is agreeable.</p>
              <p>She added: 'The consent of the court must be obtained before the matter can be compounded.'</p>
              <p>Lawyers said that the negotiation for compensation happens largely without the involvement of the court. Offers of compensation are made to the victims through the case's investigation officer.</p>
              <p>'We avoid dealing with the victims directly in case there are other allegations,' said lawyer Amolat Singh.</p>
              <p>Lawyers told The Straits Times that other Commonwealth countries such as Malaysia and Sri Lanka, have similar laws to compound less serious offences.</p>
              <p>Proposed changes to the Criminal Procedure Code last year had included suggestions to leave the decision to compound certain offences to the public prosecutor - even before an accused is charged in court.</p>
              <p>But not all cases can be settled out of court, especially if it involves public interest. One example is cases of maid abuse.</p>
              <p>In 2005, the court also threw out a bid by a company chairman, accused of assaulting another motorist, to have the case compounded for $7,500. The prosecution objected, as road rage cases were on the rise.</p>
              <p>The chairman was eventually fined the maximum $1,000, although he could have been jailed up to a year.</p>
              <p>Those convicted of outrage of modesty can be jailed up to two years or fined or caned, or subjected to any two such punishments.</p>

              <p>well.thats what im trying to say.if you find the grass on the other side greener,go ahead and move there.noone's gonna stop you.just stop whining and whining and whining. IMO, it's just the different preferences for different way of life. aust offers a more laid back lifestyle while living in sgp is really stressful ( non-stop working or whatsoever) . if any lifestyle dont suit you,just move on.=)</p>
              <p>i hope you'll enjoy the rest of your days in aust! i actually have thought of moving there after retirement. but definately not during my working years.=)</p>

The average fuel oil price over the past three months has increased by around S$7.35 to S$99.38 per barrel. <br><br>The latest hike means average increase in tariffs across all customer categories between January and March will be 5.5 per cent. <br><br>Electricity tariffs are reviewed every quarter. <br><br><br>- CNA/so</span></p>

              <p>On the contrary, I will visit very often when I'm older. I will work here where it's less stressful and go back to Singapore where I have more buying power.</p>

              <p>haha.i agree on this. i'll look at the big picture and decide carefully on what is really best for me, my family and country rather than following the crowd whereever they go. if PAP were to instill a unpopular but important policy, i will agree with them. in contrast, if they were to instill a useless policy, i will not support them. rather than supporting them blindly.</p>
              <p>but the sad truth is, many singaporeans are too narrow-minded or are incapable of making well-thought decisions. hence, the government steps in to have a firmer control- which i call it as benevolant dictatorship. can hardly do anything about this, but im glad that this power is not abused. maybe in the future when more people are well-educated enough to understand each rationale behind each decision, then singapore can be a much much more free country.</p>

              <h1>Inaccurate statements from HDB</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 30, 2009</span></p>
              <p>I take issue with Mrs Lily Chan-Wong Jee Choo, Deputy Director (Policy and Property), HDB’s reply in the ST article “Singles do get benefits” on 23 Dec 2009.</p>
              <p>Mrs Chan had made the following statements:</p>
              <p>1. “Permanent residents (PRs) do not enjoy any housing subsidy and can buy only from the resale market.”</p>
              <p>2. “Singles are not allowed to buy new flats as the subsidy included in the selling price is for a family of at least two.”</p>
              <p>I would like to point out the falsity of statement:</p>
              <p>1. A Singapore citizen (SC) and PR family nucleus can buy a flat directly from HDB and hence PRs do enjoy housing subsidies. A SC-PR nucleus enjoys the same level of subsidy as a SC-SC nucleus when buying flats directly from HDB.</p>
              <p>2. Mrs Chan stated that Single SCs are not allowed to buy new flats as the subsidy is for “a family of at least two”. Yet, it is a fact that SC-PR nuclei can enjoy subsidies when buying new flats. Is Mrs Chan implying that the PR counterpart in the SC-PR nucleus is more deserving than a Single SC and hence entitled to the subsidy? Is HDB insinuating that a Single SC is less deserving than the PR counterpart to have a stake in public housing?</p>
              <p>In the resale market, Half Housing Grants are applied to enable only eligible members of the family nucleus to enjoy housing subsidies. Why was the Half Housing Grant concept not adopted in the sale of new flats to SC-PR families to ensure equity?</p>
              <p>It is a shame that the person involved in HDB policies is ignorant of the fact that PRs do enjoy housing subsidies and makes such factually inaccurate statements in the press.</p>
              <p>It would be a tall order to expect HDB to formulate equitable policies when HDB staff involved in policy work are not even familiar with their own HDB policies, much less appreciate the detrimental effects of such ill-thought policies which are felt so starkly by the layperson.</p>
              <p>Considering that HDB had displayed such poor fundamental knowledge of their own policies, I would not be surprised that the queries in my letter go unanswered.</p>
