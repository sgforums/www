              <p>How does resale flat price booming create much jobs for businesses  like interior design, carpenters, house renovation peoples, since the flats are already there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In actual fact, this will just give HDB excuse to increase new flat prices and people who bought new/resale flats, esp young couples, are going to spend less as a result due to the high housing loans they're paying.</p>

              <p>When people bought a resale flat at a high price, they will renovate it, they will also buy furnitures, get an interior design to decorate it, property agents will also earn higher commission, bank will loan more money out and earn more interest leading to bank worker getting more paid and bonuses..etc etc etc...so when all these people earn more money, they will spend more, property agents getting rich will dine at restuarant with their families, drink at pubs, furniture shop workers and bosses being richer will spend on travelling, buying cars etc etc etc...all these stimulate the economy moving and job creation.</p>
              <p>New couples go buy resale flat for what...???? must damn stupid lor. New couples are alway given the priorty on New nice flats at origin price, after 5 years, can sell and make money lor. I was thinking of going to find a guy, with no love, together we go Registry of Marriage and register, then we go and apply a big HDB house, then rent it out for 5 years, then sell it away as resale, sure to earn lots of money. After that, both of us file for divorce and life goes on. So, there is loophole in gaining from buying HDB flat. Be smart ya...so..eh...which guy want to marry me??? old old also never mind lah.

              <p>Why must people buy at a <strong>high price</strong> then will go and renovate &amp; buy furniture? Buy at <strong>low </strong>price won't they spend even more  to renovate and have more to spend after that? Some people earn more some others must be losing more, come on.</p>
              <p>For people like you maybe you can carrry out your plan because you do not need the flat and can buy it for investment with some mock husband. But for many couples, that is the only home they can afford and if they sell it, they no need to buy another one to live? It will probably be hard for them to ballot a new flat again so go where to buy another cheap flat to live? You sell so high you think got goondo is selling low for you to buy?  </p>
              <p>Some people migh profit a little from selling their flats but they will almost certainly lose in some intangible area, like living with parents again, or shifting to a damn ulu place. Is that good? Really up to individuals.</p>

              <p>Actually, can see from angel7030 that she has limited knowledge on properties as well</p>
              <p>If you sell high, you obviously are going to buy high, IF the one you are selling is the ONLY home you have.</p>
              <p>People only start making money if they have a secondary property, so that they sell high, then wait for the price to drop, before buying in again.</p>
              <p>Of course, there is the other option, buy a home and live for many years, then sell and downgrade so that got some $$$ for retirement.</p>
              <p>That is NOT the option I will take.</p>

You sell so high you think got goondo is selling low for you to buy?  </p>
              <p>Some people migh profit a little from selling their flats but they will almost certainly lose in some intangible area, like living with parents again, or shifting to a damn ulu place. Is that good? Really up to individuals.</p>

              <p>Dear PM Lee &amp; Mr Gan,<br> <br>I refer to the online report by local blog www.temasekreview.com (see article:<br><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/15/singapore-courts-mass-recruiting-malaysians-in-jb-next-monday-to-fill-vacancies-based-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>) that Courts Singapore will be holding a mass recruitment exercise across the causeway to fill up their Singapore operations’ positions with Malaysian only.<br> <br>I would like to know the Ministry of Manpower’s position on this matter.<br> <br>PM Lee, it is somehow good news to hear recently on some Government announcements that give native Singaporeans certain priority such as primary school balloting and revision of school fee for PR/foreigners. However, most of these announcements are simply superficial don’t really give a clear distinction between citizens and foreigners.</p>
              <p>During the early pre-independence days, the PAP Government under then-PM<br>Lee Kuan Yew had campaigned for a ‘Malaysian Malaysia’ policy. Why after fifty years the PAP Government has sifted it ‘goal-post’ from a ‘Singaporean Singapore’ to ‘pro-Foreign Talent Singapore’ policy?  Is it because of such radical shift that caused companies to also adopt a pro-Foreign HR policy?<br> <br>Yours Faithfully,<br> <br><strong>A native-born Singaporean – Tan Keng Hong</strong></p>

              <h1>Singapore MNC placed job ad recruiting Malaysians ONLY (Singaporeans need not apply)</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 16, 2010</span></p>
              <p>An “International Progressive Company in Agricultural Chemicals” based in Singapore put up a recruitment advertisement on the online portal olx.sg for two positions of laboratory technicians in December last year.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>It is stated clearly in the ad that only Malaysians are “required” and not Singaporeans:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21177" title="courts" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/msiatech.jpg" alt="courts" width="560" height="286"></p>
              <p>[Source: <a href="http://www.careerjet.sg/job/dc8a79681bf5eb8509d098842056b15a.html"><span style="color: #a91b33;">olx.sg</span></a>]</p>
              <p>The job scope includes performing physical and chemical tests on incoming and outgoing, in process raw materials and finished goods,  ensuring quality standards of incoming and outgoing raw materials, in-process raw materials and finished goods and assisting in carrying out quality checks on newly developed products.</p>
              <p>The pay range lies between S$1,500 – S$1600 which is barely sufficient to survive in Singapore, but can enable one to enjoy a comfortable life when converted to Ringgit in Malaysia where the cost of living is much lower.</p>
              <p>According to leaders from the ruling party, companies in Singapore have no choice but to employ foreign workers because locals are not interested in taking up the jobs on offer. They also claim that foreign workers are needed in sectors shunned by Singaporeans such as the construction industry.</p>
              <p>However, the above vacancies can be filled by any Singapore diploma holder. Though the pay is not too attractive, some Singaporeans may still accept it in the present economic climate. It is strange that the MNC chose to employ Malaysians instead of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>One reason may be that they have to contribute CPF to Singapore workers which will translate to higher labor costs. Furthermore, Singapore males need to be away for up to 4 weeks yearly for reservist training while Malaysians do not have such obligations.</p>
              <p>This is one of the many ads out there which seek foreign workers specifically. Singapore Courts put up a full-page advertisement in the Malaysia paper – The Star today to recruit Malaysians for various positions in Singapore. The interview will be held next Monday in Johor Bahru.</p>
              <p>Some companies are more discreet and do not specify the nationality of the workers they are seeking, but phrase it in another way to give the public the wrong impression that locals are welcomed to apply for the vacancies too.</p>
              <p>For example, we published an article earlier on a local SME Wang Foong food supplies which put up a job ad containing the following sentence as part of its criteria – “PRs and Malaysians are welcomed”.</p>
              <p>Though it did not rule out Singaporeans, when our correspondent called them up this morning, the first question its staff asked was whether he is a Malaysian PR.</p>
              <p>One reader who has over 10 years of experience in the HR department of a major company in Singapore told us that if a company wants to recruit Singaporeans the phase on the ad will be – “All are welcomed including PRs” and not “PRs and Malaysians are welcomed” which is a polite way of saying – “Singaporeans need not apply.”</p>
              <p>His company employs a large number of foreigners who are preferred over Singaporeans due to their lower cost and willingness to work OT. However as it cannot discriminate openly against Singaporeans, it will accept their applications and even call them up for interviews, but their files will be stamped (ironically) with a “star” – meaning that the interviewers will simply just go through the “motion” without the intention of ever recruiting them.</p>
              <p>As a result of the ruling party’s lax immigration and pro-business policies, large numbers of foreigners have flocked to Singapore to find work in recent years.</p>
              <p>While some of them are indeed real talents who contribute greatly to the nation’s development, there are many others who are competing directly with Singaporeans for jobs which can be otherwise taken up by them.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of foreigners has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans leading to a widening income gap between the rich and the poor. Singapore has the highest income gap among the thirty most developed economies in the world.</p>
              <p>Though there are no official statistics available, the income gap between its political leaders and citizens is probably one of the highest as well. The monthly median wage of an average Singapore worker is only S$2,600 compared to S$180,000 for a minister.</p>
