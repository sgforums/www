I don’t want to see foreigners flood our condos, HDB estates, MRT trains, buses, schools, EVERYWHERE<br><br>5. I don’t want to know about how ministers are getting lots of landed and prime property both local and overseas when I have trouble getting a 3-room flat.<br><br>6. I don’t want ministers who get multi-million dollar salaries when I do odd jobs and some months I don’t make more than $2,000.<br><br>Ministers in other countries may take bribes and embezzle. My ministers are smarter, they get more money claiming more MILLIONS in salary LEGALLY.<br><br>7. I don’t want to pay ERP just because foreigners’ cars are clogging my roads. Especially, when ERP do not solve congestion problems!!! We still have terrible traffic jams!<br><br>8. I don’t want to do NS and reservist to protect my country against foreign invaders when:<br>(A) I don’t have a house to protect<br>(B) I cannot afford to start a family to protect<br>(C) I have to protect foreigners and their property with my life when they run away during war.<br>(D) Foreigner PRs do not have to serve<br>(E) I get paid worse than a Bangala worker. To think that National Service needed people donation’s in 1967, after a year, it gathered S$ 3 million from Singaporeans when we were all so poor.<br><br>9. I do not want to see PRs and New citizens flashing their blue and pink ICs on their national days.<br><br>10. I do not want to see the shamelessness of importing foreign athletes and claims that Singapore won when a foreigner won. Oh yes, we pay these foreigners millions of dollars so that Singapore can claim that it won. WOW!<br><br>11. I do not want to hear jeering against the SG local soccer teams from foreigner spectators when we play against other countries IN OUR OWN COUNTRY!<br><br>12. I don’t want to pay 7% more for everything I buy in my whole life when the government gives my $200 in “compensation” handouts!<br><br>13. I want to see a local student being the top student. Not some China kid. Not hearing from ours kids that there is no point to work hard as some foreigner is going to squeeze them down inevitably.<br><br>14. When there is public curiosity, I expect my government (especially Law minister) to be transparent enough let us know about Temasek and HDB cost to build a flat, etc.<br><br>15. I want my country to be known as a COUNTRY. My country is NOT just a city like some idiot claims.<br><br>16. I don’t want LHL’s son to be the next succeeding prime minister.<br><br>17. I don’t like how China suckered us in the Suzhou park initiative and we still have to kiss their assess.<br><br>18. I cannot understand why local siblings cannot buy flats when foreigner PR siblings can buy flats.<br><br>19. Singles are not allowed to buy flats before 35? Are singles supposed to be forced into marriage just because of this? By the time singles reach 35, the flat prices will be higher by $100,000 to $300,000. These singles worked very hard to scrimp and save only to see savings ERODED away by inflation!<br><br>20. I do not want to read the paper when it is pro-PAP and there is major censorship and selective publishing and late publishing for what cannot be hidden.<br><br>21. I don’t want my life-savings to be belittled as the salt on the “peanuts”.<br><br>22. I don’t like it when my country’s reserves lost tens of billions of dollars and the PM’s wife can still head Temasek!<br><br>23. I want important national assets key to our security like power stations to BELONG to our country, not sold to foreigners.<br><br>24. I like to add hum to my mee siam by the way.<br><br>25. I want a president who actually DOES more. Not one which who I seek shakes hands, seldom speaks, does not even pardon and spare a 19-year-old kid his life. Not a president who kids confuse with Mas Selamat (Many kids who know Mas Selamat do not EVEN know Nathan)<br><br>26. I don’t want to have my next national day parade at the silly riverside place….AGAIN! How long does it take to make a stadium? We are a country but we don’t even have a national stadium?? How about loaning Malaysia’s Merdeka Stadium for Singapore’s National day?<br><br>27. I want job security. A contract for 1 or 2 years, Then look for work again. The cycle repeats. We have to worry for our jobs and livelihoods on a daily basis. When we are over 40 years old, who want us anymore? I might as well join the army as sign on. But wait, that is contract TOO!<br><br>28. I don’t want the next generation to suffer like me in university. I had to work part-time to support my uni fees in NUS, while foreign students get free uni education thanks to MOE PLUS $500 allowance every month. After that, NUS still has the cheek to call me up and ask me to donate to NUS. Why they need money? They lost hundreds of millions of endowment in the financial crisis. I can still remember working and saving for 3 months before I could afford a 2nd hand laptop.<br><br>29. I want to protest in the streets to voice my discontent without being put to jail by the ISA act or made bankrupt. For goodness sake, I don’t even dare to accept Singtel’s offer of giving me free 6 months internet if I switch from Starhub to Singtel, because I am scared that my IP address and my name will be blacklisted by the government. (considering Singtel’s afflictions with the govt)<br><br>30. I want an opposition party in power. Any opposition is welcome. As educated and smart as my current and soon-to-be-ex ministers may be, I want people who CARE and LISTEN. Even if it is a guy who had graduated from kindergarten would be welcomed if he cares.<br><br>31. Elites who have been born with a silver spoon, who never had trouble finding a job, who never had money difficulties, who never went hungry, who breezed through NS, do NOT deserve my respect nor should they be in the government. We need people who UNDERSTAND what it is like at the pits and bottom! Not some shortie who claims to understand hardship with a childhood living in 3-room flat but marries an angmoh and lives in a landed mansion.<br><br>32. I want a better electoral system! I don’t want WALK-OVERs again. Some of the seniors did not even get to vote ONCE in their whole lives. How is that democracy?<br><br>33. I want fairness. Is it a coincidence that certain estates under certain members of our government are especially well-cared for with upgrading etc incentives? Is this fair? Are residents of areas under the opposition similarly cared for? I quote a resident from Potong Pasir “the lifts here are so old and I can’t climb the flight of stairs to reach my place anymore.” I supposed the 60 year old aunty would be forced to vote for PAP to get new lifts.<br><br>34. I want a limit to the number of years the PM can hold office, so that as bad and as lousy as the PM is, we can at least have a chance to start afresh.<br><br>35. I want small quotas/ratios legislated for foreigners.<br><br>36. I want foreigners to be restricted to less than 20% of our population instead of 36%.<br><br>37. MBT actually said that foreigner PRs were under-represented in HDB flats. Pah! No more than 2 flats in a block should be sold to PRs! Otherwise, how can the many old uncles and aunties have pocket money for retirement by renting out flats?<br><br>38. I want their CPF contribution percent to be much higher and that their CPF to be forfeited if they leave SG.<br><br>39. I want higher income taxes and property taxes for foreigners.<br><br>40. I want NS for foreigners.</strong></div>

              <div id="post_message_362519"><strong>41. Foreigners who bought HDB flats cannot be allowed to rent their flat out EVER!<br><br>42. I want the SGD to be moderated downwards! A higher SGD may benefit those who can afford to holiday overseas, those who are rich enough to send kids to overseas for studies, or PRs and foreigners when they remit money home. BUT overly high SGD deters investments into Singapore.<br><br>43. I want curbs on inflation. To that effect, we need to install restrictions on property speculation, raise reserve ratios in banks, and have more stringent criteria before loans are issued. AND OF COURSE, GST lower back to 3%<br><br>44. When foreign talent enters my country. I want these people to be REALLY foreign talent. I don’t want my country’s pink IC and PR to be handed out like toilet paper.<br><br>45. I want more heavily subsidized birth-delivery, child-care, pediatric health and education care to boost local numbers. If S.Korea can do it, why not us? The practice of replacement diminishing local numbers with foreigner number MUST STOP.<br><br>46. Instead of always saying Singapore does not have enough talent, will the government spend more money and effort in education and grooming the young? Every time they say that there is not enough of certain type of people, the government will import these people in masses and hordes.<br><br>47. I expect government-affiliated institutions to not indulge themselves with luxuries when other citizens have bread-butter problems:<br><br>When NTUC income unilaterally announced major cuts in its bonus for insurance-policy-holders, the MAS allowed this to happen. NTUC income claimed financial woes, but took HUNDREDS of agents to Australia for an exorbitant expense-paid holiday as they made the announcement earlier this year!!! Do they think about the widows and orphans when they dine fine with wine???<br><br>At first I could not believe NTUC Income to be capable of this, then I checked on the web and saw the NTUC CEO hugging 2 BIKINI girls and drinking champagne in Australia too.<br>(1) <a href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1550459&amp;id=36541001838&amp;ref=mf"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?...1001838&amp;ref=mf</span></a><br>(2) <a href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1549575&amp;id=36541001838&amp;ref=mf"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?...1001838&amp;ref=mf</span></a><br><br>48. I expect the MAS to protect citizens financially too:<br><br>When thousands of investors lost their life savings in the mini-bond fiasco, where was the government?? Unlike the Hong Kong government which had exerted pressure on its local banks to compensate a minimum sum to its minibond holders, the Singapore authorities chose to stay out of the matter….. MM Lee Kuan Yew even chided Singapore investors for “walking in with their eyes open” and therefore did not deserve a compensation. <br><br>49. I have 1 more issue with the state Media Press. HOW can they publish photos of people suspected of crimes when they have not EVEN been convicted?? Imagine the tarnishing to the poor suspect’s reputation if he were innocent! It is not as if the guy can sue ST and get $400,000 in defamation compensation.<br><br>50. Anyone can give the 50th reason??????????????? Come on my fellow locals. If I can say so much, you can at least say something! Few thousand people viewing this article and so little comments???</strong></div>

              <div id="post_message_3231690"><strong>MM Lee: HDB flat value will rise as long as economy grows<br><br>By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia<br>Posted: 13 December 2009 2123 hrs</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: Public flats will continue to appreciate in value as long as the Singapore economy continues to grow. And with limited space, the future of public housing looks set to go up - with more skyscraper flats to be built. <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said this as he launched The Pinnacle@Duxton, which at 50 storeys, is the tallest HDB development in Singapore. <br><br>The first rental HDB blocks in Tanjong Pagar were built in 1963 on the site where The Pinnacle@Duxton stands. Today, it is the site of the tallest HDB in the country and the scene has changed significantly. <br><br>Mr Lee attributes the change to an early policy decision to build a home-owning society, which is what motivates Singaporeans to upgrade this asset for a better life, something which could not have happened with just rental flats. <br><br>Going forward, Mr Lee expects more of such flats to be built. <br><br>He said: "The Pinnacle@Duxton is therefore a good example that if the nation continues to do well, we can build more flats of this standard. But we should not make a quick profit from a resale of HDB flats. <br><br>"The rules on minimum occupation and requirement for family units nucleus are to discourage speculative purchases." <br><br>Mr Lee gave out keys to seven of the first families to move in and visited one family, whose father had rented a flat in the area previously. <br><br>Speaking to reporters later, he said the government could have built a condominium in its place but preferred to build public flats in this central area and share the growth of the city with the people who had rented flats in the area before. <br><br>Responding to questions later on about young couples who are concerned about flat affordability, Mr Lee said this is linked to the country's growth - if the country is doing well, property prices will go up. <br><br>But if the economy goes down, unemployment goes up but incomes and property values decline. <br><br>One thing that will be going up is the height of future public housing. <br><br>Mr Lee said: "Well, it's a very special problem we face because we can't expand the city laterally, we have to expand the city vertically. Yes, we can have more (land) reclamations but that's only about 10, 15 per cent and we've reached the limit. <br><br>"Therefore, I see more and more of the old blocks being demolished and new blocks like The Pinnacle@Duxton being built." <br><br>Units at The Pinnacle@Duxton cost an average of S$486,000 for a 4-room flat and S$590,000 for a 5-room flat, when the last of the units were released in October. <br><br>The 50th-storey skybridge will also be open to non-residents for a S$5 fee.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stori...024558/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stori...024558/1/.html</span></span></a></div>

(considering Singtel’s afflictions with the govt)<br><br>30. I want an opposition party in power. Any opposition is welcome. As educated and smart as my current and soon-to-be-ex ministers may be, I want people who CARE and LISTEN. Even if it is a guy who had graduated from kindergarten would be welcomed if he cares.<br><br>31. Elites who have been born with a silver spoon, who never had trouble finding a job, who never had money difficulties, who never went hungry, who breezed through NS, do NOT deserve my respect nor should they be in the government. We need people who UNDERSTAND what it is like at the pits and bottom! Not some shortie who claims to understand hardship with a childhood living in 3-room flat but marries an angmoh and lives in a landed mansion.<br><br>32. I want a better electoral system! I don’t want WALK-OVERs again. Some of the seniors did not even get to vote ONCE in their whole lives. How is that democracy?<br><br>33. I want fairness. Is it a coincidence that certain estates under certain members of our government are especially well-cared for with upgrading etc incentives? Is this fair? Are residents of areas under the opposition similarly cared for? I quote a resident from Potong Pasir “the lifts here are so old and I can’t climb the flight of stairs to reach my place anymore.” I supposed the 60 year old aunty would be forced to vote for PAP to get new lifts.<br><br>34. I want a limit to the number of years the PM can hold office, so that as bad and as lousy as the PM is, we can at least have a chance to start afresh.<br><br>35. I want small quotas/ratios legislated for foreigners.<br><br>36. I want foreigners to be restricted to less than 20% of our population instead of 36%.<br><br>37. MBT actually said that foreigner PRs were under-represented in HDB flats. Pah! No more than 2 flats in a block should be sold to PRs! Otherwise, how can the many old uncles and aunties have pocket money for retirement by renting out flats?<br><br>38. I want their CPF contribution percent to be much higher and that their CPF to be forfeited if they leave SG.<br><br>39. I want higher income taxes and property taxes for foreigners.<br><br>40. I want NS for foreigners.</strong></div>
              <div>
              <div><strong>41. Foreigners who bought HDB flats cannot be allowed to rent their flat out EVER!<br><br>42. I want the SGD to be moderated downwards! A higher SGD may benefit those who can afford to holiday overseas, those who are rich enough to send kids to overseas for studies, or PRs and foreigners when they remit money home. BUT overly high SGD deters investments into Singapore.<br><br>43. I want curbs on inflation. To that effect, we need to install restrictions on property speculation, raise reserve ratios in banks, and have more stringent criteria before loans are issued. AND OF COURSE, GST lower back to 3%<br><br>44. When foreign talent enters my country. I want these people to be REALLY foreign talent. I don’t want my country’s pink IC and PR to be handed out like toilet paper.<br><br>45. I want more heavily subsidized birth-delivery, child-care, pediatric health and education care to boost local numbers. If S.Korea can do it, why not us? The practice of replacement diminishing local numbers with foreigner number MUST STOP.<br><br>46. Instead of always saying Singapore does not have enough talent, will the government spend more money and effort in education and grooming the young? Every time they say that there is not enough of certain type of people, the government will import these people in masses and hordes.<br><br>47. I expect government-affiliated institutions to not indulge themselves with luxuries when other citizens have bread-butter problems:<br><br>When NTUC income unilaterally announced major cuts in its bonus for insurance-policy-holders, the MAS allowed this to happen. NTUC income claimed financial woes, but took HUNDREDS of agents to Australia for an exorbitant expense-paid holiday as they made the announcement earlier this year!!! Do they think about the widows and orphans when they dine fine with wine???<br><br>At first I could not believe NTUC Income to be capable of this, then I checked on the web and saw the NTUC CEO hugging 2 BIKINI girls and drinking champagne in Australia too.<br>(1) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1550459&amp;amp;id=36541001838&amp;amp;ref=mf"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?...1001838&amp;ref=mf</span></a><br>(2) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1549575&amp;amp;id=36541001838&amp;amp;ref=mf"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?...1001838&amp;ref=mf</span></a><br><br>48. I expect the MAS to protect citizens financially too:<br><br>When thousands of investors lost their life savings in the mini-bond fiasco, where was the government?? Unlike the Hong Kong government which had exerted pressure on its local banks to compensate a minimum sum to its minibond holders, the Singapore authorities chose to stay out of the matter….. MM Lee Kuan Yew even chided Singapore investors for “walking in with their eyes open” and therefore did not deserve a compensation.<br><br>49. I have 1 more issue with the state Media Press. HOW can they publish photos of people suspected of crimes when they have not EVEN been convicted?? Imagine the tarnishing to the poor suspect’s reputation if he were innocent! It is not as if the guy can sue ST and get $400,000 in defamation compensation.<br><br>50. Anyone can give the 50th reason??????????????? Come on my fellow locals. If I can say so much, you can at least say something! Few thousand people viewing this article and so little comments???</strong></div>

              <h2>My vote counts: 10 reasons why I cannot vote for the PAP in the next election</h2>
              <p><span style="color: #777777;">By yaevlejunce</span></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p>That so many Singaporeans behave like sheep and recite the prescribed mantra all the time about our government (namely, that we owe it all to them) really only reveals the plight of our people. Not only are Singaporeans amongst the lowest earners in the developed world in monetary terms, they are also almost definitely the poorest in the faculty to think for themselves, as a result of the education system.</p>
              <p>Now that I am of age to vote, I am unable to vote for the PAP in the coming election because there is such an urgent need to send across a strong signal through their very thick skulls that there is a problem in the way it’s running this country. I am not a member of the Opposition, and I do <em>not</em> want the Opposition to take over this country, but because there will always be too many sheep in Singapore anyway, we need every vote FOR the Opposition just to manage to produce a dent in the PAP’s smugly expected results. There will always be the apathetic, the boot-lickers, the cowardly, and the ignorant to ensure they win eventually anyway.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The difference we can make, however, is <em>how much</em> it wins by. Perhaps if it loses a GRC or two (and the GRC is a PAP invention), they will shake off their slumber and start ruling Singapore as a Republic, that is, for the public, for the People (rather than for personal interests).</span></p>
              <p>Remember how LKY said he will send in the army if there ever is a “freak election” and the PAP is voted out of Parliament? In every other country, when the people vote out the ruling party, it is called <em>a mandate</em>. It is only in Singapore that such a vote is called a “freak election”. Also, whose Army is it anyway? Is it the Army of the people of Singapore – who have just voted out the PAP? Or is it the Army of the PAP?</p>
              <p>I list here ten out of the many other reasons why I am unable to vote for the PAP:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. I will not render unto Caesar what is not Caesar’s</span></p>
              <p>Given that Singapore’s poor are amongst the Developed World’s poorest, while living standards are amongst the highest in the world, it is not difficult to see why the Government’s ridiculous salaries are distastefully inflated.</p>
              <p>The President earns $3.9 million, the PM $3.8 million, the MM and SM $3.5 million each, all other ministers between $2 to $3.2 million and all ministers of state between $1.5 to $1.8 million. These salaries do not include MP allowances, pensions and other sources of income such as Directorship, Chairmanship, Advisory, Consultancy, etc to government-linked and government-related organisations or foreign MNCs, etc. And why are they allowed to work for foreign corporations in the first place? Weren’t their ridiculously-high salaries justified with the excuse that it’ll be THIS excessive precisely so that they will focus on doing their ministerial jobs? <em>Where</em> is the check and balance in this government?</p>
              <p>How much do <em>you</em> earn in a year?</p>
              <p>In contrast, President Obama earns a more reasonable US$400,000, with US$50,000 expenses. Our most junior ministers are paid more than twice of what the most powerful man in the world gets! Hong Kong, with the same scarcity of resources as Singapore, half the developable land area, but with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">double the economic success</span>, only pays its Chief Executive Donald Tsang HK$37,1,885 (US$47, 678). That is good enough to show that the PAP rhetoric about their paycheques is plain rubbish (incidentally, “rubbish” is one of LKY’s favourite words).</p>
              <p>Adding to that, it had the cheek to raise its own salary right before a GST hike in 2003 and 2004. GST was raised again in 2007 to 7% from the original 3%. And of course, the PAP salaries have been rising accordingly as well.</p>
              <p>It claims it needs to be paid similar to the private sector, but this is the <strong>public</strong> sector for a reason – you choose to work in the government to serve the country, not your pockets. Arguing that “talents” need this monetary incentive to join the government only goes to show what kind of people are being attracted – greedy, selfish, money-minded elites who see the Civil Service as nothing but a more glamorous avenue to the big bucks since their main reason for serving is not for the good of the country, but for money.</p>
              <p>I cannot vote for a government that decides its own ridiculous salaries DESPITE a very strong public opinion against it.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Incompetence</span></p>
              <p>Despite paying astronomic salaries to these patron saints of Singapore, there is much to be desired from their performance. Surely, if we are paying the highest government salaries in the world, it is not unreasonable to simply expect these people to do their job. The recent Bukit Timah Floodings, however, is a case in point showing why this expectation may be misplaced.</p>
              <p>Environment Minister Yaacob Ibrahim said that the government knew the diversion canal was not big enough to take the rainwaters. He claimed that because this sort of “freak events” occur only once every 50 years, there was nothing the government could do about it. The Bukit Timah Canal was constructed in 1972, almost 40 years ago – about time something that happens “once every 50 years” would occur. Additionally, meteorologists reported that ‘this flood comes three years after one of Singapore’s worst floodings in recent history, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in December 2006</span>‘. 50 years indeed. But alas, our $2.8 million/year Minister was unable to foresee such a simple thing – even while knowing the canal was not big enough! Well, the PUB is planning to work on expanding it now – pretty late or early (depending on where in Singapore you live), since the next time we really need it will be 50 years from now, according to the Minister.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Double standards</span></p>
              <p>It is a well-known fact that GIC and Temasek Holdings, Singapore’s two sovereign wealth funds, are both headed by members of the Lee family. Both have reported a ridiculous loss of <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/09/29/singapores-gic-suffers-41-6-billion-loss/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">$41.6 Billion</span></a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124350003544761935.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">$39.91 Billion</span></a> respective and have yet to answer to the real stakeholders – Singaporeans – on how this could have happened. No one has taken responsibility or issued explanations or <em>anything</em> at all. In fact, the state media has been glaringly silent on the issue. Why aren’t we Singaporeans hearing anything about <em>our</em> money?</p>
              <p>“When we invest, we invest for the long-term”, Lee Kuan Yew, who heads GIC, said when Temasek Holdings purchased Bank of America shares and then sold it off <em>a few months later</em>, <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/yax-1037.htm"><span style="color: #0066cc;">losing</span></a> between US$2.3 to US$4.6 billion just like that.</p>
              <p>That is more than $80 Billion in total from the blood and sweat of Singaporeans, down the drain because of bad decisions made by individuals whose multi-million dollar paycheques remain secure no matter how many mistakes they make. In contrast, the Resilience Package tapped into Singapore’s official reserves to withdraw $4.9 billion, and that effort to <em>help</em> Singaporeans in genuine need required hours and hours of debate.</p>
              <p>While we should rightfully acknowledge the good that the PAP has done for Singapore, it is often taken for granted that Singaporeans believe a blatant lie that the country’s affluence is owed to the PAP and Lee Kuan Yew’s efforts. No, it came from the efforts of <em>all </em>Singaporeans. Hong Kong did not have a strongman like Lee Kuan Yew to dictate their lives from toilet habits to whether they could hear their own dialect on TV, and yet they have achieved double of what we have – and their people are involved in the political process, not dead and apathetic like our population. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Singapore, with its strategic location and hardworking population, would not have reached its present affluence under a less money-minded David Marshall or someone else.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the oft-used justification for the lofty salaries of the government is that the private sector pays its leaders similar salaries. Well, in the private sector, there is such a thing as <strong>accountability</strong>. Where is Temasek Holdings’ accountability? Where is GIC’s accountability? Where was Wong Kan Seng’s accountability when his Ministry slipped up time and time again? Where is Yaacob Ibrahim’s accountability? What exactly happens when a minister makes a mistake in Singapore? Where is the Fourth Estate to play its role as a watchdog?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Blatant lies</span></p>
              <p>We are probably the only country in the world that has its MPs blatantly lie in Parliament and yet achieve high rankings on corruptibility. Anyone remember the mention of White Horses in Parliament? Practically every NSF knows that there is such a thing as White Horses, yet right there in Parliament, an affront to the ideals of democracy, transparency and integrity in this country, our leaders lied to its people. If it can do that once, it could have done it before, and it can do it again. What is the point of wearing white, trying to look pure, if you are a liar? I cannot vote for such blatant liars to be my leaders – especially when they lie about such things NOT for the good of the country, but for their own interests, for the unfairly selective comfort of their own children at the very expense of the equality this country was founded upon.</p>
              <p>The media in Singapore is entirely controlled via Singapore Press Holdings, headed by a former PAP minister, Dr Tony Tan. Masquerading as an independent paper, the Straits Times, while not necessarily fabricating facts on its own (at least I hope not), blatantly twists them. For example (extracted from <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/26/role-of-state-media-in-making-singapore-leaders-appear-better-than-they-are-part-2/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></a>), the media was full of praise of Temasek CEO Ho Ching for earning a few million dollars on paper, but failed to highlight her disastrous investment decisions such as buying the shares of Barclays bank at a high and selling them at a low a few months later.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times credited the Singapore Internal Security Department for providing the crucial “intelligence” which led to the capture of escaped terrorist Mas Selamat Kasteri by the Malaysian Special Branch. It turned out that the operation was part of a joint collaboration by the Malaysian, Singapore and Indonesian police and the Singapore ISD actually played only a minor role in the capture of Mas Selamat, but the Straits Times did not mention this to give the public the full picture, choosing rather to mislead Singaporeans into believing that ISD had indeed “redeemed” itself.</p>
              <p>Without a free press in Singapore, Singaporeans are robbed of access to real and accurate news that does not include propaganda and spins that mislead. They are robbed of a crucial check and balance in the form of the Fourth Estate that acts as a watchdog to ensure the government is doing its job. In the end, it is Singaporeans who stand to lose.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Operation Coldstore and the 1963 General Elections</span></p>
              <p>The 1963 Singapore General Elections was the toughest and most critical the PAP ever faced. It had already suffered two by-election defeats and the number of seats it held was 26 – holding a majority by just one seat.</p>
              <p>On 2 February 1963, just a few months before the elections, Operation Coldstore was launched and more than a hundred people were arrested and detained without trial, including the Secretary-General and other key members of the Barisan Sosialis, the PAP’s biggest threat.</p>
              <p>Despite the heavy blow, which was an obvious attempt to undermine the Barisan Sosialis’ success at the Elections, they won 33.2% of the popular vote and the PAP took 46.9%. What do you think the PAP would have gotten if it hadn’t carried out Operation Coldstore?</p>
              <p>And why do Singaporeans not know about such an important aspect of their national history?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Lim Chin Siong</span></p>
              <p>Lim Chin Siong was recruited into the PAP by Lee Kuan Yew in 1954, and his immense popularity amongst the Chinese won a large amount of support for the PAP. When Lim Chin Siong was arrested by the British in 1955 for anti-colonial activities, the PAP promised the electorate to release him if they were elected, in order to gain votes.</p>
              <p>At the age of 22, Lim Chin Siong was elected into the Legislative Assembly, and he was so popular among the people that Lee Kuan Yew was prompted to promise that he would be <strong>‘our future Prime Minister</strong>‘ (guess who became PM instead?).</p>
              <p>However, he soon grew disillusioned with the PAP and left to form the Barisan Sosialis in 1961. Under the pretext of being a communist, he was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">detained without trial</span> under Operation Coldstore for SIX YEARS until<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> he was forced to renounce politics and went into exile in 1969. Up till today, there is no evidence at all that he was ever a communist. It was simply used it as an excuse to eliminate him from the precarious 1963 General Elections. Imagine being removed from your family, being locked up for 6 years, NEVER given a trial, and then thrown out of the country, all because you are popular and the government fears you?</span></p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew himself said of him “<em>I liked and respected him for his simple lifestyle and his selflessness. He did not seek financial gain or political glory. He was totally committed to the advancement of his cause</em>“. This was the kind of men who sincerely fought with their lives for the good of the country. And they were persecuted and crushed by the PAP in order to snatch power. Contrast the lives of such men with the kind of PAP MPs we have today.</p>
              <p>[13th Dec '09 - Edit: Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Spectrum"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></a> to read about Operation Spectrum, launched in 1987 under that terrible ISA again. Over 20 people were detained without trial under the accusation of a Marxist conspiracy. After being released a few months later, they repudiated their earlier confessions, alleged ill-treatment by ISD officers while in detention, and were arrested <em>the very next day</em> (how come this sort of efficiency is lacking with <em>real</em> threats like Mas Selamat?). Ten days later, the government announced that a proposed commission of inquiry into the allegations made by the detainees was no longer necessary as the signatories have since recanted their statement while in detention. Hmm, I wonder why.</p>
              <p>Excerpt from their statement:</p>
              <p><em>"...we were subjected to harsh and intensive interrogation, deprived of sleep and rest, some of us for as long as 70 hours insides freezing cold rooms. All of us were stripped of our personal clothing, including spectacles, footwear and underwear and made to change into prisoners' uniforms.</em></p>
              <p><em>Most of us were made to stand continually during interrogation, some of us for over 20 hours and under the full blast of air-conditioning turned to a very low temperature.</em></p>
              <p><em>Under these conditions, one of us was repeatedly doused with cold water during interrogation.</em></p>
              <p><em>Most of us were hit hard in the face, some of us for not less than 50 times, while others were assaulted on other parts of the body, during the first three days of interrogation.</em></p>
              <p><em>We were threatened with more physical abuse during interrogation.</em></p>
              <p><em>We were threatened with arrests, assault and battery of our spouses, loved ones and friends. We were threatened with INDEFINITE detention without trial. Chia Thye Poh, who is still in detention after twenty years, was cited as an example. We were told that no one could help us unless we "cooperated" with the ISD.</em></p>
              <p><em>These threats were constantly on our minds during the time we wrote our respective "statements" in detention.</em></p>
              <p><em>We were actively discouraged from engaging legal counsel and advised to discharge our lawyers and against taking legal action (including making representations to the ISA Advisory Board) so as not to jeopardise our chances of release.</em></p>
              <p><em>We were compelled to appear on television and warned that our release would depend on our performances on tv. We were coerced to make statements such as "I am Marxist-inclined..."; "My ideal society is a classless society..." ; " so-and-so is my mentor..."; "I was made use of by so-and-so..." in order to incriminate ourselves and other detainees."</em></p>
              <p>This is another reason why I will not be able to vote for the PAP. I cannot bring myself to support such a brutal and callous government which treats its people as such. And I cannot support its continued use of the ISA in Singapore, in spite of its usefulness in handling terrorists (<em>who</em> is the real terrorist here?), because time and again, history has shown that it is innocent Singaporeans who will suffer most from such a law that allows the government to conveniently eliminate all threats to itself - not the nation - without trial, without evidence, without accountability of any kind.]</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. Singaporean students need to learn a fair and accurate history in school</span></p>
              <p>The fact that practically no young Singaporean knows about important people like Lim Chin Siong, or even David Marshall, our first Chief Minister, is testament to the spectacular failure of our education system. All they ever learn about our country’s history is LKY and Raffles, LKY and Raffles, LKY and Raffles, and maybe a bit about the War. No wonder our students find history boring. No wonder our students do not feel attached to this country because their knowledge of its history is so shallow.</p>
              <p>Why has MOE removed the important bits of Singapore’s history from schoolbooks? The bits about Operation Coldstore (and the realities behind it), the historic Anson by-election, the <em>real </em>founder of the PAP (who, by the way, is not surnamed Lee), our ex-President Devan Nair, Ong Teng Cheong’s request – which was never granted to the day he died – to be given a list of Singapore’s reserves (because as President he needed to know what he is protecting, since the President’s role is to be Protector of the Reserves – and did you know that the President’s role is that, by the way?), etc. Why are Singaporeans being robbed of their history and then accused of being apathetic?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. Traumatic MP-experiences and MPs who fear death by The Chair</span></span></p>
              <p>The kind of PAP MPs that Singapore is ruled by today is a worthy cause for <a href="http://blog.dk.sg/2009/05/20/online-letter-mp-had-no-empathy/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Trauma</span></a>.</p>
              <p>In short, a married couple went to see their MP because their eldest son recently passed away from a naval accident while serving NS. They explained that their younger son will be serving his NS soon and requested for an exemption because of what had just happened. They said that it’s been a traumatic time for them. And the MP replied “What traumatic? After two months, you won’t be traumatic”.</p>
              <p>As if insensitive MPs are not enough, the PAP is fielding <a href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2009/05/boy-arrested-for-slamming-chair-at-mp.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hyper-sensitive wimps</span></a> behind the shadows with their GRC Trick.</p>
              <p>The GRC, by the way, was invented by the PAP. The fact that it engages in gerrymandering (drawing up election borders in its favour) goes to show the extent it is willing to go just to stay in power. The GRC is also unfair because constituents are forced to vote into Parliament men and women they do not really want to have. This whole system, however, was implemented without asking Singaporeans, of course. The PAP decided it wanted to have the GRCs, and it passed the law to have the GRCs. No say from the people at all. Is this democracy? Is gerrymandering for the good of the people?</p>
              <p>With such people ruling the country, it is honestly difficult to believe we are in good hands. Contrasted against the lives of men such as Lim Chin Siong, it is hard to rule out the severe suspicion that the MPs we have today are joining the Government for personal interest, not the nation’s.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. Money. Of course it’s all about money.</span></p>
              <p>Singapore claims it pays its ministers astronomical salaries because “talents” need to be attracted from the private sector – this is simply saying that our ministers serve the country just for money.</p>
              <p>Also, their pay is pegged to GDP growth – which is why it is no wonder that everything in this country seems to be focused on the economy. The government is so caught up in money-making because its salaries are pegged to it! Moreover, if Singaporeans are attuned to the mentality that money is all there is to life (and many, many Singaporeans are), then they will be less bothered about the other compromises to their civil rights, and less likely to be concerned about what their government is really doing, so long as the money keeps flowing in. What a cheap people we have become.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. What Singapore needs is change</span></p>
              <p>Lastly, by voting for a significant change to the status quo, Singaporean youths will become less apathetic, seeing that, for the first time in their lives, CHANGE is really possible in this country, and that they can make a difference in deciding for the future of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP will also be less complacent if it meets with a stunning defeat. Its cold Point 8-type ministers will also learn that it is Singaporeans they are supposed to be serving, not themselves. They will learn to treasure their constituents, to <em>sincerely</em> listen their opinions and to <em>truly</em> help them – all these are SUPPOSED to be their job in the first place.</p>
              <p>People will also start to dare to join the Opposition. The only reason why I do not wish for the Opposition to take over the government is because it is incompetent, and it is incompetent because talented men and women who are concerned about the aforementioned issues, do not have the courage or faith in the system to step forward and join the Opposition (hell no, not with a law like the ISA in place). But if the PAP faces a defeat that is significant enough, trust in the democratic system of Singapore will finally be restored and the politics of Singapore can be revived to more than just dead rhetoric.</p>
              <p>Of course we are grateful for the many, many good things the PAP has done for Singapore. It has been an excellent government in many ways (especially economically – I wonder why). However, it has also been found lacking in many aspects. Politics is not a charity, as they would themselves say with regard to the Opposition, and we cannot vote for a government simply because it <em>used</em> to serve the people well. If it has lost its focus, then support for the Opposition is the only way to make them regain this focus.</p>
