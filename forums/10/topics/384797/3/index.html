              <p>Actually, this election, if I were the opposition, I would attack a PAP established stronghold.</p>
              <p>Toa Payoh, for eg.</p>
              <p>Just tell the residents, whatever can be done in terms of infrastructure, already done, upgrading all done, HDB hub already in Toa Payoh, therefore Toa Payoh is HDB's model estate</p>
              <p>Vote opposition in here, there will be minimal impact, less of what they can threaten you with, and ultimately, as all of you have seen in Hougang and Potong Pasir, upgrades still happen.</p>
              <p>And most importantly, remove Wong Kan Seng. He doesn't even dare to be accountable for Mas Selamat, how can he be a minister?</p>

              <p>Pinoy praised ease of PR application in Singapore</p>
              <p><span class="time">September 29, 2009</span></p>
              <p>A Filipino had lavished generous praise on Singapore for the ease of PR application.</p>
              <p>Writing on a pinoy forum, he described his personal experience of applying for Singapore PR.</p>
              <p>“Today, we completed the formalities for our <strong>Singapore Permanent Residence</strong> at the ICA building on Lavender St. We first had to go for an X-ray and blood exam to check for Tuberculosis and HIV.  We had the exam done at the Raffles Hospital near Bugis Station a few days before. That took us about half a day.</p>
              <p>Then the formalities stuff at the ICA today also took about half a day.  We didn’t even have the earliest appointment which was at 8:30.  Ours was at 9 am.</p>
              <p>The thing I like about Singapore is the efficiency. From the time we arrived at the Permanent Residence processing area, you take a queue number for the self service kiosk, then just wait for your number to be called.  Everything’s computerized and what’s best is that all the counters are manned!  So there’s really very little waiting time,” he wrote.</p>
              <p>There is a large number of Filipinos working in Singapore mostly as nurses, IT engineers and domestic maids. In recent years, they are found themselves in some jobs usually held by locals such as clinic assistants, tele-marketers and even counter staff at government agencies.</p>
              <p>The post sparked off an active discussion with queries from other Filipinos who are interested to work in Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Naveen </strong>asked:</p>
              <p>“Can you please let me know if Employment Pass is one of the pre requistie to complete PR formalities? If PR is approved but the applicant has lost job, left singapore, no longer holding valid employment pass, can he re-enter singapore on visit pass and complete the PR formalities?”</p>
              <p><strong>Ramonette</strong>, who is working in the Philipines enquired about getting a job in Singapore:</p>
              <p>“I’m currently working here in the philippines as a call center agent and im so much interested to work in Singapore with the same job I have right now, is it easy to look for a job there in singapore? What are the things i need in order to land a job there?</p>
              <p>Another netizen, <strong>Saleh</strong> added:</p>
              <p>“My LPR application has been granted and I was told to book an appointment with the eappointment system. Could you please let me know that on the average how many days it takes to book an appointment? I mean if I log on today to book an appointment what could be the earliest time (like 2 days, 7 days or more?) that I can get an appointment slot?”</p>
              <p>It appears that many Filipinos are keen to work in Singapore as the wages here are much higher than in their homeland.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, they are highly prized by Singapore employers for their English proficiency.</p>
              <p>According to statistics released by the National Population Secretariat, there are more than 70,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens in 2008. The number of non-residents had increased from 1.2 million to 1.35 million.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are becoming increasingly disgruntled at the rising number of foreigners coming to work and live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Instead of addressing their concerns, the government will be setting up at $10 million community fund to make the newcomers feel “welcomed” in Singapore.</p>

              <p>there are many reasons to question how foreigners determine how transparent a place is.</p>
              <p>that gambling biz tycoon said transparent.</p>
              <p>transparent, but why then so many questions raised by the book 'singapore F1 or F9'?</p>
              <p>This book is being sold at leading book stores on the island.</p>
              <p>the writer is NMP-calibre Mr Leong , a contributing , prolly part time, writer for TOC.</p>
              <p>my point is, there are many types of Transparency . If there are 10 types, and based on 1 type transparency, a person may only see a certain angle.</p>
              <p>so, why are there so many questions unanswered if the answers already out there in public domain?</p>

              <h1>Singapore’s GIC Suffers $41.6 Billion Loss</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">September 29, 2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>By Costas Paris from Wall Street Journal</strong></p>
              <p>Government of Singapore Investment Corp. suffered a loss around 59 billion Singapore dollars (US$41.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March, making it one of the worst years for the sovereign wealth fund since it was established in 1981, a person familiar with the situation said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>“The equities investments suffered the most, followed by falls in property valuations. It was one of the worst years ever,” the person told Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
              <p>The person said GIC’s portfolio now stands around S$265 billion.</p>
              <p>GIC is the world’s fourth largest sovereign fund in terms of money managed, according to Deutsche Bank, with high-profile investments in Western financial institutions like <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=C"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Citigroup</span></a> Inc. and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=UBS"><span style="color: #a91b33;">UBS</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the day, GIC said in its annual report that its portfolio lost more than 20% of its value in the last fiscal year.</p>
              <p>However, it said, the recent rebound in global stock markets has helped it recover more than half of the loss.</p>
              <p>The person said GIC’s property valuations are also recovering strongly.</p>
              <p>GIC said in the report that it had an annualized 5.7% return in U.S. dollar terms over the last 20 years from 7.8% a year earlier. Its nominal return over 20 years in Singapore dollar terms was 4.4% compared with 5.8% a year earlier.</p>
              <p>“Like many large institutional investors, GIC’s portfolio had been impacted in the severe global downturn of 2008,” said Tony Tan, GIC’s deputy chairman.</p>
              <p>GIC manages the city-state’s foreign exchange reserves.</p>
              <p>“By end-August 2009, global stock markets have recovered 48% from the lows of March 2009 even though they are still down 35% from their peak in October 2007,” GIC’s group chief investment officer Ng Kok Song said.</p>
              <p>GIC said it has confidence in the long-term prospects of Citigroup and UBS.</p>
              <p>It holds a 9% stake in UBS by way of preferred shares it bought in late 2007 for 11 billion Swiss francs ($11 billion).</p>
              <p>Last week, it said it cut its stake in Citigroup to below 5% from over 9% after it exchanged its convertible preferred stock in the bank to common stock. It made a profit of US$1.6 billion from the sale. GIC had invested US$6.88 billion in Citi in January 2008.</p>
              <p>“The UBS investment will take longer to recover. While both banks still face challenges in returning to profitability, we maintain our confidence in their long-term prospects,” Ng said.</p>
              <p>Ng said that in the short-term, less funds will be available for leveraged investments as lending institutions will face more onerous capital-adequacy requirements and asset securitization markets remain impaired.</p>
              <p>“Regulatory intervention is likely to dampen risk-taking. Investment vehicles such as hedge funds and private equity funds will be subject to greater disclosure of their activities,” he said.</p>
              <p>The executive also said governments and central banks may face pressure not to withdraw fiscal and monetary stimulus packages because of high unemployment levels.</p>
              <p>“These changes will present both opportunities and risks that will require GIC to adapt its investment strategy accordingly,” Ng said.</p>
              <p>He said economic growth will be higher in developing countries rather than developed economies.</p>
              <p>GIC said it cut its exposure to equities by more than 10% from July 2007 to September 2008, but has now increased its exposure in global stock markets to pre-crisis levels.</p>
              <p>The fund invested 38% of its portfolio in equities last year from 44% a year earlier, while exposure to fixed income such as bonds was 24% from 26%. About 30% of GIC’s portfolio is invested in real estate, private equity, venture capital and infrastructure assets, from 23% a year earlier.</p>
              <p>The fund increased its exposure to the Americas to 44% of its portfolio last year from 40%, while in Europe it cut its exposure to 29% from 35%. Asia accounted for 24% of its portfolio from 23% earlier.</p>
              <p>Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., Singapore’s second sovereign wealth fund, said its portfolio shrank to S$130 billion in the year to March from S$185 billion a year earlier due to losses in equities investments.</p>
              <p>It said that as of July, the portfolio stood at S$172 billion as a result of the recovery in global equities.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the year, people familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires that in calendar 2008, GIC had lost around S$50 billion. – WSJ</p>
