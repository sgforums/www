              </h1><h1 style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-large;">Malaysian doctor: Singapore should be grateful to Malaysians for its success</span></h1>
              <p><span class="time"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">December 6, 2009</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">A Malaysian doctor by the name of Chen Jiayi who had chosen to return to Malaysia after working for a number of years in Singapore wrote in the Malaysian Chinese newspaper Sin Chew yesterday that Singapore should be grateful to the Malaysians for its success today.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Dr Chen did not reveal the reason behind his return except that “the answer would be revealed in time to come.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">When he first came to work in a Singapore government hospital as a house officer, Dr Chen soon realized that he was working with many of compatriots, some of whom are his highest level superiors. Even the Singapore Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan was a former Malaysian citizen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the press that half the number of medical specialists at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital are Malaysians during his recent visit to Singapore to attend the APEC Summit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The exact number of Malaysians doctors working in Singapore is not known. About 5 to 10 per cent of the each year cohort of medical students are Malaysians.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">While some Malaysians graduated from NUS, others like Dr Chen join the Singapore public healthcare service after they finished their studies overseas when they are lured here to work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Dr Che was told by colleagues that Malaysian talents were the most sought after in Singapore and it not a surprise as due to cultural similarities between the two nations, Malaysians find it easiest to assimilate themselves into Singapore society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">During his years of working in Singapore, Dr Chen noticed that young Singapore doctors are encountering difficulties communicating with the older generation of patients due to language barriers.</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">“Due to their educational system, the younger generation of Singaporeans are proficient in English, mediocre only in Chinese. For Malay language, they are largely outsiders; as for Chinese dialects, that will have to depend on whether their gandpas and grannies are still around. </span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>As such, young Singaporean doctors face communciation problems when they encounter aged patients, resorting to hand language at times just to get their messages across,”</em> he wrote.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">As a result of a chronic shortage of doctors in the public sector, the Singapore Ministry of Health has turned elsewhere to recruit foreign doctors.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The polyclinics employ many doctors from other countries like the Philipines, Vietnam, India, Thailand and Indonesia, some of whom are unable to speak Chinese or Hokkien, the lingua franca of elderly Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Most Singapore doctors will leave the public sector upon the completion of their mandatory 5-year bond if they are local graduates unless they decide to specialize further.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The meagre pay, long working hours and job satisfaction are often commonly cited as reasons for their departure and yet little has been done to retain senior medical officers within the public sector over the years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Dr Chen ended his letter with a smug remark that Singaporeans should be grateful to the Malaysian (doctors):</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">“The more successful Singapore has become, the more I feel proud of my Malaysian compatriots who have crossed the Causeway to serve in the Lion City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">But sometimes I would have this perverted idea: You Singaporeans need to be grateful to us, the “Made in Malaysia” yet forsaken lot, for what you have achieved!”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">As a matter of fact, Dr Chen should be thankful to Singapore for giving him an opportunity to succeed in life. Had he not come to Singapore, he would have to serve his internship in a Malaysian hospital which is much busier before being packed off to a remote corner to serve a rural community for three years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">After working in Singapore for a number of years, Dr Chen will probably be able to retire in his homeland with little financial worries for the rest of his life like many of his compatriots who enjoy the best of both worlds by being a Singapore PR and Malaysian citizen at the same time.</span></p>

              <p><strong>By Chen Jiaqi from Sin Chew Daily</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>I met up with some old classmates several times since my university graduation, and discovered that over half of my Form V classmates had gone to study, work, or even settle down in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I knew many of the top talents from my school ended up in Singapore, but I was not aware that the number could be so big.</p>
              <p>Those secondary school classmates of mine were among the most brilliant in school, and Singapore was more than happy to bring these independent Chinese secondary school students there so that they could get the opportunity to advance their ambitions.</p>
              <p>Still on my internship at a government hospital here, I had a mixed bag of feelings, and to my own disbelief, I joined their rank several years later.</p>
              <p>Only a few days in Singapore, I was told by my superior that there were plenty of my compatriots around me.</p>
              <p>Indeed, beginning with my colleagues and looking upward level by level, I found that many of my highest level superiors were Malaysians.</p>
              <p>They were doing their work conscientiously and had contributed significantly towards the success of the tiny city-state.</p>
              <p>I suddenly had that feeling of pride that Singapore owed much of its success to the contributions made by Malaysian citizens.</p>
              <p>I was told by colleagues that Malaysian talents were the most sought after in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Due to cultural and geographical proximity, we are actually that group of foreigners who can best assimilate themselves into the Singapore society.</p>
              <p>This can’t be more true, as the two countries were forced apart by nothing but politics!</p>
              <p>Due to the nature of my job, I came to know many patients. Singapore is a multicultural, more so a multinational country. To these migrant workers, fundamental communication is never a problem: Chinese Malaysians are well versed in three languages plus an array of Chinese dialects.</p>
              <p>Not all Singaporean doctors have this linguistic gift! Due to their educational system, the younger generation of Singaporeans are proficient in English, mediocre only in Chinese. For Malay language, they are largely outsiders; as for Chinese dialects, that will have to depend on whether their gandpas and grannies are still around.</p>
              <p>As such, young Singaporean doctors face communciation problems when they encounter aged patients, resorting to hand language at times just to get their messages across.</p>
              <p>To Singapore, Malaysian talents are what they are most avid to tout for.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s meritocratic system knows no skin colours. But if it does, I could have bagged in more perks.</p>
              <p>I later decided to return to my country. Many have asked me why I wanted to come back to Malaysia, which is filthy, messy, hard to make a good living, and plagued with partial government policies.</p>
              <p>Why did I make such an unnatural decision? Perhaps the answer would be revealed in time to come, I was thinking.</p>
              <p>The more successful Singapore has become, the more I feel proud of my Malaysian compatriots who have crossed the Causeway to serve in the Lion City.</p>
              <p>But sometimes I would have this perverted idea: You Singaporeans need to be grateful to us, the “Made in Malaysia” yet forsaken lot, for what you have achieved! <em>(By Chen Jiaqi (reader)/Translated by DOMINIC LOH/Sin Chew Daily)</em></p>

Because, for most people, voting for you-know-who is really an irrational decision, motivated by some or all of the fears mentioned above. Of course, many will try to deny this and attempt to rationalise their stance, for e.g. "Sg has no credible oppo". Nice argument - especially when one of the main reasons there's no powerful oppo is because of persecution by the powers-that-be. So, these people "rationally" choose the party that strenuously and selfishly ensures they have no other real choice to vote for. Doesn't sound quite so rational now, does it?<br><br>So, "cool down" and wait another day to make a truly rational decision. I won't presume to tell you what that should be, but in my mind, I know what's rational and what's simply FEAR cloaked in desperate denial.<br></div>

              <p>The <strong>Shimabara Rebellion</strong> was an uprising of Japanese peasants, many of them Christians, during the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1637-1638.</p>
              <p>Rebellion broke out on (according to western calendar) December 17, 1637 when peasants rose against their daimyo Matsukura Shigeharu. Christians like to emphasize the fact that most rebels were Japanese converted to Christianity but the other prominent reason for the revolt was the very heavy tax burden. Rebels took the mantle of Christianity later.</p>
              <p>Rebels included maybe up to 23.000 peasants and ronin, including many women, in Shimabara and nearby Amakusa Islands under the leadership of Masuda Shiro who used a Christian name <em>Jerome</em>. Both areas had been under heavy Jesuit missionary activity during the previous Christian daimyo Konishi Yukinaga.</p>
              <p>Terazawa Hirotaka, governor of the Nagasaki, dispatched an army of 3,000 samurai to Amakusa but rebels defeated them on December 27, 1637 with 2,800 casualties. Survivors retreated to Nagasaki and governor asked shogunate for reinforcements. However, in battle on January 3, 1638 shogunate warriors defeated the rebels who lost about 1,000. They retreated to Shimabara.</p>
              <p>In Shimabara, rebels besieged Shimabara castle and took over the fortress at Hara.</p>
              <p>Hirotaka had already left for Shimabara on January 2 with 500 samurai and gathered 800 more from Omura. They made camp half a mile from Shimabara castle. They commenced artillery fire from cannons commandeered from Japanese and Chinese vessels. They then requested aid from a Dutch merchant vessel to bombard the Hara fort from the sea. Rebels shot two Dutch lookouts and the ship withdrew.</p>
              <p>Shogunate troops arrived but rebels in Hara fortress resisted siege for months and caused them heavy losses. Both sides had a hard time fighting in winter conditions. On February 3, 1638, a rebel raid killed 2,000 warriors from Hizen including their daimyo. However, they slowly ran out of food, ammunition and other provisions.</p>
              <p>On March 10, shogunate forces begun to gather in Shimabara and by April there were 30,000 rebels facing 200,000 shogunate soldiers. Desperate rebels mounted an assault against them on April 4 and were forced to withdraw. Captured survivors revealed the fortress was out of food and gunpowder.</p>
              <p>On April 12, 1638, Hizen warriors stormed the fortress and captured the outer defenses. Rebels held out and caused heavy casualties until they were routed on April 15. The Shogunate had lost about 10,000 soldiers.</p>
              <p>Afterwards, the shogunate forces beheaded an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers. Masuda Shiro's head was taken to Nagasaki and Hara fortress was destroyed. The Shogunate banned Christianity and the remaining Japanese Christians had to go underground. The Shogunate suspected that western Catholics had been involved in spreading the rebellion and Portuguese traders were driven out of the country.</p>

Some asked for their freedom. They often got what they asked for: the lords of the manors were desperate for people to farm their land and tend their animals. Then, in 1351, King Edward III summoned parliament to pass the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Statute of Labourers" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Statute_of_Labourers"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Statute of Labourers</span></span></a>. The Statute attempted to curb the demands for better terms of employment by pegging wages to pre-plague levels and restricting the mobility of labour; however the probable effect was that labourers employed by lords were effectively exempted, while labourers working for other employers, both artisans and more substantial peasants, were liable to be fined or held in the stocks. The enforcement of the new law angered the peasants greatly and formed another reason for the revolt.</p>

This they duly did, but the King broke his promise. The nobles quickly re-established their control with the help of a hastily organised militia of 7000, and most of the other leaders were pursued, captured and executed, including John Ball and Jack Straw, who was beheaded.

              <p>Despite its name, participation in the Peasants' Revolt was not confined to serfs or even to the lower classes. The peasants received help from members of the noble classes - one example being William Tonge, a substantial alderman, who opened the London city gate through which the masses streamed on the night of June 12.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> Although the most significant events took place in the capital, there were violent encounters throughout England. Those involved hastened to dissociate themselves in the months that followed.</p>
              <p>Although the Revolt did not succeed in its stated aims, it did succeed in showing the nobles that the peasants were dissatisfied and that they were capable of wreaking havoc. In the longer term, the Revolt helped to form a radical tradition in British politics (a development explained by Christopher Hampton, see further reading). After the revolt, the term 'poll tax' was no longer used, although English governments continued to collect broadly similar taxes until the 17th century. The <a title="Community Charge" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Community_Charge"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Community Charge</span></span></a>, introduced 600 years after the peasants revolt, was popularly known as the poll tax (particularly by its opponents).</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medieval England</span> experienced few revolts but the most serious was the Peasants' Revolt which took place in June 1381. A violent system of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">punishments</span> for offenders was usually enough to put off <span style="text-decoration: underline;">peasants</span> from causing trouble. Most areas in England also had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">castles</span> in which soldiers were garrisoned, and these were usually enough to guarantee reasonable behaviour among <span style="text-decoration: underline;">medieval peasants</span>.</p>
              <p>An army of peasants from Kent and Essex marched on London. They did something no-one had done before or since - they captured the Tower of London. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the King's Treasurer were killed. The king, <strong>Richard II</strong>, was only 14 at the time but despite his youth, he agreed to meet the peasants at a place called Mile End.</p>
              <p>What were the peasants angry about and why had they come to London ?</p>
              <p><strong>1</strong>. After the Black Death, many manors were left short of workers. To encourage those who had survived to stay on their manor, many lords had given the peasants on their estates their freedom and paid them to work on their land. Now, nearly 35 years after the Black Death, many peasants feared that the lords would take back these privileges and they were prepared to fight for them.</p>
              <p><strong>2</strong>. Many peasants had to work for free on church land, sometimes up to two days in the week. This meant that they could not work on their own land which made it difficult to grow enough food for their families. Peasants wanted to be free of this burden that made the church rich but them poor. They were supported in what they wanted by a priest called <strong>John Ball</strong> from Kent.</p>
              <p><strong>3</strong>. There had been a long war with France. Wars cost money and that money usually came from the peasants through the taxes that they paid. In 1380, Richard II introduced a new tax called the Poll Tax. This made everyone who was on the tax register pay 5p. It was the third time in four years that such a tax had been used. By 1381, the peasants had had enough. 5p to them was a great deal of money. If they could not pay in cash, they could pay in kind, such as seeds, tools etc., anything that could be vital to survival in the coming year.</p>
              <p>In May 1381, a tax collector arrived at the Essex village of Fobbing to find out why the people there had not paid their poll tax. He was thrown out by the villagers. In June, soldiers arrived to establish law and order. They too were thrown out as the villagers of Fobbing had now organised themselves and many other local villages in Essex had joined them. After doing this, the villagers marched on London to plead with the young king to hear their complaints.</p>
              <p>One man had emerged as the leader of the peasants - <strong>Wat Tyler</strong> from Kent. As the peasants from Kent had marched to London, they had destroyed tax records and tax registers. The buildings which housed government records were burned down. They got into the city of London because the people there had opened the gates to them.</p>
              <p>By mid-June the discipline of the peasants was starting to go. Many got drunk in London and looting took place. It is known that foreigners were murdered by the peasants. Wat Tyler had asked for discipline amongst those who looked up to him as their leader. He did not get it.</p>
              <p>On <strong>June 14th</strong>, the king met the rebels at Mile End. At this meeting, Richard II gave the peasants all that they asked for and asked that they go home in peace. Some did. Others returned to the city and murdered the archbishop and Treasurer - their heads were cut off on Tower Hill by the Tower of London. Richard II spent the night in hiding in fear of his life.</p>
              <p>On <strong>June 15th</strong>, he met the rebels again at Smithfield outside of the city's walls. It is said that this was the idea of the Lord Mayor (Sir William Walworthe) who wanted to get the rebels out of the city. Medieval London was wooden and the streets were cramped. Any attempt to put down the rebels in the city could have ended in a fire or the rebels would have found it easy to vanish into the city once they knew that soldiers were after them.</p>
              <p>At this meeting, the Lord Mayor killed Wat Tyler. We are not sure what happened at this meeting as the only people who could write about it were on the side of the king and their evidence might not be accurate. The death of Tyler and another promise by Richard to give the peasants what they asked for, was enough to send them home <br style="clear: left; display: block;"></p>

              <p>The last great peasant revolt to challenge autocratic rule in Russia occurred during the reign of Catherine the Great. Between 1773 and 1774, Emelian Pugachev, a Don Cossack freebooter, rallied thousands of disaffected peasants by proclaiming himself Tsar Peter III, who had been deposed in 1762 and died shortly thereafter. Although there had been many uprisings in the region and numerous pretenders, the Pugachev Revolt was by far the greatest threat to Catherine’s rule.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, as General Bibikov told the aristocracy of Kazan, “This is a revolt of the poor against the rich, of the slaves against their masters.” [1] Yet the causes were many and have been interpreted differently by Russian, Soviet, and Western Historians. [2] Generally, the causes can be broken down as follows:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Loss of autonomy by the indigenous groups in the Urals. </li>
              <li>Forced conscription of local peasants to fight against the Turks. </li>
              <li>Use of serf labor in the newly created factories and mines. </li>
              <li>Seizure of lands by the state. </li>
              <li>Heavy taxation. </li>
              <li>Expanded state intrusion into local customs, practices, and beliefs. </li>
              <li>The role of “Old Believers” that rejected official Orthodoxy.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 class="dynamic">Initial Successes of the Revolt</h3>
              <p>Pugachev was a messianic figure, capitalizing on the popular notion that Peter III was viewed as still being alive by the peasants. Pretenderism had always been a spark in sporadic peasant revolts. Pugachev was a courageous leader with some military skills, having served in the Seven Years’ War. The capture of several garrisons and the rallying of thousands of supporters attested to his leadership.</p>
              <p>Catherine herself contributed to the rebellion’s early victories by not taking Pugachev seriously, equating the revolt with the many prior disturbances that had been swiftly quelled by her troops. The resurrection of Peter III in the guise of a brigand was troubling, however, and reminded Catherine that she had seized power in 1762 through a coup.</p>
              <h3 class="dynamic">Pugachev Defeated by Catherine’s Armies</h3>
              <p>After a series of successes on his way to Moscow at the head of the peasant army, Pugachev was turned back following the partial destruction of Kazan. Bringing death and destruction to the gentry in the Volga region, Pugachev pursued a course that would take him to home territory. Count Panin, commissioned by Catherine to end the insurrection, rushed fresh troops to the region. The Turkish War had been concluded and now Pugachev was facing veteran forces.</p>

              <p>Adding to Pugachev’s problems, a famine swept the region, depriving his motley army of necessary supplies. In August 1774, he fought his last battle against troops commanded by Ivan Mikhelson, an exceptional officer who repulsed a direct charge and counterattacked, totally destroying Pugachev’s army. The battle at Cherny Yar was decisive.</p>
              <p>Although he escaped, Pugachev was betrayed by fellow Cossacks and carried to Moscow in a cage where he was tortured and executed. Rather than addressing reforms, serfdom was strengthened and state control became more onerous. Historians researching 19th Century Russian radicalism have linked the efforts of revolutionaries with memories of the Pugachev revolt, believing that the peasantry represented the vanguard of revolution. [3]</p>
              <p>Paul Avrich cites early Bolshevik thoughts regarding the use of the peasant class in achieving revolution and highlights the distinct peasant notions of a “tsar” that would emancipate them and act on their behalf. But the Pugachev revolt would be the last great upheaval until the twentieth century when the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 weakened and ultimately ended autocracy.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="entrybody">
              
              <p><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ywxj-aPPC9M/RzE_DEbfoBI/AAAAAAAAAMc/XXhHR8BvTSY/s1600-h/Serfdom+Middle+Ages.jpg"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #151515; font-family: Century Gothic;"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ywxj-aPPC9M/RzE_DEbfoBI/AAAAAAAAAMc/XXhHR8BvTSY/s400/Serfdom+Middle+Ages.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><br>According to some historians, during the thousand year long Middle Ages in Europe there was on average one peasant revolt per year. All of them failed.</p>
              <p>There are several reasons for the failure of the peasantry to successfully revolt against the elites of the Middle Ages, but I’ll mention only one reason to illustrate the difficulty the peasants faced. Before the advent of the hand-held firearm, it required <span style="font-style: italic;">years</span> of training to produce someone highly competent in the best weapons of the Middle Ages. Most peasants didn’t train in those weapons, and as a consequence, were usually over-matched when they revolted. Sickles against lances, hammers against swords.</p>
              <p>But why did the peasants so frequently revolt in the first place? The most usual reason seems to have been famine. During most of the middle ages, transportation was so poor that it was almost unheard of to ship food in bulk for any distance. So, if the crops failed in one locality, that locality could experience famine even though there might be a surplus of food a mere 30 miles away. When famine struck a locality, the elites had custom, law and force all on their side — they got what food there was, despite that the peasants produced the food. That left the peasants starving and prone to revolt.</p>
              <p>Broadly speaking, at least three things came together to end the thousand year landscape of the Middle Ages. The first was the rise of capitalism, which can be traced back to very early beginnings around 900 A.D. The second was the British Agricultural Revolution — a remarkable increase in agricultural productivity — that can be traced back to around 1500 A.D. And the third was the Industrial Revolution, which began around 1700 A.D.</p>
              <p>Those three factors, working together, created Europe’s most successful peasant revolt. For, while all the revolts of the Middle Ages failed, capitalism, the British Agricultural Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution eventually brought not only wealth and long lifespans to the peasantry, but arguably contributed to their political liberation.</p>
              <p>It seems odd to me that nowadays so many of us have come to resent those three developments. We see the many serious problems they have created and we sometimes imagine it would be a good thing if we were rid of capitalism, industrialization, and even large scale agriculture. Yet, to get rid of those things would surely plunge us back into an age when most people lived a short life of scarcity and want. So, I think the real problem is not to get rid of the very things that have lifted societies out of poverty, but to “update” them. We do not need, for instance, to abolish capitalism so much as we need a newer, more useful version of it with the most pressing bugs worked out.</p>
              <p>A final consideration here is my gripe against ideologies. Not just any ideology, but all ideologies suffer from the fact they are either impossible or cumbersome to change. The world moves on, but the world’s ideologies merely turn into retarded and retarding dogmas. I have never met an ideology that didn’t turn to stone all it touched. If a software company were ever to adopt an ideology of software, you can bet they would go out of business — because they would never update their product in any meaningful or useful way. Version 2.0 would have the same bugs as version 1.0 — and only the marketing department would say it was better than 1.0. If we are ever so unwise as to leave the future of capitalism, the agricultural and industrial revolutions entirely to ideologists, we will surely get the disasters we deserve for our folly.</p>
              <p>After all, it wasn’t Christianity, the ideology of the day, that brought about Europe’s most successful peasant revolt. Nor should we expect the ideologies of our day to bring about a successful social and economic future for humanity.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title">New reason for FTs : S'poreans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving</h3>
              <div class="post-body">
              <p> </p>
              <div><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become <strong>less hard-driving and hard-striving</strong>. <strong>This is why</strong> it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants" </em></div>
              <div><em>- MM Lee, National Geographic, The Singapore Solution, Jan 2010[<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em>.</em></div>
              <div>Gee, we were told they were here to create jobs for Singaporeans[<a href="http://www.singaporejobsmarket.com/forum/news/1431-foreign-workers-help-create-jobs-singaporeans.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>] and we should be thankful. Then we were told they were here because of the low fertility rate. Long time ago we were told they were needed for skills that didn't exist in Singapore. We were also told they are here for jobs Singaporeans did not want.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>Now we are told they are here because Singaporeans are now too lazy for Singapore Inc. Yes, years of good life and pampering by the PAP govt has turned us into softies unable to compete in this globalised economy. Strange isn't it? If these hardworking and hard striving Chinese immigrants are so productive why has our productivity fallen as their numbers rise?</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>To the elitist PAP govt, the ordinary Singaporean is never good enough. The 70 yr old who has to clean tables at the Bedok Hawker Center for a living does not strive hard enough. The mother with 2 disabled kids did not strive hard enough to look for a job to support her family. The Singapore workforce ranked no. 1 for over a decade was not hard driving enough for the PAP. Only people who does any real work in Singapore is the PAP govt that is why their ministers deserve to make in one day what some of the workers earn in a year.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div><em>" If native Singaporeans are falling behind because "<strong>the spurs are not stuck into the hide</strong>,"<strong> that is their problem</strong>" - MM Lee</em></div>
              <div><em>.</em></div>
              <div>This explains why the blame is always put on Singaporeans for almost every problem faced by our society. You find it hard to afford a HDB flat - that is because you didn't strive hard enough. You struggle to raise your family, pay the ever-increasing bills for electricity &amp; transport and find it hard to cope with the unstable job market - you didn't strive hard enough.</div>
              <div>You recall what Wee Shu Min once said:</div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
              <div><em>"i should think not. dear derek is one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world. one of those who would prefer to be unemployed and wax lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for the foreigner's, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a sales assistant. it's not even about being a road sweeper. these shitbags don't want anything without "manager" and a name card.<br>please, get out of my elite uncaring face."</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>....</em>and her father is president of the defense business section ST Engineering which is fed mainly by our defense budget i.e. taxpayer's money. The PAP elites likes to talk about the ordinary Singaporeans not working hard enough and not being able to compete. However, the PAP itself shuns competition preferring to tweak the laws to retain their monopolistic powers. The PAP men like to work in state own monopolies for ridiculously high salaries and from their ivory towers command the ordinary Singaporean to be cheaper, better and faster. We take the overcrowded buses and MRT so that their transport companies can make money, we live in small overpriced public housing (the most expensive in the world), we pay the 2nd highest electricity tariffs in the world and we pay the highest salaries in the world for those PAP ministers...if there is one reason Singapore is not competitive it is because there are leeches sucking the blood of ordinary Singaporeans.</div>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A few thousand new citizens and PRs celebrate the New Year together with Singaporeans at a countdown party at Labrador Park organized jointly by the Radin Mas Citizens Consultative Committee from Tanjong Pagar GRC and Chinese paper Lianhe Zaobao.</p>
              <p>Though the event is opened to Singaporeans as well, it is obvious who the “guests of honor” are judging from the extra efforts put in by the organizers to publicize the party to new citizens and PRs by contacting formal and informal immigrant organisations in the Cambodian, Filipino, Vietnamese and Indian communities, among others.</p>
              <p>The party is supported by the National Integration Council. It is not known if the $10-million Community Integration Fund will be tapped for the event.</p>
              <p>The fund was unveiled a few months ago by Minister of Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan to make the new citizens feel “welcomed” in Singapore due to rising social tension on the ground.</p>
              <p>From the responses given by the new citizens and PRs, it appeared that their efforts have paid off.</p>
              <p>One Indian PR interviewed by the Chinese paper Lianhe Wanbao said she enjoyed the “splendid” evening thoroughly with her family. Another felt it was a good opportunity to “mingle” with the locals.</p>
              <p>The exact number of new citizens and PRs who attended the event, which is free of charge is not known.</p>
              <p>As a result of the ruling party’s liberal immigration policy, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing percentage are new citizens.</p>
              <p>Besides Labrador Park, parties are held in Sentosa, Marina Barrage, the Esplanade and Sembawang to welcome the New Year.</p>
              <p>The next decade will probably see more radical changes to Singapore’s demographics as the ruling party aims to increase its population to 6.5 million people eventually via immigration.</p>
              <p>In his New Year Day’s message to Singaporeans, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reiterated the importance of foreigners to Singapore though Singaporeans will remain a “top priority” to his government.</p>
              <p>He did not elaborate more on what measures the ruling party will take to ensure that Singaporeans do not fall behind the new comers.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic, PM Lee’s father the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew continues to support the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies though he is aware that many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants.</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>The state media later “clarified” on Lee’s behalf that he meant that he was “concerned” Singaporeans will “lose out” if they do not work harder in the face of more new immigrants flooding Singapore, but the damage has already been done.</p>
              <p>Lee’s remarks in the National Geographic magazine’s article – “The Singapore Solution” were circulated widely in Singapore’s blogosphere, attracting much derision and opprobrium from netizens.</p>
              <p>A Facebook set up to call on him to apologize to Singaporeans has drawn more than 200 members so far.</p>

              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>The recent move by the Ministry of Education to give an additional ballot to Singapore citizens in application for primary school places has won it much public approval and support.</p>
              <p>In the past, PRs are able to compete directly with Singapore citizens for place via the Phase 1C scheme which has caused  alot of resentment and anger on the ground.</p>
              <p>The state media is quick to praise the government for making a clearer distinction between citizens and PRs without asking the fundamental question on why PRs are allowed to compete with citizens for coveted places in schools in the first place.</p>
              <p>The additional ballot only gives Singaporeans a higher chance of getting into a school of their choice, but is likely to be diluted with the increasing number of PRs and new citizens.</p>
              <p>So long as the government’s underlying liberal immigration policy remains unchanged, Singaporeans will forever have to fight with these newcomers for school places.</p>
              <p>According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are over 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens last year. Given that there are few good schools to go around, the demand is going to far exceed the supply soon.</p>
              <p>To the Singaporean who has to compete with more and more PRs, an extra ballot is nothing more than scant consolation. If one still fail to ballot for a place, then one has to blame providence and not the government.</p>
              <p>All primary schools are funded directly by taxpayers under the Ministry of Education. Since they are public institutions, their doors should be opened only to Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>The Minister of Education is an elected official. He should take care of the interests of the voters first and not PRs who do not have a stake in the country.</p>
              <p>PRs can be allocated left-over places only after Singaporeans have made their pick. The best schools such as Raffles Girls Primary School, Nanyang Primary and Roseyth Primary should be reserved solely for citizens.</p>
              <p>The children of PRs may not be settling down in Singapore after all. They may pack their bags and return to their homelands or study overseas when they reach 18 years of age. They should not deprive locals of chances to pursue a quality education in a school of their choice.</p>
              <p>Besides, there are international schools which can cater to the needs of the PRs and they provide an education on par with Singapore schools.</p>
              <p>Granted that PRs pay taxes as well, but they should not forget that they are here for economic opportunities in the first place and they should be thankful that Singapore is generous enough to accept them.</p>
              <p>If they truly want their children to enjoy a first world education in Singapore, then they must be prepared to take up Singapore citizenship and sink their roots down here.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the new rule should be applied to differentiate between old and new citizens as suggested earlier by a writer to the Straits Times Forum.</p>
              <p>Singapore men has to sacrifice two most productive years of their lives to serve the nation where they are exposed to all sorts of risks and dangers.</p>
              <p>Upon the completion of National Service, they still have a 13-year reservist obligation to fulfil. Surely it is not too much to ask the state to grant preferential treatment to their children?</p>
              <p>The new immigrants who flock to Singapore are enjoying the fruits of our National Servicemen without having to pay the price. As such, their children should not be entitled to the same rights and privileges as NSmen.</p>
              <p>NSmen are given an income tax exemption of $3,000 in recognition of their contributions to the nation. Why not extend this to primary school application as well?</p>
              <p>The superficial changes introduced by MOE are hardly enough to make a “clearer distinction” between citizens and PRs which should be made not only more acute but extended to differentiate between old and new citizens as well.</p>
              <p>Singapore citizens should not be competing with PRs for primary school places at all which is hardly heard of in the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>We propose that MOE make the following changes to better reflect the contributions of NSmen and Singapore citizens:</p>
              <p>1. Two ballots for citizens whose fathers have served National Service.</p>
              <p>2. One ballot for citizens who fathers did not serve National Service.</p>
              <p>3. PRs are only allowed to ballot only for left-over places in selected neighborhood primary schools after Singaporeans have taken their pick.</p>
              <p>Not only will it appease rising disaffection and angst on the ground among citizens that they have been unfairly treated by the government, it will also give PRs more incentive to take up Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP government has never failed to emphasize on the “fact” that “Singapore’s politics are reserved for Singaporeans only” as outsiders do not have a stake in the country to deter foreigners from “interfering” in local politics.</p>
              <p>Foreign journalists often have their work permits canceled without warning like in the recent case of Daily Telegraph journalist Benjamin Bland or banned from entering Singapore altogether like the Chief Editor of Asia Sentinel John Berthelsen who was once “deported” unceremoniously by the police upon his arrival at Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are required to apply for a police permit even when speaking indoors and they are almost always not given when the topic touches on local politics. For example, a Swedish human rights activist’s permit to hold a workshop for SDP members was rejected with no reasons given.</p>
              <p>Being a non-partisan public institution, one would expect the Singapore police to apply the law equally to all political parties, but this is not often the case.</p>
              <p>Not too long ago, Chinese Daily Lianhe Wanbao hosted a public forum which saw a famous Taiwanese orator heaping generous praises on PAP leaders though the topic of discussion was supposed to be on China’s development in the future.</p>
              <p>Since foreigners are not allowed to “interfere” in Singapore politics, then one should expect PRs to fall within the ambit of the unwritten rule as well.</p>
              <p>However, PRs are often given ample space in the Straits Times Forum to voice their support for the PAP government, the latest being a Pakistani Sam Ahmed who wrote a letter urging Singaporeans to be “more appreciative” of their own country.</p>
              <p>It is strange that letters critical of the PAP are almost always censored while those few lauding it are published to sway public opinion to its side.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times should have rejected these fawning letters to curry favor with the ruling party on the ground that they are “interfering” in domestic politics which are for Singapore citizens only.</p>
              <p>With the PAP giving Singapore citizenships freely to foreigners, these new citizens will form an increasingly influential voting bloc in the future, but are they ready to partake in the political life of Singapore?</p>
              <p>As many of them came to Singapore in the prime of their lives without ever serving National Service, life here is a bed of roses for them especially if they come from developing countries like India and China.</p>
              <p>A new citizen from India and YPAP member Mr Fredric Fanthome wrote an article for Contact Singapore in which he expressed his admiration for Singapore’s “efficiency” – “everything works here!,” he wrote.</p>
              <p>Mr Fanthome holds a senior position in a local SME. Armed with a decent-paying job and saved from the hassle of National Service obligations, it is little wonder that Mr Fanthome is so infatuated with the PAP.</p>
              <p>However for a Singapore man growing up in Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s, it is a different story altogether.</p>
              <p>During his younger days, he witnessed his parents being able to afford a HDB flat relatively easily, but when it comes to his time, he has problems servicing the hefty mortgage loan as a result of sky-rocketing prices in the last few months.</p>
              <p>He has to compete with an increasing number of foreigners like Mr Fanthome who are lured to Singapore by jobs which offer higher pay than their homelands.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, he has the mandatory 4 week reservist obligation to fulfill annually when the newcomers have none. It is only natural that the Singaporean will feel bitter and angry towards the PAP government.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, such genuine grouses on the ground are incomprehensible to the new citizens who are courted by the PAP actively from the very beginning to rope them into grassroots organizations and the party itself to shore up its support base.</p>
              <p>Mr Fanthome can therefore be forgiven for dismissing online critics of the PAP as “anonymous hordes which spray venom at the government” for not being born and bred in Singapore as his perception of the PAP is somewhat colored and skewed by the propaganda churned out by the state media daily.</p>
              <p>As the new citizens have a limited understanding of Singapore politics, can we really trust them to make an informed decision during the elections?</p>
              <p>It is only natural to expect new citizens to vote for the ruling party which gives them the opportunity to start life afresh in Singapore in the first place.</p>
              <p>Since their support for the PAP is based largely on gratitude, they may be ignorant of the more important issues at stake such as the direction the nation is heading in the future.</p>
              <p>Many of them also appear not to be aware of the lack of accountability and transparency in Singapore’s political system which allows one dominant party to ride roughshod over all other political parties, state institutions and the people.</p>
              <p>It may take some time before new citizens come to the same conclusion as the locals – that they are not getting a fair deal from the ruling party and by then it will be too late.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. The percentage of new citizens is unknown, but is likely to be on an upward trend.</p>
              <p>In a small country like Singapore, a sizable number of new citizens in the electorate will have a significant impact on the outcome of the election.</p>
              <p>There are two ways to counter the unfair advantage enjoyed by the incumbent as a result of the rising number of new citizens:</p>
              <p>1. New citizens are not permitted to vote within the first five years of their residency in Singapore to give them ample time to familiarize themselves with the political situation in the country so as to help them to make a calm and rational decision.</p>
              <p>2. Old citizens are given one additional vote to give them more say in the running of their nation, especially those who have spent the two most precious years of their lives serving the nation.</p>
              <p>Of course it is impossible to expect the PAP to do anything which will hurt their interest when the massive immigration we are seeing now is part of its grand design to perpetuate its political hegemony forever whether we like it or not.</p>
              <p>The only way out for locals is to stand up and be counted at the next general election and vote for sufficient opposition MPs into parliament to deny the PAP’s its traditional two-thirds majority.</p>
              <p>Only then can we put a brake to its runaway liberal immigration policy to replace locals with their new pets from China, India and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Singapore politics should be reserved strictly for citizens born and bred in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Even among citizens, a clearer distinction must be drawn between old and new citizens to acknowledge the sacrifices the former have made to the nation.</p>

              getting into a school of their choice, but is likely to be diluted
              with the increasing number of PRs and new citizens.</p>
              <p>So long as the government’s underlying liberal immigration
              policy remains unchanged, Singaporeans will forever have to fight
              with these newcomers for school places.</p>
              <p>According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are over 90,000
              PRs and 20,000 new citizens last year. Given that there are few
              good schools to go around, the demand is going to far exceed the
              supply soon.</p>
              <p>To the Singaporean who has to compete with more and more PRs, an
              extra ballot is nothing more than scant consolation. If one still
              fail to ballot for a place, then one has to blame providence and
              not the government.</p>
              <p>All primary schools are funded directly by taxpayers under the
              Ministry of Education. Since they are public institutions, their
              doors should be opened only to Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>The Minister of Education is an elected official. He should take
              care of the interests of the voters first and not PRs who do
              not have a stake in the country.</p>
              <p>PRs can be allocated left-over places only after Singaporeans
              have made their pick. The best schools such as Raffles Girls
              Primary School, Nanyang Primary and Roseyth Primary should be
              reserved solely for citizens.</p>
              <p>The children of PRs may not be settling down in Singapore after
              all. They may pack their bags and return to their homelands or
              study overseas when they reach 18 years of age. They should not
              deprive locals of chances to pursue a quality education in a school
              of their choice.</p>
              <p>Besides, there are international schools which can cater to the
              needs of the PRs and they provide an education on par with
              Singapore schools.</p>
              <p>Granted that PRs pay taxes as well, but they should not forget
              that they are here for economic opportunities in the first place
              and they should be thankful that Singapore is generous enough to
              accept them.</p>
              <p>If they truly want their children to enjoy a first world
              education in Singapore, then they must be prepared to take up
              Singapore citizenship and sink their roots down here.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the new rule should be applied to differentiate between
              old and new citizens as suggested earlier by a writer to the
              Straits Times Forum.</p>
              <p>Singapore men has to sacrifice two most productive years of
              their lives to serve the nation where they are exposed to all sorts
              of risks and dangers.</p>
              <p>Upon the completion of National Service, they still have a
              13-year reservist obligation to fulfil. Surely it is not too much
              to ask the state to grant preferential treatment to their
              children?</p>
              <p>The new immigrants who flock to Singapore are enjoying the
              fruits of our National Servicemen without having to
              pay the price. As such, their children should not be entitled
              to the same rights and privileges as NSmen.</p>
              <p>NSmen are given an income tax exemption of $3,000 in recognition
              of their contributions to the nation. Why not extend this to
              primary school application as well?</p>
              <p>The superficial changes introduced by MOE are hardly enough to
              make a “clearer distinction” between citizens and PRs which should
              be made not only more acute but extended to differentiate between
              old and new citizens as well.</p>
              <p>Singapore citizens should not be competing with PRs for primary
              school places at all which is hardly heard of in the rest of the
              world.</p>
              <p>We propose that MOE make the following changes to better reflect
              the contributions of NSmen and Singapore citizens:</p>
              <p>1. Two ballots for citizens whose fathers have served National
              Service.</p>
              <p>2. One ballot for citizens who fathers did not serve
              National Service.</p>
              <p>3. PRs are only allowed to ballot only for left-over places
              in selected neighborhood primary schools after Singaporeans
              have taken their pick.</p>
              <p>Not only will it appease rising disaffection and angst on the
              ground among citizens that they have been unfairly treated by the
              government, it will also give PRs more incentive to take up
              Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A few thousand new citizens and PRs celebrate the New Year together with Singaporeans at a countdown party at Labrador Park organized jointly by the Radin Mas Citizens Consultative Committee from Tanjong Pagar GRC and Chinese paper Lianhe Zaobao.</p>
              <p>Though the event is opened to Singaporeans as well, it is obvious who the “guests of honor” are judging from the extra efforts put in by the organizers to publicize the party to new citizens and PRs by contacting formal and informal immigrant organisations in the Cambodian, Filipino, Vietnamese and Indian communities, among others.</p>
              <p>The party is supported by the National Integration Council. It is not known if the $10-million Community Integration Fund will be tapped for the event.</p>
              <p>The fund was unveiled a few months ago by Minister of Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan to make the new citizens feel “welcomed” in Singapore due to rising social tension on the ground.</p>
              <p>From the responses given by the new citizens and PRs, it appeared that their efforts have paid off.</p>
              <p>One Indian PR interviewed by the Chinese paper Lianhe Wanbao said she enjoyed the “splendid” evening thoroughly with her family. Another felt it was a good opportunity to “mingle” with the locals.</p>
              <p>The exact number of new citizens and PRs who attended the event, which is free of charge is not known.</p>
              <p>As a result of the ruling party’s liberal immigration policy, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing percentage are new citizens.</p>
              <p>Besides Labrador Park, parties are held in Sentosa, Marina Barrage, the Esplanade and Sembawang to welcome the New Year.</p>
              <p>The next decade will probably see more radical changes to Singapore’s demographics as the ruling party aims to increase its population to 6.5 million people eventually via immigration.</p>
              <p>In his New Year Day’s message to Singaporeans, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reiterated the importance of foreigners to Singapore though Singaporeans will remain a “top priority” to his government.</p>
              <p>He did not elaborate more on what measures the ruling party will take to ensure that Singaporeans do not fall behind the new comers.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic, PM Lee’s father the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew continues to support the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies though he is aware that many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants.</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.”</em> Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,”</em> he quipped.</p>
              <p>The state media later “clarified” on Lee’s behalf that he meant that he was “concerned” Singaporeans will “lose out” if they do not work harder in the face of more new immigrants flooding Singapore, but the damage has already been done.</p>
              <p>Lee’s remarks in the National Geographic magazine’s article – “The Singapore Solution” were circulated widely in Singapore’s blogosphere, attracting much derision and opprobrium from netizens.</p>
              <p>A Facebook set up to call on him to apologize to Singaporeans has drawn more than 200 members so far.</p>

              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>The recent move by the Ministry of Education to give an additional ballot to Singapore citizens in application for primary school places has won it much public approval and support.</p>
              <p>In the past, PRs are able to compete directly with Singapore citizens for place via the Phase 1C scheme which has caused  alot of resentment and anger on the ground.</p>
              <p>The state media is quick to praise the government for making a clearer distinction between citizens and PRs without asking the fundamental question on why PRs are allowed to compete with citizens for coveted places in schools in the first place.</p>
              <p>The additional ballot only gives Singaporeans a higher chance of getting into a school of their choice, but is likely to be diluted with the increasing number of PRs and new citizens.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP government has never failed to emphasize on the “fact” that “Singapore’s politics are reserved for Singaporeans only” as outsiders do not have a stake in the country to deter foreigners from “interfering” in local politics.</p>
              <p>Foreign journalists often have their work permits canceled without warning like in the recent case of Daily Telegraph journalist Benjamin Bland or banned from entering Singapore altogether like the Chief Editor of Asia Sentinel John Berthelsen who was once “deported” unceremoniously by the police upon his arrival at Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are required to apply for a police permit even when speaking indoors and they are almost always not given when the topic touches on local politics. For example, a Swedish human rights activist’s permit to hold a workshop for SDP members was rejected with no reasons given.</p>
              <p>Being a non-partisan public institution, one would expect the Singapore police to apply the law equally to all political parties, but this is not often the case.</p>
              <p>Not too long ago, Chinese Daily Lianhe Wanbao hosted a public forum which saw a famous Taiwanese orator heaping generous praises on PAP leaders though the topic of discussion was supposed to be on China’s development in the future.</p>
              <p>Since foreigners are not allowed to “interfere” in Singapore politics, then one should expect PRs to fall within the ambit of the unwritten rule as well.</p>
              <p>However, PRs are often given ample space in the Straits Times Forum to voice their support for the PAP government, the latest being a Pakistani Sam Ahmed who wrote a letter urging Singaporeans to be “more appreciative” of their own country.</p>
              <p>It is strange that letters critical of the PAP are almost always censored while those few lauding it are published to sway public opinion to its side.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times should have rejected these fawning letters to curry favor with the ruling party on the ground that they are “interfering” in domestic politics which are for Singapore citizens only.</p>
              <p>With the PAP giving Singapore citizenships freely to foreigners, these new citizens will form an increasingly influential voting bloc in the future, but are they ready to partake in the political life of Singapore?</p>
              <p>As many of them came to Singapore in the prime of their lives without ever serving National Service, life here is a bed of roses for them especially if they come from developing countries like India and China.</p>
              <p>A new citizen from India and YPAP member Mr Fredric Fanthome wrote an article for Contact Singapore in which he expressed his admiration for Singapore’s “efficiency” – “everything works here!,” he wrote.</p>
              <p>Mr Fanthome holds a senior position in a local SME. Armed with a decent-paying job and saved from the hassle of National Service obligations, it is little wonder that Mr Fanthome is so infatuated with the PAP.</p>
              <p>However for a Singapore man growing up in Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s, it is a different story altogether.</p>
              <p>During his younger days, he witnessed his parents being able to afford a HDB flat relatively easily, but when it comes to his time, he has problems servicing the hefty mortgage loan as a result of sky-rocketing prices in the last few months.</p>
              <p>He has to compete with an increasing number of foreigners like Mr Fanthome who are lured to Singapore by jobs which offer higher pay than their homelands.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, he has the mandatory 4 week reservist obligation to fulfill annually when the newcomers have none. It is only natural that the Singaporean will feel bitter and angry towards the PAP government.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, such genuine grouses on the ground are incomprehensible to the new citizens who are courted by the PAP actively from the very beginning to rope them into grassroots organizations and the party itself to shore up its support base.</p>
              <p>Mr Fanthome can therefore be forgiven for dismissing online critics of the PAP as “anonymous hordes which spray venom at the government” for not being born and bred in Singapore as his perception of the PAP is somewhat colored and skewed by the propaganda churned out by the state media daily.</p>
              <p>As the new citizens have a limited understanding of Singapore politics, can we really trust them to make an informed decision during the elections?</p>
              <p>It is only natural to expect new citizens to vote for the ruling party which gives them the opportunity to start life afresh in Singapore in the first place.</p>
              <p>Since their support for the PAP is based largely on gratitude, they may be ignorant of the more important issues at stake such as the direction the nation is heading in the future.</p>
              <p>Many of them also appear not to be aware of the lack of accountability and transparency in Singapore’s political system which allows one dominant party to ride roughshod over all other political parties, state institutions and the people.</p>
              <p>It may take some time before new citizens come to the same conclusion as the locals – that they are not getting a fair deal from the ruling party and by then it will be too late.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. The percentage of new citizens is unknown, but is likely to be on an upward trend.</p>
              <p>In a small country like Singapore, a sizable number of new citizens in the electorate will have a significant impact on the outcome of the election.</p>
              <p>There are two ways to counter the unfair advantage enjoyed by the incumbent as a result of the rising number of new citizens:</p>
              <p>1. New citizens are not permitted to vote within the first five years of their residency in Singapore to give them ample time to familiarize themselves with the political situation in the country so as to help them to make a calm and rational decision.</p>
              <p>2. Old citizens are given one additional vote to give them more say in the running of their nation, especially those who have spent the two most precious years of their lives serving the nation.</p>
              <p>Of course it is impossible to expect the PAP to do anything which will hurt their interest when the massive immigration we are seeing now is part of its grand design to perpetuate its political hegemony forever whether we like it or not.</p>
              <p>The only way out for locals is to stand up and be counted at the next general election and vote for sufficient opposition MPs into parliament to deny the PAP’s its traditional two-thirds majority.</p>
              <p>Only then can we put a brake to its runaway liberal immigration policy to replace locals with their new pets from China, India and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Singapore politics should be reserved strictly for citizens born and bred in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Even among citizens, a clearer distinction must be drawn between old and new citizens to acknowledge the sacrifices the former have made to the nation.</p>
