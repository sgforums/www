            <div class='col-md body'>With the official announcement, our PM is now a full-fledged PM only, having handed the reins to Tharman as the incoming Finance Minister. This is a post that he will serve, together with his already burdening Education Minister's position until a suitable replacement can be found.<br><br>One expects Dr Ng Eng Hen to be that man, tipped heavily over Lui Tuck Yew. But if Ng were to step up (if you call that a promotion or a re-designation), that leaves the Manpower Minister 'headless', or with Ng holding two portfolios (like Tharman presently), till his successor is found.<br><br>Next we will have another 'the search for the next manpower minister'. Maybe we should start a reality TV show.<br><br>A la-musical chairs of sorts.<br><br>How ironic that possibly, with the exception of Defence, the position of Education and Finance, two of our most crucial govt bodies, will be managed by the same man. Chances are both will suffer for it. Tharman, an ex-CEO of MAS, may have the calibre to warm up quickly to his new post, but Education AND Finance??<br><br>Unlikely.<br><br>Meanwhile, our long-serving Tanjong Pagar MP Prof Koo Tsai Kee wrote a recent article about the GEP system and its benefits:<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_179897.html" rel="nofollow">Singapore's education system works </a><br><br>His glossed over view that our education system 'works' was put to the sword by another concerned reader:<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_181887.html" rel="nofollow">S'pore education system works - with tuition </a><br><br>I wonder whether our esteemed Minister of state for defence is really aware of the problem faced by our education system or if his sweeping views come from a select crop of the 'elite', who have this self-delusional vision that everything 'works': from our rising inflation and cost of living, to our 'world class transportation' and now our 'first rate education system'.<br><br>The endemic problem of self-praise still plagues our current crop of leaders, and this presents a serious political problem.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the benefit of readership i have posted the articles here:<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Singapore's education system works<br>By Koo Tsai Kee, For The Straits Times  </span></span><br><br>THIS year's Primary School Leaving Examination results are heart-warming. Natasha Nabila Muhamad Nasir, a Malay girl from a working-class family attending a Christian school in a Gifted Education Programme class, tops the nationwide exam in grand style. Her score of 294 is a record that will remain for some time to come.<br>While her results are remarkable, the messages behind her achievement are familiar ones. Singapore is a place where everybody can do well. The elites do not have a monopoly on success. And success is not entrenched in the old establishment.<br><br>The first message is clear. The elites' children do not have a monopoly on good grades. The elites - having attended 'good' primary schools themselves - may cash in on their affiliation points and enrol their children in their old schools. But at the end, it is intelligence and, above all, diligence and motivation that produce good grades.<br><br>Every year, I see top PSLE students coming from working-class families. They worked themselves up from neighbourhood schools to GEP schools and then on to good secondary schools. Natasha is one such example. Our system gives them a chance for upward mobility. The system doesn't ask where you live and where you come from. It only asks if you are capable and willing to scale the peaks of excellence. The best schools are those that open the gate as wide as possible to the ablest and the most determined regardless of race, language, religion or wealth.<br><br>Money cannot buy intelligence, nor pedigree ensure clever children. Sure, money alone can buy some advantages; and pedigree can indeed give the child a head start. But the random nature of reproduction has shown that successful parents do not always have clever children.<br><br>The GEP has been much maligned. Changes are always welcome. But without the GEP, many outstanding students from working-class families in neighbourhood schools would not have been able to move to the good schools. They have no affiliation points to use, they cannot afford to live near good schools. In that sense, the GEP is a gold standard for transparency in enrolment. Only the motivated and intelligent need apply.<br><br>However, if parents think the GEP is a gift, they are mistaken. It is true that GEP students as a group do very well, but it is also well known that some fall by the wayside. The reason is clear. GEP students - however intelligent - do not have a passport to good results. Some GEP students could have come in by chance. Others may not be suitable for the academic rigour, while yet others find their interests elsewhere. Everybody has to prove themselves once again at the PSLE. The competition is re-set every few years.<br><br>In my daughter's primary school, 17 pupils obtained over-270 marks in this year's PSLE. Of the 17, only 10 came from the GEP, the rest came from mainstream classes. But what is noteworthy is that eight out of the 10 GEP students who scored over 270 marks had come from neighbourhood schools.<br><br>The second message is the multiplying strength of diversity and social harmony. Children of all races and religions, across economic profiles, study together happily in the same environment. St Hilda's Primary did not pre-qualify only Christians. If it did, it would have lost Natasha. Nor is the school exclusively for members of the establishment and the rich. Natasha's father is a technician and her mother a full-time housewife.<br><br>And our system doesn't bankrupt families' savings. Tuition fees are so low they are even affordable to poor new immigrants. Scholarships allow them to go to the best universities.<br><br>The third message is that the system works. If it didn't, if it only produced exam-smart kids, then how does one account for the success of modern Singapore? What fuels this metropolis? The answer is smart Singaporeans. With limited natural resources and limited human resources, it is the quality of the people that matters. Quality education delivers quality people. Nothing else does.<br><br>Sometimes, news can be misleading. A headline in The Sunday Times told of how the international school United World College beat top local schools at The Arena debating competition. That attracted attention and created a noisy chatter. But no headline noted that UWC was beaten in another school debate series.<br><br>But really, headline news does not matter to most people. What really matters is how the average student performs. The average is the centre of gravity of our system. In the Natasha story, her score of 294 is outstanding, but it is the average score of the average PSLE student that vindicates our system.<br><br>Here, it should be noted that the average literacy level in Singapore is very high. And the average Singapore student has consistently done well in international benchmarking tests. This is the system which many international educators have been trying to approximate.<br><br>It is a system that works. It delivers the Singapore dream.<br><br>The writer is Singapore's Minister of State for Defence. This article, however, is written in a personal capacity.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the response article:<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">S'pore education system works - with tuition  </span></span><br><br>THE Minister of State for Defence, Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, praised the Singapore education system in his article, 'Singapore's education system works' (ST, Nov 24). There are two issues which need clarification.<br>Prof Koo commented that 'without the GEP, many outstanding students from working-class families in neighbourhood schools would not have been able to move to the good schools'. Is he implying that neighbourhood schools which do not offer the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) are not good schools? That all GEP schools are good schools?<br><br>The annual Primary 1 registration is already stressful for both parents and schools. Some parents, eager to put their children in 'good' schools, clocked up numerous hours in volunteer work, only to find that they did not have the luck of the draw. Then there are parents whose children had already secured places in such schools. Fearing that their little ones might not be able to cope with the demands of the school, or to give their kids a leg up, they enrolled them in enrichment programmes and, thence on, it is tuition all the way till the PSLE.<br><br>Implying that neighbourhood schools are inferior to GEP schools is being very unfair to non-GEP schools and their teachers. Moreover, this puts additional pressure on some parents to get their children into GEP schools.<br><br>Prof Koo concluded his article by pronouncing that the Singapore education system is one that works. I do not refute this, but there is a missing addendum - with tuition.<br><br>It is a well-known fact that a large proportion of our students, from pre-primary all the way to pre-university, have tuition.<br><br>Some children are so reliant on tuition that even though they score above-average grades, they would insist on continuing with tuition the following year, for 'security' reasons.<br><br>Students in schools with the integrated programme (IP) are supposedly the cream of the crop, yet there are many who have tuition. A few centres have been called 'IP tuition centres' because of their large number of IP students.<br><br>When a child says that he does not have tuition, but his parents coach him using assessment books, that is tuition in a sense.<br><br>So, Singapore's education system does work - with tuition.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ng Kim Yong (Mrs) </span><br><br></div>
