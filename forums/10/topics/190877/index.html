            <div class='col-md body'>This is an interesting article... it entails the resolve of the Bush Administration Arm Chair fantasy, "A Cat Walk" and "Home By Christmas", in their intention to Attack Iran.<br><br>Note : Iran has not Invaded anyone thru modern History, they were invaded by Iraq, the aggressor, and Why did the US support the aggressor, if they are the so-called "world police" and " a responsible world power" ? Doesn't do what they preach.... without proof can they justify an invasion that has no threat to them....<br><br><strong>US TROOPS PREPARED TO ATTACK IRAN </strong><br><br>Excepts... BTW this hilarious....<br><br>In January 2006, a major military base located in the western United States received voice instructions from National Command Authority (NCA) to get their logistics train underway and train up their troops for desert warfare.<br><br>The current National Command Authority is comprised of a Commander-In-Chief who deserted his post during the Vietnam War, and a Secretary of Defense who, despite never having donned a uniform in defense of his country, did succeed in cashiering and countermanding enough combat-experienced generals to engineer the current debacle in Iraq.<br><br><strong>Â“Which desert?Â” </strong>the commander wanted to know.<br><br><strong>Â“You donÂ’t need to know,Â” </strong>he was told by the NCA.<br><br>With their mission unstated, infantry staff officers presumed that this redeployment of more than 10,000 combat-tested troops, as well as supporting armor, artillery and air reconnaissance would soon be heading back into IraqÂ—with enough force, as my source put it, to Â“finally go in and do it right.Â”<br><br><strong>US commanders pointed out that their tanks were not going to be taking any scenic drives through Persian peaks exceeding 7,000 feet, and occasionally topping out over 10,000. The missing oxygen required to sustain life would also not be enough to sustain heavy-lift helos attempting to chopper in all those bullets and beans well above their rated service ceilings. </strong><br><br>Â“Bad idea,Â” they said. The Soviet Red Army had conclusively and catastrophically demonstrated what happens when troops attempting to assault unfamiliar mountain defiles without armor and adequate air support confront homeland defenders armed with anti-air and anti-vehicle rockets fighting from good cover. Especially when said shooters are not afraid to die.<br><br><strong>Â“We canÂ’t do this,Â” the generals told Rumsfeld and his amateur warmakers. Â“Your plan will not work. Most of our people will get killed.Â”<br><br>Â“No worries,Â” the Sec DefÂ’s best and brightest assured the generals. Â“WeÂ’ll cross the eastern border from Afghanistan near Zahedan, and use the IranianÂ’s own railroad to transport everything we need down hundreds of miles of hotly contested train tracks right into Tehran.Â”<br><br>Â“After weÂ’ve blown up the tracks and sidings in the preliminary air campaign to prevent the Iranian army from taking train rides?Â” the generals wanted to know. Â“How exactly will that work?Â” Even an intact stretch of track, they went on, can be put of commission by a disgruntled local tossing a single grenade.<br><br>Â“Relax,Â” the White House war wizards came about onto another tack. Â“WeÂ’ll air drop all the transport vehicles you need from high-flying C-130s.Â”<br><br>Â“You canÂ’t HALO a Humvee!Â” </strong>the conquest-infatuated civilians were informed. In practice exercises, High Altitude drops of heavy vehicles attained terminal velocities before streaming their chutes at the moment of Low Opening. And stream they did! Humvees arriving beneath shredded canopies tended to shed wheels and parts in all directions, before bouncing their junked chassis 300 feet past ducking observers. At that point, the generals explained, jumping in and driving to Tehran was not really an option.<br><br>Another small problem, they pointed out, was that since breaking off all diplomatic relations with Iran more than a decade before, <strong>US military commanders with an urgent need for accurate Intel had zero clue what was happening inside that shrouded country. </strong><br><br>Sure, theyÂ’d been violating IranÂ’s sovereign airspace as ordered, flying picture-snapping UAVs through the mountains looking for targets for months. But constant climbing and divingÂ—and high winds in the mountain passesÂ—had left the unpiloted Predators with little fuel for loitering.<br><br>Even when an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle did spot a feature of possible interest, it was often impossible to tell a painted plywood or Styrofoam decoy from a real truck or howitzer.<br><br>Just like what happened in Kosovo, the generals remembered, after a massive US-led aerial bombing campaign massacred civilians, initiated an industrial pollution holocaust, irradiated the country with uranium-waste warheadsÂ—and saw most of the Serbian artillery and tanks driven past UN Observers after the ceasefire.<br><br><strong>No problem, said the White House. With more than 10,000 potential targetsÂ—many of them located in the center of modern cities like TehranÂ—weÂ’ll simply bomb the crap out of the entire country.</strong> With oil fires deliberately lit off by the defenders blinding the US attackersÂ’ night vision equipmentÂ—as well as Hellfire missile sensors, and the lasers needed to guide Â“smart bombsÂ”Â—waves of terrain-challenged cruise missiles suffering from poor accuracy under ideal conditions, would somehow hedgehop mountain ridges to initially deluge Iranian cities and outlying centers with high explosives and depleted uranium.<br><br>Not coincidentally, this multi-billion dollar Â“urban renewalÂ” project would generate tremendous profits for Bush administrators tied through banks and the Carlyle Group to US arms manufacturers, and reconstruction giants Halliburton and Bechtel.<br><br><strong>This ruinous yet highly lucrative attack would be immediately followed by B-52s, Â“carpet bombingÂ” Iranian cities and countrysideÂ—just like theyÂ’d done to Vietnam, Cambodia and Basra.</strong> Deeply buried nuclear research facilities would be used to Â“field testÂ” experimental nuclear Â“bunker-bustersÂ”.<br><br>Nervous generals worried that the resulting clouds of radioactive dirt, debris and human flesh would rain downwind over Pakistan, India, Burma and China to the east, before contaminating North America and both hemispheres.<br><br><strong>Read the whole article here, and witness the Neocon Rumsfield's wet dream.</strong> <a href="http://newswire.indymedia.org/en/2006/05/839133.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://newswire.indymedia.org/en/2006/05/839133.shtml</a><br><br></div>
