              <p>There are 2000 armed Gurkhas in Singapore and their number grows annually by 140.</p>
              <p>This is a dangerous sign.</p>
              <p>Gurkhas are not Singaporeans. They are mercenaries. AND Mercenaries work for money.</p>
              <p>In other words, Gurkhas can be bought with money. Loyalty is a
              tricky issue here, for their loyalty is dependent on their having to be
              satisfied with material reward. AND NOW this has proven to be true with
              their recent rioting incident in Mount Vernon Camp over pay issues
              which is very worrying.</p>
              <p>I do not know how the trouble makers will be taken to task in this
              incident and whether or not there will be a coverup because of the way
              in which the MHA has conducted itself with the lack of transparency in
              the way it fumbled over the Mas Selamat Kastari escape.</p>
              <p>The latest Gurkha rioting incident raises many questions in the
              minds of Singapore Citizens as to: How this mercenary unit being
              brought in and being armed? How is this mercenary unit empowered to act
              in Singapore? How is this mercenary unit subject to law and discipline
              and control?</p>
              <p>Will the rioters be charged and disciplined accordingly? What sort of discipline will they receive?</p>
              <p>As seen from the Mas Selamat Kastari escape, our administration will
              bend over backwards for these foreign mercenaries. The Gurkhas on duty
              ought to have been charged under the Penal Code but instead they were
              let off with a slap on their wrists. I believe the negligent
              Singaporean ISD officers received far heavier sanction compared to the
              negligent Gurkhas. It is amazing how much better treatment these
              foreigners are being treated in comparison to their Singaporean
              counterparts in the Police.</p>
              <p>[By the way when Singaporean boys have petty fight in groups, they
              are often charged with rioting and they go to jail for it, I wonder if
              our Singapore Police Force is held to any higher standards of conduct]</p>
              <p>We can trust that the Singapore Police Force and the Ministry of
              Home Affairs will do their best to cover up this incident and sweep it
              under the carpet. As if underneath the carpet is already not dirty
              enough. I would caution against condoning such coverup and I would also
              caution against the Singaporean public to be complacent enough to
              overlook the need to pressure the MHA into revealing the worms in the
              innards of the Gurkha Contingent.</p>
              <p>This is because it is my view that the continued presence of Gurkhas
              in Singapore is the greatest danger to Singapore itself. My reasons are
              stated below.</p>
              <p>If the PAP administration persists on being unrepentant on their
              mercenary ways and insist on using mercenaries for their security or
              should i say “the security of Singapore”, it would not be difficult to
              imagine the possibility of such attitudes infecting the Gurkha
              Contingent [which is mercenary in the first place] and resulting in the
              Gurkha Contingent selling out Singapore in time to come.</p>
              <p>Imagine, there are 2000 mercenaries armed and ready. Their
              allegiance unknown. It is easy for them to even try to eliminate the
              entire leadership and neutralize the other Singaporean units in the
              Singapore Police Force should they ever decide to do so. And it would
              be easy for them to do so because the PAP trusts the Gurkhas more than
              they trust Singaporean Police Officers, they get the Gurkhas to guard
              Ministers homes.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Gurkhas are professional soldiers and mercenaries,
              they are put constantly under training during their service. They upon
              completion of their vocational training continue to serve their careers
              in the position they have been trained for.</p>
              <p>Singaporean National Servicemen on the other hand are under training
              only whilst doing their national service and they only turn operational
              near to their Run-Out-Date (Operationally ready date) only to be
              released and returned to their civilian status.</p>
              <p>In the Singapore Armed Forces, we all know that in each SAF camp,
              there are roughly only 10-12 rifles in each aggregated guard detail and
              maybe 200-300 rounds of ammunition in each guardhouse. Other than that,
              all other weapons and ammunition are stored separately and drawing of
              arms and ammunition in times of need will take time.</p>
              <p>As of now, we know nothing of the Gurkha Contingent’s weapons
              drawing protocol and ammunition storage and drawing protocol but there
              is reason to believe that their ammunition and weapons are stored in
              the same camp unlike the weapons and ammunition which are stored
              separately in all SAF units. Therefore, it is my belief that our SAF
              units cannot react fast enough to be mobilized, armed and ready for
              action if their was a mobilization call to neutralize the Gurkha
              Contingent when the need arises.</p>
              <p>The red tape from the rules set by our leaders surrounding SAF
              weapons and ammunition drawing and the inherent fact that our
              Singaporean National Servicemen stay in the far flung corners of
              Singapore [with compliments from the Central Posting Centre in Mindef]
              as opposed to the Gurkhas being accommodated in their camp whilst on
              duty and being accommodated near their camp whilst off duty will
              prevent our local units  from reacting fast enough to tackle the
              mercenary unit should the mercenaries turn renegade.</p>
              <p>[Please recall that in this incident, the SOC reacted fast enough to
              deploy  Mount Vernon Camp because it was an incident of scuffle and
              rioting. This situation would be vastly different from the scenario
              where the  entire Gurkha Contingent co-operate and mutiny, there would
              be no 999 call to the Radio Division Singapore Police Force, there
              would also be no advance warning call to the Special Operations
              Command.]</p>
              <p>The PAP had better come up with much better reasons for maintaining the need for the Gurkha Contingent.</p>
              <p>Should the Gurkha Contingent revolt for reasons unknown, the PAP’s
              policy of recruiting and arming foreigners heavily on its own soil may
              prove to be the worst ever decision the administration has made and
              might in actual fact lead to the downfall of Singapore.</p>
              <p>I repeat myself. Gurkhas are not Singaporeans, they are mercenaries
              and they intend to retire in their homeland when they finish their
              terms of services. Gurkhas are i believe more heavily armed, from what
              the photos reveal, with at least Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine guns
              and M-16 assault rifles as opposed to most of their Singaporean
              counterparts with their Smith &amp; Wesson 0.38 revolvers. God knows
              whether or not they have the same heavy weapons as a SAF Infantry
              Battalion e.g. GPMGs.</p>
              <p>Thank God that Singapore still has its Special Operations Command,
              Police Task Force unit, KINS and PINS. This however does not square the
              equation because do we have as many as 2000 fighting men in the Special
              Operations Command? I believe not.</p>
              <p>The question is to MHA is this - What function does this unit perform which cannot be performed by true blue Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>I hereby declare my intention to campaign for the disarming and
              disbanding of the Gurkha Contingent and I hope other Singaporeans will
              rally with me with this call.</p>
              <p>Until the administration gets pressured enough to be accountable
              with how the Gurkhas’ recruitment, training, deployment and weapons
              access and cost of upkeep, I pray for all Singaporean police officers,
              especially those in the Special Operations Command, to keep a keen and
              watchful eye on the Gurkha Contingent for reasons which i need not say
              more.</p>
              <p>No one need to look too far into history to know the dangers of having a foreign armed mercenary unit in Singapore.</p>

              <p>...The political conditions of the latter half of the
                      twentieth century will continue to be dominated by the weapons
                      situation, for, while politics consists of much more than weapons,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the
                      nature, organization, and control of weapons is the most significant of
                      the numerous factors that determine what happens in political life.</span></p>
              <p>Surely weapons will continue to be expensive and complex. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This means
                      that they will increasingly be the tools of professionalized, if not
                      mercenary, forces.</span></p>
              <p>All of past history shows that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the shift from a mass
                      army of citizen-soldiers to a smaller army of professional fighters
                      leads, in the long run, to a decline of democracy.</span></p>
              <p>When weapons are
                      cheap and easy to obtain and to use, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">almost any man may obtain them</span>,
                      and the organized structure of the society, such as the state, can
                      obtain no better weapons than the ordinary, industrious, private
                      citizen.</p>
              <p>This very rare historical condition existed about 1880, but is
                      now only a dim memory, since the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weapons obtainable by the state today
                      are far beyond the pocketbook, understanding, or competence of the
                      ordinary citizen.</span></p>
              <p>When weapons are of the "amateur" type of 1880, as
                      they were in Greece in the fifth century B.C., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they are widely
                      possessed by citizens, power is similarly dispersed, and no minority
                      can compel the majority to yield to its will.</span></p>
              <p>With such an "amateur
                      weapons system" (if other conditions are not totally unfavorable), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we
                      are likely to find majority rule and a relatively democratic political
                      system.</span></p>
              <p>But, on the contrary, when a period can be dominated by complex
                      and expensive weapons that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only a few persons can afford to possess or
                      can learn to use, we have a situation where the minority who control
                      such "specialist" weapons can dominate the majority who lack them.</span></p>
              <p>In
                      such a society, sooner or later,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> an authoritarian political system that
                      reflects the inequality in control of weapons will be established.</span></p>
              <p>At the present time, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there seems to be little
                      reason to doubt that the specialist weapons of today will continue to
                      dominate the military picture into the foreseeable future.</span> If so, there
                      is little reason to doubt that authoritarian rather than democratic
                      political regimes will dominate the world into the same foreseeable
                      future...</p>

              <p>...Also related to the problem of internalised controls <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the shift of
              weapons in our society.</span> This is a profound problem. I have spent ten
              years working on it throughout all of history, and I hope eventually to
              produce a book if I can find a publisher.</p>
              <p>There will be endless
              analyses of Chinese history, Byzantine history and Russian history and
              everything else, and the book is about nine-tenths written.</p>
              <p>I'd say in
              the last ten years the shift of weapons in any civilization and, above
              all, in our civilization,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> from shock weapons to missile weapons has a
              dominant influence on the ability to control individuals</span>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">individuals
              cannot be controlled by missile weapons.</span></p>
              <p>Notice that if you go back
              several hundred years to the Middle Ages,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> all weapons were shock, that
              is, you came at the enemy with a spear or a sword.</span> Even as late as
              1916, in the First World War, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you came at the Germans with bayonets
              after a preliminary barrage with artillery.</span></p>
              <p>But we have now shifted
              almost completely to missile weapons.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Missile weapons are weapons that
              you hurl. You may shoot, you may have bombs dropped from an airplane,
              you may throw a hand grenade: these are missile weapons.</span></p>
              <p>The essential
              difference between a shock weapon and a missile weapon is this: a
              missile weapon is either fired or it isn't fired. It cannot be
              half-fired. Once you let it go, it's out of your control.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It is a
              killing weapon.</span></p>
              <p>But a shock weapon--a billy club or a bayonet-- can be
              used to any degree you wish. If you say to someone, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Get up and get out
              of my room," and you pull out a machines gun, or you call in a B-52
              bomber, or you pull the pin in a hand grenade....But with a bayonet you
              can persuade him.</span></p>
              <p>In our society, individual behaviour can no longer be controlled by
              any system of weaponry we have.</p>
              <p>In fact, we do not have enough people,
              even if we equip them with shock weapons, to control the behaviour of
              that part of the population which does not have internalised controls.</p>
              <p>One reason for that, of course, is that the twenty percent who do have
              internalised controls are concentrated in certain areas. I won't go
              into the subject of controls.</p>
              <p>It opens up the whole field of guerrilla
              resistance, terrorism, and everything else; these cannot be controlled
              by any system or organized structure or force that exists, at least on
              the basis of missile weaponry.</p>
              <p>And, as I said, it would take too many
              people on the basis of shock weaponry. We have now done what the Romans
              did when they started to commit suicide: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have  shifted from an army
              of citizens to an army of mercenaries, and those mercenaries are being
              recruited in our society, as they were in Roman society, from the
              twenty percent of the population which does not have the internalised
              controls of the civilization...</span></p>
