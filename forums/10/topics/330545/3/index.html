              <p>in hiring the ghurka contigent is not about mistrust of locals.They are from a race and religion which does not make up singapore, they are not from a select group of people that canb e found worldwide, they are not driven by ideology The ghurkhas are impartial in dealing with racial riots. . In case such an event occurs, all sides will be neautralised. There were many conflicts and wars in history, and studying them shows that men from your own side can betray you for the love of money or other reasons such as religion, internal conflict politics and ideology.</p>
              <p>Another is we are surrounded by neighbours who are predominantly from a select group of religion. </p>
              <p>I support the Ghurka contigent. In an event where a conflict breaks out, you will not have a problem of a chinese singaporean hesitating to shoot someone from china or a malay or indian doing the same.</p>

              <p>we all were stunned, thought he joking... but he looked damn serious... plus he said we were nearest to the "battlefield" in the event of war. forgot to mentioned, i was at sembawang camp at that time, transport unit... so we joked among ourselves during preparation, "maybe we should pack additional boxes of chocolates for our fellow comrades?" since we transport so no front line fighting. hahaha...</p>
