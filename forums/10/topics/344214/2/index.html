              <p>The copilot, who survived, later said that the flight crew knew the

              <p><em>In the early hours of 5 June 1967, Israel attacked Egypt and
              destroyed nearly its entire air force on the ground. On the Syrian-
              Israeli border, Israel attempted to evict its inhabitants and
              provoked a Syrian response. Already preluding the war, on 7 April
              1967 the Israeli air force attacked Syria, shooting down six
              planes, hitting thirty fortified positions and killing about 100
              people. By 10 June, Israeli forces captured the West Bank, East
              Jerusalem and Gaza, along with the Sinai and the Golan Heights. At
              the end of the war Israel had succeeded in almost doubling the
              amount of territory it controlled.</em></p>
              <p>While one third of Egypt's army was in Yemen and therefore
              unlikely to start a war, Israel claimed to a believing world that
              the Arabs attacked Israel and that Israel was in danger of
              annihilation. Both claims were false. Israeli Air Force General
              Ezer Weizman declared that "there was never any danger of
              extermination". [1]</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Almost a year
              after the war, Israeli General Matityahu Peled said: "To pretend
              that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers were in a position
              to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only
              to the intelligence of anyone capable of analysing this sort of
              situation, but above all an insult to the Zahal [Israeli
              army].</strong></span>" [2]</p>
              <p>On the Syrian-Israeli border, Israel was engaging in threats and
              provocations. One such incident on 7 April 1967 in a major aerial
              engagement between Israeli and Syrian planes. Six Syrian planes
              were shot down. In an interview in May 1967, Yitzhak Rabin
              threatened to overthrow the Syrian regime. Prime Minister Levi
              Eshkol reportedly said that Israel "may have to teach Syria a
              sharper lesson than that of 7 April." [3] On May 14, Soviet and
              Egyptian intelligence reported a massing of Israeli troops on the
              Syrian borders. [4]</p>
              <p>A similar provocation against Jordan took place in November
              1966, when 4,000 Israeli soldiers attacked Samu in the West Bank,
              and killing 18 Jordanian soldiers. The public justification for
              this action was to prevent Palestinian infiltration," though at the
              time "the Jordanian authorities did all they possibly could to stop
              infiltration," according to Odd Bull, chief of staff of UN forces
              at the time. [5]</p>
              <p>In the course of the war more than 300,000 Palestinians were
              displaced, half for a second time. [6] A smaller number of
              Palestinians were internally displaced during the war, including
              Palestinians expelled from the Old City of Jerusalem. Subsequent
              displacement and expulsion of refugees has continued in 1967
              occupied Palestine and in various countries of exile. Most of them
              found refuge on the east bank of the Jordan River along with the
              more than 400,000 who had fled there in 1948. More than 100,000
              people, including 17,000 Palestinian refugees registered with
              UNRWA, moved from the Golan Heights into Syria. [7] In Jordan the
              refugee population increased by almost half. A small number fled
              further northern into the part of Syria not occupied by Israeli
              military forces, to Lebanon and Egypt. [8]</p>
              <p>On the side of Egypt, Jordan and Syria the loss was 4,296 killed
              soldiers and 6,121 wounded. On the Israeli side the loss was 983
              soldiers killed and 4,517 wounded. [9]</p>
              <p>About one million Palestinians remained in those parts of
              Palestine occupied by Israel in 1967. As in 1948 in conquered areas
              with large Palestinian populations, Israel established a military
              government in West Bank and Gaza. The military government prevented
              the return of refugees who had been displaced during the war and
              also enabled Israel to take control of large amounts of land
              without granting citizenship and civil and political rights to the
              Palestinians living in these areas.</p>
              <p>In the immediate wake of the June 1967 war, the Israel destroyed
              more than half a dozen Arab villages in the West Bank. Villages
              such as Imwas, Yalu and Beit Nuba in the Latrun area were destroyed
              and their inhabitants expelled. The area of these villages was
              subsequently turned into a nature reserve, Park Canada, which
              remains to this day a favorite Israeli picnic spot.[10] In the old
              city of Jerusalem, Israel depopulated and demolished the Mughrabi
              quarter adjacent to the Western Wall to make room for a square.
              Israel also depopulated the villages of Beit Marsam, Beit Awa,
              Jiftlik, and al-Burj as well as half the city of Qalqilya. [11]
              Only those Palestinians (and their offspring) registered in
              Israelï¿½s September 1967 census of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and
              the Gaza Strip were considered legal residents of the 1967 OPTs.
              The administrative measure effectively prevented most Palestinian
              refugees displaced in 1967 from returning to their homes.</p>
              <p>In occupied eastern Jerusalem, Israel disbanded the local
              municipal council and extended Israeli law and jurisdiction. The
              military government in West Bank and Gaza and the municipal order
              imposed on eastern Jerusalem controlled the Palestinian population
              by policies of separation and isolation.</p>
              <p>A year after Israel occupied the remaining part of Palestine it
              began to establish settlements in these areas. In 1979 the UN
              Security Council determined in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://electronicintifada.net/bytopic/historicaldocuments/52.shtml">Resolution 446</a> that the policy and practices of
              Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other
              Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and
              constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just
              and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>

                  radical Baathist regime in Syria signed a defense treaty with Egypt in
                  November 1966. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Early in April 1967 Israel attempted to cultivate
                  disputed Arab land in the Syrian-Israeli demilitarized zone, thus
                  triggering a confrontation.</strong></span> A month later Syria informed Egypt's
                  president, Gamal Abdul Nasser, of Israeli troop concentration along its
                  border. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Promising to aid Syria on 16 May, Nasser dispatched Egyptian
                  troops to eastern Sinai. </strong></span>Two days later he demanded the withdrawal of
                  the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), which had been patrolling
                  the truce lines since the end of the 1956 Suez War on the Egyptian
                  side. UNEF withdrew immediately. </em></span></span><em><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Having
                  stationed Egyptian troops at the tip of the Tiran Straits in Sharm al
                  Shaikh on 22 May, Nasser blockaded the straits, thus closing off the
                  Israeli port of Eilat. This raised the Temperature in the region.
                  Reflecting the popular mood, King Hussein of Jordan, hitherto hostile
                  to Nasser, rushed to Cairo on 30 May to conclude a mutual defense pact
                  and place his forces under Egyptian command. Israel had earlier told
                  its superpower ally, the United States, that it would go to war if one
                  or more of the following events occurred: the departure of UNEF; the
                  blockading of the Tiran Straits; the signing of a Jordanian-Egyptian
                  defense pact; and the dispatch of Iraqi forces to Jordan. By the end of
                  May all but one of these [the last] eventualities had come to pass." ....</span></span></em></div>
