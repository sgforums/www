              <p>IDF is a bunch of whiny hebrew teenagers being marched into a blender by the demonic ZioNazi gang of war criminals. Isreal will pull out of Gaza because it knows it can't win. Just watch. They talk about a truce and how humanitarian they are and all that fucking crap like everybody forgot they bombed UN refugee shelters and killed UN aid workers. Olmert is afraid he'll get assassinated by someone's mother and Benjamin is a-ok to see Olmert hang. The Pallys are going to fucking plot, scheme and kill Jewish settlers for the next 50 years (because that's probably how long Israel will last) and the best thing is the whole world is just going to kick back and laugh at the miserable sniveling whining mother fucking Zionazis as they get beheaded in droves. The muslim young are growing up lions and the Zionist young are scared they're going to hell because EVERYBODY CAN SEE THE ZIONIST PROJECT HAS LOST THE MORAL HIGH GROUND.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>What is so great about IDF training SAF 40 bloody years ago? They taught us because they needed diplomatic support for their Zionist Project and they thought they saw the Chinese here as being in the same boat as them, appropriating Muslim lands etc. But things have changed. Singapore wants a progressive future based on peaceful and stable trade relations with its neighbours. Israeli Zionists wants an Apocalyptic War and the Endtimes. These divergence views of the future has made whatever doctrines the IDF taught us as being obsolete. Those who still think like the Isreali settlers are dinosaurs in Singapore. Singapore does not want terrorism and war at its doorstep because Singapore does not have remote control powers over the U.S. administration. Singapore must always rely on its politicians first before its generals. That is why generals are taken into public service and taught to become statesmen. A small country like Singapore, run like a military dictatorship with the mentality of the Zionist will doom everyone in Singapore. So IDF can go fly a fucking kite in a thunderstorm for all I care.</p></div>

              <p><strong>"Chronicle of a Suicide Foretold: The Case of Israel"</strong></p>
              <p>The state of Israel proclaimed its independence at midnight on May
              15, 1948. The United Nations had voted to establish two states in what
              had been Palestine under British rule.
              The city of Jerusalem was supposed to be an international zone under
              U.N. jurisdiction. The U.N. resolution had wide support, and
              specifically that of the United States and the
              Soviet Union. The Arab states all voted against it.</p>
              <p>In the sixty years of its existence, the state of Israel has
              depended for its survival and expansion on an overall strategy that
              combined three elements: macho militarism, geopolitical
              alliances, and public relations. The macho militarism (what current
              Prime Minister Ehud Olmert calls the "iron fist") was made possible by
              the nationalist fervor of Jewish Israelis,
              and eventually (although not initially) by the very strong support of
              Jewish communities elsewhere in the world.</p>
              <p>Geopolitically, Israel first forged an alliance with the Soviet
              Union (which was brief but crucial), then with France (which lasted a
              longer time and allowed Israel to become a
              nuclear power), and finally (and most importantly) with the United
              States. These allies, who were also patrons, offered most importantly
              military support through the provision of
              weapons. But they also offered diplomatic/political support, and in the
              case of the United States considerable economic support.</p>
              <p>The public relations was aimed at obtaining sympathetic support from
              a wide swath of world public opinion, based in the early years on a
              portrait of Israel as a pioneering David
              against a retrograde Goliath, and in the last forty years on guilt and
              compassion over the massive Nazi extermination of European Jewry during
              the Second World War.</p>
              <p>All these elements of Israeli strategy worked well from 1948 to the
              1980s. Indeed, they were increasingly more effective. But somewhere in
              the 1980s, the use of each of the three
              tactics began to be counterproductive. Israel has now entered into a
              phase of the precipitate decline of its strategy. It may be too late
              for Israel to pursue any alternative strategy, in
              which case it will have committed geopolitical suicide. Let us trace
              how the three elements in the strategy interacted, first during the
              successful upward swing, then during the slow
              decline of Israel's power.</p>
              <p>For the first twenty-five years of its existence, Israel engaged in
              four wars with Arab states. The first was the 1948-1949 war to
              establish the Jewish state. The Israeli declaration of
              an independent state was not matched by a Palestinian declaration to
              establish a state. Rather, a number of Arab governments declared war on
              Israel. Israel was initially in military
              difficulty. However, the Israeli military were far better trained than
              those of the Arab countries, with the exception of Transjordan. And,
              crucially, they obtained arms from
              Czechoslovakia, acting as the agent of the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>By the time of the truce in 1949, the discipline of the Israeli
              forces combined with the Czech arms enabled the Israelis to win
              considerable territory not included in the partition
              proposals of the United Nations, including west Jerusalem. The other
              areas were incorporated by the surrounding Arab states. A large number
              of Palestinian Arabs left or were
              forced to leave areas under the control of the Israelis and became
              refugees in neighboring Arab countries, where their descendants still
              largely live today. The land they had owned
              was taken by Jewish Israelis.</p>
              <p>The Soviet Union soon dropped Israel. This was probably primarily
              because its leaders quickly became afraid of the impact of the creation
              of the state on the attitudes of Soviet
              Jewry, who seemed overly enthusiastic and hence potentially subversive
              from Stalin's point of view. Israel in turn dropped any sympathy for
              the socialist camp in the Cold War, and
              made clear its fervent desire to be considered a full-fledged member of
              the Western world, politically and culturally.</p>
              <p>France at this time was faced with national liberation movements in
              its three North African colonies, and saw in Israel a useful ally. This
              was especially true after the Algerians
              launched their war of independence in 1954. France began to help Israel
              arm itself. In particular, France, which was developing its own nuclear
              weapons (against U.S. wishes),
              helped Israel do the same. In 1956, Israel joined France and Great
              Britain in a war against Egypt. Unfortunately for Israel, this war was
              launched against U.S. opposition, and the
              United States forced all three powers to end it.</p>
              <p>After Algeria became independent in 1962, France lost interest in
              the Israeli connection, which now interfered with its attempts to renew
              closer relations with the three now
              independent North African states. It was at this point that the United
              States and Israel turned to each other to forge close links. In 1967,
              war broke out again between Egypt and
              Israel, and other Arab states joined Egypt. In this so-called Six Day
              War, the United States for the first time gave military weapons to
              Israel.</p>
              <p>The 1967 Israeli victory changed the basic situation in many
              respects. Israel had won the war handily, occupying all those parts of
              the British mandate of Palestine that it had
              occupied before, plus Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and Syria's Golan
              Heights. Juridically, there was now a state of Israel plus Israel's
              occupied territories. Israel began a policy of
              establishing</p>
              <p>Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.</p>
              <p>The Israeli victory transformed the attitude of world Jewry, which
              now overcame whatever reservations it had had about the creation of the
              state of Israel. They took great pride in
              its accomplishments and began to undertake major political campaigns in
              the United States and western Europe to secure political support for
              Israel. The image of a pioneering
              Israel with emphasis on the virtues of the kibbutz was abandoned in
              favor of an emphasis on the Holocaust as the basic justification for
              world support of Israel.</p>
              <p>In 1973, the Arab states sought to redress the military situation in
              the so-called Yom Kippur war. This time again, Israel won the war, with
              U.S. arms support. The 1973 war marked
              the end of the central role of the Arab states. Israel could continue
              to try to get recognition from Arab states, and it did succeed
              eventually with both Egypt and Jordan, but it was
              now too late for this to be a way to secure Israel's existence.</p>
              <p>As of this point, there emerged a serious Palestinian Arab political
              movement, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which was now
              the key opponent of Israel, the one with
              whom Israel needed to come to terms. For a long time, Israel refused to
              deal with the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat, preferring the iron
              fist. And at first, it was militarily
              successful.</p>
              <p>The limits of the iron fist policy were made evident by the first <em>intifada</em>, a spontaneous uprising of Palestinian Arabs inside the occupied territories, which began in 1987 and lasted
              six years. The basic achievement of the <em>intifada</em> was twofold. It forced the Israelis and the United States to talk to
              the PLO, a long process that led to the so-called Oslo Accords of
              1993, which provided for the creation of the Palestinian Authority in
              part of the occupied territories.</p>
              <p>The Oslo Accords in the long run were geopolitically less important than the impact of the <em>intifada</em> on world public opinion. For the first time, the David-Goliath image
              began to be
              inverted. For the first time, there began to be serious support in the
              Western world for the so-called two-state solution. For the first time,
              there began to be serious criticism of
              Israel's iron fist and its practices vis-à-vis the Arab Palestinians.
              Had Israel been serious about a two-state solution based on the
              so-called Green Line - the line of division at the end
              of the 1948-1949 war - it probably would have achieved a settlement.</p>
              <p>Israel however was always one step behind. When it could have
              negotiated with Nasser, it wouldn't. When it could have negotiated with
              Arafat, it wouldn't. When Arafat died and
              was succeeded by the ineffectual Mahmoud Abbas, the more militant Hamas
              won the Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. Israel refused to
              talk to Hamas.</p>
              <p>Now, Israel has invaded Gaza, seeking to destroy Hamas. If it
              succeeds, what organization will come next? If, as is more probable, it
              fails to destroy Hamas, is a two-state solution
              now possible? Both Palestinian and world public opinion is moving
              towards the one-state solution. And this is of course the end of the
              Zionist project.</p>
              <p>The three-element strategy of Israel is decomposing. The iron fist
              no longer succeeds, much as it didn't for George Bush in Iraq. Will the
              United States link remain firm? I doubt it.
              And will world public opinion continue to look sympathetically on
              Israel? It seems not. Can Israel now switch to an alternative strategy,
              of negotiating with the militant
              representatives of the Arab Palestinians, as an integral constituent of
              the Middle East, and not as an outpost of Europe? It seems quite late
              for that, quite possibly too late. Hence, the
              chronicle of a suicide foretold.</p>

              <p>What is so great about IDF training SAF 40 bloody years ago? They taught us because they needed diplomatic support for their Zionist Project and they thought they saw the Chinese here as being in the same boat as them, appropriating Muslim lands etc. But things have changed. Singapore wants a progressive future based on peaceful and stable trade relations with its neighbours. Israeli Zionists wants an Apocalyptic War and the Endtimes. These divergence views of the future has made whatever doctrines the IDF taught us as being obsolete. Those who still think like the Isreali settlers are dinosaurs in Singapore. Singapore does not want terrorism and war at its doorstep because Singapore does not have remote control powers over the U.S. administration. Singapore must always rely on its politicians first before its generals. That is why generals are taken into public service and taught to become statesmen. A small country like Singapore, run like a military dictatorship with the mentality of the Zionist will doom everyone in Singapore. So IDF can go fly a fucking kite in a thunderstorm for all I care.</p>

              <p>take it easy la. we are talking IDF good in military warfare. IDF did not brainwash our forefathers or fathers in their early days of NS.</p>
              <p>like it or not, IDF kick the ass of arabs in 1967 in their 6 days war. it still amazed me how can a small country with possibly much inferior military weapons compare to the mightyEgy and gangs, kick their ass and possibly eliminate the threat from them in years to come.</p>

              <p>i bet u r few of those who blindly deny the superiorty of IDF in comparison to its arabs neighbours. like i say, i dont comment whether the war on gaza is morally right or wrong, i just like to comment, IDF is hell of a good army!!</p>

              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Did the Egyptians actually start the 1967 war, as Israel originally claimed?</h4>
              <p>“The former Commander of the Air Force, General Ezer Weitzman,
              regarded as a hawk, stated that there was ‘no threat of destruction’
              but that the attack on Egypt, Jordan and Syria was nevertheless
              justified so that Israel could ‘exist according the scale, spirit, and
              quality she now embodies.’...Menahem Begin had the following remarks to
              make: ‘In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian Army
              concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that Nasser was
              really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided
              to attack him.’“ <em>Noam Chomsky, “The Fateful Triangle.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Was the 1967 war defenisve? — continued</h4>
              <p>“I do not think Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent to The
              Sinai would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive war. He
              knew it and we knew it.” <em>Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s Chief of Staff in 1967, in Le Monde, 2/28/68</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Moshe Dayan posthumously speaks out on the Golan Heights</h4>
              <p>“Moshe Dayan, the celebrated commander who, as Defense Minister in
              1967, gave the order to conquer the Golan...[said] many of the
              firefights with the Syrians were deliberately provoked by Israel, and
              the kibbutz residents who pressed the Government to take the Golan
              Heights did so less for security than for the farmland...[Dayan stated]
              ‘They didn’t even try to hide their greed for the land...We would send
              a tractor to plow some area where it wasn’t possible to do anything, in
              the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would
              start to shoot. If they didn’t shoot, we would tell the tractor to
              advance further, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and
              shoot.</p>
              <p>And then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and
              that’s how it was...The Syrians, on the fourth day of the war, were not
              a threat to us.’” <em>The New York Times, May 11, 1997</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">The history of Israeli expansionism</h4>
              <p>“The acceptance of partition does not commit us to renounce
              Transjordan; one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision. We
              shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today. But the boundaries
              of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no
              external factor will be able to limit them.” <em>David Ben-Gurion, in 1936, quoted in Noam Chomsky, “The Fateful Triangle.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Expansionism — continued</h4>
              <p>“The main danger which Israel, as a ‘Jewish state’, poses to its own
              people, to other Jews and to its neighbors, is its ideologically
              motivated pursuit of territorial expansion and the inevitable series of
              wars resulting from this aim...No zionist politician has ever
              repudiated Ben-Gurion’s idea that Israeli policies must be based
              (within the limits of practical considerations) on the restoration of
              Biblical borders as the borders of the Jewish state.” <em>Israeli professor, Israel Shahak, “Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of 3000 Years.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Expansionism — continued</h4>
              <p>In Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharatt’s personal diaries, there is
              an excerpt from May of 1955 in which he quotes Moshe Dayan as follows:
              “[Israel] must see the sword as the main, if not the only, instrument
              with which to keep its morale high and to retain its moral tension.
              Toward this end it may, no — it must — invent dangers, and to do this
              it must adopt the method of provocation-and-revenge...And above all —
              let us hope for a new war with the Arab countries, so that we may
              finally get rid of our troubles and acquire our space.” <em>Quoted in Livia Rokach, “Israel’s Sacred Terrorism.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">But wasn’t the occupation of Arab lands necessary to protect Israel’s security?</h4>
              <p>“Senator [J.William Fulbright] proposed in 1970 that America should
              guarantee Israel’s security in a formal treaty, protecting her with
              armed forces if necessary. In return, Israel would retire to the
              borders of 1967. The UN Security Council would guarantee this
              arrangement, and thereby bring the Soviet Union — then a supplier of
              arms and political aid to the Arabs — into compliance. As Israeli
              troops were withdrawn from the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and the
              West Bank they would be replaced by a UN peacekeeping force. Israel
              would agree to accept a certain number of Palestinians and the rest
              would be settled in a Palestinian state outside Israel.</p>
              <p>“The plan drew favorable editorial support in the United States. The
              proposal, however, was flatly rejected by Israel. ‘The whole affair
              disgusted Fulbright,’ writes [his biographer Randall] Woods. ‘The
              Israelis were not even willing to act in their own self-interest.’” <em>Allan Brownfield in “Issues of the American Council for Judaism.” Fall 1997.[Ed.—This was one of many such proposals]</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">What happened after the 1967 war ended?</h4>
              <p>“In violation of international law, Israel has confiscated over 52
              percent of the land in the West Bank and 30 percent of the Gaza Strip
              for military use or for settlement by Jewish civilians...From 1967 to
              1982, Israel’s military government demolished 1,338 Palestinian homes
              on the West Bank. Over this period, more than 300,000 Palestinians were
              detained without trial for various periods by Israeli security forces. <em>“Intifada: The Palestinian Uprising Against Israeli Occupation,” ed. Lockman and Beinin.</em></p>

              <h1>Truths about the Six-Day War: U.S. CIA &amp; military secretly helped
              Israelis</h1>
              <h2><span class="tite">Mid-East Realities,</span> 11 June 1997</h2>
              <p>MER - Most of the lies and distortions about the Six Day War
              in 1967 when Israel occupied the Golan, West Bank, Gaza, and East
              Jerusalem, remain today 30 years later.</p>
              <p>The reality is that Israel encouraged and then took advantage of that
              war for many political, economic, and territorial reasons.  In the
              following column by Prof. Tanya Reinhart, she puts this into
              perspective in so far as Israel's attack on Syria and capture of the
              Golan in the last days of the war.</p>
              <p>What history still does not properly record are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Israel never was in military danger, the Israeli Army was
                 always aware they could overpowered all the Arab armies. </li>
              <li> The US CIA was greatly involved in providing Israel
              intelligence information that greatly helped them win the
              war in such a short time. </li>
              <li> US military personnel, disguised as civilians and on secret
              missions to which they were sworn to secrecy, helped the
              Israelis with specific technical and intelligence-gathering
              operations. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>There is also a considerable likelihood that in the years following
              the war the American CIA, cooperating with the Israeli Mossad,
              targeted Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, just as was the case
              with other anti-American leaders in other parts of the world.
              Nasser's death may have been one of the CIA's greatest and most secret
              successes.  Recent revelations in Washington of destroyed CIA
              files dealing with foreign assassinations in the 50s and 60s adds a
              further dimension to this serious possibility.]</p>
              <h2>Dayan admits Israel attacked Syria in land grab</h2>
              <h3>By Prof. Tanya Reinhart, translated from <span class="title">Yediot Aharonot,</span> 6 May 1997</h3>
              <p>In June, it would be 30 years to the war of 1967 - the war that
              brought about the occupation.  Governments have changed from Labor to
              Likud and back several times since then, and what has changed?</p>
              <p>Yediot Aharonot of April 27 has published an 1976 interview with Moshe
              Dayan (which was not previously published). Dayan, who was the defense
              minister in 1967, explains there what led, then, to the decision to
              attack Syria.  In the collective consciousness of the period, Syria
              was conceived as a serious threat to the security of Israel, and a
              constant initiator of aggression towards the residents of northern
              Israel. But according to Dayan, this is 'bull-shit' - Syria was not a
              threat to Israel before 67. Just drop it - he says as an answer
              to a question about the northern residences - I know how at least
              80% of all the incidents with Syria started.  We were sending a
              tractor to the demilitarized zone and we knew that the Syrians will
              shoot. If they did not shoot, we would instruct the tractor to go
              deeper, till the Syrians finally got upset and start shooting.  Then
              we employed artillery, and later also the air-force... I did that...
              and Itzhak Rabin did that, when he was there (as commander of the
              Northern front, in the early sixties).</p>
              <p>And what has led Israel to provoke Syria?  According to Dayan, this
              was the greediness for the land - the idea that it is possible to
              grab a piece of land and keep it, until the enemy will get tired and
              give it to us.  The Syrian land was, as he says, particularly
              tempting, since, unlike Gaza and the West bank it was not heavily
              populated.</p>
              <p>The 67 war has brought the big chance to grab the land, and along with
              the land, the water of the of the Jordan Riverheads. Dayan insists
              that the decision to attack Syria was not motivated by security
              reasons: You do not attack the enemy because he is a bastard, but
              because he threatens you, and the Syrians in the fourth day of the war
              were not threatening us.  He adds that the initiative of Colonel
              David Elazar to open the Syrian front was assisted by a delegation
              sent to prime-minister Eshkol by the Northern kibbutz's, who did
              not even try to hide their greediness to that land.</p>
              <p>In 1973, the Israeli society has paid, for the first time, a heavy
              price for the occupation - in the 'Yom Kippur' war.  The interview
              with Dayan was held three years after the defeat, and in that
              atmosphere, he explains that the decision to attack Syria was a
              mistake that will disable, in the future, peace with Syria.</p>
              <p>One could infer from Dayan's words that he would have, perhaps,
              supported, withdrawal from the Golan heights, but Rabin, his partner
              to the road of the Labor, has never changed his skin.  At the first
              period of his term as prime-minister, many believed that he is seeking
              an agreement with Syria.  But behind the halo of our saviour the
              peace-maker, there was the same land-greedy commander who sent the
              tractors to provoke the Syrians in the early sixties.</p>
              <p>In the tradition of all his predecessors, Rabin used the tactics of
              dragging negotiations: He agreed to discuss everything (the location
              of inspection points, the dates of opening embassies) except for the
              one issue that Syria was interested in - which lands Israel is willing
              to give up in the Golan.  While Rabin's one hand was spreading rumors
              about secret agreements, to pacify public opinion, his other hand was
              pouring unprecedented budgets for developing the Israeli settlements
              in the Golan Heights.  Apartments previously frozen were sold to
              anyone interested, and huge amounts of money were invested in
              developing foundation work and industry.  All Netanyahu had to do is
              pick the fruits.</p>
              <p>Thirty years after, the land-greedy are still stealing and
              appropriating it wherever possible - in the Golan heights, as in the
              West Bank. What we are left with are the words of Yifat Kastiel, whose
              twin sister was murdered recently in Wadi Kelet: They fight here
              all the time over pieces of land. But what importance could the land
              have, when the people who live here are so miserable?</p>

              <p><em>In the early hours of 5 June 1967, Israel attacked Egypt and
                  destroyed nearly its entire air force on the ground. On the Syrian-
                  Israeli border, Israel attempted to evict its inhabitants and provoked
                  a Syrian response. Already preluding the war, on 7 April 1967 the
                  Israeli air force attacked Syria, shooting down six planes, hitting
                  thirty fortified positions and killing about 100 people. By 10 June,
                  Israeli forces captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, along
                  with the Sinai and the Golan Heights. At the end of the war Israel had
                  succeeded in almost doubling the amount of territory it controlled.</em></p>
              <p>While
                  one third of Egypt's army was in Yemen and therefore unlikely to start
                  a war, Israel claimed to a believing world that the Arabs attacked
                  Israel and that Israel was in danger of annihilation. Both claims were
                  false. Israeli Air Force General Ezer Weizman declared that "there was
                  never any danger of extermination". [1]</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Almost a year
                  after the war, Israeli General Matityahu Peled said: "To pretend that
                  the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers were in a position to
                  threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the
                  intelligence of anyone capable of analysing this sort of situation, but
                  above all an insult to the Zahal [Israeli army].</strong></span>" [2]</p>
              <p>On
                  the Syrian-Israeli border, Israel was engaging in threats and
                  provocations. One such incident on 7 April 1967 in a major aerial
                  engagement between Israeli and Syrian planes. Six Syrian planes were
                  shot down. In an interview in May 1967, Yitzhak Rabin threatened to
                  overthrow the Syrian regime. Prime Minister Levi Eshkol reportedly said
                  that Israel "may have to teach Syria a sharper lesson than that of 7
                  April." [3] On May 14, Soviet and Egyptian intelligence reported a
                  massing of Israeli troops on the Syrian borders. [4]</p>
              <p>A
                  similar provocation against Jordan took place in November 1966, when
                  4,000 Israeli soldiers attacked Samu in the West Bank, and killing 18
                  Jordanian soldiers. The public justification for this action was to
                  prevent Palestinian infiltration," though at the time "the Jordanian
                  authorities did all they possibly could to stop infiltration,"
                  according to Odd Bull, chief of staff of UN forces at the time. [5]</p>
              <p>In
                  the course of the war more than 300,000 Palestinians were displaced,
                  half for a second time. [6] A smaller number of Palestinians were
                  internally displaced during the war, including Palestinians expelled
                  from the Old City of Jerusalem. Subsequent displacement and expulsion
                  of refugees has continued in 1967 occupied Palestine and in various
                  countries of exile. Most of them found refuge on the east bank of the
                  Jordan River along with the more than 400,000 who had fled there in
                  1948. More than 100,000 people, including 17,000 Palestinian refugees
                  registered with UNRWA, moved from the Golan Heights into Syria. [7] In
                  Jordan the refugee population increased by almost half. A small number
                  fled further northern into the part of Syria not occupied by Israeli
                  military forces, to Lebanon and Egypt. [8]</p>
              <p>On the side
                  of Egypt, Jordan and Syria the loss was 4,296 killed soldiers and 6,121
                  wounded. On the Israeli side the loss was 983 soldiers killed and 4,517
                  wounded. [9]</p>
              <p>About one million Palestinians remained in
                  those parts of Palestine occupied by Israel in 1967. As in 1948 in
                  conquered areas with large Palestinian populations, Israel established
                  a military government in West Bank and Gaza. The military government
                  prevented the return of refugees who had been displaced during the war
                  and also enabled Israel to take control of large amounts of land
                  without granting citizenship and civil and political rights to the
                  Palestinians living in these areas.</p>
              <p>In the immediate
                  wake of the June 1967 war, the Israel destroyed more than half a dozen
                  Arab villages in the West Bank. Villages such as Imwas, Yalu and Beit
                  Nuba in the Latrun area were destroyed and their inhabitants expelled.
                  The area of these villages was subsequently turned into a nature
                  reserve, Park Canada, which remains to this day a favorite Israeli
                  picnic spot.[10] In the old city of Jerusalem, Israel depopulated and
                  demolished the Mughrabi quarter adjacent to the Western Wall to make
                  room for a square. Israel also depopulated the villages of Beit Marsam,
                  Beit Awa, Jiftlik, and al-Burj as well as half the city of Qalqilya.
                  [11] Only those Palestinians (and their offspring) registered in
                  Israelï¿½s September 1967 census of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the
                  Gaza Strip were considered legal residents of the 1967 OPTs. The
                  administrative measure effectively prevented most Palestinian refugees
                  displaced in 1967 from returning to their homes.</p>
              <p>In
                  occupied eastern Jerusalem, Israel disbanded the local municipal
                  council and extended Israeli law and jurisdiction. The military
                  government in West Bank and Gaza and the municipal order imposed on
                  eastern Jerusalem controlled the Palestinian population by policies of
                  separation and isolation.</p>
              <p>A year after Israel occupied
                  the remaining part of Palestine it began to establish settlements in
                  these areas. In 1979 the UN Security Council determined in <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/bytopic/historicaldocuments/52.shtml">Resolution 446</a> that the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in
                  the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no
                  legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a
                  comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>

                will be a revolutionary turn which will ... justify far reaching conclusions, but for the

                and expressing my opinion on current political affairs so as not to make things difficult
                for the government in any way. And if you hadn't called on me, the three of you, yourself,
                Lavon and Dayan, I would not have, of my own accord, expressed an opinion on what is being
                done or what ought to be done. But as you called me, I deem it my duty to comply with your
                wishes, and especially with your own wish as Prime Minister. Therefore, I permit myself to
                go back to one issue which you did not approve of and discuss it again, and this is the
                issue of Lebanon.</p>
              <p>........<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.<strong>It is clear that Lebanon is the weakest link in the Arab League.</strong> </span>The other
                minorities in the Arab States are all Muslim, except for the Copts. But Egypt is the most
                compact and solid of the Arab States and the majority there consists of one solid block,
                of one race, religion and language, and the Christian minority does not seriously affect
                their political and national unity. Not so the Christians in Lebanon. They are a majority
                in the historical Lebanon and this majority has a tradition and a culture different from
                those of the other components of the League. Also within the wider borders (this was the
                worst mistake made by France when it extended the borders of Lebanon), the Muslims are not
                free to do as they wish, even if they are a majority there (and I don't know if they are,
                indeed, a majority) for fear of the Christians, The creation of a Christian State is
                therefore a natural act; it has historical roots and it will find support in wide circles
                in the Christian world, both Catholic and Protestant. In normal times this would be almost
                impossible. First and foremost because of the lack of initiative and courage of the
                Christians. But at times of confusion, or revolution or civil war, things take on another
                aspect, and even the weak declares himself to be a hero. Perhaps (there is never any
                certainty in politics) now is the time to bring about the creation of a Christian State in
                our neighborhood. Without our initiative and our vigorous aid this will not be done. It
                seems to me that this is the central duty - for at least one of the central duties, of our
                foreign policy. This means that time, energy and means ought to be invested in it and that
                we must act in all possible ways to bring about a radical change in Lebanon. Sasson ...
                and our other Arabists must be mobilized. If money is necessary, no amount of dollars
                should be spared, although the money may be spent in vain. We must concentrate all our
                efforts on this issue ........ This is a historical opportunity. Missing it will be
                unpardonable. There is no challenge against the World Powers in this ........Everything
                should be done, in my opinion, rapidly and at full steam.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The goal will not be reached of course, without a restriction of Lebanon's borders. But
                if we can find men in Lebanon and exiles from it who will be ready to mobilize for the
                creation of a Maronite state, extended borders and a large Muslim population will be of no
                use to them and this will not constitute a disturbing factor.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I don't know if we have people in Lebanon-but there are various ways in which the
                proposed experiment can be carried out.</p>

              <p>Like previous war for example:</p>
              <p>It was a classic setting for international intrigue, a tile-roofed
              villa secluded among fog-swirled trees, ivy clinging to building wings
              clustered around a stunted steeple-like tower. The first group of
              conspirators landed at a French airfield outside Paris and reached the
              wall-enclosed villa in an unmarked car during the wee hours of October
              22, 1956. Later that Monday morning, French Foreign Minister Christian
              Pineau visited his office in Paris, then was chauffeured home to switch
              to his personal car. He soon was at the villa shaking hands with
              Israel’s 70-year-old Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, eye-patched Chief
              of Staff Moshe Dayan and Defense Ministry Director-General Shimon
              Peres. British Foreign Minister Selwyn Lloyd, a key member of the third
              group of plotters, called his office in London to say he was staying
              home with a cold. He left England shortly after, to arrive at the villa
              that afternoon.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By the time the tense clandestine
              discussions–which also included French Premier Guy Mollet and British
              Prime Minister Anthony Eden–ended two days later in France and England,
              a secret accord had been reached. </strong></span>Champagne glasses were raised to
              celebrate a tripartite pledge to pursue what one chronicler called ‘the
              shortest and possibly silliest war in history.’ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The target was Gamal
              Abdel Nasser’s Egypt, which had become the symbol of Arab nationalism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Israel,
              still territorially insecure after 8 1/2 years of existence among
              hostile Arab neighbors and cut off from access to the Red Sea by a
              blockade, had agreed to launch a pre-emptive invasion of Egypt’s
              24,000-square-mile Sinai Peninsula on October 29. </strong></span>In response to that
              ‘threat’ to the strategically important <span id="high_1" class="searchterm1">Suez</span> Canal, Britain and France would step in the next day to give the
              belligerents 12 hours to stop fighting, pull back from the strategic
              waterway and accept temporary occupation of ‘key positions on the
              Canal’ to ‘guarantee freedom of passage.’ That ultimatum, so obviously
              favorable to Israel, was designed to be rejected by Nasser. Then, on
              October 31–following a ‘decent interval’ for Egypt’s rejection of the
              ultimatum–Britain and France would launch airstrikes against the
              Egyptians. Invasion forces would then land long enough afterward to
              lend plausibility to the scenario...</p>
