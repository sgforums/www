              <p>http://geraldgiam.sg/2009/10/hdb-should-be-neutral-and-stop-playing-politics/</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>HDB should be neutral and stop playing politics</strong></span><br> <br> I am glad to learn that the opposition held wards of Hougang and Potong
              Pasir will finally be getting lift upgrading for their HDB blocks. This
              is a long overdue measure for the residents of the two constituencies,
              which have been strongholds of the opposition since 1991 and 1984
              respectively.<br> <br> Singaporeans will recall that on the eve of the polling day in 1997, then-<strong><span style="color: red;">Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong warned voters that opposition estates risked becoming “slums” if they continued voting out the PAP</span></strong>. Thus started a pattern of <span style="color: red;"><strong>Third World pork barrel politics of the ruling PAP</strong></span>,
              which culminated in the 2006 election when PAP candidates Eric Low and
              Sitoh Yih Pin boasted that caretaker National Development Minister Mah
              Bow Tan had promised the two wards a total of $180 million for
              upgrading if residents voted for the PAP.<br> <br> Fortunately, voters were too sophisticated and principled to fall for
              the PAP’s dirty tactics of using taxpayer money to advance their
              partisan political ends. Hougang and Potong Pasir voters proved that
              they could not be so easily swayed by money and election goodies by
              re-electing Mr Low Thia Khiang (Workers’ Party) and Mr Chiam See Tong
              (Singapore Democratic Alliance), the former with a record high winning
              margin.<br> <br> Three-and-a-half years after those embarrassing defeats, the PAP has
              realised that such underhanded tactics don’t work. So now they’ve taken
              a different tack by promising lift upgrading to these wards just as the
              next election looms.<br> <br> TODAY newspaper reported that the PAP’s losing candidate Sitoh had
              received an email from HDB informing him of this news. He lost no time
              in breaking the good news to residents through a news release. Mr Eric
              Low plans to announce the news today at a grassroots event. In
              addition, Mr Sitoh said he will be sending out a circular to residents
              in the selected blocks soon, presumably with his own letterhead
              proclaiming himself as the “adviser to the Potong Pasir grassroots
              organisations”.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I see no reason why the HDB should
              break the news to the losing PAP candidates. Does the HDB inform losing
              opposition candidates of impending upgrading in the wards they
              contested in, for example in East Coast or Tampines? Definitely not!</strong></span><br> <br> So why the double standard? Is it to give a chance to the PAP’s losing
              candidates to be like Santa Claus bearing good gifts for residents as
              if it came from them?<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The PAP’s Eric Low claimed that
              the upgrading “is a result of our efforts over the years”. What utter
              rubbish! It was the Workers’ Party’s Low Thia Khiang who had asked in
              Parliament after the 2006 elections for the promised $100 million to be
              released to Hougang for upgrading. But the National Development
              Minister stoutly refused, saying that the funds were conditional on
              voters choosing the PAP.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Knowing full well that the PAP’s intention was to
              put opposition wards at the end of the upgrading queue, Hougang Town
              Council had previously gone ahead to upgrade the lifts at the blocks on
              Hougang Avenue 3 and 7 at the cost of some $400,000 to $500,000 of the
              Town Council’s own funds.</strong></span> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A
              mere seven years later, HDB simply demolished those upgraded blocks,
              and refused to reimburse Hougang Town Council the costs for the
              unexpired cyclical period.</strong></span><br> <br> In fact, HDB’s informing of the PAP’s losing candidates of the upcoming
              upgrading is just the tip of the iceberg of the agency’s history of
              partisan political manoeuvring.<br> <br> After winning the 1991 elections and assuming the chairmanship of
              Hougang Town Council, the WP’s Low was immediately served by the HDB
              with a notice to quit the premises at Blk 810 Hougang Central, which
              was then occupied by the PAP’s Hougang Town Council. HDB also served
              him with a notice of termination of its services as the managing agent
              for Hougang Town Council. Despite this, the new Town Council managed to
              overcome the obstacles put in its way, built a new premise within 6
              weeks, and took over the management of Hougang estate from the HDB on
              1st January 1992.<br> <br> Without an office to operate from and to manage the estate, Low then
              took on the task of building and completing, within six weeks, the
              Hougang Town Council’s office. It is now located at Block 701 Hougang
              Avenue 2. He also successfully put together a team of councillors and
              staff to manage and maintain Hougang estate. Together, they took over
              the management of Hougang estate from the HDB on 1st January 1992.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The HDB should stop letting itself
              become a political tool of the ruling PAP. This is not the way a
              taxpayer funded statutory board should operate. Residents of non-PAP
              wards pay their income taxes and GST, and do their national service
              just like the rest of us. They should not be discriminated against.</strong></span><br> <br> I call on HDB chairman Koh Cher Siang, HDB CEO Tay Kim Poh, Ministry of
              National Development permanent secretary Tan Tee How and all the good
              officers working under them to exercise their rightful independence and
              neutrality as civil servants and resist attempts by the PAP ministers
              (or any future government ministers) to pressure them into executing
              decisions that benefit the party and not the people.<br> <br> ---------------------<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">For more alternative news, pls visit <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a></span><br> <br> .</p>

              <p>I said before, they should have zoning, land slated for residential or commerical. They should not based land on commercial or private residential cost. Definitely commercial properties yield higher returns than residential, if so, then the whole of Singapore won't have public housing.</p>

              <p>Ya true,the price of HDB flats are really shocking nowadays.And the HDB still have to ask u every month earn how much,if u are asking for a loan from them.In the past,there is no such rule when u loan money from them.</p>
              <p>Oh Wait,didnt LKY promise Singaporeans that every citizen that live in this country will has his/her own flat?But now the flat price is so high,n HDB loans are strict,and not all ppl can afford it.So where is the promise?Isnt that contradicting from what he has promised in the past?</p>
              <p>How come his successors like GCT n LHL want to impose such strict rules n raise the HDB flats so high?Is it becoz he n his cabinets choose his successors wrongly?</p>
