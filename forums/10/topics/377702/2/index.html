              <p>Ya true,the price of HDB flats are really shocking nowadays.And the HDB still have to ask u every month earn how much,if u are asking for a loan from them.In the past,there is no such rule when u loan money from them.</p>
              <p>Oh Wait,didnt LKY promise Singaporeans that every citizen that live in this country will has his/her own flat?But now the flat price is so high,n HDB loans are strict,and not all ppl can afford it.So where is the promise?Isnt that contradicting from what he has promised in the past?</p>
              <p>How come his successors like GCT n LHL want to impose such strict rules n raise the HDB flats so high?Is it becoz he n his cabinets choose his successors wrongly?</p>

              <p>I only ask you a simple question. How much do you think a HDB flat, say 4 room flat SHOULD cost to you, and not how much does a HDB flat cost. Yet you asked me in return with something else.</p>
              <p>As a fellow citizen, I too am concerned about such prices, because if it becomes too high, families cannot get started, overcrowding will occur or our young indebted to the hilt.</p>
              <p>One way to ensure that this does not happen is to ensure:-</p>
              <p><br>a. The maximum ceiling for citizens purchasing public housing be capped below $8,000 monthly salary to ensure the well off do not expliot public housing whereby they can afford private property. HDB is and must be keep affordable for the less afluent in our society.</p>
              <p>b. Loans must be extended to the new couples formed to start families, and its repayments must not be such that it takes up more than their combine salary, leaving nothing to live on,let alone have savings.</p>
              <p>c. For those who have lower income, must have access to cheaper varieties such as 4 room units or if necessary, return to 3 room units.</p>
              <p>d. And for those who are really down and out, cannot afford even the cheapest flat type, they must at least have access to cheap rental small unit flats.</p>
              <p>This is and had always been HDB's as well as our society's policy for years and more years to come. No one is to be left homeless in our egalitarian society.</p>
              <p>So far, none had ever been marginalised. I too want a big and cheap flat, with more money balanced to my account for my own spending, but that would be at the expense of my other less afluent citizens as well as future generations.</p>
              <p>Next, if govt should sell flats at cheaper prices  way below market values, I am sure you will see what will happen to the older flats owners and banks. Disaster awaits.</p>
              <p>And dont expect those new owners who got it cheap from the govt will sell cheap after 5 years. They will demand high prices too, or market prices. Someone will have to pay, and it will be our next generation greatly burdened.</p>
              <p>They only pay back what they owed to CPF, which in the end is their money. But the profits from the sale lines the owners wallets, not to society.</p>
              <p>There is only so much space our country can build flats, and the demand is high daily. The solution now is to spend on researching advance technology to build even higher but safe storeyed flat units to maximise space.</p>
              <p>Whatever 'profits' there are goes back to our treasury, and not to HDB as it is not a private agency but a stat board to serve the PEOPLE. Those money belongs to our next generations to assist them in owning homes - either for research, better service, building more flats or subsidies, and serves as a common pool for social spending.</p>
              <p>Whomever that you had heard profits from sale of HDB flats lining the wallets of ministers, please ask him/her to show evidence, or you are being made a fool of and you dont even realize it.</p>
              <p>I am not from HDB. They would be the better ones to explain to you. I can only offer you a brief insight to its policies, which is in line with what our society fairly needs in the interest of all, of which you and I are its equal members by birthright.</p>

              <p>Can one who is not from the HDB give any accurate insight to its policies that will give any answers to the primary concern of this thread about how much a HDB flat should cost to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Or has the bankrupt mind of a X-rat simply plagiarized PAPa's strategy of answering simple question by leading us through a tour of all its policies to simply obfuscate the issue and leave everyone none the wiser ?</p>
              <p>Has the answer been given by the X-rated effort made in a plagiarized "Wall of Text" format that is void of any relevant substance to the question asked ?</p>
              <p>A more honest effort would have been to refer to the previous thread in this Speaker's Corner - titled : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/374180?amp%3Bpage=1"><strong>Cost of building HDB flats – finally an answer ? </strong>(*1) </a></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore Exchange’s mainboard-listed BBR Holdings has secured a S$104.2-million contract from the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) to build seven blocks of flats in Yishun Neighbourhood 4.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The work comprises 864 homes, a Child Care Centre, a roof garden, communal amenities and site works, as well as contingency works.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since there will be 864 HDB flats, the average cost per flat, inclusive of communal amenities, site works and contingency works, is about <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$120,602</span></span></strong> ($104.2 million divided by 864 flats).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the latest HDB new 4-room flats at Punggol (Punggol Residences BTO) selling at an average price of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$293,000</span></strong> (price range of $264,000 to $322,000 divided by 2), does it mean that the HDB stands to make <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a profit of about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$172,398</span> per flat</strong></span>, or a profit margin of about <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">143 per cent</span></strong> ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The project will be carried out in 10 phases and is expected to be completed by 2012.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One should consider that the government had utilised CPF funds borrowed at low interest rate of 2.5 per cent per annum to build these HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Selling these flats to Singaporeans at such high profit margins, will mean that the money is borrowed at no cost.</p>
              <p>Selling these flats at such high profit margins to the HDB can only result in the entire CPF savings being used to purchase the HDB unit, with nothing left for retirement.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore "asset rich and cash poor" - when the "asset" is an artificially high priced HDB unit that transfer the CPF savings to the Government Treasury ?</p>
              <p>This is day-light robbery, which CASE cannot even dare to represent the interests of all Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Why dare not be responsible for such statement? Having doubts even herself? Or need a fool to say it on her behalf?</p>

              <p>Unlike the X-rat who is only prepared to be vain by plagiarizing the works and words from others to be its own - does the X-rat know how to be honest by giving recognition to the effort of others who have finally succeeded to throw some light into the REAL COSTS of what the PAPa has never dared to give ?</p>
              <p>How can anyone teach a kiddie who pretend to be an adult the "basic social skills" that it is only polite NOT to plagiarize the works and words from others, and that when one quote any piece of work, one should always give the credit to that person.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the stoooopidity can come only from a hopelessly bankrupt mind that have no understanding of simple courtesy.</p>
              <p>Can we leave it to the ingenuity of a X-rat to even plagiarize the creative insult from a hog that is familiar with its own turd ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, the X-rat do not even possess the skill to come up with its own X-rated insult.</p>
              <p>Did the tsunami wash through the X-spot where you stand, and washed everything clean out of you ?</p>
              <p>Did the new brain reject you after the old teeny one got washed out ?</p>

              <p>Well,looking at the HDB flats price now,i would say a 4 room flat should sell around $250000-$260000.But currently,the price of such units,especially in central area where transportations are more convenient like Toa Payoh,AMK,Bishan etc,cost around $330000.</p>
              <p>I think its quite high,consider our economy recovery are slow,n our paid raise also minimal,unless u work in a Government company with prominent post.</p>
              <p>Also,xtreyier,if u are so concern about Atobe quoting from other source construction cost of flats.Then u might as well send in a letter to HDB n request them to declare the construction cost of the flats,problem solved!!!</p>
              <p>Maybe from ur enthusiastic n relentless defend of HDB here,they might be touched by u and declare the whole construction price data transparently to the public.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>HDB flats are made 'affordable' to the public, with profits in mind!</strong></p>
              <p>Source : Business Times, <span style="color: #ff0000;">12 Dec 2007</span><br> <br> LETTER TO THE EDITOR<br> New HDB flat prices based on market prices of resale flats<br> Email this article<br> Print article<br> Feedback<br> <br> I REFER to the letter, Since when did resale prices decide cost of
                                      HDB flat? (BT, Nov 30) by Lu Keehong.<br> <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The prices of new HDB flats are based on the market prices of
                                      resale HDB flats, and not their costs of construction.</strong></span> In order to
                                      provide affordable housing to Singaporean families, new HDB flats
                                      are priced below their equivalent market values. In this way, new
                                      flat buyers can enjoy a substantial subsidy. This point has been
                                      explained in Parliament and reported in the media on many
                                      occasions.<br> <br> As resale prices move up, so do new flat prices. Similarly, when
                                      resale prices move down, as happened during the property market
                                      downturn in recent years, the prices of new HDB flats were also
                                      reduced significantly.<br> <br> By selling new flats with a market subsidy, HDB has been unable to
                                      recover the development cost of new flats. HDB has incurred an
                                      average deficit of $457 million a year in its home ownership
                                      programme in the last five years. These figures are reported in

              <p>Well,looking at the HDB flats price now,i would say a 4 room flat should sell around $250000-$260000.But currently,the price of such units,especially in central area where transportations are more convenient like Toa Payoh,AMK,Bishan etc,cost around $330000.</p>
              <p>I think its quite high,consider our economy recovery are slow,n our paid raise also minimal,unless u work in a Government company with prominent post.</p>
              <p>Also,xtreyier,if u are so concern about Atobe quoting from other source construction cost of flats.Then u might as well send in a letter to HDB n request them to declare the construction cost of the flats,problem solved!!!</p>
              <p>Maybe from ur enthusiastic n relentless defend of HDB here,they might be touched by u and declare the whole construction price data transparently to the public.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
