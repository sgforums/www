              <p>Is the X-rat capable of posting anything of significance or consequence in any of its responses or threads ?</p>
              <p>When the X-rat begin addressing others in "feminine" terms, it clearly shows that it is losing its center line of blurred thoughts.</p>
              <p>The resident Commando had referred to the X-rat as 'Nancy' - perhaps its lesbianism will calm its senses and stop it from sniffing out its own kind ?</p>

              <p>Why can't HDB just lease the flats to people on a term and need basis at a fraction of the market installment rate ?</p>
              <p>Why are people made to pay UPFRONT for 99 years of lease and need to borrow from banks to do so ?</p>
              <p>Answer : GREED.</p>
              <p>If HDB will let young family start up pay $500/mth for a 3 room flat, and have them return the flat to HDB, then lease a bigger flat when the baby comes along, at the same price.</p>
              <p>When they become empty nesters, they return the bigger flats to HDB and go live in a 1 bedroom or 2 bedroom flat.</p>
              <p>Families pay a standard fixed lease rate their whole life cycle. ( adjusted for inflation)</p>
              <p>Tis way resale and skyrocketing pricing problem woulda be eliminated.</p>
              <p>The current HDB market pricing policy is obviously class/income discrimination, and does nothing to encourage people to have more babies.On the contrary it makes people to NOT want to have more babies. As more babies, need more room = more expensive.</p>
              <p>The allocation of type of flats should not be "who can afford".  Rather, should be "need" based according to which part of a family life cycle you are in.</p>

              <p>Winning or losing doesn't really matter to me - people who have been in the forums long enough know my style of posting and why I respond the way I respond.</p>

              <p>I ocassionally give my views on some of the issues raised in Speaker's Corner, albeit in a more humourous or light hearted way.  I don't expect anybody to agree with me and likely one or two others will have a totally different view - does it really matter to me? No.</p>

              <p>Why can't HDB just lease the flats to people on a term and need basis at a fraction of the market installment rate ?</p>
              <p>Why are people made to pay UPFRONT for 99 years of lease and need to borrow from banks to do so ?</p>
              <p>Answer : GREED.</p>
              <p>The current HDB market pricing policy is obviously class/income discrimination, and does nothing to encourage people to have more babies.On the contrary it makes people to NOT want to have more babies. As more babies, need more room = more expensive.</p>

              <p>I have to agree on that.Not only having more rooms are much more expensive,if u have a bigger house unit,the calculation of electricity n water fees are also higher than smaller unit.That is another reason why Singaporeans say :"NO BABIES" to our sh!tty PAP government.</p>
