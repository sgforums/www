            <div class='col-md body'>The bulb thingy, telling us tat something create us just because human creates the bulb is silly... only man made things r created by human and your example is true only for them. If u ask tat way then u have to ask wat creates our creator ? Then wat creates our creator creator ? I guess your answer will be tat is not something for us to know or tat we r unable to know because we r too stupid. Tat is unfair argument as I can answer in the same way as u do, which made us stagnant and never improve our knowledge.<br><br>Talking about creator, u have to agree eventually something is "created"  not by some will of intelligent beings but happened due to some events (big bang, starting of life) no one control.<br><br>And might as well believe tat we r created by some event no intelligent being control but due to some freaks of nature tat happened because all evidence pointed tat way.<br><br>U know why most successful, or I say all religion tell people about life after death ? Because only tat way can they make people have a reason to believe as they wanted to believe. They r scared as death is a frightening thought. Religion give them hope, though achieved by telling white lies.<br><br>The second traits of most religion is tat they give extra favours or priviledge if they believe in them. A lot believe in faith because if they believe withotu doubts, then they will have a higher chance of being guided in life, getting healed or going into heaven. Tat is one reason religion sucks because it just show how unfair and vain tat God is. It is like doing charity and telling all the people about it. They have other motives than really helping out !!!<br><br>There r many religion in the world, why only reward people tat do it in a certan way while treat others who lives an equally pious life differently. Can u really blame them for following the wrong path since no evidence is given to any sides ?<br><br>Anyway about the frogs and well story, I interprete it as man have to keep striving to improve science and not stagnant in religion and sink into it<br><br>P.S: About bagua thingy, I say he ate during Parent Visiting Day ONLY !!! U have parents tat visit u then and brought food for u then isn't it ??</div>

GOD the Almighty. GOD the Merciful, GOD the Powerful. GOD the Forgiving.<br><br>These are the spirit of the ability of MAN itself.<br><br>The power of Man's brains and hands CREATES, and has the ALMIGHTY POWER to destroy, to be MERCIFUL, and FORGIVING.<br><br>These are the essence of Man's eternal behavior that are forgotten in Man's own weakness in vainly refusing to accept his limited role of his short life span of - more or less - 70 years on this earth.<br><br>Forgive me, kyas, as I have no intention to destroy or persuade you from your own faithful belief in your religion, nor do I wish to persuade anyone else from their own religion.<br><br>Electricity in the bulb is the LIFE Force, and the Brilliance from the electric light bulb is your "soul", which is your CONCIOUSNESS - as in your being awake and moving and seeing, and which allow others to respond to your presence.<br><br>When the 'electricity' is turned off, or when the filament in the light bulb is spent, the bulb is no longer of use.<br><br>However, the living will still be able to remember the warmth of the past luminiscence that the "bulb" has given.<br><br>The spent bulb will be turned into powder and returned to earth, where it came from - in the first place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then how does Creator get created ? I follow your same argument tat bulb is made by human, commisioned by human and "recycled" by human. Surely something as great as God is must be admistered by something isn't it ? If he does not need admistration, then why does human need administration ?<br><br>Anyway another point about soul thingy. Why does soul have to be so invisible, so silent, so devoid of any influence to heat, electricity, so secretive, so undetectable tat nobody ever can prove its existence and the only way for it to be relevant is when u died. Why does God have to make soul such ? Why don't him make it more detectable so tat others will believe in it more easily, which is good for everybody. U cannot blame me for not believing it as I felt the most logical answer is because there is no such thing as soul.<br><br>There r people tat r crazy and idiot from birth. R u trying to say tat they have defects in their souls ? Those with trauma tat make them crazy, r u trying to say tat soul became unstable if abused ?<br><br>Adobe is right, soul is just your impressive brain at work<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as i have consistently mentioned before, i do not critisized others for what they believe. and i do not blame any body for looking for logical answers. i was just asking for opinion from the non believers especially from my friend Atobe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>and we have to accept the fact that there are things that are just unexplainable scientifically e.g. the use of sixth sense, the ghost, the floating yoga guru, soul etc. we just have to continuously look for the answers with our own different ways. adios!</div>
