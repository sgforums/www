              <p>I'm sure the contracts pretty much say the same thing. whenever bank customers buy a product, there's this form that customers sign indemifying the bank for any losses incurred.</p>
              <p>i've heard that courts are usually more sympathetic to the customers in scenarios like these though.</p>

              <p>How Lehman could be remotely culpable in this entire issue is beyond me. Just to clarify some issues which some folks without extensive knowledge might not get the full picture.</p>
              <p>The minibond was a financial product <strong><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">structured by Lehman</span></em></strong> which other financial institutions (think your local banks like DBS in Singapore) around the world bought into and, in turn, sold to investors (the very people crying foul now). Hence, it makes perfect sense that the investors - whether justified or not - should go after whichever institutions sold them the product because ultimately, Lehman never dealt with these individuals (these small-time investors - by industry standards - would never get a look-in by Lehman to begin with). Clearly, financial institutions that bought the minibonds knew full well what they were buying into and, by extension, so should have been the retail investors who bought them from these financial institutions.</p>
              <p>To drive home the point, imagine having a piece of toxic plastic manufactured by a factory in remote China that in turn sells it to Mattel which utilises it to manufacture toys. Now, should an end-user be poisoned for coming into contact with the toxic plastic, it would make perfect sense for them to go after Mattel (instead of the factory), wouldn't it?</p>

              <p>actually, i understand this abit differently. DBS, Hong Leong, and Maybank in this scenario acted as distributors on behalf of Lehmen Bros. Lehmen had these CDOs, in the form of securitised assets, and they were looking to sell them so they can get cash and re-leverage. In return for selling these MiniBonds, the 3 banks would get a distibutor's fee of about 0.5% of amount sold. (i'm not too sure about the exact amount)</p>
              <p>in this scenario, to say that Lehmen is not culpable might not be entirely correct. But i agree with your Mattel scenario.</p>

              <p>So how is Lehman culpable? Are you for a moment suggesting they plotted and schemed their own bankruptcy? You might wish to figure how much it has caused the industry in settling CDS on Lehman following its collapse.</p>
              <p>The fact that Lehman structured this product renders their position no different from a corporate bond issuer - any investor (be they institutional or individuals) knows full well (or at least, are expected to do so) the risk they are taking on.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the flimsy case in this saga surrounds whether the retail investors (end-users who bought the product through a proxy and not through the originator) were mis-led. Clearly, in light of that, it's the intermediaries and proxies (in this case, the FIs that sold the product on to individual investors) who are accountable to the end-users who buy their product, and not the originator.</p>
              <p>Are you therefore not ridiculously contradictory to suggest you agree with my Mattel scenario, but not Lehman considering Lehman never actually dealt with these individuals?</p>

              <p>it's quite subjective, it's like pressing a reboot button when things go awry....sure there are the less savvy and uneducated about such products...to claim miselling is totally inaccurate too, for institutions like lehman, who would have thought it would end up bankrupt? the sales rep probably just passd on their impressions too....assuming one were sold dbs minibonds years ago, the average sg citizen has huge confidence in the bank and should it suddenly go under, is this considered miselling when the buyer was told how solid the bank was then?</p>

              <p>I really agree with dinky's and dukedracula point of view. To me, investment is like gambling. You place a bet hoping that the bet will win you something. Otherwise you lose. So you invest on something hoping that this something can give you profit. If not, then that's too bad.</p>
              <p>If the banks have 80 million to spare, then they should have given it to those who really need it, i.e. the poor. I mean, if a person has 100K to invest, that means that this person must be well off. I don't believe that by investing 100K, this person has to live solely on bread everyday and stay in a one-bedroom HDB flat. And I am sure these people are not that stupid to put every single cent of their life savings in one basket. I am sure that after investing 100K, this person is still able to live comfortably. So sure, now this person is 100K poorer, but he is still able to live comfortably. So why should he be compensated just because he has lost his bet big time?</p>
              <p>This 80 million is better off used in helping those who really has to eat bread everyday, who is really hit by the inflation such that even a 5 cent increase in bus fare is tough for them, who has difficulty making ends meet.</p>

              <p>I really agree with dinky's and dukedracula point of view. To
              me, investment is like gambling. You place a bet hoping that the
              bet will win you something. Otherwise you lose. So you invest on
              something hoping that this something can give you profit. If not,
              then that's too bad.</p>
              <p>If the banks have 80 million to spare, then they should have
              given it to those who really need it, i.e. the poor. I mean,
              if a person has 100K to invest, that means that this
              person must be well off. I don't believe that by investing 100K,
              this person has to live solely on bread everyday and stay in a
              one-bedroom HDB flat. And I am sure these people are not that
              stupid to put every single cent of their life savings in one
              basket. I am sure that after investing 100K, this person is
              still able to live comfortably. So sure, now this person is 100K
              poorer, but he is still able to live comfortably. So why should he
              be compensated just because he has lost his bet big
              time?</p>
              <p>This 80 million is better off used in helping those who
              really has to eat bread everyday, who is really hit by
              the inflation such that even a 5 cent increase in bus fare is tough
              for them, who has difficulty making ends meet.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>i think on average, local banks made about S$2 billion (in profits, not revenue) each last year. $80 million might look like alot on an absolute front but pales when you compare it to their annual profit.</p>

              <p>You're either misguided or misled - I haven't got a clue where you got your lot of drivel from.</p>
              <p>For the record, the minibonds were structured by Lehman Brothers and sold to retail investors worldwide via proxies. HSBC has been acting as the trustee (and not your simple "DBS, Maybank, HL were paid a distributor's fee by Lehman") for this product. If you haven't got a clue on the trustee's role in this whole affair, you might want to check out the following statement from Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission for starters : <a href="http://www.sfc.hk/sfcPressRelease/EN/sfcOpenDocServlet?docno=08PR145">http://www.sfc.hk/sfcPressRelease/EN/sfcOpenDocServlet?docno=08PR145</a> .</p>
              <p>Even after ignoring some of the rather rational comments posted by someone above this post suggesting the investors wouldn't have refunded additional dividends had their investment yielded surplus returns, suggesting Lehman is even remotely responsible is downright ridiculous.</p>
              <p>After all, if there is any misrepresentation and mis-selling on the end of the retail investors, it's conducted by the proxies (DBS, etc); in other words, Lehman never established any sort of direct contact with these investors. At best, it's these proxies who hold the moral obligation (whether this is substantial remains open to debate) to account to the retail investors since they knew very well the products they were dealing with.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, using a more appropriate example. If you bought a desktop from Dell through a retailer to whom you would send it to for servicing during the warranty period (where the product is still effectively guaranteed by Dell), and Dell happens to become insolvent before your warranty expires and your desktop encounters problems during the remaining period of the warranty, are you for a moment suggesting Dell too is culpable of shortchanging you since they too, as the PC manufacturer, should be aware of the risks involved in the system breaking down?</p>

                      any sort of direct contact with these investors. At best, it's
                      these proxies who hold the moral obligation (whether this is
                      substantial remains open to debate) to account to the retail

              <p>i agree with the part the the proxies should partake in the responsibility toward the retail investor. what i am saying is that lehmen should hold some responsibility too. let's assume they are still around now and instead of going bankrupt, they defaulted on these minibonds. would people blame them? are they responsible? i would say .. yes, definitely.</p>
              <p>i see what you are trying to say. u are saying that lehmen shouldn't be held responsible because they are just a packager of these products and they played no part in this mis-selling/misrepresentation by the local financial institutions. what im saying is these securitised assets were ultimately their assets (and probably that of a few other institutions).they knew the risks involved, they knew they were very highly leveraged, but because securitising assets, selling them and getting cash back so they can write loans to securitise again were so profitable, they decided to keep doing it.</p>
              <p>whether or not Lehmen were responsible to the retail investors is another question. i think not because the local institutions should take up that responsibility. but lehmen should be responsible to someone.</p>

              <p><span>On Channelnewasia, Tan KL said the saga boils
              down to ethic. On TV, he can only say this.</span></p>
              <p><span>For the past 7 to 10 years, there were periodic
              but frequent reports about the unethical, forced or pressured
              selling behaviour of the major banks. This issue never dies
              but surfaces again and again.</span></p>
              <p><span>The repeated official lines from the
              authority were it has investigated the involving banks, found
              no breach of the law and has advised the banks to exercise
              care and caution. In other words, status quo.</span></p>
              <p><span>These complaints, media report and letter to the
              press, were ample warning signs for MAS to clean up the act of
              these banks. Instead, MAS overlooking the re-occurrence nature
              of this issue and repeatedly claimed that enough has been done,
              enough check and balance has been in placed.</span></p>
              <p><span>If the heart of issue is really about ethic or
              about global economy integration as some claimed, so be it – a
              disaster unavoidable. But if MAS had acted on these complains by
              supervising the banks more stringently, the result would be vastly
              different.</span></p>
              <p><span>I disagree with those who said that the govt
              should not bear the responsibility for the loss, or at least part
              of this loss. Had our forever-claiming-to-efficient govt and MAS
              stepped in and intervened in a timely manner, the issue would not
              have been as it is now.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, I also see another aspect to this saga.
              For MAS to admit that it has not been doing a good job, would open
              up a whole new political dimension.</span></p>
              <p><span>LHL claimed that he would loosen up the political
              climate here. This would be a good test for him to put his word
              where his mouth is. But given our one party state, given our
              compliant media, given our no-question-ask citizen, this issue
              would never see the light of the day.</span></p>

              <p><br>The whole point about your logic that sounds ridiculous is the notion that Lehman is culpable and should be accountable to someone. In the given circumstances, it's as ridiculous as it gets. (For the record, there's clearly no precedence of any insolvent corporation that fits the bill you describe in any part of the civilised world)</p>
              <p>You're talking about a firm that has filed the largest bankruptcy (and one which has done so in the course of conducting their business, not through some fraudulent activities) in US history here, not a conartist that has become a fly-by-night merchant.</p>
              <p>If you were to buy any equities or corporate bonds and should the company go bust, you know full well you have no right to a recourse in the form of a compensation of any sort (you could use a million other examples - be it the warranty example I cited or other issues - to justify this). Precisely, assuming an efficient market, equity prices are therefore presumed to have included all known market information while credit/bond ratings obviously exist for a reason.</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is these products have been priced at those levels and still remained attractive to the investors (at least, attractive enough to the FIs, who can hardly claim to be ignorant of the risks) simply because of sound fundamentals which the firm was perceived to be run on (well, if you didn't agree with that, you could have heavily highly-leveraged a naked short for Lehman's stocks which would have yielded handsome returns on 15th September) by investors.</p>
              <p>Surely, you'd agree it's not rocket science that the proxies dealing with these products had done so simply because they could not (in fact, no one could reasonably have done so) have imagined Lehman filing for insolvency that soon?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Unless you decide to challenge the very notion that the proxies that dealt directly with Lehman had not done so in good faith on the understanding of being a rational price-taker, there is no case against Lehman to begin with.</em></span></p>
              <p>Hence, from where do you derive the warped logic that Lehman should be accountable to anyone?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS : On a sidenote, all investment banks (well, think Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns before the subprime debacle unfolded which has since claimed 3 of these as independent entities) are highly-leveraged - Lehman was no exception. In fact, the same could be said for other commercial banks with a strong IB presence (i.e. citi, DB, CS, UBS, etc) although they had stronger access to liquidity on virtue of the fact they were deposit-taking institutions (through its other non-IB operations). Clearly, on that very basis, being highly-leveraged is hardly a good enough reason for any reasonable investor to cast aspersions on the way Lehman ran business. After all, was it not what propelled such firms to the pinnacle of the industry (which would have benefitted shareholders and other corporate bondholders prior to the crisis) to begin with?</p>
