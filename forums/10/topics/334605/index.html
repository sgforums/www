              <p>Found an interesting article (below).</p>
              <p>What a way to put it. Hope things will cool down a little now that DBS has offered to compensate the holders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In spite of my initial misgivings of the government’s handling of the Lehman minibond fiasco, I must applaud them for bringing about a faster than expected closure with the latest <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/384629/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #105cb6;">announcement</span></span></a> by Hong Leong Finance, Maybank and DBS to compensate “vulnerable” buyers for their losses.</p>
              <p>If the outcome was expected, the government certainly did not betray its intention during the last parliamentary sitting in which Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Mr Lim Hng Kiang defended MAS’s approach to the fiasco so far and urge the investors to be patient.</p>
              <p>What makes the banks come to such a collective decision in double-quick time when they have been dragging their feet during the past 2 weeks is anybody’s guess.</p>
              <p>Is it due to a possible class action suit mooted by some investors or the endless brickbats hurled by netizens and bloggers at MAS for its impotence and inaction in comparison to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ?</p>
              <p>Irregardless of the real reasons behind this sudden reversal of fortunes, the affected minibond investors, especially retirees who lost their entire life-savings should heave a sigh of relief by now.</p>

              <p>I disagree with the banks' decision to buy back the minibonds. If I'm a share holder of the banks involved, I would initiate a legal suit against eroding shareholder's interested; buying back means that the bank are taking on the losses as a result of bad investment turnout.</p>
              <p><strong>Low Risk does not mean No Risk</strong>. The investors should understand this. The prospectus are printed in 4 languages.

              <p>The decision to buy back minibonds now opens the floodgate to many other issues. How about other investors who lost money during this economic downturn? Are the banks going to compensate them too? Lehman is not the only bank or company that went bust.</p>
              <p>With the banks taking on the losses up to the tune of $53million USD, where is this money going to come from? The bank's profit? Then who is going to compensate investors for their losses in earning per share?</p>
              <p>What about the legal aspect? This goes to further proof that in Singapore, legal rights will always give way to public outcry.</p>

              <p>initially i strongly supported the people when i heard that many of them lost their life savings. this money is hard earned through years of blood and sweat, and the government should do something to help.</p>
              <p>however now when i start thinking of it, i am of the opinion that these people should not be bailed out. why? because this will create an incentive for everyone to invest into products that promise the highest yield. should the organisations fail, there will be a bailout anyway.</p>
              <p>there should always be a balance struck between risk/reward. fixed deposits don't give you low interest rates for any reason other than the fact that they offer low risk (and liquidity). taking the risk means you bear the consequence. if we bailout these people who have invested in the minibonds, getting 5% p.a. for the past few years, and getting their principal sum back, we are not sending a good message to the people. neither are we being fair to the people who have believed in fixed deposits.</p>

              <p>Really interesting points mentioned by the forumners here that highlight some of the concerns that has been going on for the past few weeks..</p>
              <p>Ramseth, your concerns for the retirees are without a doubt a notable one. But nevertheless, what kind of consideration are we giving here in trying to establish a decision? Should empathy dominate in decision making?</p>
              <p>Some argued that retirees don't know what they are really getting themselves into when signing the contract. But were they forced at gun-point? Were they sourced out and then force to sign? Perhaps, maybe with their marketing gimmicks, they manage to 'psycho' these retirees even though they don't know much. But if it is according to the law, then it is plain bad luck on business grounds right? On the worst note, if the retirees feel they have been tricked, then it is a different case altogether. It could be a case of con. But no right? What is the point of having the law and a contract if, empathy overrides them in the case of cumulative outcry? If the retirees would have made huge huge profits out of their investment instead, would they be forced to give away some of their profits to the bank?</p>
              <p>Compensation by the banks if need to be should be given on the basis of corporate social responsibility and not something out of blame.</p>
              <p>Sympathize with them we can and we should, but to the extent of saying that they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deserve </span>something back in the form of compensation should be frowned upon in my opinion.</p>

              <p>To me, this boo boo proved :</p>
              <p>. about 10,000 Singaporeans TRUST Blindly, in this case. How many more who trust blindly are undiscovered because they do not invest?</p>
              <p>Lesson learnt : From now onwards , all of us must learn and practice QUESTIONING. ALWAYS question. I notice singaporeans no gutsy enough to question. no no why. fear? Never TRUST anyone when he cannot give you a black and white of what he said. Some may think this is too much. But then maybe they have not suffered like these investors before. Also, no one owes businessmen a living. No Free Lunch, remember?</p>
              <p>Eg. when some tom dick or harry promise you rebates if you buy his product, you make sure he can write it down in the contract and sign on it. If he says he promise you More Good Products, you ask him to prove this by signing on a contract containing this statement.  If he says no more price hikes, you may sure he can produce a contract that indicates that clearly and signs it.</p>
              <p>If everyone cooperates and practise the above, I am sure businesses will be pissed but they cannot do anything about it if all consumers play it smart. We need a Union-like organization for Consumers.</p>
              <p>They throw you a thick Prospectus filled with bombastic words and legal or contractual or accounting or finance terminologies and you sign on the dotted line? When you sign, you are actually admitting that you understand everything and accept all that is said in the contract!</p>
              <p>If a consumer has to bare so much responsibility, then I think many would need to engage lawyers, accountants, finance experts and english-chinese translators BEFORE they can purchase any financial product - this means businesses will die.</p>
              <p>So, I believe consumers should be protected more. Else, people should be told clearly the worst case scenario before any sale can be allowed by law. The system appears to me to be slightly biased to protect the businessmen, don't you think?</p>

              <p>no. what im saying is that the richer people should have a higher sense of financial literacy and understand that there is no free lunch in the world. im still not sure if it was marketed to DBS treasures customers, that's what i've heard.</p>
              <p>and when situations like this happen, the way to go is to feign ignorance and say that you didn't know this, you didn't know that. again, im not saying this applies across the board, but i would say its typical.</p>
              <p>i've said that there is always a risk/reward ratio in investments. people tend to use at interest returns and tenure of investment as considerations, without considering the risk. on hindsight it would definitely seem 5% was not worth the risk taken, but 1 year ago no one would have expected a 158 year old investment bank to file for bankcruptcy.</p>

              <p>i think essentially here, if it is a case of misrepresentation, then perhaps, it is to be brought to the court and hence, it becomes a matter of rights. But right now, many people are putting across the point that retirees with life savings are at a loss and that they should be compensated, but on what grounds? It seems to me it is mere empathy and if empathy is good enough to earn you compensations in times of loss, wow, we just found a new way of hedging our risks.</p>
              <p>However, if it is prove to be a case of misrepresentation, then its a different case altogether. The retirees might have a right to compensation.</p>

              <p>i agree that there definitely would be cases of misrepresentation and mis-selling. alot of the time bank relationship managers have their own interests at heart, not perfectly understand the product they r selling, etc. etc. but now EVERYONE is playing the same tune, claiming to have no knowledge about this product and it's risk. don't you smell a rat?</p>
