To a certain extent its leadership approach is incorporating democratic processes. But if such processes are not institutionalised into the central governing constitutions they will also disappear over time should China encounter another self-centred leader.<br><br>Such a hybrid leadership cum process democracy being practised in China may not last because if they elected a wrong person who is power-crazed or self-centred all the good work will stop as such a leader could use excuses like meritocracy and other hypocrisy to bypass people's goals and aspirations and all the present good work with a fair degree of accountability to renewal process will disappear.<br><br>India by virtue of having a process democracy in place from the british days will be able to attract widespread accountable government involving the people with developing their best talents and knowledge application in the long term although in the short term they have to filter down processes to prevent corruptions and wrongful cronyism.</div>

Stop drinking the cheap alcohol, and maintain a clear mind on what you are comparing.<br><br>India will overtake China in what, political reform, economic development, social integration, or total population?<br><br>India has been a democratic republic, with constitutions in place, since 1950. China has been a communist country since 1947, and since then its history was marked with one economic disaster after another, and countless political persecutions in between, until 1979. If the political system has not put India ahead of China today, what makes you think it will happen in the future?<br><br>Most people in China are glad that China did not go through political reform before economic reform, like the former Warsaw pact countries. Where are russia, the eastern european, comparing with the development in China? don't have to look so far, look at the Philippines, don't they have the exact American democratic political system? they ended up like india, the largest exporters of cheap labour in the region. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If you have a fever, don't just take paracetomol 500 mg, it only cures the symptom. Inflammatin of your throat may be cause. Find out what is the root of the problem, don't just treat the head because you feel the pain on your head.<br><br>I fully agree with you that one day, India will overtake China in term of population, no question about it. But will the quality of the children be better of than those in China, there is also no question about it, judging from what we see today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> more cheap labour for export??<br><br>So if the Chinese politicians in Singapore are soo.....lousy, are the indian politicians better of ? lets hear some substantiations, before this turns out to be a mindless racist remark.<br><br></div>

All this has occurred while India was bogged down with policies and politics that flip-flopped when comparing its democratic process with other more progressive democratic countries that are less fractious.<br><br>With the massive population in a large Indian sub-continent in fractious disarray, and which the Central Government in New Delhi have little influence or control - unless it is through State Governments that are controlled by the same Political Party as in the Central Government - development in India is seen to be haphazard at best - and similar to their ambitious arms development program that remains a pipe dream.<br><br></span><br><br></div>

KRISTOF<br>The New York Times<br>April 24, 2007<br><br>KHAWASPUR, India<br><br>India is stirring after many centuries of torpor, and it has a chance of ending this century as the capital of the world, the most important nation on earth. You see up-and-coming cities like Hyderabad or Ahmedabad, and itÂ’s easy to believe that India will eventually surpass China.<br><br>....<br><br>So in the great race of this century, the race to see which country will lead the world in 2100, IÂ’m still betting on China for now. IÂ’m having my kids learn Chinese, not Hindi (or Indian English, a remarkable language in its own right).<br><br>Until IndiaÂ’s economic boom becomes much more broadly based, and until Indian schools manage to teach their students, this country will continue to waste its precious brainpower and wonÂ’t achieve a fraction of what it should.</blockquote></div>

To a certain extent its leadership approach is incorporating democratic processes. But if such processes are not institutionalised into the central governing constitutions they will also disappear over time should China encounter another self-centred leader.<br><br>Such a hybrid leadership cum process democracy being practised in China may not last because if they elected a wrong person who is power-crazed or self-centred all the good work will stop as such a leader could use excuses like meritocracy and other hypocrisy to bypass people's goals and aspirations and all the present good work with a fair degree of accountability to renewal process will disappear.<br><br>India by virtue of having a process democracy in place from the british days will be able to attract widespread accountable government involving the people with developing their best talents and knowledge application in the long term although in the short term they have to filter down processes to prevent corruptions and wrongful cronyism.</div></blockquote>Well said.You know what,actually i also dont want to see India overtake China.But if China dont implement a political reform n abolish comunist ruling n one child policy,the chance of she winning India is slim.</div>
