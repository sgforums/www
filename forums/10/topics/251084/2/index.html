Listen to what MM said about the breakthrough made by the singapore government, and the mediocre government in Scandinavia, and down to many Singaporean who travel and complain about how dirty some places are, " in Singapore we are much better'......Honestly, if Singaporeans do care about the impression of outsiders, HUMILITY is not part of our attitude, Boasting and Bragging are the trend of the time. If we need to run down others to show our achievement, we inherently lack the confidence to convince.<br><br>China is known to the world because it is a big country with 1.3 billion people; Singapore is kown to the world first because of the most expensive cars, now for the highest paid ministers. What kind of impression do we really want people to know about us? I am always proud of Singapore because people of all religions and races can live harmoniously together. I am very proud of the founders of Singapore because of their sacrifices.<br><br>In China, we respect our ancestors because they took great risks and endure hardship to strive for a better future. I know about China because of what Confucious said, the sacrifices of Sun Yet Sen in fighting against the Qing Dynasty, I even respect the Tai Ping Tian Guo (despite their stupidity) for giving up their lives against the foreigners. But these impressions went down the drain when I met the modern Chinese, first from ROC, then PRC, especially the "newly rich" or the "bao fa hu". Virtues such as sacrifices for the nation, gracousness, humility....do not exist anymore, these diminish with prosperity.<br><br>My conclusion is: Prosperity brings wealth, wealth brings corruption! When people try all means to get money, the illegal ways called corruption, bribery, and even the not so illegal ways such as self renumeration....., we see things going wrong. Take the case of TT Durai of NKF, his bossess approved his salary and benefits, he approved excessive bonuses to his beloved subordinates, it never appeared to be wrong, even the then PM wife said his salary was only peanut. But is it wrong now?<br><br>If Chinese from PRC cares about what others think about them, $1.2 trilion or even more $ will not impress anybody, it does not matter if your country is developed or developing, it all depends how you and your countrymen behave, especially in front of foreigners, in and outside of China.</div>

I would sadly agree that India won't be going anywhere unless they completely eradicate and abolish corruption through every rank and field. Such rampant corruption is truly restricting the whole nation from progress.<br><br>Also I would like to see China and India co-operate and join hands to just unseat the "Uncle Sam". Because with him around, it currently seems that there will be only wars for oil at the pretext of falsely claiming the presence of WMD.<br><br>Another thing to ponder about is, given a chance, which one are you willing to work with? A PRC or an Indian? I am pretty sure the majority of you will say Indians. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyways, where is hellomotosq??

Despite his anti China sentiment, Shutterbug is right that "back in the 60s, we have more thoughtful, and courteous people locally, now with higher educations, skills, globally mobile, people have become so stuck up!".<br><br>Wealth has not made Singaporean more EDUCATED, we just became more literate, but a lot more arrogant than ever before, from the very top of the government. Listen to what MM said about the breakthrough made by the singapore government, and the mediocre government in Scandinavia, and down to many Singaporean who travel and complain about how dirty some places are, " in Singapore we are much better'......Honestly, if Singaporeans do care about the impression of outsiders, HUMILITY is not part of our attitude, Boasting and Bragging are the trend of the time. If we need to run down others to show our achievement, we inherently lack the confidence to convince.<br><br>China is known to the world because it is a big country with 1.3 billion people; Singapore is kown to the world first because of the most expensive cars, now for the highest paid ministers. What kind of impression do we really want people to know about us? I am always proud of Singapore because people of all religions and races can live harmoniously together. I am very proud of the founders of Singapore because of their sacrifices.<br><br>In China, we respect our ancestors because they took great risks and endure hardship to strive for a better future. I know about China because of what Confucious said, the sacrifices of Sun Yet Sen in fighting against the Qing Dynasty, I even respect the Tai Ping Tian Guo (despite their stupidity) for giving up their lives against the foreigners. But these impressions went down the drain when I met the modern Chinese, first from ROC, then PRC, especially the "newly rich" or the "bao fa hu". Virtues such as sacrifices for the nation, gracousness, humility....do not exist anymore, these diminish with prosperity.<br><br>My conclusion is: Prosperity brings wealth, wealth brings corruption! When people try all means to get money, the illegal ways called corruption, bribery, and even the not so illegal ways such as self renumeration....., we see things going wrong. Take the case of TT Durai of NKF, his bossess approved his salary and benefits, he approved excessive bonuses to his beloved subordinates, it never appeared to be wrong, even the then PM wife said his salary was only peanut. But is it wrong now?<br><br>If Chinese from PRC cares about what others think about them, $1.2 trilion or even more $ will not impress anybody, it does not matter if your country is developed or developing, it all depends how you and your countrymen behave, especially in front of foreigners, in and outside of China.     </div></blockquote>This is a very critical thinking, applause for you . This is the most sensible post i have read so far in this racism ridden forum. At least you stated why you do not like PRCs, unlike other singaporean members here, they don't even know why they hate PRCs, it is like a fashion trend to them. It is like everything with the label China is always cheap, dirty, rude, bad, worthless to them.<br><br>Thank you for reading</div>
