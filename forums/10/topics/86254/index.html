            <div class='col-md body'>Stupid government think that by not letting single buy a HDB flat before 35, this will encourage people to get attached. Somehow, they think people marry to buy a HDB flat. The fact is, singles living by themselves away from parents are more likely to get attached due to loneliness after being away from parent, rather than being in the comfort zone with parents. So, they got their logic all wrong. This government think everything can be measure by $$ one.<br><br>And the feedback people also damn stupid, keep telling government how there is no incentive to marry and have children. So, that makes the government think even more that $$ can encourage people to get attached and marry. And hence the logic of letting people who are "hopeless of getting married" to buy a HDB flat at the age of 35. They got it all wrong!!</div>

You mean the child is not even regconized as a citizen of Singapore?<br><br>If he is, then who are his parents on his/her birth cert? Orphan?<br><br>What is the legal status of the mother? Single or married? I think as long as there is no ROM or child at all, then government regconized this person as Single. Then she should be eligible for the singles scheme in HDB.<br><br>In the worst case, you have a widowed mother with a child regconized as an orphan, then it could be a situation where that person cannot get a flat.
