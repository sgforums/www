            <div class='col-md body'>I believe this kind of seperatist attitude will always exist. Whether in singapore or in other countries. Whether now, in the past or in the future. People will always be judged by others for their colour, their social status. It has always happened and forever will. But we can as human beings try to change as many people out there as possible. But it wil still happen.<br><br>Now to be a little on-topic.<br><br>There are many things that definie a person, not just grades. Other skills as well. A person who has good grades but has little of other skills may not be able to perform a task in the real world when given him. On the other hand, a street-smart person who is poor in academics may be able to survive well if thrown into a real-world situation.<br><br>Just because the guy is not good in a good school won't mean he won't have good grades. Even if he does not have good grades, it does not mean he is a non-achiever.<br><br>Points is, grades aren't everything. And in any relationship, there will always be differences. Whether in terms of personality, background, etc, etc ,etc. It is up to the couple to overcome these differences together. Afterall, they have chosen to be together. So they should take efforts to make sure the relationship works for whatever reasons. So long as they're happy together. Who's to say anything?<br><br>Do not ever let others definite what happiness is for you. You ultimately know what makes you happy and what doesn't.</div>
