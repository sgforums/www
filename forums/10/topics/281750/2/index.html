Hey, do not let your personal likes or dislikes cloud the issue here. You think I don't like to have my money at 55 so that I can have a good time with cheena concubine? If after good time I died at 60, that's OK - maybe my bank is still not broke yet. But what if I don't die at 60 and cheena concubine had milked me till zero balance, are you going to feed me??</div></blockquote>If you take up a cheena concubine and you get cheated, serves you right.<br><br>I am highly against the annuity for the following reasons:<br>1) I don't know if I will live till 85<br>2) I believe that everyone should have the freedom to make the choice of how to spend HIS OWN money<br>3) That the govt should stop being a nanny, and allow Singaporeans to live their retirement however they want.<br>4) That I believe the OTHER reason behind this annuity (scam) is to absolve all responsibilities by the Govt to take care of its citizens when they reach old age.<br><br>Freedom is the way to live the life I want. Of course, freedom means that I may be stupid enough to take up a concubine (like you), and serves me right if I get cheated, coz its my choice.<br><br>I don't want to live my life as a bird in a cage. Yes, the bird is safe (Coz caged up), get food at regular intervals, get to fly around (in that cage), but its life and death is controlled by the person owning that cage.<br></div>
