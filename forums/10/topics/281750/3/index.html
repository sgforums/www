            <div class='col-md body'>I can forsee those age 40s onwards will have a hard time getting a job. Unless you have special expertise eg. chef . Than perhaps certain sector still will employ you. Things have change since a decade ago. Even if FT do not directly compete in the jobs. The job market wont be big enought for all of us.<br>So when you grow older, your chance of getting employ is lower. The goverment should know all this by now. Why they still expect us to work till 67? Live till 85?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">There is sufficient empirical evidence that workers over the age of 40 already have difficulties competing with younger workers, even foreigners, for jobs. Even if they find work, there are issues about the amount of income, and job security. Part-time work or contract work is the lot for many.<br><br>It was reported in the press that in 2006, about 12% of the resident workforce or 172,000 workers were on contract work, the bulk of whom were older and with less education (ST 24/8/07). There must be unreported cases in the informal sector as well. It is not uncommon to find sole breadwinners doing odd jobs to feed school-going children.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
