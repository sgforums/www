            <div class='col-md body'>The lack of coverage on parliamentary debates, the reasons to which is still widely unknown, has in its way largely contributed to the politcal apathy of many in Singapore.<br><br>If political debates were televised once a month in Singapore, imagine the interest stirred up. The young to old, poor to rich, educated to not so educated would all be drawn in.<br><br>This is what the government doesn't want, isn't it? A socially, politically and economically wise populace.<br><br>Here are excerpts from Sylvia's speech:<br><br>First, we should recognise that delaying the DDA in effect is an economic pressure on workers to continue at the same pace as before. However, as mentioned by Minister in charge of the Civil Service during question time on Monday, there will be employees who decide that at 62, it is time to slow down e.g. a Head of Department in a school might want to be a teacher and relinquish HOD responsibilities.<br><br>If such a person was not able to concurrently receive his monthly CPF payments at 62, he may not have the luxury of making such a choice. Others, who have slogged for 40 years in the rat race, may want to find peace by devoting more time to volunteer work or charitable acts. By indirectly compelling them to continue working into their mid-60s, there would be fewer younger retirees to form a backbone of manpower for social, community and even religious activities. How would that impact the morale and quality of life of our society?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.......fixing the retirement age at 65 does not mean everyone will be working up to 65. Yesterday Minister of State for Manpower sought to assure the House of the viability of the plan to re-employ workers after 62. For residents between the age of 55 and 64, the employment rate is currently about 54%. MOS said that the MinistryÂ’s target was to raise this to 65%, which was, in his own words, Â“an ambitious targetÂ”. Thus, we are not at all certain that 65% is achievable. And even if it was achieved, what about the other 35% who are not working?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The proposed law to re-employ people after 62 may only reach those who are employed at 62. Even then, what recourse will employees have if employers do not re-employ them? Yesterday MOS sought to assure the House that the law would be enforceable, but gave few details, except to say that a tripartite committee would be formed to look into the issue and report on later. On Monday, Manpower Minister said the tripartite committee would report on the re-employment regime and guidelines within 2 years from now! If that is so, how can we agree to delay the DDA now, when these details are still up in the air? Will the new law become just a piece of paper?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>......those who work beyond 62 are vulnerable to having reduced income. A study was done of unionised companies that re-employed workers beyond 62 in the last 18 months (ST 25/8/07). It was revealed that only 20% retained workers at the same job and pay, while 70% had to work the same job but for lower pay, and 10% got a different job altogether. As this study only captured those who did re-employ workers who reached 62, it is not known the fate of those who were not re-employed. On Monday, Minister Teo Chee Hean also mentioned the re-employment of retired teachers as adjunct teachers. This suggests income reduction in the public sector as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.......the Minimum Sum to be left in CPF at 55 years has gone up progressively over a short time. Since 2003, the Minimum Sum has progressively gone up Â– from $80,000 to the current $99,600 within 4 years, and will continue rising till it reaches $120,000 in 6 yearsÂ’ time. Apart from this, we are also required to leave a Medisave Required Amount in the CPF. This Medisave Required Amount will go up rapidly, from the current $11,500 by $2,500 per year and in 6 yearsÂ’ time it will be $25,000. This means that Singaporeans will soon need to have a total of $145,000 kept locked in the CPF when they reach 55. On top of this much larger sum, it also takes longer to accumulate savings due to reductions in employerÂ’s contributions. EmployerÂ’s CPF contributions had in recent memory been cut from 20% to 13% and recently only partially restored to 14.5%.<br><br>Besides all the above, the rule allowing members to withdraw 50% of their savings is being phased out starting from Jan 2009. In 6 yearsÂ’ time, if members cannot meet the Minimum Sums when they reach 55, they will not be able to withdraw anything except $5,000.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is sufficient empirical evidence that workers over the age of 40 already have difficulties competing with younger workers, even foreigners, for jobs. Even if they find work, there are issues about the amount of income, and job security. Part-time work or contract work is the lot for many.<br><br>It was reported in the press that in 2006, about 12% of the resident workforce or 172,000 workers were on contract work, the bulk of whom were older and with less education (ST 24/8/07). There must be unreported cases in the informal sector as well. It is not uncommon to find sole breadwinners doing odd jobs to feed school-going children.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Various Ministers sought to remind the public that the government was spending more than $1b to increase interest rates, fund Workfare etc. However, it should be noted that government revenues have enjoyed significant increases arising from taxpayersÂ’ dues. Business Times (Sep 8-9, 2007) reported that IRASÂ’ collections for FY 2006 rose 15% from the previous FY, part of a steady increase since FY 02. These comprise corporate and personal income tax, GST, and stamp duty and property tax. In dollar terms, the taxes collected rose by more than $6b compared to 5 years ago.<br><br></div>

I'm currently serving the grassroots at a YEC and i've the opportunity to listen to the cries from the lower strata of the society. At certain instances, i feel for them and that policies implemented arent foolproof and as wide covering as our government claims it to be. Hence, i'm starting to get interested in empirical evidence that opposition parties put up. yup.<br><br>rock star: thanks for your links. will take me some time to digest what was transpired all this while.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah, the CPF fund debate run over here. Sylvia was a law lecturer. If she taught me law I would have failed her. What is she talking? Employment is a contract between you and your employer - not a jail sentence. Have you heard of these words "I quit"? At anytime you can hand in your resignation. Who can make you work if you don't want to? If I strike TOTO, I will give Sylvia money to re-study law again!</div>
