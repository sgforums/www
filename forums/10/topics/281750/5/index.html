I'm heartened to see that there is a good soul with a real brain out there willing to speak out in the public's interest, facing the tsunami for the sake of real progress for ordinary citizens, and not just there to warm a seat and receive a fat paycheque to throw up one-dimensional, ill-tailored "solutions".  And I'm glad to see some people here who understand that the seeking information from various reliable sources, and not just one, is vital to the formation of educated opinions.  We may have hope yet.
