              <p>Many people in Sg forums talk me into checking myself with the IMH basically insulting me by telling me that my sanity is in question.</p>
              <p>So let me ask this question just how big is the power of IMH to ordinary citizen? Why do so many people seem to worship the IMH as though you need a certificate of sanity from them.</p>
              <p>Have you heard the stories that in Russia, Not too rare that oppositions are thrown into mental hospital and detained there without being able to defend themselves. Is Singapore going to the same direction? I mean Singapore is effectively a tyrannical kingdom.</p>
              <p>Not too distant in the future perhaps anybody who professes that they believe in God needs to have their sanity checked by the IMH.</p>
              <p>I too have been defamed crazy by the authority in Singapore, but have decided to fight back by refusing to take medication since the beginning to prove I'm not what they told me I am. Since then I've graduated from local university(in 7 full semesters), indulged in hobbies that only sane people could do, have friends that know me that I'm not crazy. Even my own mother refused to listen to me and defamed me too.</p>
              <p>I'm NOT suing the your local authority well at least the NUH, because I have no money to hire a lawyer and from my past 7 years experience I bet that it will not be a fair trial.</p>
              <p>I have given thought why they picked on me. It seems that they picked on me without good reason and after watching the Dark Knight and seeing Joker, I realize that some people do not need reason to do evil at all. They make their own reasons if there were none. They do evil because they want to and because they can. They are psychopathic.</p>

              <p>One of the early method of remote viewing was to use people in the enclosed building premises that no spy satellite or plane could penetrate. They(the psychic)  see what was inside the building by tapping into the people inside that building. One person offers their  glimpse of what was  hapening inside the building. They (the psyhic) keep on changing people until they see the whole building from the  eyes of the people inside the building withut them realizing that they had been helping the CIA. More like putting together a puzzle to get the whole picture.</p>

              <p>I didn't understand you words at first but now I think I got it. Knowing that you will die someday helps to prevent you from going too far off the limits. But this only applies for a person who believes in God existence and the afterlife judgement.</p>
              <p>History has teached us much too often that some men are far worse than animal. Genghis Khan, Xerxes, Nero, Hitler. No bounds hold these kind of people. Nothing is sacred for them.</p>
              <p>Atilla the Hun died bleeding in bed while having sex for example. But perhaps some of you would argue what a better way to die. LOL</p>
              <p>These Lee family though only ruling a small nation/island has an accumulated wealth worth of at least US$10.00 billion dollar. And in today society who worship money that means a hell lot of influence. I don't think the Bush family is even close the the Lee. That is what gives them power not their office.</p>
              <p>In short I think the Lee family<strong> has forgotten</strong> their mortality.</p>

              <p>One of the early method of remote viewing was to use people in
              the enclosed building premises that no spy satellite or plane could
              penetrate. They(the psychic)  see what was inside the building
              by tapping into the people inside that building. One person offers
              their  glimpse of what was  hapening inside the building.
              They (the psyhic) keep on changing people until they see the whole
              building from the  eyes of the people inside the building
              withut them realizing that they had been helping the CIA. More like
              putting together a puzzle to get the whole picture.</p>

              <p>I've just been banned from DiecastXchange forum because of my signature. It's the first and only site that ever forbid me from writing this or soemthing like this in my profile.

              <p>II'm a victim of grave abuses from people in power in Singapore for years. People with access to telepathic person(s). They have friends here too. All abuses are to convince people I'm mentally ill to cover their grave evil. Telepathy is not a far off fiction. It's a fact. I've realized I'm fighting a 12 year old and a country ruled by thugs.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I've been defamed schizophrenic in 2002 in Singapore but have decided to fight back by refusing to take any medication<strong> from the beginning</strong> to prove I'm not what they told me I was. I have since re-do my tertiary education locally and finished it in 7 full semesters and have indulged in hobbies that only sane people could: Model kit building that took weeks to finish, reading, badminton, jogging. I have friends that could testify that I'm not mentally ill whatsoever</p>
