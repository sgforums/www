              <h1>The dearth of public opinion in Singapore<strong></strong></h1>
              <h1><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></h1>
              <p><span class="time">July 31, 2009</span></p>
              <p>In a latest survey conducted by the Hong Kong Institute of
              Asia-Pacific Studies of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, only 10.9
              per cent were satisfied with the overall performance of lawmakers, out
              of 815 respondents.</p>
              <p>About 54.5 per cent said their performance was “normal” but 32.3 per
              cent found it “unsatisfactory”. Some 42.1 per cent of respondents
              thought lawmakers were not doing enough to tell the government about
              Hong Kong people’s concerns. The full results were published on the
              island’s main English newspaper - The South China Morning Post (read
              article <a href="http://temasekreview.com/?p=11417">here</a>)</p>
              <p>I wondered what the results will show if a similiar survey is
              conducted in Singapore, which is almost unheard of. Since when did
              Singaporeans ever know about the performance ratings of their lawmakers?</p>
              <p>The three universities in Singapore should have the necessary
              expertise and resources to conduct such surveys. Surprisingly, the
              academia has been conspicuously silent about the latest socio-political
              developments in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP have always claimed it has the overwhelming “mandate” of the
              people to rule the country. However, their claims were never
              substantiated by frequent opinion polls.</p>
              <p>The general elections, held only once every five years, is an
              inaccurate reflection of the government’s popularity due to serious
              flaws within the system such as the GRC and rampant gerry-mandering
              which has allowed the incumbent to consolidate and perpetuate its rule
              continuously uninterrupted for five decades.</p>
              <p>If the PAP government is indeed run by the best talents in
              Singapore, why is it so apprehensive to conduct an opinion poll to find
              out the real sentiment on the ground? Are Singaporeans happy with their
              leadership?</p>
              <p>Over in Malaysia, the Merdeka Center conducted such polls on a
              regular basis. The latest poll showed the approval ratings of Prime
              Minister Najib Razak increased from 45% to 65%, a testimony of the
              right moves he had made so far since assuming the premiership. He had
              also released a set of KPIs or key performance indicators for his
              ministers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Without opinion polls, the government will never know how well its
              policies are received by the people. It will be like a ship sailing out
              into the open sea without a compass.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The people are the best judge of the ministers’ performance.
              Everybody from the Prime Minister down to every senior minister of
              state should not be afraid to have their performances assessed by the
              people. It will also promote active citizenry and give Singaporeans
              more say in how their country is being governed.</p>
              <p>Singapore is perhaps the only developed country in the world where
              there is a gag imposed on the approval ratings of its Prime Minister.
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We can easily google about the latest approval rating for Barack Obama,
              Donald Tsang, Ma Ying-Jeou, Taro Aso, Gordon Brown and Najib Razak, but
              will hit a blank if we try “Lee Hsien Loong”.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why is the government so apprehensive about conducting and
              publicizing regular opinion polls about its performance? Doesn’t public
              opinion matter in the formulation and implementation of their policies?
              Or are they simply afraid that the reality may be radically different
              from the propaganda they have been spewing out daily through the
              state-controlled media?</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee and his team should always bear in mind that
              their position, power and salaries are given by the people of
              Singapore. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is only right that we are given the opportunity to air
              our support or dissatisfaction openly for them to know.</strong></span></span></p>
