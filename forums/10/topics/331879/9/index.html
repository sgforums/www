              <p>i sort of agree with angel here, that it is quite pointless for SAF to defend singapore.</p>
              <p>On morale: how do you expect soldiers on a $400/mnth pay to risk their lives for the ministers earning $4million dollar pay( $333, 333/ month, 833 times of a nsf's pay)risking their life for people who will sit in comfort in some underground bunker while the war rage on around them.</p>
              <p>Warfare: though the SAF emphasize on forward defence strategy, which involves attacking Malaysia (it's the only country saf is capable to launch troops into anyway), making jungle warfare relevant.</p>
              <p>but shouldn't be urban warfare the focus of our NS training? street fighting in HDBs, multi-storey carparks, office towers. that's what war would be like if we r fighting in singapore, or at least in JB. all the so called strategic locations are already by now fully exploited for civilian usage, incorporated into the urban landscape. Cities and towns are built on these locations, and these places are unlikely to be the jungles which we expected.</p>
              <p>look at singapore, would any enemy go hid themselves in jungles and woods which are of no strategic importance here in singapore, when there's plenty of concrete jungles around them? it is much safer to hid behind the concrete walls of 12  stories HDB buildings, which offers real protection from bullets, than behind 1 story-tall trees in hot, mosquito-infested jungle.</p>
              <p>if there's any strategic locations to seize in singapore, it would be the prime urban and financial centers of the country, not the relatively worthless plots of ulu forests.</p>
              <p>and u think during wartime, who is so dumb as to stay in singapore. most singaporeans, rich or poor, are at the very least able to afford a plane ticket to Australia, Thailand. (on the assumption that these people value their lives over money). none of the womenfolks will stay behind, nor would their men allow them to stay behind to risk death. Tell me, wouldn't you send off your wives, daughters, and mothers off to a safer country before you set off for army, during a war? (under the Geneva convention, it is illegal to attack civilian aircrafts, so it is safe for them to exit the country)</p>

              <p>than money is not the issue and motivation for you to fight. so why mention about low pay in the first place?</p>
              <p>You are not alone, i believe there are guys like you with the same thinking too.</p>
              <p>but i also believe that there are guys who are willing to fight and know what is their motivation for fighting. to serve, to protect and for freedom.</p>

              <p>Warfare: though the SAF emphasize on forward defence strategy,

              <p>but shouldn't be urban warfare the focus of our NS training?
              street fighting in HDBs, multi-storey carparks, office towers.
              that's what war would be like if we r fighting in singapore, or at
              least in JB. all the so called strategic locations are already by
              now fully exploited for civilian usage, incorporated into the urban
              landscape. Cities and towns are built on these locations, and these
              places are unlikely to be the jungles which we expected.</p>

              <p>Hello, you got watch news one or not? Murai Urban Training Facility just open a month ago. If you're combatant don't worry, your reservist sure go there one. OK? Jungle warfare irrelevant? You think got one nice pavement for you to walk to objective? Even if there is, would you take it?</p>
