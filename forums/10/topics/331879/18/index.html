              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mao Zedong spoke on this issue:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>Question:</strong></em> Some people do not realize yet that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is the result of the breakdown of the Anglo-French-Soviet talks</span>, but think that the Soviet-German treaty caused the breakdown. Will you please explain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why the Anglo-French-Soviet talks failed?</span></p>
              <p><em>Answer:</em> The talks failed purely because the British and French governments were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insincere.</span></p>
              <p>In recent years the reactionary international bourgeoisie, and primarily that of Britain and France, have consistently pursued the reactionary policy of "non-intervention" towards aggression by fascist Germany, Italy and Japan.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their purpose is to connive at wars of aggression and to profit by them.</span></p>
              <p>Thus Britain and France flatly rejected the Soviet Union's repeated proposals for a genuine front against aggression; standing on the side-lines, they took a "non-interventionist" position and connived at German, Italian and Japanese aggression.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their aim was to step forward and intervene when the belligerents had worn each other out.</span></p>
              <p>In pursuit of this reactionary policy they sacrificed half of China to Japan, and the whole of Abyssinia, Spain, Austria and Czechoslovakia to Italy and Germany. Then they wanted to sacrifice the Soviet Union. This plot was clearly revealed in the recent Anglo-French-Soviet talks.</p>
              <p>They lasted for more than four months, from April 15 to August 23, during which the Soviet Union exercised the utmost patience.</p>
              <p>But, from start to finish, Britain and France rejected the principle of equality and reciprocity; they demanded that the Soviet Union provide safeguards for their security, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refused to do likewise for the Soviet Union and the small Baltic states, so as to leave a gap through which Germany could attack</span>, and they also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refused to allow the passage of Soviet troops through Poland to fight the aggressor.</span></p>
              <p>That is why the talks broke down. In the meantime, Germany indicated her willingness to stop her activities against the Soviet Union and abandon the so-called Agreement Against the Communist International and recognized the inviolability of the Soviet frontiers; hence the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty.</p>
              <p>The policy of "non-intervention" pursued by international and primarily Anglo-French reaction is a policy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"sitting on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight"</span>, a downright imperialist policy of profiting at others' expense. This policy was initiated when Chamberlain took office, reached its climax in the Munich agreement of September last year and finally collapsed in the recent Anglo-French-Soviet talks.</p>
              <p>From now on the situation will inevitably develop into one of direct conflict between the two big imperialist blocs, the Anglo-French bloc and the German-Italian bloc. As I said in October 1938 at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of our Party, "The inevitable result of Chamberlain's policy will be like 'lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own toes'." Chamberlain started with the aim of injuring others only to end up by ruining himself. This is the law of development which governs all reactionary policies.</p>

              <p>As mentioned in my preceding reply - as shown in the preceding Page 17, Stalin had his own "Secret War Plans" from the very beginning.</p>
              <p>It is no surprise that Chairman Mao will have the same retrospective views of any author concerning the sacrificial lambs made in the world stage of geo-politics.</p>

              <p>This was part of the entire ideology of Western Society attempting to block Stalin's efforts to spread Communism globally.</p>
              <p>In any case, prior to the outbreak of WW-2 - during the early 1930s - Britain and France were decidedly firm that after WW-1, another War in Europe should be avoided at all costs; and that peaceful resolution to settle land disputes should be used instead.</p>
              <p>Stalin's efforts to spread Communist ideology was less a threat then Hitler's ambitions to upset the land divisions that were settled at the end of WW-1, which will surely result in war breaking out.</p>

                                      information about the relationship between the British government

                                      on the verge of overthrowing Hitler because they feared war with
                                      Britain and France. The British government became aware of this
                                      plot. However, they were determined that Hitler should not be

              <p>Would you sign deal with HItler, Atobe, after your offer of alliance was rebuffed?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>THE GREAT RUSE</strong> <br><br><em>Essentially Hitler was </em></span><a href="http://www.savethemales.ca/000369.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>not interested in a world war</em></span></span></a><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>. His design was to conquer the USSR in a loose "Nordic" alliance with England. Erroll belonged to the "Cliveden Set" a powerful section of the British elite that supported this alliance. <br><br>Churchill's backers, the privately-owned Bank of England set Hitler up as a means to menace Stalin, have a world war and destroy Germany once and for all . War enables them to concentrate power and wealth in their hands and slaughter national elites who might interfere with world government. <br><br>The bankers used the Cliveden types to fool Hitler into thinking England approved of his plans. Like  proud proteges, the Nazis entertained the English and gave them information on their military build-up. The Nazis were set up. This is the real meaning of the "Policy of Appeasement." <br><br>The Cliveden Set divided into two groups, those who were aware of the trap, and those who were not. Erroll was one of latter who sincerely believed Hitler represented a bulwark to Communism. When the war broke out, Erroll did his patriotic duty. But he knew too much. He was aware of how Hitler and Churchill belonged to the same homosexual occult secret society and he may have spoken of it within range of MI-5 assets.</em>  </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Other then the writing from Henry Makow, there do not seem to be any other writings that can support your "Conspiracy Theory" which you have attributed to Neville Chamberlain's efforts to work with Germany and France to block Russia's spread of Communism into Europe.</p>

              <p>...far from opposing Nazism, however, the political leaders of Britain and
                  France and a number of other western countries believed that they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">could
                  use Hitler to destroy what they saw as a far greater danger to their
                  power and privileges — the Bolsheviks of the Soviet Union.</span><br><br> The socialist USSR was an example that a new social system bringing an
                  end to capitalist exploitation was possible. It was a hindrance to the
                  plans of the imperialist states to re-divide the world’s markets and
                  control the resources of the colonies to their own advantage.<br><br> While the governments of the US, Britain and France wanted to unite the
                  capitalist world against the Soviet Union by forming a compact with
                  Hitler’s Germany, the capitalists of Germany sought such a union
                  through the subjugation of other capitalist countries.<br><br> Some imperialist politicians saw this contradiction clearly — Churchill
                  in Britain, Barthou in France, Roosevelt in the US — but they were the
                  minority. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most were so blinded by anti-communism that they were
                  prepared to give the fascists a free hand...</span></p>
