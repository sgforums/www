              <p>...On September 1,
              Hitler<a name="7608"> </a> attacked Poland.  Britain and France were caught
              in their own trap.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These two countries assisted in all of

              1933, they never stopped speaking in praise of
              Hitler's<a name="7610"> </a> battle against
              Communism.  Now they were forced to declare war against Germany,
              although they had no intention of doing so in an effective manner.</p>
              <p>Unable to see through their dream of seeing the Nazi army charge
              through Poland to attack the Soviet Union, France and Britain were
              forced to declare war on Germany...</p>

              Hitler<a name="7627"> </a>in his aggression
              against the Soviet Union.  Nothing will come of it.  They will have to

              <p>People cover up parts of history that they feel is negative.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br> <br> ...That the wells of appeasement lay in this fear of Russia, in the
                                          conviction that Nazi Germany was a barrier against the spread of
                                          Communism, and that a war in western europe could only benefit the
                                          Soviet Union by extending her power and influence has been amply
                                          demonstrated in this and other chapters. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But these cardinal elements in the
                                          policy of appeasement have been underrated or almost totally
                                          ignored by the British historical establishment.</span><br> <br> There are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two reasons for
                                          this <strong>failure by British historians</strong> to <strong>come to terms with their
                                          country's diplomatic past.</strong></span> Firstly, there is the accepted
                                          tradition not to attribute to their government Machiavellian
                                          designs against a foreign power.<br> <br> Hence, no matter how patriotic or realistic Chamberlain and his
                                          supporters may have felt themselves to be in attempting to spare
                                          Western Europe the ravages of war and revolution, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they should not be accused of
                                          conspiring to pit one totalitarian power against the other.</span> "Of course," writes Robert Skidelsky, the British neorevisonist
                                          historian,"there were a number of groups in Britain who . . .
                                          advocated the bargain that Hitler must always have hoped for — 'a
                                          German deal with the British Empire at the expense of the Soviet
                                          Union.' But such cynicism (or realism) was foreign to the British
                                          Establishment."<br> <br> Secondly, because of the ideological divide between East and West,
                                          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no establishment
                                          historian (despite Stalin's own Machiavellian aims) wishes to play
                                          into the hands of the<br> Soviet Union by ackowledging Britain's share of responsibility for
                                          the rebirth of German militarism and the calamity of the Second
                                          World War.</span><br> <br> This<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure to expose
                                          the main roots of appeasement is unfortunate</span></strong> not only for
                                          the historiography of this crucial period in world history, but for

              <p>...A very important book, Hitler’s Spy Chief: The Wilhelm Canaris Mystety,
                      was published in November, 2005. It received very little attention but
                      it contained some very interesting new information about the
                      relationship between the British government and Nazi Germany. <br><br>The
                      author,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Richard Bassett, found some very interesting documents that
                      helps to explain the peace negotiations that went on between the two
                      governments.</strong></span> Bassett shows that in July, 1938, a powerful group from
                      within Nazi Germany that included Canaris, were on the verge of
                      overthrowing Hitler because they feared war with Britain and France.
                      The British government became aware of this plot. However, they were
                      determined that Hitler should not be removed from power.<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason,

              <p>I know for a fact that 99% of english history textbooks do not talk about Britain instigating German-Soviet war.</p>
              <p>Russia textbooks talks about it.
                  Polish foreign minister talks about it.</p>
              <p>Mao Zedong talks about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> Question:</strong> Some people do not realize yet that the Soviet-German non-aggression
                  treaty is the result of the breakdown of the Anglo-French-Soviet talks,
                  but think that the Soviet-German treaty caused the breakdown. Will you
                  please explain why the Anglo-French-Soviet talks failed?</p>
              <p><em><strong>Answer:</strong> </em>The talks failed purely because the British and French
                  governments were insincere. In recent years the reactionary international
                  bourgeoisie, and primarily that of Britain and France, have consistently
                  pursued the reactionary policy of "non-intervention" towards aggression by
                  fascist Germany, Italy and Japan.</p>
              <p>Their purpose is to connive at wars of
                  aggression and to profit by them. Thus Britain and France flatly rejected
                  the Soviet Union's repeated proposals for a genuine front against aggression;
                  standing on the side-lines, they took a "non-interventionist" position and
                  connived at German, Italian and Japanese aggression.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Their aim was to step
                  forward and intervene when the belligerents had worn each other out.</strong></span> In pursuit
                  of this reactionary policy they sacrificed half of China to Japan, and the
                  whole of Abyssinia, Spain, Austria and Czechoslovakia to Italy and
                  Germany. Then they wanted to sacrifice the Soviet
                  Union.</p>
              <p>This plot was clearly revealed in the recent Anglo-French-Soviet talks.
                  They lasted for more than four months, from April 15 to August 23, during
                  which the Soviet Union exercised the utmost patience.</p>
              <p>But, from start to
                  finish, Britain and France rejected the principle of equality and reciprocity;
                  they demanded that the Soviet Union provide safeguards for their security,
                  but refused to do likewise for the Soviet Union and the small Baltic states,
                  so as to leave a gap through which Germany could attack, and they also refused
                  to allow the passage of Soviet troops through Poland to fight the aggressor.</p>
              <p>That is why the talks broke down. In the meantime, Germany indicated her
                  willingness to stop her activities against the Soviet Union and abandon the
                  so-called Agreement Against the Communist International and recognized the inviolability of the Soviet
                  frontiers; hence the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty.
                  The policy of "non-intervention" pursued by international and primarily
                  Anglo-French reaction is a policy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"sitting on top of the mountain to watch
                  the tigers fight"</strong></span>, a downright imperialist policy of profiting at others'
                  expense.</p>
              <p>This policy was initiated when Chamberlain took office, reached
                  its climax in the Munich agreement of September last year and finally collapsed
                  in the recent Anglo-French-Soviet talks.</p>
              <p>From now on the situation will
                  inevitably develop into one of direct conflict between the two big imperialist
                  blocs, the Anglo-French bloc and the German-Italian bloc.</p>
              <p>As I said in October
                  1938 at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of our Party,
                  "The inevitable result of Chamberlain's policy will be like 'lifting a rock
                  only to drop it on one's own toes'."<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Chamberlain started with the aim of
                  injuring others only to end up by ruining himself. This is the law of development
                  which governs all reactionary policies.</strong></span></p>

              <p>...The plan of Britain, the United States and France was
              to egg Germany on to attack the Soviet Union, so that they themselves, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"sitting
              on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight", could come down and take
              over after the Soviet Union and Germany had worn each other out.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The
              Soviet-German non-aggression treaty smashed this plot. In overlooking this
              plot and the schemes of the Anglo-French imperialists who connived at and
              instigated war and precipitated a world war, some of our fellow-countrymen
              have actually been taken in by the sugary propaganda of these schemers.</p>
              <p>These
              crafty politicians were not the least bit interested in checking aggression
              against Spain, against China, or against Austria and Czechoslovakia, on the
              contrary, they connived at aggression and instigated war, playing the proverbial
              role of the fisherman who set the snipe and clam at each other and then took
              advantage of both. They euphemistically described their actions as
              "non-intervention", but what they actually did was to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"sit on top of the
              mountain to watch the tigers fight".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quite a number of people throughout
              the world have been fooled by the honeyed words of Chamberlain and his partners,
              failing to see the murderous intent behind their smiles</strong></span>, or to understand
              that the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty was concluded only after Chamberlain
              and Daladier had made up their minds to reject the Soviet Union and bring
              about the imperialist war. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is time for these people to wake up...</strong></span></p>

              <p>...That the wells of appeasement lay in this fear of Russia, in the
                                          conviction that Nazi Germany was a barrier against the spread of
                                          Communism, and that a war in western europe could only benefit the
                                          Soviet Union by extending her power and influence has been amply
                                          demonstrated in this and other chapters. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But these cardinal elements in the
                                          policy of appeasement have been underrated or <strong>almost totally
                                          ignored by the British historical establishment.</strong></span><br> <br> There are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two reasons for
                                          this <strong>failure by British historians</strong> to <strong>come
                                          to terms with their country's diplomatic past.</strong></span> Firstly, there is the accepted tradition not to attribute to their
                                          government Machiavellian designs against a foreign power.<br> <br> Hence, no matter how patriotic or realistic Chamberlain and his
                                          supporters may have felt themselves to be in attempting to spare
                                          Western Europe the ravages of war and revolution, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they should not be accused of
                                          conspiring to pit one totalitarian power against the other.</span> </strong>"Of course," writes Robert Skidelsky, the British neorevisonist
                                          historian,"there were a number of groups in Britain who . . .
                                          advocated the bargain that Hitler must always have hoped for — 'a
