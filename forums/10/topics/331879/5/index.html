              <p>the 18 year old will eventually become 21 year old, and 21 year old is generally more matured than 18 year old. if NS is the main issue for 18 year old to vote opposition, than it is clearly not a good idea to let them do that.they are free to do that when they are 21, and still think NS is not a good idea.</p>
              <p>the voting age was 21 around the world, but most of the countries reduce it to 18 le. so it is not a smart move, but rather a smart non move.</p>

              <p>The law was not passed in fairness to the oil companies in Singapore, it was to protect the tax on petrol collected by the government! Many oil companies, such as exxon mobil supply petrol to JB from Singapore refineries.</p>
              <p>The fact that checks are not enforced on all vehicles today because manpower are deployed to check on terrorists, and smuggled cigarettes!</p>
              <p>With high oil prices now, government's tax collection has already increased. Besides, if the malaysian government is subsidizing their petrol sales, why not let them subsidize the singaporean cars as well. The government won't rescind the law because they dont want cars from the whole singapore jamming the causeway just to buy petrol, that would worsen the traffic already jamming the place.</p>

              <p><br>Protect the tax on petrol collected by the government? What talking you???</p>
              <p>You really think the government cared about your few cents per litre petrol tax (A few % of your petrol/litre goes to the government tax)? Or do you think government cared more about how much tax they are collecting from the petrol companies?</p>
              <p>Petrol tax % per litre will still be imposed regardless of whether the petrol companies are operating in Singapore or not. It's more important to retain the petrol companies in Singapore rather than to discourage them to all move over to Malaysia and other cheaper neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>How much MANPOWER are you talking about? Do you see a group of people checking for terrorist and drugs and cigarettes (SHEN JING BING!!!)? Singapore Customs will be overcrowded if your so-called manpower for checking vehicles were really diverted to check for terrorist/drugs/cigarettes.</p>

              <p><br> Protect the tax on petrol collected by the government? What talking
              you???</p>
              <p>You really think the government cared about your few cents per
              litre petrol tax (A few % of your petrol/litre goes to the
              government tax)? Or do you think government cared more about how
              much tax they are collecting from the petrol companies?</p>
              <p>Petrol tax % per litre will still be imposed regardless of
              whether the petrol companies are operating in Singapore or not.
              It's more important to retain the petrol companies in Singapore
              rather than to discourage them to all move over to Malaysia and
              other cheaper neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>How much MANPOWER are you talking about? Do you see a group of
              people checking for terrorist and drugs and cigarettes (SHEN JING
              BING!!!)? Singapore Customs will be overcrowded if your so-called
              manpower for checking vehicles were really diverted to check for
              terrorist/drugs/cigarettes.</p>
              <p>And only KIASU IDIOTS like you will go jammed up the causeway
              for your few dollars petrol discount. Do you even drive at
              all???</p>
              <p>OMG....nowadays retards are jamming up this Speaker's Corner.
              Can we change the forum name to Childcare Corner please?????????
