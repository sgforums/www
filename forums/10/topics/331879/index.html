              <p><strong>SDP’s policy paper on National Service</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
              <p>National Service, or army conscription in Singapore, was first
              introduced in 1967 due to pressing issues such as national security
              after Singapore’s “forced” independence in 1965. In 1971, the British
              completely pulled out of Singapore. It has been 41 years since the
              introduction of NS.</p>
              <p>Since then the world and Asia has changed significantly in terms of
              security and economic arrangements. But has Singapore’s conscription
              policy kept up with these changes to reflect and cope with the new
              geopolitical landscape?</p>
              <p>First let us review the service that all able-bodied 18-year-old
              male Singaporeans have to undergo. Basic Military Training, or BMT, is
              the “boot camp” for all new recruits. This lasts for three months
              whereupon the soldier then gets posted out to other units for further
              specialised training.</p>
              <p>The conscripts then serve the remainder of their two-year stint
              polishing up their combat skills. Following the two years of full-time
              service, NSmen are required (for up to 40 days a year) to serve in a
              part-tme capacity until they are 50 years old for commissioned officers
              and 40 for others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Reduce the two-year full-time service</strong></p>
              <p>In an age where warfare has turned to “smart” technology, is it
              still logical and necessary for Singapore to insist that its National
              Servicemen undergo 24 months months of active, full-time service? Such
              a policy is rare among countries that maintain a conscription policy.
              Below is a list of countries with periods of full-time conscript
              service:</p>
              <p>1.Austria (6 months)<br> 2.Bolivia (12 months)<br> 3.Brazil (9-12 months)<br> 4.Denmark (4-12 months)<br> 5.Estonia (8-11 months)<br> 6.Finland (6-12 months)<br> 7.Germany (9 months)<br> 8.Greece (12 months)<br> 9.Guatemala (12-24 months)<br> 10.Moldavia (12 months)<br> 11.Mongolia (12 months)<br> 12.Paraguay (12-24 months)<br> 13.Poland (9-12 months)<br> 14.Serbia (6 months)<br> 15.Switzerland (18-21 weeks)<br> 16.Taiwan (12 months)<br> 17.Tunisia (12 months)<br> 18.Turkey (12 months)<br> 19.Ukraine (12 months_<br> 20.Uzbekistan (12 months)</p>
              <p>From the above data, it can be seen that for all intents and
              purposes a conscript army training programme need not be as long as the
              one we have in Singapore. The more advance countries like Austria,
              Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Switzerland all have full-time services
              limited to one year and less.</p>
              <p>Even Taiwan, which has an identifiable enemy in the form of China,
              limits its active service to 12 months. Only countries like South Korea
              and Israel have conscription periods that are longer than Singapore’s.
              These countries are, however, in a state of war.</p>
              <p>Given the situation in Singapore there is no reason why we cannot
              employ more efficient training methods and reduce full-time NS from the
              present two-years to twelve months or less.</p>
              <p><strong>Reservist training</strong></p>
              <p>The current period of reserve training for NS men of up to 40 years
              old is also a burden on the servicemen and, by extension, the economy.
              Not only does the serviceman have to contend with the influx of
              foreigners, they are disadvantaged in terms of employment, remuneration
              and promotion when employers compare local men who have to be away for
              weeks in anyone year with foreign workers who have no such obligation.</p>
              <p>The span of a serviceman’s reservist training should not go beyond
              30 years of age. Men tend to settle down and start families around this
              age and job stability and carreer prospects are essential during this
              period. Unfair competition from foreign nationals would handicap local
              males and add to their already stressful lifestyles.</p>
              <p>In addition, the human body goes into a physical decline after the
              age of 30. To keep our military personnel in top condition, it makes
              little sense in keeping men over the age of 30 in the frontline if
              military conflict does indeed breakout.</p>
              <p><strong>Increase volunteer, professional army</strong></p>
              <p>To compensate for the decrease in the number of active and reservist
              NSmen, the Singapore Armed Forces should expand volunteer army
              recruitment to complement the reduction in the number of conscripts.</p>
              <p>In fact, the number of countries that have scrapped conscription are
              on the rise: Argentina (1994), Belgium (1994), Czech Republic (2004),
              France (1996), Hungary (2004), Italy (2004), Netherlands (1996), New
              Zealand (1972), Portugal (2004), and Spain (2001).</p>
              <p>While Singapore may not be ready to follow suit, it would be prudent
              for us to reduce NSmen in favour of a professional military outfit</p>
              <p>At the moment, NSmen are exploited for their services to glorify the
              PAP during National Day parades. The energy and time of these men can
              be put to more productive use than as entertainment for the PAP regime.</p>
              <p><strong>Conscientious objectors</strong></p>
              <p>What about people who do not believe that it is right for them to do
              military service due to moral, religious or ethical grounds? At the
              moment such conscientious objectors are charged and imprisoned for the
              length of their service.</p>
              <p>In some of the countries that have compulsory military service,
              there is also a provision for conscientious objectors to serve in
              non-combat roles. There is an argument that this would open the flood
              gates for men to opt for non-combat positions. Such a loophole can be
              plugged by increasing the length of active service by, say, six months.
              The experiences of other countries like Germany and Sweden have not
              been negative in this aspect where males try to avoid combat service by
              claiming to be conscientious objectors.</p>
              <p><strong>Tranparency and openness</strong></p>
              <p>Obligation in Singapore seems to be a one-way street. While the
              Government holds the people accountable for their NS liabilities, the
              Ministry of Defence remains non-transparent and non-accountable in
              their dealings with the public.</p>
              <p>The recent deaths of National Servicemen have opened a can of worms
              on training safety. In addition, the number of training fatalities and
              injuries are not made known to the public as a matter-of-course. The
              Government which compels the people to give their lives for the country
              are obliged to be absolutely transparent with information pertaining to
              safety issues. Compensation for deaths and injuries must also be
              reviewed and revised upwards.</p>
              <p>The Government must also not exploit NSmen as cheap labour during
              major events such as the WB-IMF meeting or, possibly, the upcoming
              Youth Olympics. In must be remembered that the Enlistment Act was
              enacted for a specific purpose and any detraction from that purpose
              must be shunned.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>When citizens are forced to serve in the military with the
              possibility of being killed if called to war, it is imperative that the
              government is a democratic one where citizens can hold the government
              accountable for its decisions and actions. Otherwise we may end up in a
              situation where wars are waged for the ruling elite rather than for the
              security and sovereignty of the nation.</p>

              <p>x2. It's a lot of selective information on the part of the writer of this article. Why are Israel and South Korea out of that list?</p>
              <p>Most other countries on that list who do NS do it out of tokenism. A means of shaking up and disciplining their male populace, if you will. Their NSmen will not (usually) be the first to be sent into combat - that's for the better-trained regulars to handle first.</p>
              <p>On our part, we do NS for our very own survival. When we go to war, we do not just send in our regulars. That's friggin' suicide. We freakin' have to turn to the NSmen for the critical mass that we need!</p>
              <p>I don't like NS. Nobody likes NS. No reason why the gahmen doesn't dislike NS too - a lot of resources goes into training our boys, and a good pool of talented manpower gets tied up for two years while they're being trained in the armed forces.</p>
              <p>Want a volunteer army? Well, who wants to volunteer?</p>
              <p>Want an increased professional force? Okay, sure.... can we get 300,000 people to sign on? And can we do so without impacting the economy at all?</p>
              <p>If you ask me, NS is a necessary evil in an imperfect world. And two years is still an improvement over 2 1/2. And as Bear has pointed out, NS has already been watered-down over the years.</p>
              <p>As much as I oppose a lot of the ruling party's policies..... should the sh*t ever hit the fan..... what this writer is proposing is pure madness.</p>

              <p><strong>SDP’s policy paper on National Service</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
              <p>National Service, or army conscription in Singapore, was first introduced in 1967 due to pressing issues such as national security after Singapore’s “forced” independence in 1965. In 1971, the British completely pulled out of Singapore. It has been 41 years since the introduction of NS.</p>
              <p>Since then the world and Asia has changed significantly in terms of security and economic arrangements. But has Singapore’s conscription policy kept up with these changes to reflect and cope with the new geopolitical landscape?</p>
              <p>First let us review the service that all able-bodied 18-year-old male Singaporeans have to undergo. Basic Military Training, or BMT, is the “boot camp” for all new recruits. This lasts for three months whereupon the soldier then gets posted out to other units for further specialised training.</p>
              <p>The conscripts then serve the remainder of their two-year stint polishing up their combat skills. Following the two years of full-time service, NSmen are required (for up to 40 days a year) to serve in a part-tme capacity until they are 50 years old for commissioned officers and 40 for others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Reduce the two-year full-time service</strong></p>
              <p>In an age where warfare has turned to “smart” technology, is it still logical and necessary for Singapore to insist that its National Servicemen undergo 24 months months of active, full-time service? Such a policy is rare among countries that maintain a conscription policy. Below is a list of countries with periods of full-time conscript service:</p>
              <p>1.Austria (6 months)<br>2.Bolivia (12 months)<br>3.Brazil (9-12 months)<br>4.Denmark (4-12 months)<br>5.Estonia (8-11 months)<br>6.Finland (6-12 months)<br>7.Germany (9 months)<br>8.Greece (12 months)<br>9.Guatemala (12-24 months)<br>10.Moldavia (12 months)<br>11.Mongolia (12 months)<br>12.Paraguay (12-24 months)<br>13.Poland (9-12 months)<br>14.Serbia (6 months)<br>15.Switzerland (18-21 weeks)<br>16.Taiwan (12 months)<br>17.Tunisia (12 months)<br>18.Turkey (12 months)<br>19.Ukraine (12 months_<br>20.Uzbekistan (12 months)</p>
              <p>From the above data, it can be seen that for all intents and purposes a conscript army training programme need not be as long as the one we have in Singapore. The more advance countries like Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Switzerland all have full-time services limited to one year and less.</p>
              <p>Even Taiwan, which has an identifiable enemy in the form of China, limits its active service to 12 months. Only countries like South Korea and Israel have conscription periods that are longer than Singapore’s. These countries are, however, in a state of war.</p>
              <p>Given the situation in Singapore there is no reason why we cannot employ more efficient training methods and reduce full-time NS from the present two-years to twelve months or less.</p>
              <p><strong>Reservist training</strong></p>
              <p>The current period of reserve training for NS men of up to 40 years old is also a burden on the servicemen and, by extension, the economy. Not only does the serviceman have to contend with the influx of foreigners, they are disadvantaged in terms of employment, remuneration and promotion when employers compare local men who have to be away for weeks in anyone year with foreign workers who have no such obligation.</p>
              <p>The span of a serviceman’s reservist training should not go beyond 30 years of age. Men tend to settle down and start families around this age and job stability and carreer prospects are essential during this period. Unfair competition from foreign nationals would handicap local males and add to their already stressful lifestyles.</p>
              <p>In addition, the human body goes into a physical decline after the age of 30. To keep our military personnel in top condition, it makes little sense in keeping men over the age of 30 in the frontline if military conflict does indeed breakout.</p>
              <p><strong>Increase volunteer, professional army</strong></p>
              <p>To compensate for the decrease in the number of active and reservist NSmen, the Singapore Armed Forces should expand volunteer army recruitment to complement the reduction in the number of conscripts.</p>
              <p>In fact, the number of countries that have scrapped conscription are on the rise: Argentina (1994), Belgium (1994), Czech Republic (2004), France (1996), Hungary (2004), Italy (2004), Netherlands (1996), New Zealand (1972), Portugal (2004), and Spain (2001).</p>
              <p>While Singapore may not be ready to follow suit, it would be prudent for us to reduce NSmen in favour of a professional military outfit</p>
              <p>At the moment, NSmen are exploited for their services to glorify the PAP during National Day parades. The energy and time of these men can be put to more productive use than as entertainment for the PAP regime.</p>
              <p><strong>Conscientious objectors</strong></p>
              <p>What about people who do not believe that it is right for them to do military service due to moral, religious or ethical grounds? At the moment such conscientious objectors are charged and imprisoned for the length of their service.</p>
              <p>In some of the countries that have compulsory military service, there is also a provision for conscientious objectors to serve in non-combat roles. There is an argument that this would open the flood gates for men to opt for non-combat positions. Such a loophole can be plugged by increasing the length of active service by, say, six months. The experiences of other countries like Germany and Sweden have not been negative in this aspect where males try to avoid combat service by claiming to be conscientious objectors.</p>
              <p><strong>Tranparency and openness</strong></p>
              <p>Obligation in Singapore seems to be a one-way street. While the Government holds the people accountable for their NS liabilities, the Ministry of Defence remains non-transparent and non-accountable in their dealings with the public.</p>
              <p>The recent deaths of National Servicemen have opened a can of worms on training safety. In addition, the number of training fatalities and injuries are not made known to the public as a matter-of-course. The Government which compels the people to give their lives for the country are obliged to be absolutely transparent with information pertaining to safety issues. Compensation for deaths and injuries must also be reviewed and revised upwards.</p>
              <p>The Government must also not exploit NSmen as cheap labour during major events such as the WB-IMF meeting or, possibly, the upcoming Youth Olympics. In must be remembered that the Enlistment Act was enacted for a specific purpose and any detraction from that purpose must be shunned.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>When citizens are forced to serve in the military with the possibility of being killed if called to war, it is imperative that the government is a democratic one where citizens can hold the government accountable for its decisions and actions. Otherwise we may end up in a situation where wars are waged for the ruling elite rather than for the security and sovereignty of the nation.</p>

              <p><br>This is the reason why SDP will never be the ruling party of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Democracy is when the people choses the smartest group of people to lead them and govern their country to prosperity.</p>
              <p>If the politicians in the opposition party like SDP thinks at the same level as the people, then it is certainly proven that the politicians in the SDP are not SMARTER than the people. These politicians are only voicing out the transgression faced by a small group of the people, and that makes these politicians the People's Nannies.</p>
              <p>It's the same as in a family, the children (people) will always be closer to the mother (nannies politicians) than the father (ruling party politicians). Why? Cos the mother always spoon-fed to satisfy the children and buy toys, tidbits, goodies, with whatever the children asked for. The father will do whatever it takes to ensure the survival of the family including the mother and the children....WITHOUT seeking their opinions/approvals.</p>
              <p>You think fathers before our generations are the head of the family without a reason? Just having a big sack of balls plus sasuage doesn't makes you the head, you need to be smart to lead you know? But I guess this tradition will soon be overturned judging at the uselessness of SG Guys nowadays. Lucky for me, I'm smarter than them.</p>
              <p>Government must be formed by the smartest group of people in the country, if the government begins to think like the people...then the country will be thrown into chaos and get overrun by idiots and retards who holds the majority vote of power to shift the direction of prosperity to poverty.</p>
              <p>Maybe that's why I don't think like those rebels, cos I'm not a descendant of Yelu Qi, I'm the descendant of Yang Guo and Xiao Longnv. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>As an opposition championer, dun u think it is a bit lame to take NS as your tool to win votes?? Come on lah, for so many years, NS had been the same, if opposition can wins vote by pointing to NS as a default, then opposition is real lame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A credible Opposition should come out with more creative and innovation ideas about Singapore instead of crying over NS as a yardstick which is also a national security where all are involved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not that people dun vote for opposition or PAP govt is good, it is with no choice of good opposition that peoples voted PAP instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Get your damn paper off the board and start thinking better ideas. Otherwise take your medicine and keep quiet.</p>

              <p>OMG..</p>
              <p>Yes it's true that technology has evolved to be even advanced, but....<br><em>"smart" warfare technology ≠ shorter conscript period.<br>So w</em>hat good does our advanced warfare technology do if we don't have enough time to master and operate these technology?</p>
              <p>The general lot of the NSFs may think that after their training, they spend the rest of their 12month++ idling away and doing nothing in camps and bases. But the truth is that there are <strong>NSFs</strong> who are involved in "technology" that they have to deal and train with throughout their 24months. You all don't hear these that often coz they're sworn to secrecy.</p>
              <p>Hence when the general public hear the main bulk of people complaining about how their time is wasted being <em>arrowed</em> to do <em>saikang</em> and idle away in office, it's not because they are purposely kept back, it's because the time needed for NSFs to train is best kept close to ± 24months..</p>
              <p>Reading up the part about "<strong>Conscientious objectors</strong>", i only have this to say..<br>There are people who don't see the point in doing military service due to moral or ethical reasons, and that they can be employed to serve in non-military vocations.</p>
              <p>From what I've seen and what those who served in NS has experienced, i dare say (and that the rest will agree) that, <strong>majority</strong> of the people who has a choice to serve in non-combat roles will only choose to serve in non-combat roles because human mindset is naturally tuned to do one thing: take the easy way out.<br>Hence if the choice was left to us, we would have all chosen to take the easy way out, that is to serve in non-combat. Then who's left to be the combatant?</p>
              <p>Yes, we may not like it when we're called up to waste our time doing prep work for major event e.g. National Day, but that does not mean it's necessary, as much as we don't like it. Just imagine, if we're not called back to do up for National Day, who's gonna do the prep work? Recall the NSmen from their civilian jobs and do the prep work for full time? Ask our foreign workers to do? <em>Alamak</em>..... <em>*slaps own forehead*</em> dunno what the author was thinking when he/she was typing out this "policy paper"...</p>

              <p>There are some good points and some bad points in CSJ's article.</p>
              <p>I do not agree we should reduce the time spent in army. But this paragraph, at least to me, sounds quite true, although his words usage might be a bit too harsh.</p>

              <p>At the moment, NSmen are exploited for their services to glorify

                                      men can be put to more productive use than as entertainment for the

              <p>This already excludes the amount of time (and cheap labour for the govt) the school kids have to put into training for NDPs instead of spending time increasing their knowledge or engaging in CCAs (thus learning something in the process) than merely prancing around in the fields en masse.</p>

              <p><br>Our local workforce is decreasing in nos, if all NSmen become regulars then, who is going to work in the economy?? Please bear in mind that because of NS disciplinary training, our guys are better disciplined in term of responsibility and character in dealing with their works and studies, 2 years is a must as we are short of men, other countries can go for 3 mth or whatsover because they got peoples, not enuf camps to stuff all of them for 2 years. So, they are not fully trained. Secondly they dun have enuf military budget to feed them. DO you know that in other countries, many peoples volunteer to serve NS or army was turn down due to too many of them, and why??? because outside no job.</p>
