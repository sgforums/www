              <p>to clarify, when i said that people will roughly know whether there will be a war or not, i don't mean that they will know the exact date and time of invasion. if they can do that, they may as well replace the intelligence service.</p>
              <p>having a well prepared reserve of armed personels is important, but having a large standing peace-time army is not.</p>
              <p>look at the battle of Britain, when France fell, the Brits sure know that they are next on the list, without having to wait for official delcaration of war by the germans or by any government. it is common sense.</p>
              <p>in the weeks before the israeli invasion of lebanon, the lebanites are already leaving lebanon for safer grounds, even before the war began.</p>
              <p>in WWII, well-to-do europeana flee singapore to australia before the japanese even reaches malaysia.</p>
              <p>to quote operation barbarossa, in the weeks before the invasion, the USSR do know that they will be attack, but ain't sure exactly when.</p>
              <p>unlike singapore, the USSR back then was a full-time army, with not much <strong>well-trained</strong> reserve forces. they were even lacking in proper equipment, not to mention about their capability to mount a full scale mobilisation. the typical soviet army then was screwed, 20 men to 1 rifle. 19 men waiting behind their sole-weapon bearing comrade, ready to pick up that rifle when he falls.</p>
              <p>they don't have the ability to mobilise to form even a half-decent army.</p>
              <p>for the USA, so what if you have a great standing army? it is proven at pearl harbor that having a big standing army is not necessary. it is not a gurantee against surprise attacks. in fact, it left your standing forces to greater exposure by first strike attacks.</p>
              <p>with the satellite technology today, one must be dumb (usually the chief of armed forces), to not notice hostile enemy buildup.</p>
              <p>rmb, for the enemy to attack, they too have to mobilise and move their troops around, which will give us more than enough time for mobilisation if required. </p>

              <p>It is based on primary sources, secondary sources, documentary sources, diplomatic records, monographs and other evidence.</p>
              <p>An
                  analysis of such information clearly shows the real story of what was
                  going on, which was Britain trying to instigate a German-Russian war.</p>
              <p>Historian Burnett Bolloten writes on the reasons for the british cover up:</p>
              <p><br> <br> ...That the wells of appeasement lay in this fear of Russia, in the
                  conviction that Nazi Germany was a barrier against the spread of
                  Communism, and that a war in western europe could only benefit the
                  Soviet Union by extending her power and influence has been amply
                  demonstrated in this and other chapters. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But these cardinal
                  elements in the policy of appeasement have been underrated or almost
                  totally ignored by the British historical establishment.</span><br> <br> There are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> two reasons for this failure by British historians to come to terms with their country's diplomatic past. </span>Firstly, there is the accepted tradition not to attribute to their government Machiavellian designs against a foreign power.<br> <br> Hence, no matter how patriotic or realistic Chamberlain and his
                  supporters may have felt themselves to be in attempting to spare
                  Western Europe the ravages of war and revolution,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> they should not be accused of conspiring to pit one totalitarian power against the other.</span> "Of course," writes Robert Skidelsky, the British neorevisonist
                  historian,"there were a number of groups in Britain who . . . advocated
                  the bargain that Hitler must always have hoped for — 'a German deal
                  with the British Empire at the expense of the Soviet Union.' But such
                  cynicism (or realism) was foreign to the British Establishment."<br> <br> Secondly, because of the ideological divide between East and West, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no establishment historian (despite Stalin's own Machiavellian aims) wishes to play into the hands of the<br> Soviet Union by ackowledging Britain's share of responsibility for the
                  rebirth of German militarism and the calamity of the Second World War.</span><br> <br> This<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> failure to expose the main roots of appeasement is unfortunate</span> not only for the historiography of this crucial period in world history, but for those seeking a true understanding of...</p>

              <p>Putin's remarks at interview:</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">...As for the people who want to or attempt to
                      rewrite history, to disparage the importance of this event and the
                      important of the Soviet Union and the Red Army, the Soviet Army, in the
                      victory over Nazism, we understand the events that this is connected
                      with. For example, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is often mentioned,
                      which resulted in a pact between Soviet Russia, the Soviet Union and
                      Hitler’s Germany, and the subsequent annexation of the Baltic States.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">What can one say about this? Everything needs to
                      be seen in the context of historic events. And I would ask you to
                      return to the events of September 1938, when agreements were made
                      between Nazi Germany and western European countries, which later went
                      down in history as the “Munich pact”.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">I would also remind you that these agreements
                      were signed by the western allies: Daladier, I believe, from France and
                      the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and on the other side by Mussolini
                      and Hitler himself.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">The Soviet-German document was signed on a much
                      lower level – on the level of foreign ministers – one year later, in
                      response to the treaty signed by the western countries, which is now
                      called the “Munich pact”. I would also remind you – and for you as
                      Slovaks, this is probably especially important: as a result of the
                      Munich pact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Czechoslovakia was handed over to Nazi Germany, and the
                      western partners, as it were, showed Hitler where he should go to
                      fulfil his growing ambitions – to the East.</strong></span> To protect its interests
                      and security on its western borders, the Soviet Union signed the
                      Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Germany.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">If we look at the problem in this context, it
                      looks quite different. And I would recommend new historians, or rather
                      those who want to rewrite history, to learn to read books before they
                      rewrite or write them...</p>

              <p class="RVPS706570"><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em> "What can I say on that score? We ought to regard it all in
              its historical context. I dare ask you to get back to the developments
              of September 1938, when notorious agreements were signed in Munich
              between nazi Germany and West European countries. They came down into
              history, later on, and are often referred to as 'the Munich plot'."</em></p>
              <p><em> The agreements exposed Czechoslovakia to nazi Germany to be devoured.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Western partners, in a way, showed Hitler where he ought to turn to

              <p>Beijing, February 18, 1973, 2:43–7:15 p.m.<br><br>Talks between Chou
                  En-lai, Premier of China and Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Assistant to the
                  President for National Security Affairs:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PM Chou: Originally Western Europe had hoped that Germany would go eastwards.</strong></span><br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Western Europe.<br><br>PM Chou:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> At Munich.</strong></span><br><br>Dr.
                  Kissinger: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes, at Munich.</strong></span> Western Europe had very superficial leaders.
                  They didn’t have the courage to pursue any policy towards a conclusion.
                  Once they had done Munich it made no sense to fight for Poland. But
                  that is a different issue. And I don’t blame Stalin, because from his
                  point of view he gained himself the essential time.<br><br>PM Chou: But there was one weak point, that they were not sufficiently prepared.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: That is right.<br><br>PM
                  Chou: They did make preparations but they were not entirely sufficient.
                  And in Zhukov’s memoirs he also touched upon this. Have you read this?<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Yes. And they deployed their forces too far forward.<br><br>PM Chou: Also scattered in three directions.<br><br>Dr.
                  Kissinger: So, but the basic point that I want to make is not to debate
                  history but to say the lessons of both wars are that once a big war
                  starts its consequences are unpredictable, and a country which
                  encourages a big war in the hope that it can calculate its consequences
                  is likely to produce a disaster for itself. The Germans had made very
                  careful plans in World War I, and they had exercised them for 30 years,
                  but when the war . . .<br><br>PM Chou: You mean after the Pact of Berlin?<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: World War I—1914—the Schlieffen Plan.<br><br>PM Chou: You mean after the Treaty of Berlin.<br><br>Dr.
                  Kissinger: Oh, after 1878, yes, that’s right. But they had exercised
                  the Schlieffen Plan every year after 1893, for 21 years, and they had
                  calculated everything except the psychological strain on a commander
                  under battle conditions. So they thought they were starting a 6-months
                  war and they wound up with a 4-year war. Not one European leader in
                  1914, if he had known what the world would look like in 1918, would
                  have gone to war. And nor would Hitler in 1939. Let us apply it to the
                  current situation, these observations. If one analyzes the problem of
                  pushing the Soviet Union toward the East, or maybe you trying to push
                  it towards the West . . .</p>

              <p>Beijing, February 17–18, 1973, 11:30 p.m.–1:20 a.m.<br><br>Talks between Mao Zedong and Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs:<br><br>...Chairman
                  Mao: (Pointing at Dr. Kissinger) They are uniting and the Soviet Union
                  wants the Communist Party to get into office. I don’t like their
                  Communist party, just like I don’t like your Communist party. I like
                  you, but not your Communist party. (Laughter)<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>In the West
                  you always historically had a policy, for example, in both World Wars
                  you always began by pushing Germany to fight against Russia.</strong></span><br><br>Dr.
                  Kissinger: But it is not our policy to push Russia to fight against
                  China, because the danger to us of a war in China is as great as a war
                  in Europe.<br><br>Chairman Mao: (Before Dr. Kissinger’s remarks are
                  translated, he makes remarks in Chinese and counts on his fingers. Miss
                  Tang then translates Dr. Kissinger’s remarks and after that Chairman
                  Mao’s remarks.)<br><br>What I wanted to say is whether or not you are
                  now pushing West Germany to make peace with Russia and then push Russia
                  eastward. I suspect the whole of the West has such an idea, that is to
                  push Russia eastward, mainly against us and also Japan. Also probably
                  towards you, in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.<br><br>Dr.
                  Kissinger: We did not favor this policy. We preferred the German
                  opposition party which did not pursue this policy. (Chairman Mao,
                  smoking a cigar, offers cigars to Dr. Kissinger and Mr. Lord who
                  decline.)...</p>

              <p>Mao Zedong's talk with British ex-prime minister Edward Heath:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heath: I think the Soviet Union has a lot of troubles. They are facing domestic economic difficulties and agricultural predicament, and there are also differences within the leadership, over questions of tactics and timing, not over long-term strategy.<br><br>Mao: I think the Soviet Union is busy with its own affairs and unable to deal with Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, China and the Pacific. I think it will lose.<br><br>Heath: However, its military strength is continually augmented. Although the Soviet Union has encountered troubles at many places in the world, its strength is continuing to grow. Therefore, we deem this to be the principal threat. Does the Chairman think the Soviet Union constitutes a menace to China?<br><br>Mao: We are prepared for it to come, but it will collapse if it comes. It has only a handful of troops, and you Europeans are so frightened of it! Some people in the West are always trying to direct this calamity toward China. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your senior, Chamberlain, and also Daladier of France were the ones who pushed Germany eastward.</strong></span><br><br>Heath:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I opposed Mr. Chamberlain then.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...We are told sometimes that 
              					the criminal plot of the two dictatorships –  Stalin’s and 
              					Hitler’s – was legitimate under the international law of the 
              					time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What’s more, it constituted a justified or even essential defense in view of the Munich 
              					Agreement concluded in September 1938 among Nazi Germany, 
              					Italy, the United Kingdom and France. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That treaty was

                  an ace of succeeding, and failed only because of the obstinacy of the
                  Poles, the unseemly haste of Hitler, and the fact that at the eleventh
                  hour the Milner Group realized the implications of their policy and

              <p>...Any analysis of the motivations of Britain in
              1938-1939 is bound to be difficult because different people had
              different motives, motives changed in the course of time, the motives
              of the government were clearly not the same as the motives of the
              people, and in no country has secrecy and anonymity been carried so far
              or been so well preserved as in Britain.</p>
              <p>In general, motives become
              vaguer and less secret as we move our attention from the innermost
              circles of the government outward. As if we were looking at the layers
              of an onion, we may discern four points of view:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(1) the
              anti-Bolsheviks at the center, </strong></span></p>
              <p>(2) the "three-bloc-world" supporters
              close to the center,</p>
              <p>(3) the supporters of "appeasement," and</p>
              <p>(4) the
              "peace at any price" group in a peripheral position.</p>
              <p>The
              "anti-Bolsheviks," who were also anti-French, were extremely important
              from 1919 to 1926, but then decreased to little more than a lunatic
              fringe, rising again in numbers and influence after 1934 to dominate
              the real policy of the government in 1939. In the earlier period the
              chief figures in this group were Lord Curzon, Lord D'Abernon, and
              General Smuts. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They did what they could to destroy reparations, permit
              German rearmament, and tear down what they called "French militarism."</strong></span></p>
              <p>     This point of view was supported by the second
              group, which was known in those days as the Round Table Group, and came
              later to be called, somewhat inaccurately, the Cliveden Set, after the
              country estate of Lord and Lady Astor. It included Lord Milner, Leopold
              Amery, and Edward Grigg (Lord Altrincham), as well as Lord Lothian,
              Smuts, Lord Astor, Lord Brand (brother-in-law of Lady Astor and
              managing director of Lazard Brothers, the international bankers),
              Lionel Curtis, Geoffrey Dawson (editor of <em>The Times</em>), and their associates.</p>
              <p>This group wielded great influence because it controlled the Rhodes Trust, the Beit Trust, <em>The Times</em> of London, The Observer, the influential and highly anonymous quarterly review known as <em>The Round Table</em> (founded in 1910 with money supplied by Sir Abe Bailey and the Rhodes
              Trust, and with Lothian as editor), and it dominated the Royal
              Institute of International Affairs, called "Chatham House" (of which
              Sir Abe Bailey and the Astors were the chief financial supporters,
              while Lionel Curtis was the actual founder), the Carnegie United
              Kingdom Trust, and All Souls College, Oxford.</p>
              <p>This Round Table Group
              formed the core of the three-bloc-world supporters, and differed from
              the anti-Bolsheviks like D'Abernon in that they sought to contain the
              Soviet Union between a German-dominated Europe and an English-speaking
              bloc <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rather than to destroy it as the anti-Bolsheviks wanted. </strong></span>Relationships between the two groups were very close and friendly, and
              some people, like Smuts, were in both.</p>
              <p>   <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>  The anti-Bolsheviks, including D'Abernon, Smuts,
              Sir John Simon, and H. A. L. Fisher (Warden of All Souls College), were
              willing to go to any extreme to tear down France and build up Germany.</strong></span> Their point of view can be found in many places, and most emphatically
              in a letter of August I l, 1920, from D'Abernon to Sir Maurice (later
              Lord) Hankey, a protà¹‰gà¹‰ of Lord Esher who wielded great influence in
              the inter-war period as secretary to the Cabinet and secretary to
              almost every international conference on reparations from Genoa (1922)
              to Lausanne (1932). D'Abernon advocated a secret alliance of Britain
              "with the German military leaders in cooperating against the Soviet."
              As ambassador of Great Britain in Berlin in 1920-1926, D'Abernon
              carried on this policy and blocked all efforts by the Disarmament
              Commission to disarm, or even inspect, Germany (according to Brigadier
              J. H. Morgan of the commission)...</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">...Through all this, the British stubbornly persisted with
              their vision of an Anglo-German rapprochement.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When the Panzers rolled into
              Prague the Federation of British Industry sent a delegation to Dusseldorf to
              negotiate with its German counterpart. Throughout that last summer of peace,
              talks took place on a many trade and bilateral questions.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The guarantees given
              by Britain and France to Poland fit into this picture of burgeoning Anglo-German
              relations. Chamberlain stiffened the Poles, in effect giving them the right to
              declare war on Germany on behalf of Britain and France. But war was the last
              thing he expected. The British guarantees to Poland were made with the purpose
              of encouraging Polish intransigence and giving Hitler reasons to swallow Poland
              whole. Poland was a sacrificial pawn. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>British policy was to direct Germany
              against Soviet Russia</strong></span>. It had been for more than twenty years.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The unilateral
              guarantees were an alternative to a political-military understanding with the
              USSR which was the only country actually in a position to help Poland.
              Chamberlain was trying to canalise German aggression away from the Western
              Powers. Hitler had once again been given the green light for aggression in the
              East. This was how Hitler himself understood the matter: when Britain and
              Germany did find themselves at war a few weeks later, no-one was more surprised
              than the 'strategic genius' in Berlin, unless it was Neville Chamberlain.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>British policy had only one aim: to cajole, wheedle, guide
              and direct Germany against Soviet Russia...</strong></span></p>

              <p>...The truth is that even in the fateful period of the spring and summer
              of 1939, on the threshold of war, Britain and France, supported by
              United States ruling circles, continued their former line of policy.</p>
