              <p>You have done a remarkable research, which I have been reading with your replies to skythewood that began on Page 13 through 16 - from Kissinger-Chou En Lai to Chairman Mao-PM Edward Heath ad verbatim record of the respective historical meetings on different dates.</p>
              <p>Perceptions of those political leaders simply confirm the geo-political interests of the various major players, but do the expressions of political perceptions reveal the political manouvres that continue behind the scene of "real life" - where each political power continue to undermine the other's interests ?</p>
              <p>Even as much as you will believe that Chamberlain and his French accomplices were conniving to re-direct Adolf Hitler's ambitions eastwards towards Russia, you must also note that these efforts were completely negated when at the same time Russia and Germany were signing a pact to divide Poland that Britain was sworn to defend.</p>
              <p>This resulted in the province of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia becoming a sacrificial lamb to "appease" Adolf Hitler.</p>
              <p>Was Britain and France pushing Hitler to move Eastwards to neutralise Russia's communism ?</p>
              <p>If so, historical records does not seem to agree with your views.</p>
              <p>It was common knowledge that even before WW-2 had taken effect, the Communist threat was real and was pervasive, and have nurtured moles over decades - with the discovery of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.espionageinfo.com/Bl-Ch/Cambridge-University-Spy-Ring.html">‘Cambridge University Spy Ring’ </a>in mid-1960s providing a shocking revelation to the Western Governments.</p>
              <p>Even a Pullitzer-Prize winning author's writings about "Russian moles" under-mining the Capitalist societies, as well as Adolf Hitler's Germany has shown that the threat from Russia's Communism was real.</p>
              <p>While Stalin had signed a Peace Treaty with Hitler, Russia was also making secret plans to attack Germany, buying time for Russia to build up mulitple tank, artillery and infantry divisions in secret; while manipulating politics behind the scene to galvanise Russian Citizens' attitudes towards Hitler and Nazism.</p>
              <p>Adolf Hitler had to attack eastward in what is now known as the Babarrossa Campaign, as Russia's military built-up had reached a critical point that threatened Germany.</p>
              <p>In the eyes of the Germans, the Babarrossa Campaign was a pre-emptive strike against the Russians, even as much as it was portrayed to be a betrayal by Hitler after a Peace Treaty was signed with the Russians.</p>
              <p>The conversation of the Western Political Leaders with China's Political Leaders in the 1970s simply brought up the geo-political interests that were at play, and confirms nothing of the schemes to put Russia at risks.</p>
              <p>If at all, every country in Europe - including Russia - was buying time to prolong Peace in Europe in order to rebuild their military, as every European Country was hit by the 1930s economic recessions and had reduced their military size and expenditures - even as Hitler was expanding Germany's military to regain their loss national pride, political and economic interests.</p>

              <p><br>You may want to reconsider your statement if you accept the fact that members of the <em>"Cambridge University Spy Ring"</em> had occupied very senior positions in the British Government throughout WW-2 and into the mid-1960s.</p>
              <p>When spies are in a very senior position of Government - either in the Cabinet, or in the various Civil Service Department that support the Cabinet - and all working in concert, their impact can be very damaging.</p>
              <p>It seems that up until the 21st Century, there remains at least one Communist mole that had evaded detection.</p>
              <p>The Pullitzer-Prize Winner who wrote the book that convincingly identified Hermann Goerring as a Russian mole - and was second-in-command next to Adolf Hitler, was surely in a very influential position to have affected Hitler's decisions to suit Stalin's preparation works to face the Germans.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In the new references given below - [Ref 1 and Ref 2] - you will note that Stalin had a design to dominate the World for Communism to succeed in colonizing Europe and Asia, which explains for the intense support given to the Russian KGB to develop moles in all countries that Stalin see as a threat.</p>
              <p>In the referenced piece it showed a messages sent in 1940 by Stalin's Foreign Ministry to Russia's Ambassador in Tokyo - which was intercepted by the Japanese Consulate in Manchuria - and clearly showed Stalin's ambitious design at domination:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>"In one of these messages, Molotov told his ambassador: "We concluded an 'Agreement with Germany' because a war is required in Europe" between the capitalist nations, to open the door for the future communization of the European continent. Molotov went on to explain that any peace settlement that would end the war between China and Japan "might destroy our work proceeding among the suppressed peoples of Asia, and . . . it would not instigate the Japanese-American war which we desire."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>If Japan turned its eyes towards conquest in Southeast Asia — including the U.S.-controlled Philippine Islands — and became embroiled in a war with America, then Moscow could feel secure that the Japanese would not invade Soviet Siberia, as well. And in the chaos that a general war in Asia would create, the breeding ground for communist revolutions would be expanded. To help seal this likelihood, Stalin signed a non-aggression pact with Japan in April 1941."</em></span></p>

              Germany’s attack towards the Soviet Ukraine</span>, and the agreement

              <p>...One the eve of the Great War there was an atmosphere of war
              preparations, of frenzied diplomacy, of uncertain pacts and treaties
              such as obtains to-day. There was also the same deep apprehension and
              longing for peace on the part of the toiling masses. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is true that
              the first waves of patriotism on the outbreak of war swept away the
              instinctive distrust of the masses but it reasserted itself in the form
              of revolution before long.</span> Similarly, the bourgeois politicians who
              babble so glibly of peace to-day are unwittingly preparing the masses

              <p><em>...The Soviet Union together with the communist parties around the world
                          launched a campaign to warn that fascism meant war and that if Hitler
                          was to be stopped a world-wide anti-fascist front had to be created.
                          The Soviet Union called for a system of collective security against the
                          rise of fascism.<br><br> Unfortunately the western powers, led at that time by the British and
                          French Governments and a number of other European countries, encouraged
                          the rearmament of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nazi Germany believing that its virulent
                          anti-communism meant it could be used to attack and destroy the
                          socialist Soviet Union.</span> They rejected any collective security pact with

              <p><strong>Snow:</strong> That seems a rather large order for Mr. Chamberlain. I wonder if you mean that, while fighting Germany, Chamberlain's real attention is centered upon the destruction of Russia? It appears to me that Chamberlain has got his hands full with Hitler for the present, without planning an even larger war against Russia. Would it not be logical for him to try to win Russia's friendship, if possible, in order to beat Hitler, even if he does have some designs on Stalin in the future? Do you mean that he <em>formerly</em> dreamed of diverting Hitler's attack toward the East, or that he is actively planning it now, or that he hopes to consummate such a front out of the present war?<br><br><strong>Mao: </strong>He formerly dreamed of it, he actually plans it now, and he hopes to realize it later. Why? Because in front of Chamberlain there is not only the problem of Hitler, but also the problem of revolt in India, and among people in his own country, while the Soviet Union is the supporter of the colonial revolutions and the people's (revolutionary) movement in capaitalist countries themselves. Hence Roosevelt also sympathizes with Chamberlain.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...The purpose of Chamberlain's 1938 Munich agreement to give the
                      Sudetenland to Germany was, in fact, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">push the Germans to the east
                      and into confrontation with the Soviet Union. </span>One reason for this, of
                      course, was the imperialists' fond dream of smashing the socialist
                      Soviet Union...</p>
              <p><a href="http://rwor.org/a/076/ww2-en.html">http://rwor.org/a/076/ww2-en.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...However, influential leaders of the capitalist powers believed that
              German fascism was the only bulwark against Bolshevism. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They
              confidently expected that a re-armed Germany would sweep to the East
              and destroy the centre of the Red contagion — the USSR.</span><br><br> Western leaders consistently rejected calls for collective security —
              it was intended to restrain aggressors, and could only be aimed at
              Hitler’s Germany.<br><br> Instead, Germany was helped to rearm, to re-occupy the Rhineland, to
              force through an Anschluss with Austria (basically Germany was allowed
              to seize the country).<br><br> When Germany moved to occupy Czechoslovakia, which had a strong army
              and an advanced armament industry, the imperialists found themselves in
              a quandary.<br><br> The British and French public demanded that their governments support
              the independence of Czechoslovakia while the strategic aims of the
              British and French rulers called for Czechoslovakia to be given to
              Hitler.<br><br> A conference of the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy held
              in Munich betrayed Czechoslovakia and handed that country to Nazi
              Germany. The Soviet Union was not invited to attend.<br><br> The Soviet Union offered to stand by Czechoslovakia without France if
              necessary. But while Czech Communist MPs demanded that President Beneš
              request Soviet assistance, he refused, apparently more fearful of
              communism than of Hitler...</p>

              <p>...While all this was going on, the remorseless wheels of appeasement were
              grinding out of existence one country after another. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fatal loss

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This disaster was engineered by Chamberlain</span> with
              the full co-operation of the Milner Group. </p>
              <p>The details do not concern
              us here, but it should be mentioned that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the dispute arose over the
              position of the Sudeten Germans <em>within</em> the Czechoslovak state</span>, and as late as 15 September 1938 was still
              being expressed in those terms.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Up to that day, Hitler had made <strong>no
              demand to annex the Sudeten area</strong>,</span> although on 12 September he had for
              the first time asked for “self-determination” for the Sudetens. </p>
              <p>Konrad
              Henlein, Hitler’s agent in Czechoslovakia and leader of the Sudeten
              Germans, expressed no desire “to go back to the Reich” until after 12
              September.</p>

              <p>...Within two weeks of Hitler's annexation of Austria, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Britain was
              moving.</strong></span> It was decided to<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">put pressure on the Czechs to make
              concessions to the Germans</span></strong>; to encourage France and eventually Germany
              to do the same; to insist that Germany must not use force to reach a
              decision, but to have patience enough to allow negotiations to achieve
              the same result; and to exclude Russia, although it was allied to
              Czechoslovakia, from the negotiations completely...</p>
              <p>...The group which spread this version of the situation included
              Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, John Simon, Samuel Hoare, Horace Wilson, the
              Cliveden Set, the British ambassador in Berlin (Sir Nevile Henderson),
              and the British minister in Prague (Basil Newton)...</p>
              <p>...As early as March 17, 1938, five days after the <em>Anschluss,</em> t<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he Soviet government called for consultations looking toward
              collective actions to stop aggression </strong></span>and to eliminate the increased
              danger of a new world slaughter. This was summarily <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rejected by Lord
              Halifax.</strong></span> Instead, on March 24th, Chamberlain announced in the House of
              Commons Britain's refusal to pledge aid to the Czechs if they were
              attacked or to France if it came to their rescue. When the Soviet
              request was repeated in September 1938, it was ignored...</p>
              <p>...In the meantime <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the British had been working out a
              plan of their own. </strong></span>It involved, as we have said, (1) separation of the
              Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia, probably through the use of a
              plebiscite or even by outright partition; (2) neutralization of the
              rest of Czechoslovakia by revising her treaties with Russia and France,
              and ( 3 ) guarantee of this rump of Czechoslovakia (but not by
              Britain). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This plan was outlined to the Czech ambassador in London by
              Lord Halifax on May 25th</strong></span>, and was worked out in some detail by one of
              Lord Halifax's subordinates, William (now Lord) Strang, during a visit
              to Prague and to Berlin in the following week.</p>
              <p>This was the plan which
              was picked up by Lord Runciman and presented as his recommendation in
              his report of September 21, 1938.</p>
              <p>It is worthy of note that on September and Lord Runciman sent a
              personal message by Henlein to Hitler in which he said that he would
              have a settlement drawn up by September 15th.</p>
              <p>What is, perhaps,
              surprising is that Lord Runciman made no use whatever of the Karlsbad
              Demands or the extensive concessions to meet them which the Czechs had
              made during these negotiations, but instead recommended to the British
              Cabinet on September 16th, and in his written report five days later,
              the same melange of partition, plebiscites, neutralization, and
              guarantee which had been in the mind of the British Foreign Office for
              weeks.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It was this plan which was imposed on the Czechs by the
              Four-Power Conference at Munich on September 30th...</strong></span></p>
