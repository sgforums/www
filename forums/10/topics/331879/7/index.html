              <p>Let me feed you again on your petrol tax from Budget 2003:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Currently, excise duties on petrol are levied 
                                        either at an ad valorem rate on final pump price before 
                                        GST, or at a prescribed floor rate, whichever is higher. 
                                        If petrol prices rise, the duties go up correspondingly. 
                                        This adds to the burden on businesses and motorists. 
                                        <strong>To address this, I have decided to impose excise duties 
                                        on petrol at a <span style="color: #ff0000;">specific rate</span> instead, so that the duties 
                                        no longer fluctuate with oil prices. This takes effect 
                                        from today. </strong></p>

              <p>And yes, if like what you have requested for SG Girls to be
              fucked by SG Guys who participated in defending the country, Do not
              forget that your girlfriend, sister and your mother are all
              included in the tiny bonus package called SG Girls. You sure you

              Girls cos you got rejected and denied one too many times in your
              real life? And this clearly shown a good example of a SG Guy who
              post without thinking.</p>
              <p>Defence is good? Are you kidding me? Look at the amount of
              RETARDED REBELS in here! Are you blind or you need to be
              re-educated again? Read more posts in SgForums first before you
              start stammering on your next Patriotism crusade again.</p>
              <p>And yes, I thank your Sergeants for removing himself from the
              society, cos TRASH like him who demands gratitude from CIVILIANS
              should not be made to SERVE the country. WHO DO YOU THINK PAYS YOUR
              SERGEANTS THEIR SALARIES+ BONUSES? Go ask them if you don't
              want to admit the answer ok?</p>
              <p>Soldiers who demands for gratitude are just not professional
              enough to be a soldier in the first place. They do not have the
              conviction required to serve their duty and have zero loyalty to
              the country they are serving. So now you know why the confidence
              levels are super low?</p>
              <p>Your Sergeants asked to have sex with your mother you also obey
              is it? No wonder SG Guys all sucks....dumb ones following the
              retarded ones.</p>

              <p>People like you, i see until sian liao lah. If i tell you i'm happily attached to a SG ger, you will say she's one of the stupid ones...if i say i single, you will say you not surprised...if i reply to one of your posts, you will say i'm typical SG guy, don't know when to quit....if i don't reply, you will say i finally got nothing to say.....so on and so forth...</p>
              <p>You seem to know SG guys very well, well enough to make sweeping statements... have you actually slept with all of them? I know i haven't. Or have i...? =)</p>

              <p>You are so like Qing Shi Huang and Gang of Four. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I suppose in your life, you have never learnt anything from textbooks and newspaper. So where did you attain your knowledge from? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't even know what is levy and tax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Petrol Levy and Petrol Tax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Stupidity is not priceless, it's worthless just like you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
