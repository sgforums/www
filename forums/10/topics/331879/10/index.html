              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> Thanks for a very detailed reply made in a moderate tone, compared
              to your earlier knee jerk reaction towards SDP - and CSJ in
              particular. </p>
              <p>Responding to the summarised points of your reply - firstly,
              concerning your view in comparing Bush's moving of resources from
              Afghanistan to Iraq  and undermining the hunt for Osama, it is
              quite far fetch in linking this analogy to the SAF not
              having enough troops to defend Singapore - in the manner that you
              have described.</p>
              <p>The point mentioned in reducing the length of NS training
              is not about reducing troop strength for the SAF, which is already
              facing a shortage due to the shrinking pool of MANpower in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>You have mentioned the shortage of human
              resource is due to the declining birth rates, and
              this has also placed a challenge to the Economy, that will
              eventually have an impact on the politics of Singapore.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Singapore Political Leadership is facing
              resentment from Singaporeans to the open door policies to
              Foreign Talents, even as there is a need to increase the
              population size to allow for population growth and
              to provide the replacement in human resources for both the
              economy and the SAF.</p>
              <p>Given a shortage of manpower, and continuing the length of
              National Service inflexibly will ultimately affect the other
              dimensions of the FIVE Prong Defense Policy promoted by MINDEF - of
              which a strong economy is one.</p>
              <p>You must remember that when NS was first introduced in
              1967, it had two objectives - firstly to
              quickly create a large pool of Singaporeans able to defend
              Singapore against military aggression; and secondly - to absorb the
              annual release of a large pool of tens of thousands
              of young Singaporeans from secondary schools, colleges
              and university. This was at a time when the government was
              sweating to find a solution to create jobs as the British Military
              Pull-out from Singapore was throwing thousands of adults out
              of job.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, National Service was 3 Full Years - and
              the time was a buffer for the government to solve the problems of
              the economy and jobs.</p>
              <p>At this stage, Singapore is not facing the same crisis, but a
              totally different one now that require a revision of the NSF period
              which has seen a reduction to two-and-a-half year, and now to about
              twenty-five months.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans have the misplaced notion that two-and-a-half
              years of Full Time National Service will make one a
              <em>Professional Soldier</em>. This is a false gung-ho
              self-deluding, morale boosting image fed to the young minds of the
              18 and 19 year olds.</p>
              <p>The two-and-a-half years of Full Time National Service - even
              when cut down by a full year - is to be backed up by the very
              intensive Reserve Training that are now taking place
              overseas, and with higher training objectives to be achieved as
              each year progresses for the unit.</p>
              <p>As the years pass in the Reserve, the young 18 year
              old NSF will mature in mind, physique and intellegence - {i.e.
              cunning, survival instinct, daring, and ruthlessness}.</p>
              <p>The individual skills training is reinforced
              with higher echelon and combined arms training,
              and is reflected in the Singapore Military Budget
              that has exploded over the years as these overseas training
              are conducted at a very high tempo.</p>
              <p>With a limited pool of human resource, what is the troop
              strength needed to defend Singapore ?</p>
              <p>My previous example given with the Israeli experience - in
              facing the Palestinian Intifadah, and the Israeli horror
              experience with their last invasion of Lebanon - had shown
              that no matter how much resources - {manpower or equipment}
              - the Israelis can throw into the fight, it still need a
              superior strategy to make use of their limited resources within a
              time frame to defang the oppoinent.</p>
              <p>It is simply useless for Israel to conduct a war of attrition -
              and the same will apply for Singapore irregardless of the size of
              the SAF, which stand at 300,000+ mobilised. [See below: Tim
              Huxley]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This bring us to your second point concerning the plugging of
              the gaps with increase in resources by the US in Iraq.</p>
              <p>It was not that a small pool of insurgents had tied down a large
              force of US military in Iraq. The opposite is true, when the
              dismantled Iraq Military of 300,000+ men had turned insurgents, it
              simply overwhelmed the two US Divisions that Rumsfeld
              sent to invade Iraq, and caused more casualties to the US Military
              during the Occupation then during the invasion.</p>
              <p>The fact that the two US Divisiion suffered the limited
              - although mounting - number of casualties during the
              occupation, should be considered remarkable, and largely due
              to their superior training, equipment and strategy of combined
              arms support.</p>
              <p>The surge in 2007 was not merely to plug the gaps at their
              rear, as the two Divisions that Secretary of Defense Donald
              Rumsfeld had insisted on limiting - was simply causing the military
              to be stretched to the point that US troops were being
              kidnapped.</p>
              <p>In any case, the surge was not enough to plug the gaps in the
              manner that you had envisioned - as the surge was not the
              addition of another few more divisions to swamp the whole
              of Iraq with US troops; but only adding two or three
              Brigades in rotation in order not to exceed Rumsfeld
              limits to the troops deployed.</p>
              <p>This allowed a reinforced 2 Div+ of combat troops to
              conduct a wider and simultaneous operations across several hot
              areas, when previously the insurgents were able to filter from
              the combat zone into another region. None of the US Troops in
              the surge were used to protect the rear supply lines, or
              replace the fallen in the manner you suggested previously.</p>
              <p>The US was simply under manned to occupy Iraq. in the
              failed Rumsfeld policy for Iraq. </p>
              <p>Here again, the US also had their limits in suffering casualties
              in a "War of Attrition" with the local insurgents, and had
              recognised in time that the short-sightedness of
              their political and military strategy in dismantiling the
              Iraqi military - instead of retaining their service in the manner
              that the returning UK forces had used Japanese Troops in
              maintaining law and order in the liberated British
              Colonies during WW2.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, with regards to the "Principle of Redundancy" - my
              description of the pre-Desert Storm PLA 'human wave'
              strategy was to show you that the Chinese appreciated that their
              'Human Wave' strategy is no longer feasibile nor valid when they
              reviewed US Military Strategies in Desert Storm and the Afghan war
              against the Talibans. [see references below]</p>
              <p>The Chinese PLA "Human Wave" approach was simply to
              swamp their enemy's position by literally a "tidal wave" of men
              that flowed wave after wave, based on the redundancy principle
              that you have in mind - and not in your present form of
              'cross-training' of personnel.</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten that it was during the Korean War,
              when the UN forces under US Military Leadership were swept
              into full retreat - from the Yalu River to the southern most
              corner of the Korean Peninsular - by the Chinese PLA
              Human Wave assaults ? [see references below].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fourth and Fifth, in the SDP list of EU countries
              - they had all come to realise that they are facing
              declining birth rates - as is happening for Singapore - and their
              combined military strength in NATO allow each participating
              countries to maintain a force level that is sufficient for their
              NATO effort to face their perceived global threats.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, Russia today is not perceived as a threat to
              EU since the dismantling of the Communist System of
              Government.</p>
              <p>Russians who are down and out of luck in facing the competition
              of an open market economy, may have the inkling to
              return to the good old days of Socialism, but those Russians who
              have tasted and grown accustomed to the open market economy
              will hardly want to return to the Communist ways.</p>
              <p>The European Think Tanks are keeping watch on the pulse of their
              neighbors and the global affairs, and will be in a far better
              position then ourselves to comment on their region, or the
              sutiability of their decision concerning their defense. </p>
              <p>Suffice to say that their combined economic strength is
              much bigger then Singapore, and yet - if they
              will collectively feel that they cannot afford to have a
              bigger military force without destroying themselves
              economically - should we not be asking if we are about
              to destroy ourselves in the manner that we are spending on our
              military budget, and at the same time our reserves are being
              knocked around in failed overseas financial adventures by GIC and
              Temasek - while Singaporeans are continuously milked dry to
              seemingly replenish the Treasury ?</p>
              <p>Considering that Singapore's manpower is dwindling due to low
              birth rates, and that the demands of the economy for
              manpower has also to be considered, it is not wrong for the
              SDP to put up a paper for discussion - with the list of EU
              countries as references to be looked at.</p>
              <p>With regards to comparing the political system of Singapore and
              the US - or to that of UK - it is not merely about the
              executive role or power of the Singapore President compared to
              the US President, or the forms of government.</p>
              <p>My comparison is about the openess of the Political Life in the
              USA - or even UK - where the Citizens' Rights are
              respected, and given the space for each Citizen's to voice
              their concern through their Political Representative in Congress -
              who in turn are not dictated by Party Politics to vote along Party
              lines and instructions.</p>
              <p>Our Members of Parliament - the majority of whom are from
              walk-over constituencies - are locked into PAP policies
              rulings even as their conscience tell them that their own
              constituents are against those policies.</p>
              <p>It is the quality of Life that provides the motivational factor
              for the Citizens to bear arms and defend what they value, it is not
              merely material or financial rewards or compensation that motivate
              Citizens to defend themselves and their loved ones.</p>
              <p>Seriously, the Sub-Prime problem has nothing to do with any
              cover up from the open US Political System. The
              Sub-Prime problem has as much to do with failed Executive
              Policies, as it has to do with "Pork Barrel" politics. The
              sub-prime issues will soon generate alot of 20-20 hindsight
              reports, which will soon reveal the failures of the Bush
              Administration in coming out with early guidelines to have
              prevented this disaster, when some Congressmen had warned of this
              event at least 1 to 2 years earlier.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we have sacrificed the best part of our youthful
              life to delay our tertiary education, and serve Singapore - and we
              deserve better treatment then what this government has dished out
              to us.</p>
              <p>Compensation for NSF ?</p>
              <p>The amount payable - for those Singaporean men and women
              who were injured or dead - is less then satisfactory, considering
              that some are not even NSF but contracted service.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances - where there is no political
              motivation or cause for NSF to be committed - the motivation
              of NS soldiers requires imagination, courage and
              leadership - as much as it requires empathy, fairness and
              intuition.</p>
              <p>In the paper submitted, CSJ and SDP have made valid points for
              consideration, and it is worrisome that a person of your stature
              will take a jaundiced stance in so sweepingly dismiss CSJ and the
              SDP to be rabid, and went out of points in several instances to
              link their studies with the situation that the US Military
              encountered in Iraq.</p>
              <p>With the passing of JBJ, Singapore need as many dedicated and
              committed voices willing to be in the Alternative Parties, and
              it is simply disheartening that no one attempt to reach out to CSJ
              to inform him of his wrong directions but will cruxify him based on
              some distorted emotional hang-ups based on a scarred memory.</p>
              <p>People change - so do you and I.</p>
              <p>I believe CSJ has changed since his first baptism under
              fire - when first entering politics on the side of the
              Alternative Parties, and having to make the ultimate sacrifice
              repeatedly. His skillful confrontation with MM LKY and PM LHL in
              their recent confrontation in the High Court showed his
              maturity compared to his first confrontation with then PM GCT
              - which was capitalised by the PAP to deface CSJ as a
              political gangster.</p>

              Singapore, it is the one person who has publicly boasted that

              <p>*** By the way, the SAF was not being inefficient in not
              recalling some people for Reservist Training, the budget maybe
              large, but the places are limited as only so many thousands can be
              sent overseas in a year; then the important units will need to be
              kept sharp annually.</p>

              <p>At this point, I can only say we can only agree to disagree.  </p>
              <p>Both of us has seen the same piece of information from a different perspective.</p>
              <p>What I saw to manpower limitations towards operations in Iraq, you saw it as poor strategy from Rumsfeld instead.  Its fair that Rumsfeld was to blame for not providing more than 2 divisions, however, the way I see it is that, it was only natural for circumstance that followed because 2 Divisions just weren't simply enough.  Rumsfeld did not provide sufficient manpower to manage contingencies.</p>
              <p>I am viewing "fault" from a technical operational perspective that there wasn't sufficient manpower, while you view it from a blame-perspective that it was Rumsfeld that was to blame for sending insufficient troops. </p>
              <p>Israel's experience was definitely a surprise for the world. However, there is little that I really know about the actual circumstances.  I have not seen books that were published about it, nor any formal discussion by the IDF. What I saw in it was that, guided anti-armor missiles were deadly in the hands of people who knew how to use them.  </p>
              <p>Technology in this case played both teams, emphasizing that SDP's point that technology alone as a force multiplyer supports reducing NSF liabilities to be flawed.  Hence I cannot agree with them.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>None of the US Troops in the surge were used to protect the rear supply lines, or replace the fallen in the manner you suggested previously.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think I was misunderstood at this point. The surge involved additional troops to conduct more comprehensive operations as a part of a major offensive to stem insurgency.  I do not thing I mentioned them to be attrition-replacements.</p>
              <p>Attrition replacements are more commonly seen in lengthy conflicts where weary frontline units require rotation or reinforcements.   As I mentioned in my first post, conflicts that involved Singapore, were both major wars.  In the first WW, the Emden sailed around Singapore instead of takine a direct route through possibly due to Singapore's rather formidable coastal defense in that period. The 2nd WW was a different story as we all know.</p>
              <p>Hence, Singapore has to be prepared to get sucked into a major global conflict, whether we like it or not.  And we will need manpower when we get involved for indefinite periods of time. </p>
              <p>As for the principle of redundancy, I can only again say that, its objective is to keep the army fight-capable by ensuring losses taken can be replaced, and losses taken will not cripple its operational capability.  There is really little more that I can say or argue.  It is a universally accepted principle.  The only question is "how much redundancy?"</p>
              <p>The US Subprime situation, and the recent collapse of several major financial institutions, saw both Bush and McCain give the same message that was pretty questionable, "The fundementals of our economy is strong..."  Somebody didn't tell people that the subprime mortgages were gonna blow up in their faces.  If the government didn't know, somebody else did.</p>
              <p>I guess what I am saying in conclusion is that, we should not commit Singapore to a course of action that might reduce the manpower available to the SAF.  Manpower is perhaps the hardest component to replace in conflict, and being able to have a good number in reserve is a necessity.</p>

              <p>i sort of agree with angel here, that it is quite pointless for SAF to defend singapore.</p>
              <p>On morale: how do you expect soldiers on a $400/mnth pay to risk their lives for the ministers earning $4million dollar pay( $333, 333/ month, 833 times of a nsf's pay)risking their life for people who will sit in comfort in some underground bunker while the war rage on around them.</p>
              <p>Warfare: though the SAF emphasize on forward defence strategy, which involves attacking Malaysia (it's the only country saf is capable to launch troops into anyway), making jungle warfare relevant.</p>
              <p>but shouldn't be urban warfare the focus of our NS training? street fighting in HDBs, multi-storey carparks, office towers. that's what war would be like if we r fighting in singapore, or at least in JB. all the so called strategic locations are already by now fully exploited for civilian usage, incorporated into the urban landscape. Cities and towns are built on these locations, and these places are unlikely to be the jungles which we expected.</p>
              <p>look at singapore, would any enemy go hid themselves in jungles and woods which are of no strategic importance here in singapore, when there's plenty of concrete jungles around them? it is much safer to hid behind the concrete walls of 12  stories HDB buildings, which offers real protection from bullets, than behind 1 story-tall trees in hot, mosquito-infested jungle.</p>
              <p>if there's any strategic locations to seize in singapore, it would be the prime urban and financial centers of the country, not the relatively worthless plots of ulu forests.</p>
              <p>and u think during wartime, who is so dumb as to stay in singapore. most singaporeans, rich or poor, are at the very least able to afford a plane ticket to Australia, Thailand. (on the assumption that these people value their lives over money). none of the womenfolks will stay behind, nor would their men allow them to stay behind to risk death. Tell me, wouldn't you send off your wives, daughters, and mothers off to a safer country before you set off for army, during a war? (under the Geneva convention, it is illegal to attack civilian aircrafts, so it is safe for them to exit the country)</p>

But seriously, i don't think NS induces patriotism, why would anyone love a place where they are getting bullied everyday for 2 yrs? As for the deserter issue, modern Singapore has not been in a real war yet, so how to compare? As for the people who do not support SDP policy, how many are actually serving NS?

              <p>I think this really hits the nail on the head.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, NSmen wouldn't mind being NSmen so much if their hard work and effort is rewarded with appreciation. You know, you can always tell in schools that the second best teachers are the ones that yell the most but the best ones are those who don't have to yell. Ever wondered why that teacher doesn't have to yell once in the whole year but his/her class is the top class? It's only really because they make the students feel appreciated and the students, in return, feel obligated to do their work well.</p>
              <p>This is the bottom line: if the NS experience was something that was actually meaningful then maybe it wouldn't be such a turn-off. Yes, protecting the motherland is a justified cause, but doing menial work that doesn't involve protecting the country and being yelled at for nothing is completely pointless. The way to settle this issue is not to cut down on the NS time because sooner or later we'll realise that it's still a year of crap. The way to settle the issue is to refocus the goals of NS and make it more pleasant. For you critics who swear on tears and blood being the best teachers, I'd say that motivation out of a willingness to do something rather than to avoid something else is still the most powerful tool.</p>
              <p>In the end the man who loves his country will fight for it but the man who fears his country will flee. No one loves a country that bullies him for two years, and then some. Low pay could potentially be a problem: I'd suggest all NSmen be paid as much as professional soldiers in other countries, albeit perhaps appropriately upscaled or downscaled based on our financial capability. Essentially, NS pay needs to be scaled appropriately against the rest of our market. It should be a real job. It should provide the benefits that a real, corporate company might offer to woo potential workers. Even if it means we're forced into it, they should make us feel like we're not utter slaves but people working real jobs.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>At this point, I can only say we can only agree to disagree.  </p>
              <p>Both of us has seen the same piece of information from a different perspective.</p>
              <p>What I saw to manpower limitations towards operations in Iraq, you saw it as poor strategy from Rumsfeld instead.  Its fair that Rumsfeld was to blame for not providing more than 2 divisions, however, the way I see it is that, it was only natural for circumstance that followed because 2 Divisions just weren't simply enough.  Rumsfeld did not provide sufficient manpower to manage contingencies.</p>
              <p>I am viewing "fault" from a technical operational perspective that there wasn't sufficient manpower, while you view it from a blame-perspective that it was Rumsfeld that was to blame for sending insufficient troops. </p>
              <p>Israel's experience was definitely a surprise for the world. However, there is little that I really know about the actual circumstances.  I have not seen books that were published about it, nor any formal discussion by the IDF. What I saw in it was that, guided anti-armor missiles were deadly in the hands of people who knew how to use them.  </p>
              <p>Technology in this case played both teams, emphasizing that SDP's point that technology alone as a force multiplyer supports reducing NSF liabilities to be flawed.  Hence I cannot agree with them.</p>
              <p>I think I was misunderstood at this point. The surge involved additional troops to conduct more comprehensive operations as a part of a major offensive to stem insurgency.  I do not thing I mentioned them to be attrition-replacements.</p>
              <p>Attrition replacements are more commonly seen in lengthy conflicts where weary frontline units require rotation or reinforcements.   As I mentioned in my first post, conflicts that involved Singapore, were both major wars.  In the first WW, the Emden sailed around Singapore instead of takine a direct route through possibly due to Singapore's rather formidable coastal defense in that period. The 2nd WW was a different story as we all know.</p>
              <p>Hence, Singapore has to be prepared to get sucked into a major global conflict, whether we like it or not.  And we will need manpower when we get involved for indefinite periods of time. </p>
              <p>As for the principle of redundancy, I can only again say that, its objective is to keep the army fight-capable by ensuring losses taken can be replaced, and losses taken will not cripple its operational capability.  There is really little more that I can say or argue.  It is a universally accepted principle.  The only question is "how much redundancy?"</p>
              <p>The US Subprime situation, and the recent collapse of several major financial institutions, saw both Bush and McCain give the same message that was pretty questionable, "The fundementals of our economy is strong..."  Somebody didn't tell people that the subprime mortgages were gonna blow up in their faces.  If the government didn't know, somebody else did.</p>
              <p>I guess what I am saying in conclusion is that, we should not commit Singapore to a course of action that might reduce the manpower available to the SAF.  Manpower is perhaps the hardest component to replace in conflict, and being able to have a good number in reserve is a necessity.   </p>

              <p>Your reply is gratefully acknowledged, and there is little that we differ that require us to "agree to disagree" as I see that we have convergence of views on most issues - except perhaps we may have interpreted the printed words differently given our different experiences and knowledge to the events mentioned.</p>
              <p>For instance, you and I agree to the "manpower limitation" as a fact based on the limits imposed by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on the Two U.S. Division allowed to invade and occupy Iraq. Whether Rumsfeld is to be blamed or not, this "manpower limitation" exist according to both of our views.</p>
              <p>Where we differed is the interpretation to the events in Iraq - which you saw as a "smaller group of insurgents tying down a larger and more superior US forces", when I saw the situation as the insurgents <em>outnumbering</em> the US Occupying Force of Two Divisions. The supposedly "<em>small group of insurgents</em>" consisted of the Arab Jihadist infiltrating into Iraq and from the dismantled Iraqi Military Force of over 300,000 men.</p>
              <p>This combined force - of 300,000+ insurgents and Jihadist - harassed the Two Division of U.S. troops that numbered no more then 50,000 men with support personnels, and were given the impossible task to pacify a war torn Iraq.</p>
              <p>The "fault" lies with the wrong strategies of the U.S. High Command given the artificially imposed "manpower limitation" - which the Commanders on the ground must be complemented for their creativity in constantly adapting their tactics and strategies given their handicap. This resulted in the remarkably low casualties encountered compared to their experience suffered in Vietnam during the 1960s.</p>
              <p>In the example of Israel's experience, I agree with your stand that it is a nightmare when non-conventional warfare can create frontline situation almost anywhere, and very suddenly at any time.</p>
              <p>During the 2006 Lebanon War, the only sophisticated weapon that the Hezbollah guerillas used was the guided missile that severely damaged an Israeli warship and sank a freighter. The Hezbollah guerillas generally relied on roadside IEDs, and crude unguided rockets to bombard Israeli townships in their determined stand-off against the Israelis. </p>
              <p>There was little that Israeli standard doctrine and trainiing could do against these determined non-conventional fighters.</p>
              <p>The follow-up analysis of Israeli invasion of Lebanon concluded that poor intelligence, lack of preparation, and the late use of definitive force had resulted in the invasion not accomplishing the objective of neutralsing the Hezbollah. [See references below]</p>
              <p>In this instance, the size of the Manpower available is not the answer - even as the Israelis are not lacking in the sophistication of their technology available.</p>
              <p>This brings us to the discussion on "the Principle of Redundancy" - which I am also in agreement with you on the need of any Military Force to maintain its fighting capability so as to be able to accomplish its goals.</p>
              <p>As was stated in both of my previous posts, there are limitations to any military on this matter, as the number of lives lost in any conflict is always a sensitive issue - even for nations with large populations at the personal and political levels; and even more so for small nations like Switzerland, Israel and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Should we ask ourselves the question - "How much is the redundancy ?" - or should we not be asking - "How long can a conflict be sustained by our Military ?" </p>
              <p>In any conflict, manpower alone is not the determining factor in sustaining the Military efforts, as the manpower is also needed to keep the economy running in order to sustain the "military stamina".</p>
              <p>Based on the FPDA arrangement, I do not foresee Singapore being sucked into any regional or global conflicts where the SAF will commit our <em>main body</em> of NSF to any UN sanctioned front-line missions.</p>
              <p>At best, we may send a token force of some Medical Teams, or a few Naval or Air assets - without depleting our own Defense needs, and with volunteers from the NSF and Regular Service Personnels.</p>
              <p>This token force will be done with the objective to give limited exposure to the "real world" scenario within a "safe zone" - as in our deployment of "combat personnel" to support the UN mission in Timor Leste.</p>
              <p>While I am in agreement with your concluding concern - that "we should not commit Singapore to a course of action that might reduce the manpower available to the SAF" - this will need to be considered in the present predicament that Singapore is faced with the present manpower limitations and the demands placed on it.</p>
              <p>There will need to be a balance between the demands placed by the economy for manpower, as much as there is a need to have a sufficient trained force of manpower for our defense.</p>
              <p>This approach has also been recognised in a Rand Publication on the US Military - and in particular for the US Navy's recruitment problems that necessitated them to modify their approach. [See reference below, in particular Page 35 of 54]</p>
              <p>As was stated in my last post, whether it is 3-Years, 2-and-a-Half Years, or 25 months of Full Time National Service, it does not make anyone of us a <em>Professional Soldier </em>- that make an NSF comparable to the personnels from the Best Units of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulars</span></em> in the "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Professional Armies</span></em>" of other nations such as the USA, UK, Germany, France, India, Korea, Thailand and others.</p>
              <p>While our NSF Battalions, Brigades and Divisions are not lacking in sophistication in training, equipment, and organisational skills, tactics and strategies - the "Proficiency Levels" of our NSF Personnel can only be sharpened and developed further during the course of annual Reservist Training.</p>
              <p>It is my belief that high levels of proficiency - in maintaning the high military standards in the various trained skills, motivation, pride, commitment to learn and ability to adapt experiences to new situations - will finally determine if the person or the unit has attained "<em>Professional Status</em>".</p>
              <p>This can be achieved when the NSF Personnels are motivated with the right dose of inspiration from the NSF leadership developing a trained and keenly mature sense of human management intuition, empathy, fairness and clear decisiveness in execution and planning.</p>
              <p>Such a trained manpower base in Singapore is also needed for the Economy.</p>
              <p>There is little disagreement between our positons that every man able to bear arms will be required to have military training for the defense of Singapore, and that we cannot depend entirely on a Military based on Regular Career Soldiers given our limited population size.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately - as recognised by you and I - there is the present situation of declining birth rates that is made worst by an increasing ageing population. This will place a further pressure in the conflicting demands imposed on the limited Manpower for the needs of the SAF and the Economy.</p>
              <p>Surely, the Government is aware and is in an unstated predicament, and has already begun the process of reducing the length of the NS Full Time service to 25 months. </p>
              <p>The NS Full Time period maybe further shortened if their other plan to boost the population with new immigrants create political resentment from those who have made the NS sacrifices end up facing higher competition after their NS period.</p>
              <p>The present situation faced by Singapore is also felt globally, as shown in the list of countries cited as examples by SDP / CSJ, and their Report has appropriately brought up this subject to the attention of Singaporeans even as the Government aka the PAP has been reluctant to address this matter publicly.</p>

              <p>you will know if your country is going to get involve in a war. the chain of events leading to a war are always the same in most countries. e.g. sanctions, embargoes, UN meetings, more enemy recon activities.</p>
              <p>by then, there will be sufficient indicators for you to flee the country before being mobilise.</p>
              <p>and my point about the low pay is that you have 2/3 of the entire standing army receiving lousy compensation in a high risk occupation. that sure help morale alot.</p>
              <p>also, it doesn't help that the ministers are the one who will be dictating any policy (i.e. surrender, armistice), when they will surely not be fighting on the frontline risking their butts. they are the ones who earn millions and yet not have to risk their lives, unlike us common folks who are bottom on the evolutionary level, with our lives cheap as "peanut powder(cannot even qualify as peanuts )"</p>
              <p>and do you think your rich folks, the millionaires and millionaires are really going to fight? you think they will be willing to send their sons and son-in-laws off to fight?</p>
              <p>so, if singapore is involved in any major armed conflict, it would be a war fought by the commoners, and run by the elites.</p>
              <p>and regarding Hellraiza's point about Murai Urban Training
                                      Facility as the solution to urban warfare, i think it is not good enough.</p>
              <p>if i remember correctly, most of the buildings in the facility are low level shophouses, etc. the highest building is still very short as compared to the rest of the HDB lanscape of singapore. most of the strategic locations in singapore are no longer covered by these shop houses, but covered by 12 storey HDB flats, shopping complex and office towers. so, to be realistic, there should be more model HDB flats to be incorporated into the facility. fighting in high level HDB flats is way different from the low level shophouses.</p>

              <p><br>do you see more 12 storey HDBs or do u see more 2 storey shophouses around.</p>
              <p>if you are going to encamp in a concealed location, where would you choose, a HDB estates with rows and rows of corridors everywhere in all direction, or would you confine urself to low level buildings? obviously, if you value ur life, u would choose a site which offers the most cover and choices.</p>
              <p>if you are an enemy artillery man, mortar, or tank, these tall HDBs are also going to the obstacle to block your view, affecting ur precision. you are also probably not likely to walk straight up to a possible enemy encampment, with each flat similar to a fort, with enemy troops behind walls, firing from an advantageous height.</p>
              <p>also, ask urself, if u r an enemy soldier, would you dare to march down a road lined with HDBs, with every HDB having the probability of harboring enemy troops who may be already setting their sights on you as you march on.</p>
              <p>nor is it possible to just send in bombers to bomb every flat in singapore. same logic apply to bombers. each of the HDB flats may be armed with handheld anti-aircraft missile, which is more than enough to take an unsuspecting plane out of the sky.</p>
              <p>with so many flats in singapore, it would make it a hell of a job for any invader to flush out well defended troops encamping in HDBs.</p>
              <p> modern day urban combat is much more challenging than the past, with buildings getting taller, bigger and stronger.</p>

              <p>you will know if your country is going to get involve in a war.
              the chain of events leading to a war are always the same in most
              countries. e.g. sanctions, embargoes, UN meetings, more enemy recon
              activities.</p>
              <p>by then, there will be sufficient indicators for you to flee the
              country before being mobilise.</p>
              <p>and my point about the low pay is that you have 2/3 of the
              entire standing army receiving lousy compensation in a high risk
              occupation. that sure help morale alot.</p>
              <p>also, it doesn't help that the ministers are the one who will be
              dictating any policy (i.e. surrender, armistice), when they will
              surely not be fighting on the frontline risking their butts. they
              are the ones who earn millions and yet not have to risk their
              lives, unlike us common folks who are bottom on the evolutionary
              level, with our lives cheap as "peanut powder(cannot even qualify
              as peanuts )"</p>
              <p>and do you think your rich folks, the millionaires and
              millionaires are really going to fight? you think they will be
              willing to send their sons and son-in-laws off to fight?</p>
              <p>so, if singapore is involved in any major armed conflict, it
              would be a war fought by the commoners, and run by the elites.</p>

              <p>i get what u mean in ur first point. but it doesn't hurt to actually learn about how to do urban warfare in the singapore landscape. singapore is not inpregnable. in the long run, in a war of attrition, we would eventually be push back into singapore, due to resource/manpower shortages etc. we should be brushing up on urban defence back at home instead of urban warfare abroad.</p>
              <p>and how do you intend to use ur mortar/ tank/ wadever? almost every inch of singapore is covered with these HDB flat, where soldiers lurks. and, how many flats can u level? there are so many out there. even piles of rubble may prove hazardous to you, where they will still serve as effective hiding places.</p>
              <p>actually, it is kind of logical. in many of the modern urban wars, it is quite hard to take down a city full of hostile forces, not least one as urbanized as singapore. </p>
