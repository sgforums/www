              <p>Your response tells me your brain has long gone passed it's expiration date.</p>
              <p>Go get a PhD also ok? Alot of people realised their brain has expired and faster gan chiong go and take PhD/Post-Graduate courses, so that they could at least change the wrapping paper around their brain and re-market themselves to their next unsuspecting employers as "Talents".</p>
              <p>Unfortunately not all employers in the world are dumb. Sadly most in Singapore are, cos they're Singaporeans who also agrees with the changing of brain-wrappers = talent.</p>
              <p>If one item cannot sell well, change the advertisment/wrapping paper/outlook of the item. But too bad, the item is still the same........Expired is still = Expired no matter how many times you change the wrapping paper.</p>
              <p>Pure intellect does not require wrapping papers, Fake ones always need to change their wrapping paper every now and then PhD is one wrapper for brain dead people to look and re-market themselves again as "Talents". So what difference is there between Singapore Talent and Foreign Talent if they both also got PhD? No difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>ur reserves are also included as part of SAF overall manpower wad. reducing the number of yr of full time NS doesn't mean that there will be a reduction in number of reserve forces.</p>
              <p>do we really need such a big standing army? it is not as if all 60000 will be mobilise and sent off to the frontline within hours of any invasion.  i estimated that at best, there will be only thousands of men sent off as an immediate response to invasion. there are alot of logistical preparations which need to be done before you can send off that many troops. during that waiting time, there is ample time to summon up reservist forces.</p>
              <p>so, there's no actual need to have such a large standing army. we are not like Malaysia, which has a large terrain to defend and garrison. this is not the case in singapore, where we can traverse the entire island within 40 minutes. </p>
              <p>furthermore, the bulk of the forces of our standing army lies in the army, the most "redundant" of the 3 arms of the SAF. the navy and the air force have an active presence 24/7, and if there's invasion, they would be literally the first line of defence. they are able to/ suppose to buy us time to mobilise our land forces.</p>
              <p>so, why do you need to maintain such a large standing army? army as in land units.</p>
              <p>if you reduce NS to 1 yr, and 1yr ++ for officers, , you will still have around 40000 troops available. and 40,000 is still quite large. in the iraq war, the US led coalition forces took 100,000 men to invade iraq, which is hundreds of time larger than singapore. singapore has a larger concentration of full time active troops than the US forces,( using the figure of 40000 men.)</p>
              <p>in addition, when someone wants to launch an invasion, we would be blind if we are not able to notice enemy preparatory activities, and not respond in accordance to it.</p>
              <p>in other words, we have more than ample time to summon our reserves, without requiring a large standing army to be garrison all of the time.</p>

              <p>The law was not passed in fairness to the oil companies in Singapore, it was to protect the tax on petrol collected by the government! Many oil companies, such as exxon mobil supply petrol to JB from Singapore refineries.</p>
              <p>The fact that checks are not enforced on all vehicles today because manpower are deployed to check on terrorists, and smuggled cigarettes!</p>
              <p>With high oil prices now, government's tax collection has already increased. Besides, if the malaysian government is subsidizing their petrol sales, why not let them subsidize the singaporean cars as well. The government won't rescind the law because they dont want cars from the whole singapore jamming the causeway just to buy petrol, that would worsen the traffic already jamming the place.</p>

              <p><br>After you asked Shotgun how many standing troops he thought SAF would need, you posted a few statistics ranking Singapore. What are you trying to say?</p>
              <p>While Singapore ranked 24 in military expenditures, I wonder why a small country like Netherlands rank 18, is it at war with somebody?  and its neighbor Belgium, an equally small country, rank 34, why?</p>
              <p>Australia, Canada are all isolated continents but their military spendings are all very high, are they at war? or military spending should be proportionate to the size of the country? in that case, Singapore, being a small red dot, should spend nothing, and Indonesia, with 3 thousands islands, should be among the top in military spending?</p>
              <p>What is SDP trying to say, by quoting all the other countries? what are the points?</p>
