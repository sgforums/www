              <p><br> the government only declare war. look, in the Iraq, Afghanistan and
              Lebanon war, most of the civilian know that they will soon be
              engaged in some sort of war, before the war actually begins. people
              do notice things that happens around them.</p>
              <p>i get what u mean in ur first point. but it doesn't
              hurt to actually learn about how to do urban warfare in the
              singapore landscape. singapore is not inpregnable. in the long
              run, in a war of attrition, we would eventually be push back
              into singapore, due to resource/manpower shortages etc. we
              should be brushing up on urban defence back at home instead of
              urban warfare abroad.</p>
              <p>and how do you intend to use ur mortar/ tank/ wadever?
              almost every inch of singapore is covered with these HDB
              flat, where soldiers lurks. and, how many flats can
              u level? there are so many out there. even piles of rubble may
              prove hazardous to you, where they will still serve as effective
              hiding places.</p>
              <p>actually, it is kind of logical. in many of the modern urban
              wars, it is quite hard to take down a city full of
              hostile forces, not least one as urbanized as
              singapore. </p>

              <p>The only major difference i find in training in high rise/low rise buildings is stamina.</p>
              <p>There are so many kinds of corridors/windows/staircases (enclosed/spiral/etc)doors(2 door/locked/sliding) in a single building alone, why think so much? Everyone knows in urban combat the advantage lies with those who were there first, dug in. To me on the ground, i don't really care so much, just do my drills properly and try not to 'die' stupidly, that's all.</p>

              a?
              
              what should replace the breaching drill? iif things go wrong, help is not coming soon enough, you absolutely need to breech the obstacle, and you only have a bangalore to do it?
              
              i know now got the not so new toy with 50 charges that will destroy any obstacles in a straight line, but it is not very... reliable.
              
              and the drill that follows is about the same, right?
