I think they got a pretty good deal for planning terrorist acts .... it's a better deal than, what, say, those racist bloggers got for what they've written, neh ? .... we'll gain nothing by bringing them to a very public trial as a society .... better to slap them on the wrist, let their religious leaders show them the errors of the ways, and maintain the harmony of our society, eh ...<br><br>of course ... some here would like to construct this, as with everything else, as a political issue, rather than a national security issue .....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Counterterrorism Blog..<br><br>Arrests and Releases in Singapore: Two Trends Worth Noting<br>By Zachary Abuza<br><br>Today the Singapore Government made two announcements regarding terrorism in the Southeast Asian economic hub.<br><br>The first is that three more individuals, described as Â“home grownÂ” militants, were taken into custody in December 2007 under the Internal Security Act, which allows detention without trial. Two, Muhammad Zamri Abdullah and Maksham Mohd Shah, both 26, were placed under Orders of Deternion, while a third, Mohammad Taufik bin Andjah Asmara, whom authorities described as knowledgeable about the plot but less involved was placed under Restrictive Orders that limit his movement. Zamri and Maksham were described as Â“self-radicalised through radical propaganda in publications, videos and the internet.Â” Zamry was committed to join "mujahidin network", Â“so that he could wage armed jihad overseas and die a martyr.Â” Maksham taught himself about IEDs and had traveled to Malaysia to procure components.<br><br>In February 2007, Singapore arrested two other Â“home grownÂ” militants, Abdul Basheer and Muhamad Yassin Khan bin Muhamad Yunos. The government gave no indication that the two groups of self-radicalized individuals had any connection. While Singaporean authorities deserve credit for dismantling JI and MILF-connected cells since December 2001, they are clearly alarmed by the fact that the number of home grown militant cells in Southeast Asia, inspired by Mustafa Al-Suri's doctrine of nizam la tanzim (system, not organization), is expected to grow as JI is further weakened.<br><br>But the other announcement is perhaps much more important. Five detained members of JI were released from prison, though issued with Restriction Orders that limit their movement and require continued monitoring and counseling. Five other JI and MILF members who had been placed on RO on 10 January 2004, were released without condition as they have been Â“co-operative in investigations and rehabilitation.Â”<br><br>Singapore has one of the most successful jihadist rehabilitation programs and deserves both credit and attention. Since December 2001, Singapore has detained 73 individuals for their involvement in militant activities. Of those 73, 44 (60 percent) have been freed from prison, though still under some sort of restriction and monitoring. Seven individuals have been freed unconditionally. This is an impressive rate of success especially in the case of dealing with hardline and heavily indoctrinated jihadis, and considering the security consciousness of the city state.<br><br>Since April 2003, counseling for the detainees and their families has been conducted by the Religious Rehabilitation Group, comprised of roughly 21 religious teachers who volunteer their time. In the past year the RRG has broadened its mandate to engage in a broader de-radicalization amongst Muslim youth, conducting trainings in mosques and madrasas.<br><br><a href="http://counterterrorismblog.org/2008/01/arrests_and_releases_in_singap.php" rel="nofollow">http://counterterrorismblog.org/2008/01/arrests_and_releases_in_singap.php</a></div>

Two, Muhammad Zamri Abdullah and Maksham Mohd Shah, both 26, were placed under Orders of Deternion, while a third, Mohammad Taufik bin Andjah Asmara, whom authorities described as knowledgeable about the plot but less involved was placed under Restrictive Orders that limit his movement. Zamri and Maksham were described as Â“self-radicalised through radical propaganda in publications, videos and the internet.Â” Zamry was committed to join "mujahidin network", Â“so that he could wage armed jihad overseas and die a martyr.Â” Maksham taught himself about IEDs and had traveled to Malaysia to procure components.<br><br>In February 2007, Singapore arrested two other Â“home grownÂ” militants, Abdul Basheer and Muhamad Yassin Khan bin Muhamad Yunos. The government gave no indication that the two groups of self-radicalized individuals had any connection. While Singaporean authorities deserve credit for dismantling JI and MILF-connected cells since December 2001, they are clearly alarmed by the fact that the number of home grown militant cells in Southeast Asia, inspired by Mustafa Al-Suri's doctrine of nizam la tanzim (system, not organization), is expected to grow as JI is further weakened.<br><br>But the other announcement is perhaps much more important. Five detained members of JI were released from prison, though issued with Restriction Orders that limit their movement and require continued monitoring and counseling. Five other JI and MILF members who had been placed on RO on 10 January 2004, were released without condition as they have been Â“co-operative in investigations and rehabilitation.Â”<br><br>Singapore has one of the most successful jihadist rehabilitation programs and deserves both credit and attention. Since December 2001, Singapore has detained 73 individuals for their involvement in militant activities. Of those 73, 44 (60 percent) have been freed from prison, though still under some sort of restriction and monitoring. Seven individuals have been freed unconditionally. This is an impressive rate of success especially in the case of dealing with hardline and heavily indoctrinated jihadis, and considering the security consciousness of the city state.<br><br>Since April 2003, counseling for the detainees and their families has been conducted by the Religious Rehabilitation Group, comprised of roughly 21 religious teachers who volunteer their time. In the past year the RRG has broadened its mandate to engage in a broader de-radicalization amongst Muslim youth, conducting trainings in mosques and madrasas.<br><br><a href="http://counterterrorismblog.org/2008/01/arrests_and_releases_in_singap.php" rel="nofollow">http://counterterrorismblog.org/2008/01/arrests_and_releases_in_singap.php</a></div></blockquote>why are some of them being released ?<br><br>i think they should be life sentenced .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
