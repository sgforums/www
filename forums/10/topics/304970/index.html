            <div class='col-md body'>Dear LazerLordz,<br><br>Thank you for your answer. I read it with great interest and have the following to share.<br><br>It appears to me that the TERRORISM (SUPPRESSION OF BOMBINGS) ACT 2007 pertains to bombings and require the existence of a bomb to become applicable. I don't think actual bombs were found in the recent case. Feel free to correct me.<br><br>Extra-territoriality appears to me to be an alternative to having suspected Singaporean terrorists tried in the country in which the terrorist act was committed. We can't just hand over Citizens to other countries when they declare suspicion.<br><br>So if another country asks how the terrorist would be prosecuted in Singapore, this act may reassure them we are not supportive of terrorist bombings and serious about punishing the terrorist.<br><br>I suppose also so they won't feel obligated to have to send troops into Singapore to ensure the terrorist is punished properly.</div>
