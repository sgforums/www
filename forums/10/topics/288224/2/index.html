            <div class='col-md body'>All this talk abt merger, I think more or less it is a ruse tactic or merely one of those controversial talks let out of the loose gun(LXX).<br>I doubt he is crazy enough to even push forward the plans for a merger now as there are many underlying reasons.<br>SG broke awayf rom the federation due to the fact that PXP cannot agree with the Malaysia for malays system the UMNO had put forward back then. So if SG merge with MY, then it means LXX "kowtow" to the demands of UMNO or he has lost all means to let SG grow and develop further. Thus, he is willing to play second fiddle. But is he so stupid to allow such situation to happen. Think of it this way, would he rather be a king in a small kingdom or a small minister in a huge empire? No prize for guessing. With the bumi policy in place for so long, how would LXX gain their support if a merger is to happen? PXP may literally drown in the sea of this huge atmosphere.<br>Why I think this is a ruse is bcos. Most prob the PXP is gonna make news out of his comments, like running articles on the "lives of SGreans under merger". They will say things like unequal opportunities, racial policy, high crime rate, thus by contrasting to SG, they can "inflate" their so called success in these areas.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>&gt;&gt;Why PAP in 1962 hell-bent on wanting merger with Malaysia?</strong><br><br>Reply by Gandhi Ambalam:<br><br>I hope you don't mind if I bring in a few relevant historical developments before answering your question.<br><br>In 1961, the PAP was at its lowest ebb in popularity, having lost the Hong Lim by-election to Mr Ong Eng Guan and the Anson by-election to Mr David Marshall of WP. Not only these unfavorable events affected the PAP under Lee Kuan Yew's leadership, but the biggest blow that took place the same year was the split within the PAP. The splinter group calling itself the Barisan Sosialis took away almost the entire PAP branches, together with members and supporters, leaving only Lee Kuan Yew and his cabinet colleagues.  The Barisan split came about because of unfulfilled promises of the PAP in its manifesto in the 1959 elections.  As far as the Barisan leaders were concerned, the PAP under Lee Kuan Yew was deviating from its pro-people, pro-worker policies -- a betrayal of its socialistic principles.<br><br>In this changed political environment, the then Malayan Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman announced for the first time the Malaysian concept of merging Independent Malaya with the British Crown Colony Singapore and the British Borneo Territories. This announcement by the Tunku to the foreign correspondents in Singapore came as a boon to the beleaguered Lee Kuan Yew and his almost "skeletal" PAP.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew quickly latched on to this Malaysia concept which had the blessings of the British. The PAP propaganda machine was quickly set into motion with the claim that "Malaysia is as sure as the Sun rises".<br><br>Historically, Malaya, including Singapore existed under the British as a single entity until after WW II. It was only after the War that Singapore came under the direct rule of London as a British Crown Colony. Malaya became Independent in 1957, but Singapore still remained under the British with its excellent harbour and with the highest concentration of British troops east of Suez.<br><br>Almost all the political parties in Singapore were not against the reality of the Island becoming part of Peninsular Malaya. But the only objection were that of the unfair terms of merger and above all the inclusion of the Borneo Territories.  Indonesia under Seokarno objected to the formation of Malaysia because it saw it as an imperialist plot.  The Philippines under President Macapagal, the father of present president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, also opposed Malaysia for its historical claim over Sabah.<br><br>The PAP under Lee Kuan Yew had no alternative but to quickly promote merger to the people to prevent an imminent demise of the ruling party from the onslaught of the mass-based Barisan Sosialis headed by its charismatic leader Lim Chin Siong. The hastily arranged unfair merger and its subsequent breakup within two years stands testimony to the Barisan's initial objection to PAP's bulldozed merger.<br><br>Gandhi Ambalam<br>Chairman<br>Singapore Democratic Party<br><br><a href="http://singaporedemocrat.org/SDPforum/index.php?PHPSESSID=ba66bd3f71192aabea3a385e4c96f61b&amp;topic=5.0" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedemocrat.org/SDPforum/index.php?PHPSESSID=ba66bd3f71192aabea3a385e4c96f61b&amp;topic=5.0</a><br><br><strong>Lee Kuan Yew's polling fraud example 1962</strong><br><a href="http://uncleyap.blogspot.com/2007/06/lee-kuan-yews-polling-fraud-example.html" rel="nofollow">http://uncleyap.blogspot.com/2007/06/lee-kuan-yews-polling-fraud-example.html</a></div>

Constitutional discussions began in London in April 1956. On board, representing the PAP, were Lim Chin Siong and Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>The mission returned in failure and their demands for independence were refused. The British felt that the Labour Front government was too weak and the Communist elements in Singapore too powerful. If there was to be independence, the British fears needed to be calmed. David Marshall resigned and Lim Yew Hock took over as Chief Minister. He had two objectives. Firstly, he had to prove to the British that Singapore was able to resist Communism. Secondly, he wanted to purge the trade unions, schools and political parties of pro-Communist and Left Wing Leaders who were beginning to threaten the rule of the moderate politicians such as himself and LKY. Thus began a series of arrests under the Public Security Ordinance. Lim Chin Siong, Devan Nair and Fong Swee Suan were some of the prominent politicians being detained. (This issue will be dealt with in further details under Lim Chin Siong and Devan Nair at Part III)<br><br>It was Lim Yew Hock who took both blame and credit for the waves of Internal Security arrest. But the PAP was undoubtedly the main beneficiary of his tough regime. <strong>Lim Yew Hock arrested five Left Wing PAP members</strong>, newly elected onto the partyÂ’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) in August 1957, delivering the PAP from what was effectively a Left Wing Coup. Shortly after, PAP introduced the Â“cadres systemÂ” (to be elaborated under Dr Toh Chin Chye section at Part II), which prevented any further Left Wing infiltration into the partyÂ’s inner core.<br><br><strong><span class="large">Independence from the British</span></strong><br><br><strong>The next Constitutional Mission to London in April 1958 was a success. Under the State of Singapore Act in August 1958, the colony became a self-governing state. Elections for the new 51 member Legislative Assembly were scheduled for May 1959. Lim Yew Hock was given a heroÂ’s welcome on his return and a noisy motorcade from Kallang Airport.</strong><br><br></blockquote></span><br></div>
