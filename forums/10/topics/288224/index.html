            <div class='col-md body'>When the main island was colonized by the British East India Company in 1819, it contained a fishing village sparsely populated by indigenous Malays and Orang Lauts at the mouth of the Singapore River. The British used the position as a strategic trading outpost along the spice route.[1] It became one of the most important commercial and military centres of the British Empire and the site, in 1942, of what Winston Churchill called "Britain's biggest defeat" at the hands of the Japanese.[citation needed] Occupied by the Japanese Empire during World War II, it reverted to British rule in 1945 and was later part of the merger which established Malaysia in 1963. Less than two years later it left the federation and became an independent republic on 9 August 1965<br><br><strong>The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore established the city-state's political system as a representative democracy, while the country is recognized as a parliamentary republic.[4] The People's Action Party (PAP) dominates the political process and has won control of Parliament in every election since self-government in 1959.[5]</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">With more time in hand, and poring through the contents in a reference given in my last post - <strong><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=juXAmf2t1qEC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=singapore+gain+independence+through+merger+with+malaysia&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iar_qnKyAT&amp;sig=Zq7xsHc54-0gz-Fq1hZ5ojKV5rg" rel="nofollow">LKY writing a memorandum in which he had put forward a case for INDEPENDENCE THROUGH MERGER</a></strong> - there are some very interesting information that one can harvest looking back at the historical records in this reference piece.<br><br>From this memo prepared by LKY to Tunku, note that LKY had consulted UK Commissioner General (1953-69), Sir Robert Scott, Earl of Selkirk on the independence of Singapore through merger with Malaya, and subsequently including the British Borneo Territories.<br><br>This LKY <span style="font-style: italic;">''meeting with Selkirk''</span> led to further meetings with Tunku Abdul Rahman and members of his Cabinet - notably Tun Razak and Tun Ismail - to obtain their acceptance; and it led to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tunku asking LKY to prepare a proposal</span> that will detail the creation of a Federation of Malaysia - combining the territories of Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sabah and Sarawak.<br><br>Before LKY's memo was submitted to Tunku Abdul Rahman, LKY <span style="font-style: italic;">''consulted with Selkirk again''</span> and had him agree not to inform Tunku about the knowledge of this memo. While Tunku was reviewing LKY's memo, the UK Government was also similarly informed by Selkirk to the details of LKY's memo outlining the merger of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, and the British Borneo Territories.<br><br>From this piece of information, it will seem that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Malaysia was the brain child of LKY</strong></span> - and was <strong>not the creation of Tunku Abdul Rahman</strong> reputed publicly as the Father of Malaysia.<br><br>Now we know the deep personal disappointment felt in LKY to the failed merger, and for the tears that flowed during the public announcement.<br><br><strong>It was a personal creation that was hijacked by the shrewdness of others who are more wily and adapt at politics - constantly moving behind the scenes and honed in the art of back-stabbing</strong>.<br><br>Could this be the lingering ache that lead to a continuous hang-up of LKY with the idea of any future merger with Malaysia ?<br><br>Is LKY planning a second come-back to take back the brain child that rightfully belong to him ?<br><br>Perhaps this time around LKY will listen to more experienced voices that understand the Malay minds, or does he continue to believe that his experience is more then sufficient to cope with the new situation as he had believed in himself being capable in the early 1960s prior to merger and ignored all other opposing voices ?<br><br>Now I wonder where did <span style="font-style: italic;">'TheGoodEarth'</span> developed the idea that merger leading to the creation of Federation of Malaysia was a British idea - must have picked up the whiff of a gossip from some familiar <span style="font-style: italic;">'pile of crap'</span> ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm .... you are indeed into my pile of crap - yet ever higher and deeper. Your narration confirms my part of history - that Britain granted independence to its former colonies only when a NEW nation called the Federation of Malaysia is formed.  <span style="color: red;">Had SG remained in the Federation, would you say that Britain granted independence to Singapore?</span>  I think you are good in research but poor in deduction!<br>You have plenty of time to go round the bush and quote irrelevant parts here and there to suit yourself.
