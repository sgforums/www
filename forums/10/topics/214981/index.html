            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's dead slow efforts to provide low cost boradband services to the people is costing it a lot of jobs and revenure. I do not know why the IDA cannot see these great oppurtunity losses. It should have been pro-active in this regard years ago.<br><br>-- -- --<br>ESO - Educational Services Outsourcing<br>A TWO billion USD market.<br>-------------------------<br><br>Tutoring American kids from India<br><br>New Delhi, Oct 13. (PTI): After BPO, it is the turn of ESO now. For thousands of teachers here, tuitions have become a dollar spinner, thanks to the growing demand for online tutorials from USA, UK and Europe.<br><br>According to an online tutorial site, nearly 1,00,000 teachers from India were expected to set up their own internet businesses during September-October, the time when the new academic session begins in America, to teach students there.<br><br>"Educational Services Outsourcing (ESO) definitely seems to be the next 'in-thing. The education is a growing sector and the demand for Indian educators is on the rise," says Kiran Karnik, President, NASSCOM.<br><br>"Indian educators are respected globally and held in high esteem. We must capitalise on this opportunity," he says.<br><br>"ESO market is estimated to be $ eight billion dollars and Indian teachers are currently offering services to countries like US, UK , Canada , and the Middle East," says Shantanu Parkash of Educomp, an e-learning major.<br><br>"School tuitions is the main sector for Indian teachers as in higher education, accreditation with the American Education Council is compulsory. It is just the beginning of ESO and many small players have entered into the field," says Nicholas George, Vice President, NIIT.<br><br>There is very high demand for tuitions in maths, science and English. Though the main demand is from USA, newer markets of Netherlands and Europe too are fast opening up for Indian teachers, says George.<br><br>Low cost of tuitions and very good teaching skills of Indian teachers is what attracts American students and parents to them, says George.<br><br>Thus when the rest of the India sleeps, many postgraduate teachers sit wide awake before their PCs, giving interactive online tuitions to children seated before similar computer modules, continents apart in the USA.<br><br>A number of online sites have come up where teachers can register, stating their expertise in a particular subject. The sites sub-contract work from SES (Supplemental Education Services) in the US. Schools unable to improve student performance are falling back on tuitions for help.<br><br>There are over 75 such tuition centres across the US. Called SES providers, they charge students up to $ 40 an hour to take classes. Wire the work to India over broadband links and it can be done for half the cost.<br><br>However, there are some Indian educational technology companies, which have directly approached the schools in the US, he says.<br><br>The Education Market Research of US estimates the K-12 market size at $ 2 billion annually. K-12 is the North American designation for primary and secondary education.<br><br>The infrastructure for EPO includes broadband connectivity and a workstation with a whiteboard that replaces the traditional blackboard. The student and teacher can speak to each other continuously using a hands-free headset, much like talking on a telephone.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>To:  ALL   Advertisement<br><br>From:  tohgoh   12-Oct 23:37<br>To:  MarkErni   2 of 12<br><br>120493.2 in reply to 120493.1<br><br>The next big thing is Wimax.

You see, if Wimax is available here, who do you think will suffer most?<br><br>Telcos. Because their IDD revenue is going to drop big time.

No one will need to power on a stupid Cable or DSL modem.
