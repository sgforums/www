              <p>I assume u refer to my post.</p>
              <p>1.Labour union in SG represented by NTUC.Dunt think people in SG have been and are still highly controlled by ISD and secret police.<strong>No one know better than LKY the power of labour union.</strong>He was a young and voluntairly legal adviser to then unions in 1950's ,carring a rare double honours in Laws fr Cambridge or Oxford!!He came to power with the aids of unions to a great extend.Unions leaders and members were and are still human beings.They will crash with political leaders if their live suffer.</p>
              <p>2.who say Union in SG is powerless?In 1980's,SIA Pilot Union was so strong that LKY had to come out and said he would wind up SIA if the pilots did not return to negotiating table.</p>
              <p>Then u know the famous SIA union leader   ,who was SG PR from Malaysi,whose PR status was cancelled. <strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Ryan Goh Yew Hock,is a Malaysian.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p>http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-040314.htm</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">3.NTUC Fairprice Supermarket etc help to stabalize prices in SG.</span></strong></p>
              <p>U ask how HK people feel about the two Super market chains in HK_------Park N Shop and Welcome,run by greedy owners!Ask Malaysians why they always short of important foods stuff near CNY,but not near other festivals!!</p>
              <p>NTUC has a political duty to make SG people happy.LKY and their old and new gurads know SG citizens are human.</p>
              <p>Like Chinese saying go,''Water can hold ships,also can flip the ships!!''</p>
              <p>We are not prisioners of Singapore Prision ,nor patients of SG hospital!!</p>
              <p>The little red dot passport and the eduaction can help us migrate anywhere easily,anytime and anywhere.<strong>Quota for Singaporean or ambassy in SG always open.</strong></p>

              <p>Workers are also stakeholders in the economy, without workers where get bosses? given that NTUC took the initiatives to leverage the living standard of workers here thru membership clubs, rebates and other fringe benefits, does not bother even the employers concern, in fact, employers are happy that NTUC provided the platform for workers to upper their standard of living, longlife education, skill and re skilling, so as to help the employers in their productivity. When workers are happy, productivity increase, bosses become happy, paid their taxes and expand their investment and production resulting in more jobs created, this in turn make the govt happy to pursue the support for NTUC initiatives. This is call social economy. When 3 parties are in a all wins situation, the country growth and all gained. No country in this world can follow this kind of good tripartism in Singapore, a niche to beat all competition, it is say that it is an envious and jealous of many countries who never understand how this model work.</p>
