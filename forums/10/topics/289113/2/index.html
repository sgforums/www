If so, then the Workers' Party is reneging on its role of being a true opposition party.<br><br>I am also deeply disappointed that Mr Low does not think his party is ready to challenge the PAP to be the government in the near future.<br><br>I followed the 2006 General Election closely and was under the impression that the Workers' Party wanted to be an alternative government.<br><br>An opposition party should earn votes by showing that it is ready to take on national issues.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's difficult for WP to match PAP in terms of candidate calibre simply because PAP currently has the monopoly of recruiting scholars into its ranks. Although WP is gaining popularity while PAP is losing its popularity gradually, WP will never be able to obtain complete information on government data such as CPF, HDB because of PAP's dominating position. It's very hard for WP to formulate any alternative policies to challenge the PAP if it doesn't have full access to those data. However, I admire Mr Low's down-to-ground remarks about his party's political prospects and directions.</div>
