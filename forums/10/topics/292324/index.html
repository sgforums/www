            <div class='col-md body'>MOM has only its look-good statistics concealing the real problem like the number of unemployed for 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 1-2 years, 3-4 years.<br><br>It looks like Minister Ng Eng Hen is not willing to be accountable or truthful by giving direct figures showing unemployment situation in Singapore. He is more interested in showing number of jobs created but not that interested in showing out of the jobs created how many go to citizens as opposed to foreigners or PRs.<br><br>In addition, when the professors at NUS interpreted the MOM figures as showing a stark picture of unemployment Minister Ng was quick to blame them for giving false or wrong information which actually was not caused by the professors.<br><br>The talents in our government should in the first place not try to conceal truths in statistics. For example, Minister Ng could instead of combining job creations in a merged category of Singapore Residents (meaning no distinction between Citizens and PR who are now regarded as residents on par with citizens) provide separate figures showing citizens who have become unemployed against periods of unemployment over the longer time frame as many are still willing to stay employed but were unable to find jobs after 1999 widespread retrenchments. So those who are still willing to be employ but are unable to find jobs they should be included as unemployed and not excluded due to MOM's own definition of no longer seeking jobs after a shorter period.<br><br>To govern a country efficiently with care for welfare and wellbeing of citizens we must not encourage this kind of practice to use statistics to conceal unpleasant truths.<br><br>The press should be permitted free reporting of news including their own professional interpretations of data and news so as not to conceal ugly problems like NKF or Shin Corp or MOM's tweaking of the unemployment figures.<br><br>The statistics on ZAEMites should be fully transparent and accountable and not be tweaked by any ministers to lessen impact of unpleasant truths.<br><br>There may not be just one case or several cases of suicides or destitutes. But the press is not giving due coverage of such actual problems. If government is to change its mindset the first mindset is to let facts be reported freely as they stand.<br><br>Back to top<br><br></div>

Perhaps the opposition can fight for a "free" press, welfare for all, more jobs to Singaporeans rather than FT etc etc things that the PAP doesn't really deem to provide and then let the voters decide what government they want...if people vote for the hybrid PAP rather than the "democrats" then so be it.</div>
