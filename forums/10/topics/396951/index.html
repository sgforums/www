              <p>During the last dying days of the Suharto regime, the people were fed up, and the credibility and moral authority of the ruling family (can be said so) was diminishing day by day.</p>
              <p>Eventually, the regime did something.</p>
              <p>Suharto's daughter was appointed Minister of Social Affairs.</p>
              <p>She was pictured visitting poor people, orphanages, dishing out aids, visitting hospital patients, and so on.</p>
              <p>But eventually, it didnt help.</p>
              <p>People were fed up by the misdeeds, and the power monopoly of the Suharto family.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of some similar case in some other countries.</p>
              <p>There is a country where a certain charismatic ruler has been in power for so long, and that he entrenched power to his family.</p>
              <p>Because of the prominence and vulnerability of his family, something clever was done.</p>
              <p>The daughter was put forward, she wrote some articles in the state media. Usually, she would write how she is just an ordinary person, with faults and weaknesses, and that she is always striving for truth, justice, and compassion. She is also a firm believer of social solidarity.</p>
              <p>Now, why would the state media avail such generous space to her?</p>
              <p>There are countless other columnists who can write about a wide range of subjects.</p>
              <p>From what I read, there is nothing special about what she wrote. It feels more like a blog or a personal commentary. Usually talking about her personal experiences or some things in her family, or brothers, or parents.</p>
              <p>This made me sad in some way.</p>
              <p>It means it is an indication that the situation has reached the Suharto's family level.</p>

              <p>after controlling and dominating Indonesia for decades, the Suharto family is still in control.............they merely stepped back behind the curtains..............</p>
              <p>if they were pushed off from power, the family would have been persecuted mercilessly by their enemies..........it's exactly the same as the mafia, if the boss quits he'll be dead.........</p>
              <p>the different political parties in Indonesia is like a charade, Suharto family is still big boss............</p>

              <p>When Suharto rules indonesia, there was no indonesia maid</p>
              <p>When Marcos rules Philippines, there was no Philppino Maid</p>
              <p>And now, as LKY rules singapore, we women are safe from being abused and become other country maid.</p>

              <p>If you asked me, tho i may be around at the time of Suharto and Marcos, I have no doubt that they rules much much better than the present govt or those govt after them, tho they may have taken bribes and  dicatate the country, but during their reign,  economy was good, people get prosperous and everything is well controlled. </p>
