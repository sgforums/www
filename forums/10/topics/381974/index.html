              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";' lang="EN-GB">1. Pahang will soon
                              be selling water to Selangor/KL. I don't think Pahang would be happy to receive
                              3 sen per thousand gallons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";' lang="EN-GB">2. Melaka has been
                              paying Johore 30 sen per thousand gallons and is still doing so and will
                              continue to do so I suppose. Would Johore be asking for more than 30 sen in the
                              future? God knows.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";' lang="EN-GB">3. In 2011 the first
                              agreement with Singapore
                              to sell 350 million gallons of raw water daily at 3 sen per thousand gallons will
                              end. What would we do then? I suspect despite Singapore's famous Newater, it
                              would still need the 350 million gallons daily.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";' lang="EN-GB">4. The other treaty
                              would end by 2060 in which the price is also 3 sen per thousand gallons. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But
                              without the 350 million gallons daily according to the first treaty, Singapore's
                              rapidly increasing population of new immigrants would not have enough water.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";' lang="EN-GB">5. So, the amount
                  supplied according to the first treaty would be even more crucial despite
                  Newater and desalination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";' lang="EN-GB">6. The Government of
                  Tun Abdullah had very cleverly decided not to raise any of the issues
                  outstanding with Singapore
                  after the bridges were jettisoned. I suppose this charitable act would help
                  cement friendship with that city-state with a per capita income of US$36,000 (Malaysia's per capita incidentally is US$7,000,
                  i.e one-fifth of Singapore).</span></p>

              Not to worry, we are already self sufficient in water especially "newater".  With a population of nearly 5 million, there are alot of waste water from our sewerage to turn it into "newater".    We have also converted the seawater at Marina Barrage into fresh water reservoir.    
              Just like sand, we used to get from My,  Indon, then Vietnam and now from Cambodia.  Just think out of the box.

              <p>Think about it this way... 3 sen per 1000 gallon for raw water that they had no use for anyway.  </p>
              <p>Its not like raw water is some kinda economic resource to Malaysia.  What were they going to do with it anyway?  The water would probably just sit there... and not generate any kind of economic benefits. They don't have to do anything, we build the pipelines to bring the water in... </p>
              <p>Think about it this way... it just so happens that more water happens to fall down from the sky and land there.  We are just asking to have something of which they have plenty and is of no economic value to them, and paying them a token price for it.  What is wrong with that?  Why should we pay anything more?  </p>
              <p>Processed and potable water is not cheap.  It actually cost money to convert something that fell from the sky which they gracious sell to us at 3cts per 1000 gal, into something that is drinkable and usable  by industry.  Thus, raw water has been transformed into something of economic value.  So why can't we charge them for it?  We *bought* the water from them, and we need water because we have not much of it, and potable water is actually an economic resource, why shouldn't we charge them for it?  They complain its too much... how much is too much?  We can charge them lower and they can ALWAYS complain its too much when they compare it to 3 cts for useless raw water. </p>

              <p>2008, sale of potable water 1,262,000 m3 per day!THis is on par with 2002,</p>
              <p>thanks to NEWater and desalination water.</p>
              <p>May i recap  the water policy when NEWater was rolled out.</p>
              <p>----By 2011,15 % of water will be supplied by NEWater.This was increased to</p>
              <p>30% by 2011!</p>
              <p>----10 % of demand is met by desalination. The plant is sold to city spring REIT.</p>
              <p>---Before the operation of Marina Reservoir, half of SG land is used as water catchment area. This result in local catchment can provide 50% of water demand.</p>
              <p>This include some HDB estates.</p>
              <p>After the Marina Reservoir was put in op few months ago, catchment increase to two third of sg land. So, i think the local catchment will provide at least two third of water demand. It may take 2 years to dilute the salt in Marina Reservoir.The most densely populated of SG,including CBD, fall into the new water catchment. Urban catchment is not new. But Sg scale is very huge.</p>

              <p>Beige in color is current water catchment area.Green is water<br> catchment area of proposed Reservoirs of Marina,Sg Puggol ,<br> Sg Serangoon and and Lower Seletar.All the new and extended<br> reservoirs will be ready by 2012</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desalination plant</span></strong></p>
              <p>The city spring REIT plant--built by Hyflux--cost abt S$200 m and abt 6 ha to provide</p>
              <p>10 % of SG daily need, capacity 135,000 m3 per day.</p>
              <p>$$ is not a problem.Land--sg have new reclamation land of abt 2,000 ha in Tuas.</p>
              <p>So, in overnight, all water demand can be met by desalination!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWater is mainly for factory and office</strong></span></p>
              <p>Currently, only 1 % of potable come from NEWater,after it mix with traditional source of water in reservoir for sun bath! It will increase to 2.5 % within few years.</p>
              <p>In USA Cali. ,they return the treated water to underground to mix with underground water.SG is better with additional sun bath!</p>
              <p>SG factory need highh volume of pure clean water for manufacturing of wafer chips, petroleum products, cleaning etc.</p>
              <p>Office aldo need. In new Marina South new CBD, all new office bhilding are mandatory</p>
              <p>to be provided with chilled water for air cond purposes.</p>

              <p>I agree with you on this, and would like to add further.</p>
              <p>The water may belong to the Malaysians, but the water treatment facillities and management are paid by Singaporean funds. The processed water is not only used by Singaporeans, it is also used by the people of Johor.</p>
              <p>What the racist pig brained old 'has been' is calling for is an increase in the prices. Justifiable of course, and we Singaporeans can afford it, no prob, afterall we dont really need it anymore, for by 2011, we will be at least 80% self sufficient.</p>
              <p>But I am sure the Johor people are going to scream bloody murder, for it will mean an increase in the prices we sell the water back to them. Costs are and had always been passed on to the consumers.</p>
              <p>By all means, call for a raise, the way he raised petrol prices, which they own and yet sold high to its citizens unconscienciably, and see how the Johor citizens will react.</p>
              <p>We dont even need to lift a finger, just sit back, relax and watch that pig brained mad hatter be torn further into pieces figuratively by his own people, whatever thats left of his dignity if it ever exist in the first place. Nationalism will only go as far as the length of one's stomach or his loved one's.</p>
              <p>Msia can always buy over our water treatment facillities. If they can build white elephants such as the petronas towers, they can jolly well afford our price. And it will be staggering so - another 50 years of revenue lost calculated in, adjusted with annual inflation rate. Our treasury will overflow and can even build more desalination plants and supply water to SEAsia region.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Msia can also seize the facillities. Go ahead, make my day. The Johor folks feeling the recession pinch, sick of paying more in a land of resources, will welcome us with open arms.</p>
              <p>Had been waiting for it. Better we resolve it now this generation than to burden the next.Already used to his threats and sabre rattling. He owes me and my brothers-in-arms lost youth in training and preparing to counter his delusions of granduer habitually.</p>
              <p>Glory to the liberation of Singaporeans and Johor people, and Honour intact to our republic for we WILL NOT BE BULLIED!</p>

              <p>Factor in the fact we are an entreport and have other sources as well.</p>
              <p>Factor in also trade goes both way - essentials are not charity goods given to us but paid at market rates. It will hurt them as much as it will hurt us with a market gone. Their citizens will go wild. </p>
              <p>We can live without food, or just on potato as the scots did, but we cannot live without water. Fortunately, we had planned ahead and by 2011, we will only need 20% of msia water base on 4-6% growth. When push come to shove, there will be means to make up for the 20% shortfall. Invention and improvisation had always been the mother of necessity.</p>

              <p>I agree with you on this, and would like to add further.</p>
              <p>The water may belong to the Malaysians, but the water treatment facillities and management are paid by Singaporean funds. The processed water is not only used by Singaporeans, it is also used by the people of Johor.</p>
              <p>What the racist pig brained old 'has been' is calling for is an increase in the prices. Justifiable of course, and we Singaporeans can afford it, no prob, afterall we dont really need it anymore, for by 2011, we will be at least 80% self sufficient.</p>
              <p>But I am sure the Johor people are going to scream bloody murder, for it will mean an increase in the prices we sell the water back to them. Costs are and had always been passed on to the consumers.</p>
              <p>By all means, call for a raise, the way he raised petrol prices, which they own and yet sold high to its citizens unconscienciably, and see how the Johor citizens will react.</p>
              <p>We dont even need to lift a finger, just sit back, relax and watch that pig brained mad hatter be torn further into pieces figuratively by his own people, whatever thats left of his dignity if it ever exist in the first place. Nationalism will only go as far as the length of one's stomach or his loved one's.</p>
              <p>Msia can always buy over our water treatment facillities. If they can build white elephants such as the petronas towers, they can jolly well afford our price. And it will be staggering so - another 50 years of revenue lost calculated in, adjusted with annual inflation rate. Our treasury will overflow and can even build more desalination plants and supply water to SEAsia region.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Msia can also seize the facillities. Go ahead, make my day. The Johor folks feeling the recession pinch, sick of paying more in a land of resources, will welcome us with open arms.</p>
              <p>Had been waiting for it. Better we resolve it now this generation than to burden the next.Already used to his threats and sabre rattling. He owes me and my brothers-in-arms lost youth in training and preparing to counter his delusions of granduer habitually.</p>
              <p>Glory to the liberation of Singaporeans and Johor people, and Honour intact to our republic for we WILL NOT BE BULLIED!</p>

              <p>Before the X-rated Fraud gets all fogged up with its hot gas, it should look into the facts before shooting off at a tangent in some jingoistic nationalistic fervor.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html">‘The 1961 Agreement maybe expiring by 2011 and the Singapore Government will allow it to lapse. There remains the 1962 Agreement that is valid till 2061 – it gave Singapore the full and exclusive right to draw water from the Johor River up to a maximum of <strong>250 million gallons per day</strong> (or <strong>1.14 million cubic meter a day</strong>). In return, Johor was entitled to a daily supply of treated water from Singapore up to 2 per cent of the raw water it supplied. The 1962 agreement allow for a price review after 25 years – (which the Johor Government chose not to revise the prices in 1986 and 1987’. (*1) </a></p>
              <p>What is the basis for the fraudulent claim in the statement made that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">we dont really need it anymore, for by 2011, we will be at least <span style="color: #ff0000;">80%</span> self sufficient."  </span></em>?</p>

              <p>In the usual ways of a pseudo-intellect with its own characteristic false values that will encourage Singaporeans to spend our way out of the present economic crisis - and NOT to HOARD our monies - as the FORECAST is for a 3% GDP Growth for next year.</p>
              <p>For that reason, alone Singapore can throw caution to the wind, spend, spend and spend - not to hoard.</p>
              <p>For that reason that Singapore can achieve self-sufficiencty in our own water supply -<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">possibly</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> 80% by 2011</span></em> - we  can thumb our nose at the Malaysians and tell them all co-operation is off the table.</p>
              <p>Yes, we can depend on the X-rated Fraud to count on next years 3% GDP growth to be a certainty, when the caveat is not as loudly publicised.</p>
              <p>If Singapore can reach water self-sufficiency of 80% by 2011 - was there any need to have the water agreement with Malaysia to be valid till 2061 ?</p>
              <p>Was there a self-doubt that existed that the "Dog does not know what its Tail is thinking" ?</p>
              <p>It is about time that the X-rated Fraud start behaving like a real Dog and take control of its Tail, and not allow the damn "Tail to wag the Dog".</p>
              <p>Obviously, no one will expect the stoopidity of the X-rated Fraud with a pseudo-intellect to know how to be a truly good dog and control its tail to give the right signal to the Master.</p>
