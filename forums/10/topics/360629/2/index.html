              <p>Not sure what the Myanmar case is, I dont think we can make comments.</p>
              <p>You know, some things are not so simple, they are rather complicated, and it is best that they are resolved internally, domestically first.</p>
              <p>When Anwar was purged and jailed, did ASEAN make negative comments?</p>
              <p>When Thai military overturned democracy and launched coup, did ASEAN want to condemn Thailand?</p>
              <p>You know, all these have underlying domestic reasons, some kind of power struggles and social polarizations between different powers.</p>
              <p>It is best that such cases should be resolved internally.</p>
              <p>You know like when a family or a household is having a dispute and an argument, it is best that the neighbours be a bit more respectful and let them solve it themselves.</p>
              <p>I believe the same attitude must be maintained with Myanmar.</p>
              <p>The funny thing I notice is that there seem to be a special interest by some Western block countries toward Myanmar. I dont think they condem Thai military who anyway did the same thing like what Myanmar military did. So I dont think things are so simple, there must be some kind of reason for this special interest.</p>
              <p>Even for ASEAN, I dont think it is embarrasing. What is embarrasing I think is ASEAN trying to appease and grovel to the Western block protests. So they become affected and scold Myanmar as well. This kind of attitude is embarrasing.</p>

              <p><br>Arapahoe, just for discussion sake.</p>
              <p>The critical issue discussed here is democracy. Democracy for the Burmese people suffering under the repulsive Junta.</p>
              <p>I was once a flag waving idealist in support of democracy for the Burmese people, after some of the monks were shot dead and many tortured to death. I signed pettitions international and local in support of over throwing the regime in any form.</p>
              <p>But then one day i realise one important truth. Democracy is an ideal that can only be bestowed upon by the people themselves, and not given freely by others. The nation ( people) must want it, and want it badly enough collectively to SEEK every way possible to achieve it.</p>
              <p>Anything other than that will only lead to quagmires such as Vietnam and Iraq.</p>
              <p>The French had only pitchfork and farm utensils against the might of the despotic French Sun King Louis, and won. </p>
              <p>Russians adored Communism, but soon such tastes turned sour in the hands of Stalin. The people were repressed and ensured that they would never rebel.</p>
              <p>But in time, communist doctrines even failed the moderate politburo members and made them disillusion. Freedom came in the hands of Yeltsin.</p>
              <p>One way or another, freedom taste better if it comes from the hands of a nation's own people. Any other way is an open invitation to dictatorship as history had shown. We, as outsiders of nations involved, can only offer our moral support and use positive engagement to help Mynmar and its people.</p>
              <p>To isolate Mynmar is to make the resource rich country with rice that could feed the world and oil to fill every factory in China, turn to fellow despots such as N. Korea for support, and worse still if the Junta feels the rest of the world is oppressing them and turn to Osama and his gang for tech and military support.</p>
              <p>The critical issue, I repeat - Democracy can only be won by its own people, with the pen or the sword, and never in the history of mankind had it been won for the people by other nations that do not turn sour later.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I do not believe there is a need to wavie the freedom flag. Nor to import a western democracy movement into Myanmar.  Infact Aung San Suu Kyi has already agreed to a joint govt; idealogy of western democracy is relative. I don't think I have  any illusion on this topics.  </p>
              <p>What is impediment to move forward is the fact that the military have NO intention of releasing power and change its uniform to a civil structure of govt. Couple with the fact that it has a big brother to give them the incentives to continue to stay in the Same path.  </p>
              <p>I do not think that it is in ASEAN interest to wait and expect myanmar break up from a civil war for a regime change nor it is Asean interest to see it become a Godzilla with a small Nuke power plant either.</p>
              <p>The path of wait and see is the path of inaction. You can choose to take the long view, but Catalyst is the accent of change. I think overtime Asean will have to pay for the cost of waiting.  </p>

              <p>Why.....Feeling unjust.....Did i mention anything about the West or the US when I mention it is a predicament for ASEAN?  Did I said anything about deploying western style of democracy in myanmar?  </p>
              <p>When we talk about Myanmar, Isn't its part of ASEAN sphere of influence isn;t it not?</p>
              <p>Asean came out from Colonial....And Particularly Myanmar was exploited by the Brit. So Now we see that the Generals of Myanmar are so willingly to be exploited again now by China? What is the different? People are not getting better, the wealth goes to the few military elites.</p>
              <p> we enjoyed seeing myanmar get rape by China on its resources? At the expense of its burmese? When LKY mention that the Junta General is Dump Perhaps it is Really Dump.</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with the West...Nor because i stayed outside of SG.</p>
              <p>All civil govt apply certain moral law to govern their country. And millions of people in the regions live by it. That is a moral code of conduct that Asean Respect the civil code, we do not interfere. But not a military govt. It does not provide the civil code, it does not answer to the LAW it does as it goes along.   </p>
              <p>Asean will pay at some point if it allow Myanmar to go uncheck. If Asean allow the regime to grow as it is. AT some point the Generals will either have to drop the uniform or it will have to go .Or you will have Kim Jong IL Style on our side of the region.... A regime who know how to insulate itself to survive and get stronger?  </p>

              <p class="Titel" style="text-align: left;"><strong>The major actors</strong></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The
              tragedy of Burma, whose land area is about the size of George W. Bush’s
              Texas, is that its population is being used as a human stage prop in a
              drama which has been scripted in Washington by the National Endowment
              for Democracy (NED), the George Soros Open Society Institute, Freedom
              House and Gene Sharp’s Albert Einstein Institution, a US intelligence
              asset used to spark “non-violent” regime change around the world on
              behalf of the US strategic agenda.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Burma’s
              “Saffron Revolution,” like the Ukraine “Orange Revolution” or the
              Georgia “Rose Revolution” and the various Color Revolutions instigated
              in recent years against strategic states surrounding Russia, is a
              well-orchestrated exercise in Washington-run regime change, down to the
              details of “hit-and-run” protests with “swarming” mobs of Buddhists in
              saffron, internet blogs, mobile SMS links between protest groups,
              well-organized protest cells which disperse and reform. CNN made the
              blunder during a September broadcast of mentioning the active presence
              of the NED behind the protests in Myanmar.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In fact
              the US State Department admits to supporting the activities of the NED
              in Myanmar. The NED is a US Government-funded “private” entity whose
              activities are designed to support US foreign policy objectives, doing
              today what the CIA did during the Cold War. As well the NED funds
              Soros’ Open Society Institute in fostering regime change in Myanmar. In
              an October 30 2003 Press Release the State Department admitted, “The
              United States also supports organizations such as the National
              Endowment for Democracy, the Open Society Institute and Internews,
              working inside and outside the region on a broad range of democracy
              promotion activities.” It all sounds very self-effacing and noble of
              the State Department. Is it though?</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In
              reality the US State Department has recruited and trained key
              opposition leaders from numerous anti-government organizations. It has
              poured the relatively huge sum (for Myanmar) of more than $2.5 million
              annually into NED activities in promoting regime change in Myanmar
              since at least 2003. The US regime change, its Saffron Revolution, is
              being largely run according to informed reports, out of the US
              Consulate General in bordering Chaing Mai, Thailand. There activists
              are recruited and trained, in some cases directly in the USA, before
              being sent back to organize inside Myanmar. The USA’s NED admits to
              funding key opposition media including the <em>New Era Journal, Irrawaddy and the Democratic Voice of Burma</em> radio.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The
              concert-master of the tactics of Saffron monk-led non-violence regime
              change is Gene Sharp, founder of the deceptively-named Albert Einstein
              Institution in Cambridge Massachusetts, a group funded by an arm of the
              NED to foster US-friendly regime change in key spots around the world.
              Sharp’s institute has been active in Burma since 1989, just after the
              regime massacred some 3000 protestors to silence the opposition. CIA
              special operative and former US Military Attache in Rangoon, Col.
              Robert Helvey, an expert in clandestine operations, introduced Sharp to
              Burma in 1989 to train the opposition there in non-violent strategy.
              Interestingly, Sharp was also in China two weeks before the dramatic
              events at Tiananmen Square.</p>
              <p class="Titel" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why Myanmar now? </strong></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">A
              relevant question is why the US Government has such a keen interest in
              fostering regime change in Myanmar at this juncture. We can dismiss
              rather quickly the idea that it has genuine concern for democracy,
              justice, human rights for the oppressed population there. Iraq and
              Afghanistan are sufficient testimony to the fact Washington’s paean to
              Democacy is propaganda cover for another agenda.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The question is what would lead to such engagement in such a remote place as Myanmar?</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Geopolitical
              control seems to be the answer. Control ultimately of the strategic sea
              lanes from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. The coastline of
              Myanmar provides naval access in the proximity of one of the world’s
              most strategic water passages, the Strait of Malacca, the narrow ship
              passage between Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The
              Pentagon has been trying to militarize the region since September 11,
              2001 on the argument of defending against possible terrorist attack.
              The US has managed to gain an airbase on Banda Aceh, the Sultan
              Iskandar Muda Air Force Base, on the northernmost tip of Indonesia. The
              governments of the region, including Myanmar, however, have adamantly
              refused US efforts to militarize the region. A glance at a map will
              confirm the strategic importance of Myanmar.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The
              Strait of Malacca, linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, is the
              shortest sea route between the Persian Gulf and China. It is the key
              chokepoint in Asia. More than 80% of all China’s oil imports are
              shipped by tankers passing the Malacca Strait. The narrowest point is
              the Phillips Channel in the Singapore Strait, only 1.5 miles wide at
              its narrowest. Daily more than 12 million barrels in oil supertankers
              pass through this narrow passage, most en route to the world’s
              fastest-growing energy market, China or to Japan.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">If
              the strait were closed, nearly half of the world's tanker fleet would
              be required to sail further. Closure would immediately raise freight
              rates worldwide. More than 50,000 vessels per year transit the Strait
              of Malacca. The region from Maynmar to Banda Aceh in Indonesia is fast
              becoming one of the world’s most strategic chokepoints. Who controls
              those waters controls China’s energy supplies.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext"> </p>
              <p class="Lauftext"><img id="Bild670" title="Malacca" src="http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/Geopolitics___Eurasia/Myanmar/Malacca.jpg" border="0" alt="Malacca" width="400" height="345" align="top"></p>
              <p class="Lauftext"> </p>
              <p class="Lauftext">That strategic importance of Myanmar has not been lost on Beijing.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Since
              it became clear to China that the US was hell-bent on a unilateral
              militarization of the Middle East oil fields in 2003, Beijing has
              stepped up its engagement in Myanmar. Chinese energy and military
              security, not human rights concerns drive their policy.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In
              recent years Beijing has poured billions of dollars in military
              assistance into Myanmar, including fighter, ground-attack and transport
              aircraft; tanks and armored personnel carriers; naval vessels and
              surface-to-air missiles. China has built up Myanmar railroads and roads
              and won permission to station its troops in Myanmar. China, according
              to Indian defense sources, has also built a large electronic
              surveillance facility on Myanmar’s Coco Islands and is building naval
              bases for access to the Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In
              fact Myanmar is an integral part of what China terms its “string of
              pearls,” its strategic design of establishing military bases in
              Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia in order to counter US control over the
              Strait of Malacca chokepoint. There is also energy on and offshore of 
              Myanmar, and lots of it.</p>
              <p class="Titel" style="text-align: left;"><strong>The gas fields of Myanmar</strong></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Oil
              and gas have been produced in Myanmar since the British set up the
              Rangoon Oil Company in 1871, later renamed Burmah Oil Co. The country
              has produced natural gas since the 1970’s, and in the 1990’s it granted
              gas concessions to the foreign companies ElfTotal of France and Premier
              Oil of the UK in the Gulf of Martaban. Later Texaco and Unocal (now
              Chevron) won concessions at Yadana and Yetagun as well. Alone Yadana
              has an estimated gas reserve of more than 5 trillion cubic feet with an
              expected life of at least 30 years. Yetagun is estimated to have about
              a third the gas of the Yadana field.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In 2004 a large new gas field, Shwe field, off the coast of Arakan was discovered.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">By
              2002 both Texaco and Premier Oil withdrew from the Yetagun project
              following UK government and NGO pressure. Malaysia’s Petronas bought
              Premier’s 27% stake. By 2004 Myanmar was exporting Yadana gas via
              pipeline to Thailand worth annually $1 billion to the Myanmar regime.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">In
              2005 China, Thailand and South Korea invested in expanding the Myanmar
              oil and gas sector, with export of gas to Thailand rising 50%. Gas
              export today is Myanmar’s most important source of income. Yadana was
              developed jointly by ElfTotal, Unocal, PTT-EP of Thailand and Myanmar’s
              state MOGE, operated by the French ElfTotal. Yadana supplies some 20%
              of Thai natural gas needs.  </p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Today
              the Yetagun field is operated by Malaysia’s Petronas along with MOGE
              and Japan’s Nippon Oil and PTT-EP. The gas is piped onshore where it
              links to the Yadana pipeline. Gas from the Shwe field is to come online
              beginning 2009. China and India have been in strong contention over
              the  Shwe gas field reserves.</p>
              <p class="Titel" style="text-align: left;"><strong>India loses, China wins</strong></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">This
              past summer Myanmar signed a Memorandum of Understanding with
              PetroChina to supply large volumes of natural gas from reserves of the
              Shwe gasfield in the Bay of Bengal. The contract runs for 30 years.
              India was the main loser. Myanmar had earlier given India a major stake
              in two offshore blocks to develop gas to have been transmitted via
              pipeline through Bangladesh to India’s energy-hungry economy. Political
              bickering between India and Bangladesh brought the Indian plans to a
              standstill.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">China
              took advantage of the stalemate. China simply trumped India with an
              offer to invest billions in building a strategic China-Myanmar oil and
              gas pipeline across Myanmar from Myanmar’s deepwater port at Sittwe in
              the Bay of Bengal to Kunming in China’s Yunnan Province, a stretch of
              more than 2,300 kilometers. China plans an oil refinery in Kumming as
              well.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">What
              the Myanmar-China pipelines will allow is routing of oil and gas from
              Africa (Sudan among other sources) and the Middle East (Iran, Saudi
              Arabia) independent of dependence on the vulnerable chokepoint of the
              Malacca Strait. Myanmar becomes China’s “bridge” linking Bangladesh and
              countries westward to the China mainland independent of any possible
              future moves by Washington to control the strait...</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>About 3,000 ethnic Karen villagers have reportedly fled from Burma into Thailand in recent days because of a new Burmese military offensive.</strong></p>
              <p>Aid groups say the refugees are from Ler Per Her camp in eastern Karen state, near where the Burmese army is reported to be attacking Karen rebels.</p>
              <p>It is thought to be one of the largest movements of refugees across the Thai-Burma border in a decade.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Burma still faces pressure to halt Aung San Suu Kyi's trial.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The pro-democracy leader is charged with breaching the terms of her house arrest, a charge that could leave her in jail for up to five years.</p>
              <p>Former Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited Burma on a "goodwill trip" on Monday, as international anger against the regime continued to mount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i saw the news clip notice that GCK took a RSAF plane to Myanmar?  can anyone confirm that?</p>

We don’t know details yet,” Nyan Win said. <br>He said the five did not include Aung San Suu Kyi, despite declaring earlier this week that any visit by Ban to Myanmar should include seeing the democracy icon. <br>Myanmar officials said Ban would meet Than Shwe in the remote administrative capital Naypyidaw today, as well as with members of 10 political parties including the NLD, before flying back to Yangon tomorrow. <br>The visit is Ban’s first to Myanmar since he came to urge the junta to accept international aid in the wake of devastating Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, which killed around 138,000 people. <br>Ban acknowledged this week that the latest trip was diplomatically risky</span></td>
