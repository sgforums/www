              <p>Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi went on trial Monday, as hundreds of riot police ringed the country's most notorious prison to block protesters from proceedings that could send her to jail for five years.</p>
              <p>Suu Kyi, who has already spend more than 13 of the last 19 years in detention, has been charged with violating the conditions of her house arrest by sheltering an American man who swam to her lakeside home to secretly visit her earlier this month.</p>

              <p>The death of Aung San Suu Kyi's father Aung San, Myanmars' independence leader had always been shrounded in secrey.</p>
              <p>Below are sources that push the view that it was the british who killed Aung San:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1><span>WHO KILLED AUNG SAN?</span></h1>
              <p>Q: Who do you think really killed Bogyoke Aung San?</p>
              <p>A: Who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>really killed Bogyoke Aung San was the British government.</strong></span> It
              was their plot.</p>
              <p>Q: Why do you say that?</p>
              <p>A: I suppose there were three reasons why he was killed.</p>
              <p>Firstly,
              Bogyoke <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aung San was the leader who could organise and unite the whole
              country so they were afraid of the whole of Burma uniting. </strong></span>This was the
              main reason.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Bogyoke <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aung San could reunite with the Communist Party of
              Burma. </strong></span>They were worried about that too.</p>
              <p>And finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they supposed
              that they could handle Burma more easily if they removed him.</strong></span></p>
              <p>These
              were the reasons why he was killed.</p>
              <p>I better give my opinions and some evidence why I say that the British
              were involved in this assassination.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First evidence
              From the very beginning, the British government had noticed that U Saw
              was conspiring something.</strong></span></p>
              <p>They even understood that these actions were
              aimed at Bogyoke. Regarding this fact I remember two things.
              First, before the assassination, U Saw’s house was kept under police
              surveillance. One of my relatives who was then a police officer, told
              me that he was on duty from a nearby house a week before the
              assassination. He said that they had to report their findings daily and
              thought surveillance had begun even before he was put on duty.</p>
              <p>The second thing is that during 1960’s or 1970’s on one Martyr’s Day
              anniversary, one of the Burmese newspapers published an article...</p>

              <p>The Americans won't bother if they do not see a financial interest in that particular country. If not they would have already be able to topple the junta and install a pro-western leader who will open the doors for western investments.</p>
              <p>For example in 1951, Dr. <span class="mw-redirect">Mohammed Mossadegh became PM in Iran. He nationalized Iran's oil reserves, earning the ire of US and UK. In 1953 he was toppled by US-backed riots and protests. He was replaced by Mohamed Reza Shah Pahlavi, who promptly restored the US and UK interests in Iranian Oil. Alot can be done by a lone man with a few million bucks, stir the pot, and there you have it, a coup!</span></p>
              <p>Read the book "The Confessions Of A Economic Hitman" by John Perkins. It will open eyes on how the "Great Game" is played.</p>

              <p><br>Arapahoe, just for discussion sake.</p>
              <p>The critical issue discussed here is democracy. Democracy for the Burmese people suffering under the repulsive Junta.</p>
              <p>I was once a flag waving idealist in support of democracy for the Burmese people, after some of the monks were shot dead and many tortured to death. I signed pettitions international and local in support of over throwing the regime in any form.</p>
              <p>But then one day i realise one important truth. Democracy is an ideal that can only be bestowed upon by the people themselves, and not given freely by others. The nation ( people) must want it, and want it badly enough collectively to SEEK every way possible to achieve it.</p>
              <p>Anything other than that will only lead to quagmires such as Vietnam and Iraq.</p>
              <p>The French had only pitchfork and farm utensils against the might of the despotic French Sun King Louis, and won. </p>
              <p>Russians adored Communism, but soon such tastes turned sour in the hands of Stalin. The people were repressed and ensured that they would never rebel.</p>
              <p>But in time, communist doctrines even failed the moderate politburo members and made them disillusion. Freedom came in the hands of Yeltsin.</p>
              <p>One way or another, freedom taste better if it comes from the hands of a nation's own people. Any other way is an open invitation to dictatorship as history had shown. We, as outsiders of nations involved, can only offer our moral support and use positive engagement to help Mynmar and its people.</p>
              <p>To isolate Mynmar is to make the resource rich country with rice that could feed the world and oil to fill every factory in China, turn to fellow despots such as N. Korea for support, and worse still if the Junta feels the rest of the world is oppressing them and turn to Osama and his gang for tech and military support.</p>
              <p>The critical issue, I repeat - Democracy can only be won by its own people, with the pen or the sword, and never in the history of mankind had it been won for the people by other nations that do not turn sour later.</p>
