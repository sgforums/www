              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>CAIRO, Egypt – Saudi Arabia's king says the <span id="lw_1227967853_0" class="yshortcuts">price of oil</span> should be $75 a barrel, much higher than it is now, but his oil
              minister indicated Saturday that no measures will likely be taken until
              <span id="lw_1227967853_1" class="yshortcuts">OPEC</span> meets again next month.</p>
              <p>Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said that the <span id="lw_1227967853_2" class="yshortcuts">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> will "do what needs to be done" to shore up falling <span id="lw_1227967853_3" class="yshortcuts">oil prices</span> when the group meets Dec. 17 in <span id="lw_1227967853_4" class="yshortcuts">Algeria</span>, but for now it was "too early."</p>
              <p>Other
              ministers at the hastily convened OPEC meeting in Cairo did not
              entirely rule out cuts, including Libyan oil official, Shokri Ghanem,
              who, ahead of the meeting, said "all options are open."</p>
              <p>But
              Naimi, whose country is the world's largest oil producer, said the bloc
              needs to wait until the Algeria meeting to assess the impact of earlier
              production cuts.</p>
              <p>Naimi's comments came after <span id="lw_1227967853_5" class="yshortcuts">Saudi King Abdullah</span> told the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyassah in an interview published Saturday that oil should be priced at $75 a barrel.</p>
              <p>"We believe the fair price for oil is $75 a barrel," he said, without saying how the price could be raised.</p>
              <p>The price of crude stood at about $147 a barrel in mid-July. On Friday, the U.S. benchmark <span id="lw_1227967853_6" class="yshortcuts">West Texas Intermediate crude</span> for January delivery was trading at about $54 per barrel.</p>
              <p>The
              king was echoed by Qatar's Oil Minister Abdullah Bin Hamad al-Attiya,
              who told the Arab news channel Al-Arabiya that prices needed to rise to
              guarantee investment into the oil sector.</p>
              <p>"The
              price between 70 to 80 (dollars a barrel) is the one encouraging in
              investment and developing new or current oil fields," he said. "It
              falls below 70 (dollars), the investment would freeze, which will lead
              to a crisis in supply in the future."</p>
              <p>Nigerian Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia also said they would be "very happy" with oil at $75.</p>
              <p>The
              cartel has already held an emergency meeting in Vienna on Oct. 24 to
              announce a production cut of 1.5 million barrels per day.</p>
              <p>The cut failed to stop the price drop, and the cartel abruptly convened the Cairo gathering on the sidelines of the <span id="lw_1227967853_7" class="yshortcuts">Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>' meeting.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1227967853_8" class="yshortcuts">Kuwait</span>'s oil minister, Mohammed al-Aleem, said he believes there is no need for <span id="lw_1227967853_9" class="yshortcuts">OPEC</span> to make a decision in Cairo on cutting output. But he warned the market
              is oversupplied, and didn't rule out the need for OPEC to cut
              production further.</p>
              <p>"We believe a decision could be taken ... but I think it will happen in <span id="lw_1227967853_10" class="yshortcuts">Algeria</span>," he said.</p>
              <p>Al-Aleem said current prices could undercut investment in future projects and were not good for either producers or consumers.</p>
              <p>The recent price drop has left OPEC price hawks Venezuela and <span id="lw_1227967853_11" class="yshortcuts">Iran</span> clamoring for further reductions of at least 1 million barrels a day.
              Both countries need crude at about $90 per barrel to meet spending
              needs aimed in part at propping up domestically unpopular regimes.</p>
              <p>Other
              OPEC members, such as Nigeria and Ecuador, face budget problems too,
              making them reluctant to implement more cuts that might shrink revenues
              further.</p>
              <p>The Saudis are better
              positioned to cope with the drop in prices. The International Monetary
              Fund estimates Riyadh needs crude in the range of about $50 per barrel
              for 2008 fiscal accounts to break even.</p>
              <p>The statements by the king, however, indicate that normally dovish <span id="lw_1227967853_12" class="yshortcuts">Saudi Arabia</span> is ready to see the price rise, indicating cuts will eventually take place.</p>
              <p>OPEC itself, along with the <span id="lw_1227967853_13" class="yshortcuts">International Energy Agency</span>, has significantly revised down its projections for demand growth in 2009.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, global crude inventories are growing, as evidenced by
              a U.S. government report showing a surprisingly large 7 million barrel
              build in stocks last week in the world's largest energy consumer.</p>
              <p>OPEC's last round of cuts would put its total production at
              about 30.5 million barrels per day, according to the IEA. That is about
              500,000 barrels per day higher than the forecast call on OPEC crude in
              much of 2009.</p>
              <p>A Nov. 24 New York-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co. research report
              says that for oil to rebound to $65 a barrel, OPEC would need to cut
              crude production by more than 3 million barrels per day from its
              September levels — a move it called highly unlikely.</p>

              <p>Or perhaps high oil prices are determined by the value of the USD, which has coincidentally fallen about 97% since the Fed was set up in 1913?</p>

              <p>CAIRO, Egypt – Saudi Arabia's king says the <span>price
              of oil</span> should be $75 a barrel, much higher than it is now,
              but his oil minister indicated Saturday that no measures will
              likely be taken until <span>OPEC</span> meets again next
              month.</p>
              <p>Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said that the <span>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> will "do
              what needs to be done" to shore up falling <span>oil
              prices</span> when the group meets Dec. 17 in <span>Algeria</span>, but for now it was "too early."</p>
              <p>Other ministers at the hastily convened OPEC meeting in Cairo
              did not entirely rule out cuts, including Libyan oil official,
              Shokri Ghanem, who, ahead of the meeting, said "all options are
              open."</p>
              <p>But Naimi, whose country is the world's largest oil producer,
              said the bloc needs to wait until the Algeria meeting to assess the
              impact of earlier production cuts.</p>
              <p>Naimi's comments came after <span>Saudi King
              Abdullah</span> told the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyassah in an
              interview published Saturday that oil should be priced at $75 a
              barrel.</p>
              <p>"We believe the fair price for oil is $75 a barrel," he said,
              without saying how the price could be raised.</p>
              <p>The price of crude stood at about $147 a barrel in mid-July. On
              Friday, the U.S. benchmark <span>West Texas Intermediate
              crude</span> for January delivery was trading at about $54 per
              barrel.</p>
              <p>The king was echoed by Qatar's Oil Minister Abdullah Bin Hamad
              al-Attiya, who told the Arab news channel Al-Arabiya that prices
              needed to rise to guarantee investment into the oil sector.</p>
              <p>"The price between 70 to 80 (dollars a barrel) is the one
              encouraging in investment and developing new or current oil
              fields," he said. "It falls below 70 (dollars), the investment
              would freeze, which will lead to a crisis in supply in the
              future."</p>
              <p>Nigerian Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia also said they would be
              "very happy" with oil at $75.</p>
              <p>The cartel has already held an emergency meeting in Vienna on
              Oct. 24 to announce a production cut of 1.5 million barrels per
              day.</p>
              <p>The cut failed to stop the price drop, and the cartel abruptly
              convened the Cairo gathering on the sidelines of the <span>Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>'
              meeting.</p>
              <p><span>Kuwait</span>'s oil minister, Mohammed al-Aleem,
              said he believes there is no need for <span>OPEC</span> to
              make a decision in Cairo on cutting output. But he warned the
              market is oversupplied, and didn't rule out the need for OPEC to
              cut production further.</p>
              <p>"We believe a decision could be taken ... but I think it will
              happen in <span>Algeria</span>," he said.</p>
              <p>Al-Aleem said current prices could undercut investment in future
              projects and were not good for either producers or consumers.</p>
              <p>The recent price drop has left OPEC price hawks Venezuela and
              <span>Iran</span> clamoring for further reductions of at
              least 1 million barrels a day. Both countries need crude at about
              $90 per barrel to meet spending needs aimed in part at propping up
              domestically unpopular regimes.</p>
              <p>Other OPEC members, such as Nigeria and Ecuador, face budget
              problems too, making them reluctant to implement more cuts that
              might shrink revenues further.</p>
              <p>The Saudis are better positioned to cope with the drop in
              prices. The International Monetary Fund estimates Riyadh needs
              crude in the range of about $50 per barrel for 2008 fiscal accounts
              to break even.</p>
              <p>The statements by the king, however, indicate that normally
              dovish <span>Saudi Arabia</span> is ready to see the price
              rise, indicating cuts will eventually take place.</p>
              <p>OPEC itself, along with the <span>International Energy
              Agency</span>, has significantly revised down its projections for
              demand growth in 2009.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, global crude inventories are growing, as evidenced by
              a U.S. government report showing a surprisingly large 7 million
              barrel build in stocks last week in the world's largest energy
              consumer.</p>
              <p>OPEC's last round of cuts would put its total production at
              about 30.5 million barrels per day, according to the IEA. That is
              about 500,000 barrels per day higher than the forecast call on OPEC
              crude in much of 2009.</p>
              <p>A Nov. 24 New York-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co. research report
              says that for oil to rebound to $65 a barrel, OPEC would need to
              cut crude production by more than 3 million barrels per day from
              its September levels — a move it called highly unlikely.</p>
