            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Fatum.<br><br>The lady got into the mess because she couldn't reconcile with her new status.  Once she lost her job, she should have quickly 'cut her losses' by adjusting her lifestyle accordingly.  In other words, she should have 'downsized'.  If she had a car, sell it off.  Living in a condominium?  Sell it off and live in an HDB apt instead.  Country club membership?  Sell that off.<br><br>Perhaps, she kept thinking that she'll find a good job 'tomorrow' and held on tight in wait.<br><br>And in the meantime, the bills just kept getting chalked up, the interest keeps accummulating.  And credit card interest is scary!  It's kinda like compounded interest!  Interest upon interest upon interest!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>The REAL poor are those mentioned by Fatum.  What you term the 'new breed of poor' are really just folks who used to live in an ivory tower, and who are now standing on ground level, and all they need to do, is to take action and stop dreaming of their glory days gone by.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>More credit card debtors than thought?<br><br>I REFER to the articles 'Emergence of 'New Poor' a worrying trend: Credit agency' (ST, Oct 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and 'How long can I hold off credit card debt repayments?' (ST, Oct 30).<br><br>In reply to a question in Parliament, it was said that 'as a whole, the number of credit card bankruptcies as a percentage of credit card users is extremely small, at less than 0.05 per cent'.<br><br>However, a more detailed look at the statistics is quite alarming.<br><br>According to the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office, there were 22,540 undischarged bankrupts as of end August this year.  What is the total number of undischarged and discharged bankrupts here? If the total is, say, 30,000, the number due to credit card debts, at 60 per cent of the total, is about 18,000.<br><br>According to a report in July last year by Visa International, 'Credit card use and debt in Singapore', there are about 800,000 eligible credit card holders, with an annual income of more than $30,000. This means about two out of every 100 eligible credit card holders is now or was bankrupt (18,000 divided by 800,000).<br><br>If a bankrupt has on average three family members, 72,000 people (18,000 x 4 people) may be affected by the inability to get credit to buy a house or a car for the rest of their lives.<br><br>This works out to be about two out of 100 population (72,000 divided by 4 million population), who may be in this predicament.<br><br>According to the Department of Statistics, Singapore's credit card debt in 2002 as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product at 1.4 was double that of Britain's 0.7. The credit card charge-off rate, defined as bad debts written off during the period divided by the average rollover balance for the period, rose by 31 per cent from 5.5 in 2002 to 7.2 in 2003.<br><br>The Visa International report also said the credit card default rate at the end of 2003 was under 4.3 per cent, and 62.1 per cent of total balances attracted interest.<br><br>With 3.7 million credit cards and 3.4 credit cards for every household in Singapore, this means about 150,000 credit cards are in default, and many Singaporeans are not managing their credit cards well and attracting interest at the typical rate of 24 per cent a year.<br><br>The 'extremely small' statistic on credit card bankruptcies in the first half of the year may be just the tip of the iceberg. There are about 30,000 people here who owe more than $20,000 on their credit cards, and three out of four have rolled over their debt in a 12-month period.<br><br>How many more Singaporeans have to be made bankrupt due to credit card debts before we no longer say 'the number of credit card bankruptcies as a percentage of credit card users is extremely small'?<br><br>Leong Sze Hian<br></div>
