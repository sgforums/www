Do you know that they are paid high because we want to incentivise and motivate our leaders to perform at world-class levels of competence.

            <div class='col-md body'>As a forumer, my presence here is to give my views objectively as I see it. The problem is : government people are propagating their views here in the shallow.<br><br>We are already suffering from economic stagnation due to a lack of really good competitive economic strategy.<br><br>Many problems e.g. lack of entrepreneurs, high costs of living and class divisions were created by over-simplistic or over-pragmatic past policies. Government views are being propagated to emphasise on many unworkable past policies in this forum as well.<br><br>Forumers are pressured by pro-establishment views and some become confused. We will need to stay alert and counter these establishment views and examine them even more closely.<br><br>Their views on casino are very one-sided like the meritocracy education and non-welfarism policies which will continue to cause many problems. The view of the government that "without casino, we will be worse off" is too shallow and not correct.<br><br>If government wants to give their views to support casino here by all means. But personally, I believe that the government views about casino are incorrect and too biased. All forumers should stay collective and alert and try to formulate new thinking and something valuable without feeling pressurd by views to please government. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Selling toliet bowls in the internet ? Or....... selling drugs in the internet ?<br><br>Every ideas is use. And government want to earn everything. Then by putting a few more English word. They tell you. You got no talent ? Got to be kidding me.<br><br>Anyway, Just look at all the supermarket. It's the end I say. You cannot even open a shop in Singapore. At least one million dollars. if you got one million dollars why not just retired and just invest in some fund, stockmarket. Sit back relax at home. Right ? Singapore Singapore Singapore.

And dragg, : STFU is not the same as saying "If you really care, get into politics". The former is an expression of very strong disagreement  with what is being said, and a strong expression of aversion to hearing/seeing more. The latter, while arguably carrying the same meanings, also imo  carries with the implication that only those within your meaning of being in politics really care about the country.
