              <p>Singapore had gone thru different status of economy, from low cost industries, like making brush, pens, shampoos, to high tech industries like Computer chips, wafer fab, oil rig buidling, bio science, pharmacy etc etc, to a knowledge economy on financial, services, etc etc and today, a global economy. All along we are at the forefront of others, our govt is good in pre emptive measure to see the outcome, LKY is like a fortune teller in term of foreseening the future. Our govt study indept into the appropriate outcome of our society and economy, from here, they make policies to make us ready for the anticipated outcome. We are typically in a global knowledge economy, if you are still pondering around with beggar and low wage NTS workers, you had missed the bus to glory completely.</p>
              <p>Govt provided millions into education and skill upgrading, making education a must for all ages thru many initiatives that make the cost of education afforadable or for senior citizens, it can be free.</p>
              <p>At a lowest unemployment rate of today, if you are telling me, as a singaporeans,  you are out of job, my only concern is that you simply refuse to work, because you hate this, you hate that, you dun like this and dun like that and as time goes by not having job, sit in the room think think and think until maddness set in. Set your mind free, be gracious to accept, forgive and forget, get a job and life will be better with less stupid hallucinating thinking.</p>

              <p>In which group of representation you think you are for in claiming the blessing for all?  The lowest income group? Those got retrenched at 40s but cannot find job and yet a whole family to feed? Those old and sick but can only choose death as the option?  Or those who live in bungalow, condo, terrace, drive big car and 2 to 3 cars parked at home at the sametime?  No single meals cost less then $50? </p>
              <p>So which group you are representing?  No one here are qualified to tell others what is right and what is wrong because of the social divide, in case you dont know why?  So stop your nonsense in telling others to be blessed, thank your GOV and etc.</p>
              <p>There will always a group that support the PAP (and another minority hopless narrowminded BAST**D who call others traitor and etc for not supporting PAP).  There will also be another group that support the opposition.  And not forgetting a growing group of "NO CONFIDENCE" Voters... Who might void or cast to show anger only.</p>

              <p>Inequality happen everywhere, you can never seek a fairness in all thing, even the communist cannot survive a fairness world, so dun talk about other wealth and poor condition. A man had to have his own bread and butter, his own way of earning a living and certainly his own way happiness. Govt can provide only the resources such as training, set the conditions, the environment, laws and orders to help citizens in the lower category. There should not be a spoonfeeding society that ultimately destroy a man egos and fighting spirit.</p>
              <p>Frankly, is there people in singapore hunger to dead, no house to live in, no cloth to wear, no school to go to, no training to go to, no help to go to...i do not think so, govt had created so much insitutions that help both the lower group which consist of ony 20% to higher than paid thru upgrading and placement of job. But sad to said, many are not forthcoming, so if you dun help yourself, no body can help you. Having said all, I am no PAP, but certainly thru my little years of experiences in travelling and learning journey, I have no doubt, that Singapore govt had done a fine enough job, tho not perfect, but much better than others.</p>
