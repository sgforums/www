            <div class='col-md body'>I was so disappointed that WP lost Aljunied that I couldn't eat for 2 days. The team is powerpack and I suspect the relentless bad press on JGomez has achieve it's effect.<br><br>I was thinking that the result might have a bit different is JGomez has been tasked to lead another power packed team with Brandon Siow replacing him in Sylvia's team. I'm saying this not because of the JGomez bad press but JGomez is really a political heavyweight. No point putting all the eggs in one basket. He should lead another team.<br><br>Here's a few suggestion for the WP for the next 5 years...<br><br>1) Make your presence stronger!<br><br>A rebranding excercise would give WP some good publicity. Besides, I think WP should refresh their branding with a cleaner and younger look. The current blue color tone doesn't bode well with the younger generations. I think what they wore (RSAF's light bue) is very nice.<br><br>2) Reach out to the other wards!<br><br>Start setting up 'help centers' in other wards. Residents in PP and HG knows how much efforts the WP and SDA puts in. Unfortunately, the other PAP stronghold doesn't have a clue (as evident in the numerous discucssion in other threads).<br><br>They should be aggressive. Start low-cost tutition centers or help centers to reach out to a wider crowd. Start a volunteer movement to help the less privilege under WP branding.<br><br>3) Publicity, publicity, publicity!<br><br>Let the whole know... information like Chiam upgrading lifts in PP using it's own funds and without having the resident pay for it put the ruling party to shame. This are the information that Singaporeans needs to hear to know that the opposition party are working harder and more sincere for them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by anonymouscoward:</div><div class="quote_body">I was so disappointed that WP lost Aljunied that I couldn't eat for 2 days. The team is powerpack and I suspect the relentless bad press on JGomez has achieve it's effect.<br><br>I was thinking that the result might have a bit different is JGomez has been tasked to lead another power packed team with Brandon Siow replacing him in Sylvia's team. I'm saying this not because of the JGomez bad press but JGomez is really a political heavyweight. No point putting all the eggs in one basket. He should lead another team.<br><br>Here's a few suggestion for the WP for the next 5 years...<br><br>1) Make your presence stronger!<br><br>A rebranding excercise would give WP some good publicity. Besides, I think WP should refresh their branding with a cleaner and younger look. The current blue color tone doesn't bode well with the younger generations. I think what they wore (RSAF's light bue) is very nice.<br><br>2) Reach out to the other wards!<br><br>Start setting up 'help centers' in other wards. Residents in PP and HG knows how much efforts the WP and SDA puts in. Unfortunately, the other PAP stronghold doesn't have a clue (as evident in the numerous discucssion in other threads).<br><br>They should be aggressive. Start low-cost tutition centers or help centers to reach out to a wider crowd. Start a volunteer movement to help the less privilege under WP branding.<br><br>3) Publicity, publicity, publicity!<br><br>Let the whole know... information like Chiam upgrading lifts in PP using it's own funds and without having the resident pay for it put the ruling party to shame. This are the information that Singaporeans needs to hear to know that the opposition party are working harder and more sincere for them.</div></blockquote>What if JG had bee nfielded in AMK instead? Would LHL's margin be even lower?</div>
