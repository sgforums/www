            <div class='col-md body'>For the first time in 3 elections, a credible party emerged from the shadows, silent and bidding, and when they sprang up suddenly, created enough panic that even 'lao jiaos' like Goh CT and Lee HL fumbled with their campaign speeches.<br><br>The threat of the WP must have been so enormous that for once there was genuine fear that 1 GRC might fall. And not just fall, concede to a party which may just have the quality and goods to deliver a better town council, better hope and a better future for the people.<br><br>So fearful that the Ruling Party absolutely lost all focus in their original campaign agenda, or maybe they never had a solid one to begin with,  that they concentrated their tried and trusted tactic of character assassination on James Gomez, hoping to sink the fast-riding WP ship with the speed of the titanic.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, it may have backfired; the people are wiser now, less gullible and more educated. Piecing together snippets of a CCTV and CNA footage and drawing a speculative conculsion was hardly detective's work. There was less malice in James Gomez's foolish blunder than JBJ's criminal accusation at MM Lee in the 98 election.<br><br>What price has the Ruling Party paid this time?<br><br>The 7% increase in Low Thia Khiang's SMC indicates a strong REJECTION of SGD100mil worth of taxpayer's goodies, and a firm rejection of the despicable methods to 'buy' hougang voters. Eric Low's character hardly endears him to the constituents. And Low Thia Khiang's firm assertion that the upgrading money was in fact the people's monies being used unscrupulously for one party's gain; it brings back sad comparisions to the NKF saga.<br><br>I'm glad aljunied showed strong support for Sylvia Lim and her team, even if she missed the 7% cut needed to win majority.<br><br>Our people are slowly maturing into a society with higher moral standards and gracious ethics.<br><br>Sadly, it is predominant only in <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">OPPOSITION</span></strong></span> wards, where the people that matter have truly <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">EARNED</span></strong></span> their votes.<br><br></div>

Singapore Inc is not just about economics but there is a social side to it too.<br><br>Sometimes, there are concerns behind the issues so solving the issue is not a direct solution. We have an issue with cost of living, the actual concerns is that when we get old we may not have enough savings to live/retire gracefully.<br><br>Nonetheless, we are all Singaporeans. Whichever party we supported during this election should not translate to a riff.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Although the Opposition Parties - especially WP, SDA and SDP - have lost, they have struck the imagination of Singaporeans that there are SINGAPOREANS with TALENTS that remain to be found - which the PAP continuously insist that it is lacking in this tiny Red Dot.<br><br>This fact was even admitted OBLIQUELY by LHL in his Sunday victory speech - telecasted over CNA - in which he said that "the Ruling Party and the Opposition Parties <strong>MAY NOT</strong> have all the solutions to the problems encountered, but with the 'BRAINS and TALENTS' <strong><span style="color: red;">put together</span></strong>, we can work to find solutions for Singaporeans ".<br><br>This was the best ever STATESMAN-LIKE speech that I have heard LHL made since he entered politics; and for once I thought he has matured and moved away from the coat-tails and shadow of his Father.<br><br>It is sad that by Sunday evening, news broke out of the arrest of James Gomez, and Sylvia Lim being called to the Police Cantonment for questioning.<br><br>Can Singapore move on to be First World status, with First World Politicians forming a First World Government ?<br><br>The WP and SDA have both shown their abilities to conduct POLITICS as First World Politicians, in a clean and well managed election campaigns.<br><br>It was simply shameful to watch the self-proclaimed First World Citizens from the incumbent PAP conducting their political campaign in their characteristic 'riff-raff' bullying way that typifies the unsophisticated political gangsterism that they claimed from CSJ and SDP.<br><br>Singaporeans have matured, the WP and SDA will be able to speak with open honesty and Singaporeans will listen, and in the next Election, more will move with their ballot papers if the last FIVE YEARS are repeated from this day on.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually the 66.6% won by PAP is a 'fake' result.
