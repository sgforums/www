              <p>Work in general is effort make by an individual to make something move or get it done. You do charity work, do an exercise workout, you can also work happily with your children on household chores etc etc, it does not imply that you will get paid. In fact, work is done when something move.</p>
              <p>In this context, LKY can alway twist around his statement, saying, C'mon, Singaporeans, I said you should workout to keep healthy till death, whatever you work at, be it paid or no pay, it is all up to you. But if you dun work, you become weak both physically and mentally, that will not only cost you difficulties in life, but also lot of medical attention that can burden you and your family.</p>

              <p><br>16% or formerly 20% of your CPF is contributed by EMPLOYERS, and it is the governing law set up by our govt that employers must contribute this 16%, I paid 15.5% CPF for my employees, and employee paid 20% of their salary into CPF, now you know why govt have a certain said over CPF, by and large, if that contribution is totally from employees, under the banking rights, than govt will have nothing to control over it, but because of govt intervention by asking Employer to compulsory contribute CPF for their employees, it show that an individual CPF is partially from employers contribution, and that is why govt have the authority to withhold it.

              <p>And got one local Chinese movies actually indirectly mock at Malaysia Mahathir was wrong to retire,the Ah Long boss in the movie should learn from LKY dont retire at all.Well,the local public are actually laughing n cursing LKY of his stupidity,not Mahathir.</p>

              <p>If you want to reply to my post you better wake up your bloody idea and read my statement clearly.</p>
              <p>Dont make a fool of yourselve by shooting like a whore?  Did your post reply to what I'd state?  Answer is a BIG NO!!</p>
              <p>Think you only the one in the world know the rule of CPF and employer part of contribution?</p>
              <p>Also your post is nothing but just another nonsense and an argument of your dumb mindset.  You really think when the rule of employer contribution of CPF part is an additional when it first introduced?  Not adjusting employess part of the salary to compensate?  Tax cut in return for employer?  You never file company tax before??</p>
              <p>What were the reason of CPF restriction control given by the government? </p>
              <p>You and your stupid argument.  As said before, 99% of yours is talking cork and you shouldnt be alive in this forum.</p>
              <p>You make your mark in here for achieving the whore attention from forumers.  That's your goal right?</p>

Nothing, just twisting here and there, as my outside kopi tiam teochew ah pek use to say in teochew, which i also get to know and learned, he said govt and singaporeans are like this, wherever there is cool and windy, they will sit there.</p></div>
