If you multiply the US$137,735.7 by the exchange rate US$1 = SG$ 1.51, you get the SG$208,202.1 in "Gold and Foreign Exchange" which means that the majority of our reserves in "Gold and Foreign Exchange" is in US dollars (which might include US treasury bills, US bond, US equities, etc).<br><br>The annual report from MAS states "Gold and [b]Foreign Exchange</strong>" at SG$208 billions, if it was held in other currencies, then you won't get a perfect exchange rate figure of US$1 = SG$1.51 when you divide SG$208,202.1 by US$137,735.7.<br><br>Do the maths and tell me the answer.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote>As you can see, this dick head M13 is trying to twist and turn facts again.<br><br>This is what he posted earlier.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our US$ reserves held by MAS stood at US$ 138 billion </strong></span> as on March 2007.
