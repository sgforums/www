            <div class='col-md body'>u can say i am licking the boots of MIW.<br><br>Pl read first  and talk later .SG has cooled down property market<br>in May 1996 ,well before 1997 crisis and shot few warning shots<br>recently before sub prime loan troubles.<br><br>In this internet era,no need to meet the Master in Chinese<br>temple to consult the important policy,just<br>use SMS lah!!<br><br>Sometimes,u has to believe Singapore old and new gurards<br>have crystals balls in their safes!!<br><br><blockquote>....14. This year, we have already had several reminders of the risks in the system. The Chinese stock market has experienced a few incidents of volatility following expectations of and actual government action. It remains vulnerable to further corrections. In the US, the sub-prime market has imploded. More recently, US treasuries have come under severe selling pressure, causing interest rates to rise and generating unease in stock markets.<br><br>15. Nevertheless, the financial system has been resilient so far. Have we learnt our lessons from past crises and are now better prepared? Or are we just plain lucky? Whichever the answer, we should remain vigilant.<br><br>16. As bankers, you will be familiar with the saying that bad loans are made in good times. This saying is particularly worth repeating when the environment appears rosy and serves as a reminder that vigilance is our constant responsibility.<strong> With this in mind, MAS initiated a survey of risk managers and traders, many of whom are based in Singapore, about their key risk concerns. This poll was conducted between April and June this year. A roundtable discussion was also held with risk managers. Let me now share with you some of the findings from this survey.<br>17. The feedback received was open and honest and many views were shared. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most respondents believed that asset prices were frothy and that a big shock could happen. Some speculated that this could happen before the end of 2008.</span></strong><br>In this age of increased connectivity and correlation of markets, respondents felt that a shock event such as a terrorist attack, pandemic or geopolitical instability could cause market disruptions.<br><br>18. Respondents also highlighted the current liquidity in the financial markets. They observed that speculative liquidity was circulating in the financial system. This has led to historically unprecedented pricing and terms. When referring to the new players in the financial markets, respondents spoke of hedge funds and private equity in the same breath as Â“highly leveragedÂ”, Â“covenant-lite structuresÂ” and Â“large speculative positionsÂ”. In the current low interest rate environment, many yield-hungry investors have become hedge providers for institutions. Respondents expressed concern about the systemic risks such providers posed and their default risk in a severe market correction.<br><br>19. In summary, the responses to the survey indicated that there seems to be a heightened level of risk in the macroeconomic and financial environment. Nevertheless, these responses are encouraging from another perspective. They indicate that financial institutions are aware of this heightened level of risk. With acceptance comes preparedness for the risks that may materialize in future.<br><br>20. It is important for banks not to become complacent. As banks pursue the many opportunities that lie ahead, we must not let our guard down. Banks must not be lulled into a false sense of security by the external environmentÂ’s bullishness and resilience to shocks so far. We must not allow ourselves to get over-confident with our knowledge and analyses of the risks out there. Risks may deviate from expectations. Situations may take unexpected turns. In the face of such uncertainties, being prepared and ready is always a good proposition.....</blockquote>----(A)<strong><a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/news_room/statements/2007/Address_by_Mr_Lim_Hng_Kiang_MTI_and_DC_MAS_at_ABS_Annual_Dinner_2007.html" rel="nofollow">Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Trade &amp; Industry and Deputy Chairman, Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the ABS Annual Dinner<br>on 29 June 2007,</a></strong><br><br>(B)--<strong><a href="http://www.gic.com.sg/aboutus_mgtteam.htm" rel="nofollow"> DIRECTORS<br>4.

            <div class='col-md body'>duny rely on western ratings so much.<br><br>What would u feel if u read in Dec 2006:<br><blockquote>The Aa3/P-1 debt and deposit ratings are based on IKB's 38% ownership by German<br>state-owned bank Kredinanstalt fÃ¼r Wiederaufbau (KfW; rated Aaa/P-1) and the<br>cooperation of both banks in government-sponsored loan programmes. In our opinion,<br>these close ties with KfW result in a moderate degree of implicit support for IKB....<br><br>Franchise And Strategy<br>STRONG FRANCHISE BASED ON SOLID POSITION AS LONG-TERM LENDER TO THE GERMAN MITTELSTAND...<br><br>LEADING POSITION IS SUPPORTED BY DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET AND EXTENSIVE PRODUCT<br>KNOW-HOW....<br><br>STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH KFW HAS LED TO STRONGER CO-OPERATION AND ALSO RESULTS IN<br>MODERATE DEGREE OF IMPLICIT SUPPORT..<br><br>Â…EXTENSIVE USE OF COLLATERALÂ…<br>Over recent years, IKB has increased its asset investments (mainly in the syndicated loan market) in the international<br>arena, primarily in the UK, France and the USA, and around a third of IKB's total loan book is now non-domestic.<br>We welcome this geographic diversification and the good returns of this portfolio (close to half of IKB's operating<br>profit comes from international business), since it makes IKB's revenues and risk profile less dependent on the performance<br>of the German economy. The quality of the non-domestic portfolio is sound as well. While a few years ago a<br>part of this international portfolio was in the non-investment grade rating range, the bulk of the international exposure<br>is now solidly of investment-grade quality. The bank's exposure to non-industrialised countries is predominately<br>secured by the extensive use of Hermes insurance.</blockquote>--<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.ikb.de/content/de/ir/fixed_income/rating/rating_moodys.pdf" rel="nofollow">rating_moodys.pdf</a></strong><br><br>2.Conservative estimate IKB will lost Euro 3.6 billion in sub prime<br>troubles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think our Andrew Yap in sgForums is smarter than the Ministers, he managed to predict accurately the date (afew days accuracy) of the crisis and sold off his stock before he got burnt.<br><br>I think anybody who has a knack for economics could have predicted that something is wrong with trade between China and US. I predicted the crisis would happen within this year or early next year, but I could not be certain of the date. There were quite afew prominent economist who predicted some kind of crisis this year too, my guess is, these Ministers must have read some article by these prominent economist and just plagiarize their works.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If our Minister's truly anticipated the risk, then they would have divested from the US$ holdings way before the crisis. The injection of money from the Feds would mean an increase in the money supply leading to inflation and depreciation of the US$ against other currencies.<br><br><a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/resource/publications/annual_reports/MAS_AR2062007.pdf" rel="nofollow">Our US$ reserves held by MAS stood at US$ 138 billion as on March 2007.</a> FYI, US is one of Singapore's major trading partners, what better currency to hold than US$.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/MAS_AR2062007103.png"><br><br>Sometimes, when it rains, there is lightning, a simpleton will awe at it's magnificence, "wow! lightning! so wonderful!". But a scientist will tell you it's the result of static charge forming in the clouds.

If you multiply the US$137,735.7 by the exchange rate US$1 = SG$ 1.51, you get the SG$208,202.1 in "Gold and Foreign Exchange" which means that the majority of our reserves in "Gold and Foreign Exchange" is in US dollars (which might include US treasury bills, US bond, US equities, etc).<br><br>The annual report from MAS states "Gold and <strong>Foreign Exchange</strong>" at SG$208 billions, if it was held in other currencies, then you won't get a perfect exchange rate figure of US$1 = SG$1.51 when you divide SG$208,202.1 by US$137,735.7.<br><br>Do the maths and tell me the answer.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/MAS_AR2062007103.png"><br></div>
