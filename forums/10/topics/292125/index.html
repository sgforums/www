May I ask him what is his definition of "subsistence living"? Am I correct to say that, out of $260 per month for PA recipients, $100 goes to rental, power supply and S&amp;C and leaving them with only $5 a day to live on? Am I correct to say that any basic meal in any hawker centre is already $2.50 to $3.00 per meal? Therefore, is it too much to ask for just three meals a day as an entitlement for the PA recipients?<br><br><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:<br><br>How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?<br><br>Transcript taken from :<br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages?msg=139060.1" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages?msg=139060.1</a></div>
