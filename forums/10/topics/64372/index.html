            <div class='col-md body'>A TVD article for HR Day. For those who have not voted in the Mini-<br>Star Awards, hurry on down to our site to cast your<br>votes!! At the rate the Awards are going, the Hen will beour next DPM!<br>------<br>Tribute to a Local Net Legend -- Sintercom Founder, Mr Tan Chong Kee<br><br>This afternoon (Saturday) a local Net legend will be speaking in a<br>NUS political science forum on "Cyberspace and the New Politics". The<br>legend is none other than the founder of Sintercom, Mr Tan Chong Kee<br>(TCK). In an age where Net guerillas prefer to abide by the cover of<br>anonymity (us TVD crew included), TCK and his crew bravely placed<br>themselves on the magnifying glass of the ruling regime with a true<br>blue open Internet set-up, Sintercom. In many ways, Sintercom was the<br>pioneer civil society website, who can forget its classic Not the<br>Straits Time section? Forum letters "mysteriously" rejected by ST<br>found a voice, a means of expression in Sintercom. Other than the<br>premier wacky and politically inclined newsgroup,<br>soc.culture.singapore, of which TCK was also an integral founding<br>regular, the next forum to chart out and carve a Singaporean<br>cyberspace was the wildly popular Sintercom forum. Of course, we<br>later had the equally trend-setting Sex Forum run by Sammyboy, the<br>civic-minded Think centre and the funniest satirical website<br>Talkingcock as well. These are the pioneers of local cyberspace. It<br>is unfortunate that a few of the local websites today do not share<br>the camaraderie and open spirit of sharing which founding sites like<br>Sintercom promote; for example, our TVD crew have been "unofficially"<br>banned by FunkyGrad and Sgboyx for very mystifying reasons still. But<br>we are grateful for sites like Sammyboy, Sgforums, SPUG which<br>tolerate our existence and who help us spread the Voice of the<br>Singapore Net-gen. It is essential for a culture of open-ness to<br>prevail so that we fall not into a conditioned response of self<br>censorship. This was what participating in the early Sintercom forum<br>meant for a few of our TVD crew, a growing confidence that we can<br>speak and publish without censorship and which inspired our little<br>website as well.<br><br>For those singaporeans new to Singapore cyberspace, it would also do<br>well to remind newbies about a tragic piece of Singapore history; in<br>the last GE, a slew of draconian Internet regulations eventually<br>forced TCK to disband Sintercom, but not without a symbolic act of in-<br>your-face panache by TCK. Forced by SBA to register itself as a<br>political website, TCK amiably agreed to registration but immediately<br>announced the closure of Sintercom following registration. This was<br>by no means capitulation, I dare say, but an act of defiance against<br>the system of governance forced upon him. Sintercom exists today<br>still, in fragmented underground form as a Geocities website and a<br>Delphiforums discussion forum. The spirit of Sintercom has been ably<br>carried forward by diehard supporters. It is a testament of the<br>spirit of Internet politics.<br><br>TVD crew hopes that TCK will continue to promote a spirit of Internet<br>civic activism. We are sure that he will touch on Singapore Net<br>topics fearlessly as he had guided sintercom fearlessly during his<br>tenure. Unfortunately, this NUS forum is by invitation only but we<br>hope eventually to be able to publish TCK's piece as a reminder of<br>our roots and where we TVD Net wannabes came from.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Lau Ah Pek<br>11.12.03<br><br></div>
