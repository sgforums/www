            <div class='col-md body'><p>Albert Winsemius<br><br>By Ong, Christopher written on 2009-02-11<br>National Library Board Singapore<br><br>Comments on article: InfopediaTalk <br><br><br>Dutch economist Albert Winsemius (Dr) (b.1910, Netherlands d. 1996, The Hague, Netherlands) was an economic advisor to the Singapore government for almost 25 years. During that time, he contributed greatly to Singapore's economic development. He was given several monikers by the local newspapers, such as "Singapore's Dutch Uncle", the "Republic's economic guru", the "Dutchman behind Singapore Inc", and the "Father of Jurong".<br><br>Early Life <br>Born in 1910 to a father in the cheese wholesale business, the young Winsemius soon became involved in the cheese industry, working as a cheese maker after school each day. However, the teenager soon realised, in his own words that, "working with your hands usually doesn't pay too well", and moved on to being a cheese salesman. Later, Winsemius decided he needed a university education, and at the age of 26, applied to Leyden University to do law as he thought that it was the easiest subject. However, he discovered he had to pass an examination in Latin, and skipped it, and thus failed to meet the entry criteria. He then applied for Delft University but was rejected because he was found lacking in his secondary school mathematics. Finally, he applied to Rotterdam University. At the time, in order to make ends meet, Winsemius had a job in The Hague, Netherlands, and so he told the dean of Rotterdam University that he would not be able to attend lectures. Despite having his own reservations, the dean allowed Winsemius to enrol in the school. The rest is history as Winsemius went on to become a leading economist.<br><br>One of his first jobs upon graduation just before the advent of World War II, was to be the price controller for the Netherlands. His main role was to freeze prices during food shortages. He remained in the job until 1943. After the war, he worked at the Ministry of Finance as the country's director-general of industrial development. There, his role was to repair the economy, which had been damaged by the war. From time to time, he also carried out assignments on behalf of the World Bank. Thus, he began to build his growing reputation as an expert in the field of Developmental Economics.  <br>    <br>Contributions to the Republic <br>In 1960, a year after Singapore gained its independence, Winsemius was asked by the United Nations to visit Singapore as part of the United Nations Development Programme team. They were tasked with conducting a survey to assess the Republic's potential for industrialisation. Winsemius arrived on 5 October 1960, and made his first report to the Singapore government the following year, advising them that Singapore's success was dependent on the elimination of Communism. He also suggested that the statue of Sir Stamford Raffles remain. In a tribute penned by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew after Winsemius's death, he wrote "... investors wanted to see what the new socialist government in Singapore was going to do to the statue of Raffles. Letting it (the statue) remain would be a symbol of public acceptance of the legacy of the British and could have a positive effect". <br><br>Thereafter, Winsemius became the Chief economic advisor to the Singapore government in 1961-1984. He worked closely with Singapore's first generation leaders including Lee, Dr Goh Keng Swee, and Mr Hon Sui Sen. He would visit twice yearly during his term as an economic advisor, about 3 weeks each time, and would also get regular reports from the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Trade and Industry. Winsemius was called upon again in 1965 when the economy suffered from the aftermath of Singapore's separation from Malaya, as well as from Malaya's confrontation with Indonesia from 1963 to 1965. During that time, he recommended Singapore to re-open barter trade with Indonesia, and to share a common market with Malaysia. However, the latter proved to be implausible. He also advised that Singapore should look to get more investment from abroad, and improved its ties with the West so that it would have access to their markets. <br><br>His advice on industrialisation saw the emergence of high-technological industries such as the production of electrical components by the end of the 1960s. Another significant landmark in Singapores industrialisation history was the construction of the industrial town of Jurong. In 1970, Winsemius then envisioned the next lap for a newly industrialized Singapore; that the Republic would be a fully developed industrialized nation within 6-8 years and should hence start preparations for making inroads into exporting brain services. Thus, he advised the government to invest money in a new university or technical institute, instead of using governmental funds to build more factories. <br><br>Winsemius played the role of advisor for nearly 25 years until December 1983. He was credited for Singapore's establishment as an air and sea transport hub, and the development of Singapore's public housing and the financial sector. For his contributions, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal in 1967, and in 1976, was bestowed the National Trades Union Congress' highest award, the May Day Gold Medal of Honour. In 1970, the then-University of Singapore also awarded him with an honorary degree. In 1997, he was posthumously honoured with the establishment of an Albert Winsemius Professorship at Nanyang Technological University. <br><br>Winsemius died of pneumonia on 4 December 1996. He passed away in  the Hague, the Netherlands. He was 86 years old then. He is survived by his wife, 2 daughters, a son and 8 grandchildren. <br><br>Family <br>Wife: Aly Winsemius-Schreiber <br>He had two daughters and a son. One of his daughters, Ankie Averink, worked for the United Nations. She was once called upon to decipher his handwriting for the survey report that he did on Singapore in 1961. <br><br><br><br>Author <br>Christopher Ong <br></p></div>

              <p><br>Yes, at that time when we are not born, there was no economist or even toto and even a recognised University, a ang mo come in from nowhere and sure we embrace him, cos that time ang mo big ma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of these ang mos are outcasted by their own country, they cannot even find a job in their literated country, so they come to the far east to earn a living by doing some conning, some unlucky become beggar, some lucky become national icon. Heng heng this Mr. Albert got it right because at that time, most of our forefather or the govt are all gong gong mountain tortoise. If now you call an economist from Dutch to come here, i think we more worry about swine flu than his advices. Now, we also got economist, in this forum, u can see alots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just like Japan after the world, a guy by the name of Edward Deming, who was a drop out and not even recognise in Europe came in and helped japan on productivity,..now there every year there is an award under his name for best japan productive company,individual and groups. But now japan slowly move out of it shell and start to think out of the box</p>
