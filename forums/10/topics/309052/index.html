Two of her trading companies, Golden Aaron and S H Ng Trading, are based in an office block at Shenton Way. <br><br>The US sanctions ban Americans from doing business with blacklisted companies and designated individuals. The US government also seeks to freeze any assets that these blacklisted companies may have under US jurisdiction. <br><br>Apart from his "critical support" for the military junta, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also accused Mr Tun of being part of a drug empire his father, Mr Lo Hsing Han — dubbed the "Godfather of Heroin" by OFAC — had set up in the early 1970s. Mr Tun is also one of the wealthiest individuals in Myanmar, added the OFAC. <br><br>The OFAC named the three individuals yesterday under additional economic sanctions that were announced in the wake of the junta's crackdown against monk-led protests late last year. <br><br>When Today visited Ms Ng's Shenton Way office premises yesterday, an employee said her employer and Mr Tun were both overseas. The employee said she was aware that her company was blacklisted. <br><br>In December 2004, Golden Aaron made the news here when the small firm clinched a energy exploration deal to explore the coast off Myanmar with two other non- Singaporean companies. <br><br>A check with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority showed that the company, set up in October 1995, has a paid-up capital of $5 million. The other shareholder was listed as a Mr Lo Ping Zhong, one of the many alias that, according to the OFAC, Mr Tun apparently uses. <br><br>Earlier this month, the United States also sanctioned Myanmar national and Singapore Permanent Resident U Kyaw Thein, 60, as among those linked to Tay Za, the junta's alleged "henchman". <br><br>Two companies, with offices here, and a Singaporean company, Pavo Aircraft Leasing, were also named in the sanctions. <br><br>Singapore and its banks have been previously pressured by the United States to cut financial ties with the junta. <br><br>When contacted, a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) spokesperson said that "banks and financial institutions in Singapore are required to institute strict procedures". "Should there be links with illicit activity, MAS will not hesitate to take necessary action," the spokesperson said. <br><br>The Ministry of Home Affairs told Today that the Central Narcotics Bureau has not received any information that "a Singapore company has been targeted under US sanctions against Myanmar for involvement in illicit drug trade". <br><br>The ministry said that any "credible information received on suspected drug trafficking by persons in Singapore will be thoroughly investigated and offenders prosecuted". - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">TODAY</span></a><span>/sh</span></p>

              <p><span class=""><span>A Singaporean woman and her husband, who is
              allegedly the son of a drug lord, have entered the United States'
              blacklist for "providing support" to Myanmar's ruling junta.<br>
              <br>
              Ms Cecilia Ng Sor Hong, the wife of Myanmar national Tun Myint
              Naing, also known as Steven Law, owns 10 companies here â€” all of
              which will be affected by US trade sanctions. Two of her trading
              companies, Golden Aaron and S H Ng Trading, are based in an office
              block at Shenton Way.<br>
              <br>
              The US sanctions ban Americans from doing business with blacklisted
              companies and designated individuals. The US government also seeks
              to freeze any assets that these blacklisted companies may have
              under US jurisdiction.<br>
              <br>
              Apart from his "critical support" for the military junta, the US
              Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also
              accused Mr Tun of being part of a drug empire his father, Mr Lo
              Hsing Han â€” dubbed the "Godfather of Heroin" by OFAC â€” had set up
              in the early 1970s. Mr Tun is also one of the wealthiest
              individuals in Myanmar, added the OFAC.<br>
              <br>
              The OFAC named the three individuals yesterday under additional
              economic sanctions that were announced in the wake of the junta's
              crackdown against monk-led protests late last year.<br>
              <br>
              When Today visited Ms Ng's Shenton Way office premises yesterday,
              an employee said her employer and Mr Tun were both overseas. The
              employee said she was aware that her company was blacklisted.<br>
              <br>
              In December 2004, Golden Aaron made the news here when the small
              firm clinched a energy exploration deal to explore the coast off
              Myanmar with two other non- Singaporean companies.<br>
              <br>
              A check with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority
              showed that the company, set up in October 1995, has a paid-up
              capital of $5 million. The other shareholder was listed as a Mr Lo
              Ping Zhong, one of the many alias that, according to the OFAC, Mr
              Tun apparently uses.<br>
              <br>
              Earlier this month, the United States also sanctioned Myanmar
              national and Singapore Permanent Resident U Kyaw Thein, 60, as
              among those linked to Tay Za, the junta's alleged "henchman".<br>
              <br>
              Two companies, with offices here, and a Singaporean company, Pavo
              Aircraft Leasing, were also named in the sanctions.<br>
              <br>
              Singapore and its banks have been previously pressured by the
              United States to cut financial ties with the junta.<br>
              <br>
              When contacted, a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
              spokesperson said that "banks and financial institutions in
              Singapore are required to institute strict procedures". "Should
              there be links with illicit activity, MAS will not hesitate to take
              necessary action," the spokesperson said.<br>
              <br>
              The Ministry of Home Affairs told Today that the Central Narcotics
              Bureau has not received any information that "a Singapore company
              has been targeted under US sanctions against Myanmar for
              involvement in illicit drug trade".<br>
              <br>
              The ministry said that any "credible information received on
              suspected drug trafficking by persons in Singapore will be
              thoroughly investigated and offenders prosecuted". -</span>

              But the most shameful thing is that we execute those small-time drug traffickers while we fraternize with the drug lords.

              <p>To be frank, I don't think the conditions are ripe for Myanmar to relax its rule over the people. There are many guerrilla groups agitating for separation from Myanmar, if they are given freedom to agitate and propagate, the domestic situation might get worse.</p>
              <p>A Singapore style democratic facade is okay I think, but the regime must develop the economy and raise the standards of living of the people in order to prepare the stage for a more democratic rule.</p>
