I was just hoping to run into someone who knows about the law or someone who can provides some advice on dealing with such situations. For me, I'm a guy, I am fine if any girls harass me, but girls are normally more sensitive when it comes to such things.</div>

This girl just changed number a month ago, and under contract so unlikely to switch number. It's not a serious case so don't need to trouble the CID, but a police report is necessary as this guy has made repeated calls in the middle of the night, not very pleasant is it?<br><br>Yeah, I've called Singtel and haven't been able to get through for like, half an hour, I'm going to keep trying but in the meantime I'm seeking advice. Singtel lines are always busy.</div>

Wanted to call Singtel to trace the calls but they can't give out due to privacy. Went to lodge a police report earlier, they treat this as a civil case and had to go to the court to continue with the procedure and get the letter or something, then the police will assist with the investigation. It's troublesome really and the police says until as if the victim will be an idiot to continue pursue the matter. I believe that guy was serving NS and wanting to siam work so keep persuading my female friend to consider dropping the matter.<br><br>There is no threats, just sexual harassment I believe. For other people, it probably ends at that. But imagine if you happen to be the victim, you feel outraged and insulted, but worse of all, in order to pursue the matter you have to face so many red tapes.</div>
