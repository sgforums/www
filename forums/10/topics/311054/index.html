              Our PAP party leader now started to make use of our media and newspaper to discriminate Malaysia's democratic party,they scare Malaysia democracy will spread to Singapore politics.
                          
              But i think this is solely Lee Hsien Loong's idea.Becoz he scare the democracy wave will spread to Singapore politics.
              
              But if Malaysia become a more democratic country,it will actually be better for Singapore's benefits.
                          
              Firstly,Malaysia will be more fair when treating other races.This will be beneficial to Singapore if one day our country is going to merge with them again.Coz as we all know,a tiny small country like Singapore without any resources is still a major setback,even if we do accomplish some economy achievement today.
                          
              Another thing is,if Malaysia become a democratic nation,it will prevent the country to turn into extreme Muslim nation.This will reduce the threat to our country and we no need to spend a huge amount of fund in military expenses.Especially manpower,which our country is lack of.
                          
              Lee Kuan Yew know that(although i cant be sure,coz his mind is not working well nowadays),boot-licker Goh Chok Tong also know that.But only this silver-spooned kid Lee Hsien Loong know nothing.His character is not deep enough,and he is too self centred and selfish(much worse than his father).Thats why he keep using our media and newspapers to discriminate Malaysia's democratic parties.

              True,and their government is more caring for their ppl.You know that day,i went to Malaysia and spend my time touring with my Malaysia's relatives.I was shocked to find out that their Moblie Sim card users no need to pay for incoming calls,whereas our fuking telecom companies,no matter Singtel,M1 or Starhub,still charge incoming calls if u are a Sim card users.
              
              And one more thing,their election system is fair and square.Not like Singapore PAP government,keep twisting our elections systems to their favour.Not gentlemen at all.

              Pity to know that in the PAP party,there arent anyone similar to Russia democracy leader Boris Yeltsen or Taiwan's Father of democracy Lee Teng Hui.
              
              If we have such leaders,we no need to scare of Lee's family autocracy.

              <p>People continued to voiced dis-satisfaction with PAP governance for many years. Yet, PAP continues to win its elections and remain entrenched with 2 or 3 elected opposition MPs. Each election, many people gathered to hear the fiery opposition rallies while PAP rallies usually ended as quiet affairs. The election results are usually similar, except for 1 or 2 near losses for the PAP.</p>
              <p>International observers are invited to observe our election process. They continued to give clearance on our election results. Our elected opposition MPs have never cried foul that the elections were rigged.</p>
              <p>I have either voted for against and for PAP or faced walkovers in the past 3 or 4 elections. I know what kind of government I want and whether me and my family have a future in ths country.</p>
              <p>I write to MPs or government departments when I am not happy with their policies.</p>
              <p>I know that people say that the government dont listen and pushed policies down our throats. Then, speak up and stopped yapping that your voices are not heard.</p>

              <p>Did Singapore PAP discriminate against Malaysia's DAP ?</p>
              <p>How did the discrimination happen ? In what form ?</p>
              <p>It will indeed be ironical for the PAP to act against the DAP - as the DAP is actually an off-shoot of the PAP when Singapore was part of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Part of the agreement for Singapore to join Malaysia was that the political parties of Malaya and Singapore will not cross their respective state borders - to participate in the other's state politics.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, UMNO broke this understanding by entering into Singapore politics under the disguise of USNO - and the Malayan UMNO leadership took it on themselves to champion the Political Rights of the Singaporean Malays.</p>
              <p>This resulted in Devan Nair leaving Singapore to start the DAP in Peninsular Malaya, and instead of the red lightning bolt in a blue circle, the DAP had a 'Red Rocket' over a blue circle for its logo.</p>
              <p>When Singapore was evicted from Malaysia, Devan Nair decide to return to Singapore, and let the second tier DAP leadership to carry on the fight for a ''Malaysian Malaysia'' till this day.</p>
              <p>PAP acting against DAP ?</p>
              <p>This must be an early April Fools' Day joke ?</p>

One way I can think of is to declare to boot Penang out of Malaysia under the name of "racial harmony" blah blah blah. So, the DAP will lose its power generator in Penang and suffer a split. When this happen, BN won't worry whether opposition can take back the central government in next election already. Then there will be a 3rd action party appear. This time, Lim Kit Siang won't cry but Anwar will.<br>Losing a state is better than losing the whole country. Abdullah, just do it.</p></div>

              Yeltsen didnt ruin Russia economy,becoz Russia economy is at the edge of bankcruptcy,and the reason being the Communist mismanagement of the country.
                  
              Yeltsen is smart to overthrow the communist government,becoz he know the root of the  problem in Russia is in the politics,that is autocracy ruling.
                  
              Now look at Russia,her economy is doing well and she is beginning to gain back her influential status in the world.Even our hospital also want to grab Russia customers,thats show more n more Russians are getting richer.
                  
              As a matter of fact,Russia now is the 2nd super-power nation in the world,just behind the U.S.Some ppl say Mainland China is super-power nation behind America,but i have to disagree.Those Communist pigs are lagging behind the American and Russians alot in military areas.They are just booasting about their might.Pigs always do that^^         <blockquote>

              You think too much,Pok.Lets not talk about Russia,but Communist China is a real threat to the world peace.Look at the way China treat their own ppl,cruel,ruthless,mean.Do you really think that they will treat other countries with sincerity by the way the treat their own ppl?
              
              Its just like a person who is mean to his family members and friends,do u think he will treat other ppl with sincerity?If let me choose to side between Communist China and USA,i will choose U.S,even though i am a Chinese.            <blockquote>

              <p>Did Singapore PAP discriminate against Malaysia's DAP ?</p>
              <p>How did the discrimination happen ? In what form ?</p>
              <p>It will indeed be ironical for the PAP to act against the DAP -
              as the DAP is actually an off-shoot of the PAP when Singapore was
              part of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Part of the agreement for Singapore to join Malaysia was that
              the political parties of Malaya and Singapore will not cross their
              respective state borders - to participate in the other's state
              politics.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, UMNO broke this understanding by entering into
              Singapore politics under the disguise of USNO - and the Malayan
              UMNO leadership took it on themselves to champion the
              Political Rights of the Singaporean Malays.</p>
              <p>This resulted in Devan Nair leaving Singapore to start the DAP
              in Peninsular Malaya, and instead of the red lightning bolt in a
              blue circle, the DAP had a 'Red Rocket' over a blue circle for its
              logo.</p>
              <p>When Singapore was evicted from Malaysia, Devan Nair decide to
              return to Singapore, and let the second tier DAP leadership to
              carry on the fight for a ''Malaysian Malaysia'' till this
              day.</p>
              <p>PAP acting against DAP ?</p>
              <p>This must be an early April Fools' Day joke ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is a matter of facts that Yeltsin has destroyed the russia economy and its political power as well, causing so many people to starve, bankrupt and whole nation disintegrate. That's why the US like him so much.<br>But after Putin become the next president, he managed to revitalize the russia economy and political status, US then call him a dictator and threat to democracy. US pretend that they dont know Putin get much more votes than Yeltsin. What a hypocrite.<br><br>As for china, they never invade, occupy, colonise other country before, I don't know where the threat come from.<br>Instead they were invaded by other countries, and forced to give out lands so many times. Maybe this is what the US want to see to happen again.</p></div>
