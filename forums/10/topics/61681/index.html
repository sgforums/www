            <div class='col-md body'>I was just watching channel i news and there was an incident abt a malaysian bus ramming a singapore SUV repeatedly, even tearing the shirt of the SUV driver in an attempt to fight. I was amazed that the bus driver got away scot free while the singaporean family was fined...yes you didn't read wrongly ....<span style="color: red;">FINED</span> by the malaysian police for attempting to "overtake dangerously".<br><br>Guess that's the law in our neighbouring country.<br><br>If such an incident occured in singapore, the bus driver would have doubtless been hauled to court...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i fail to understand is the utter lack of logic in the authorities there.<br><br>The car was pretty banged up from all sides save the front. Doesn't that prove something? Yes he may have been over-taking illegally or dangerously, but how on earth did the driver escape punishment?<br><br>That was a life-threatening situation.<br><br>I wonder what would have happened if there was an oncoming vehicle and the chew family was killed.<br><br>There would have been no justice and no one would have disputed the bus driver's story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Driving back from Kuala Lumpur in the middle of a rainy night, and alone, I had my normal lights on low beam, and backed up with my spot lamps as most Malaysian cars would.<br><br>Just as my car passed into the Johor state border, I tried to pass a Malaysian passenger coach in front of my car. It then started to swerve from the left lane to the right lane, and I thought that the driver was falling asleep.<br><br>Slowing my car to the rear of the bus, which was already travelling at a speed of about 125 kmh, the bus straightened out in the left lane (on the 2 lane North South Highway).<br><br>With the bus on the left lane, I tried to make a second pass again, then the driver again swerved into my right lane, preventing me from passing him again; and started to weave the bus from the left lane to the right lane over the next 1km - at a speed of 125 kmh.<br><br>Again I slowed my car to the rear of the bus, realising that the driver is out of his mind; and blasted my air horn for a full minute to wake up any passengers in the bus and have them observe the erratic driving that is endangering the passengers' lives.<br><br>The next time when I tried to pass the bus, with my air horn full blast, the bus driver made a less determined swerve to push me off the highway, but I was determined not to pull back, and instead drove closer to the bus - while being alert to the distance between my car and the bus.<br><br>The bus driver realised that I was not giving way, and he stuck his hand out to show me his middle finger.<br><br>I passed the bus, and went in front of the bus, and slammed my brakes enough to slow the bus down, without having it hitting my rear; and slowed the speed down to 90kmh for the next 1 km.<br><br>From past experience on Indonesian roads, I realised that the bus driver may have at least one or two assistants on board, and it will be pointless for me to stop the bus - (to question the Driver for his reckless driving) - even though my car is equipped for any aggressive assault by any road rage driver on Malaysian roads.<br><br>The bus tried to overtake me again but it was no match for the take-off speed of my car, and I taunted him over the next 2 km, pulling myself away after that, as it was pointless to fluster him further.<br><br>It was pointless to report this matter to the Malaysian Police, as they are indifferent to such reports from Singaporeans.<br><br>From his side mirrors, the bus driver could hardly see my car as a Singapore registered car, especially when my two head lamps were on, with additional two spot lights mounted into my bumpers also turned on.<br><br>It seems that some of these bus drivers take the law into their own hands, and behave in a murderous way when irritated by bright lamps - regardless if the cars are Malaysian or Singaporean registered.<br><br>Little wonder that some accidents on the Malaysian highway can occur with little explanations, especially when no one live through a severe road accident.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You took a big risk there.<br><br>No matter how "well-equip" your car was, it would certainly not have been able to withstand a collision at full speed from a 40-seater. You might have been in a hospital or worse.<br><br>Nevertheless, after succeeding in overtaking the buffoon, you could have avoided taunting him. That only lowers us to his level (though i personally would have enjoyed that myself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and we are definitely better than that.<br><br></div>

He actually flashed and horned me a couple of times while he continued his dangerous stunt.<br><br>Several times i tried to move over, but a constant stream of vehicles kept me from doing so.

He made it thru the gap but almost immediately, he pulled up infront of me and slowed down considerably, surprising me and forcing me to brake as well. All this while there was no vehicle in front of him.<br><br>He continued to hog the right lane. In my mind he was deliberately taunting me and moments later i was right, for he cut across three lanes and filtered off into choa chu kang. For all of 10 sec there, i lost control.<br><br>I accelerated and chased him across the highway while he was lane-changing. There was no doubt in my mind that i intended to ram him if i could. It took me several moments to suddenly come to my senses and slow the vehicle down, glancing to see him speed of down the fliter way.<br><br>In that 10 sec, i almost became a road raging killer. It was a moment of spite, anger and emotional instability that made me a danger to other road users.<br><br>Thankfully, it was through this incident that made we realise that such cases aren't worth pursuing.
