              <p>Seriously i don't know why people keep harping on the stop at 2 policy.</p>
              <p>You realise our problem is <strong>birth rate </strong>, not population numbers? Ignoring the social and infrastructural problems when you have a population growth that the system cannot cope with (see: India), the stop at 2 policy also only applied to our parents generation and isn't related to the cause of our dismay birth rate.</p>
              <p>Hongkong, Taiwan and Japan all have the same birth rate problem and they never instituted any 2 child policy ( that i know of!)</p>
              <p>Any form of social security ( such as our CPF) is at its core a Ponzi Scheme, meaning there must be enough new contributors in order to pay off the retirees of the system. That is why birth rate is so vital to upkeeping the system running</p>
              <p><strong>THAT </strong>is the problem. It is completely unrelated to the stop at 2 policy.</p>
