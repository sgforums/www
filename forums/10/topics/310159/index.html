              <p>SINGAPORE - Renowned for its strict and 
                                                    tight government controls, Singapore's Orwellian 
                                                    reputation took a hit on February 27 when terror 
                                                    suspect Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from the 
                                                    island state's Whitley Road Detention Center. 
                                                    <br><br>The escape, and the government's 
                                                    subsequent handling of the manhunt, have called 
                                                    the island nation's terror-fighting credentials 
                                                    into question. Mas Selamat is the alleged leader 
                                                    of the Singapore cell of the regional terror 
                                                    network Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is believed 
                                                    to have links with al-Qaeda.</p>
              <p>According to 
                                                    government sources, Mas Selamat had in early 2002 
                                                    planned for a commercial plane from Bangkok to be 
                                                    hijacked and crashed into Singapore's Changi 
                                                    Airport, in apparent imitation of the September 
                                                    11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Prior 
                                                    to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">that, in 2001, Mas Selamat and his 
                                                    JI associates had also allegedly planned to plant 
                                                    bombs at a train station, the US Embassy, the 
                                                    American Club and other targets, as well as poison 
                                                    Singapore's water system. <br><br>The main target 
                                                    of the US's "war on terror" in Southeast Asia, JI 
                                                    is believed to operate across at least three 
                                                    countries in the region - Singapore, Malaysia and 
                                                    Indonesia. The radical group stands accused of 
                                                    orchestrating a number of terror attacks, 
                                                    including the 2002 Bali blast in Indonesia which 
                                                    killed 202 people. <br><br>The group is also 
                                                    believed to have links and share training 
                                                    facilities with Islamist rebels active in the 
                                                    southern Philippines, including the allegedly 
                                                    al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf. While many JI 
                                                    operatives have in recent years been apprehended 
                                                    by their respective governments, no country, 
                                                    including the United States, has declared victory 
                                                    over the underground network. <br><br>Mas Selamat 
                                                    was a particularly high-value detainee. His 
                                                    involvement in Islamic militant activities dates 
                                                    to 1990, when he first joined the Darul Islam, an 
                                                    Indonesia-based radical movement considered by 
                                                    many as the forerunner of JI. <br><br>According to 
                                                    the International Crisis Group (ICG), by 1992 Mas 
                                                    Selamat was a member of the religious council of 
                                                    JI's Singapore cell. He traveled to Afghanistan 
                                                    for military training in 1993, and again in 1998, 
                                                    to observe the Taliban's austere and strict 
                                                    fundamentalist rule, of which the ICG reports he 
                                                    was "deeply impressed". <br><br>Around 1999, Mas 
                                                    Selamat was reportedly promoted to Singapore 
                                                    commander by the group's Southeast Asian 
                                                    operations chief Riduan Isamuddin, or Hambali, who 
                                                    was captured in Thailand in August 2003 and is now 
                                                    in US custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. <br><br>A 
                                                    full week after Mas Selamat's dramatic escape, 
                                                    details are still sketchy as the government has 
                                                    reverted to damage-control mode. The authorities 
                                                    have remained tight-lipped about the embarrassing 
                                                    security breach. Their silence has allowed all 
                                                    manner of conspiracy theories to flourish over the 
                                                    Internet. <br><br>What is known is that Mas 
                                                    Selamat was being taken by guards for a scheduled 
                                                    visit with his family when at 4:05 pm he requested 
                                                    to use the toilet. That apparently was the last 
                                                    time he was seen by his prison minders. Deputy 
                                                    Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong 
                                                    Kan Seng told the media four days later there had 
                                                    been a "physical breach" at the facility, but 
                                                    refused to elaborate. "An independent 
                                                    investigation is underway and we should not 
                                                    speculate on what and how it happened," he said. 
                                                    <br><br></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Schizophrenic 
                                                    manhunt<br></strong>Thousands of police have 
                                                    flooded the area in the vicinity of his escape, 
                                                    setting up roadblocks and conducting 
                                                    house-to-house searches. It wasn't until after 8 
                                                    pm the day of the escape that the government 
                                                    announced that the leading terror suspect was on 
                                                    the loose. The four-hour lag between the escape 
                                                    and the public announcement has stoked speculation 
                                                    of a government cover-up. <br><br>Every day and 
                                                    night since, police, army personnel and tracker 
                                                    dogs have combed forested areas for the fugitive - 
                                                    to no avail. The authorities have stated their 
                                                    belief, without pointing to specific corroborating 
                                                    evidence, that the suspect is still on the island 
                                                    and has not fled to a neighboring country, such as 
                                                    Muslim-majority Malaysia or Indonesia. 
                                                    <br><br>Urban areas are now covered with police 
                                                    posters showing the face of the wanted man. 
                                                    Authorities have alerted the population that Mas 
                                                    Selamat walks with a limp and police have released 
                                                    information about his height and weight. It was 
                                                    only on the sixth day that the media were told 
                                                    what clothes Mas Selamat was wearing at the time 
                                                    of his escape. <br><br>The government's 
                                                    schizophrenic impulse, simultaneously calling on 
                                                    the public to help, but not trusting people with 
                                                    specific information about the suspect, is 
                                                    characteristic of the Singapore government's 
                                                    nanny-state ways. Mas Selamat's escape is 
                                                    particularly embarrassing not only because the 
                                                    Singapore citizen had eluded capture before, but 
                                                    it was the Indonesians who had originally caught 
                                                    him and handed him over. <br><br>Thirteen 
                                                    suspected members of JI's Singapore wing were 
                                                    hauled off to indefinite detention without trial 
                                                    under the Internal Security Act over their alleged 
                                                    roles in plotting the 2001 attacks. Mas Selamat, 
                                                    however, managed to slip through the dragnet and 
                                                    fled to Indonesia, where the terror group has 
                                                    deeper roots and is suspected to maintain a wide 
                                                    sanctuary network. <br><br>Indonesian police 
                                                    arrested him in 2003 on Bintan, an island near 
                                                    Singapore, when they discovered he was carrying 
                                                    fake immigration papers. He was sentenced to 18 
                                                    months in prison on immigration charges, during 
                                                    which he attempted to escape by jumping off a high 
                                                    floor of the detention facility. He broke his leg 
                                                    in the failed attempt, and the injury apparently 
                                                    developed into a permanent limp. <br><br>Where Mas 
                                                    Selamat went after serving that sentence is 
                                                    unclear. However, he was arrested for a second 
                                                    time on immigration offences in Malang, Java, in 
                                                    2006. He was deported to Singapore in February 
                                                    that same year and was held under the Internal 
                                                    Security Act, which allows for indefinite 
                                                    detention without trial if the state has cause to 
                                                    believe a suspect is a threat to the state. Mas 
                                                    Selamat was held at the Whitley Road Detention 
                                                    Center until his escape. <br><br>Singapore prides 
                                                    itself as a trusted and reliable partner to the US 
                                                    in matters of regional security. The US Navy 
                                                    regularly makes port calls and it is believed the 
                                                    two sides have been sharing 
                                                    counterterrorism-related information. It is 
                                                    because of that special relationship, apparently, 
                                                    that JI chose to scout out American targets for 
                                                    attacks in Singapore in 2001. <br><br>Mas 
                                                    Selamat's escape calls into question the 
                                                    reliability of Singapore's own security 
                                                    arrangements, as well as how much Western allies 
                                                    can and should depend on them. There have been 
                                                    similar breaches in the Philippines, where 
                                                    high-value terror suspects have escaped, allegedly 
                                                    through police corruption. Unless Mas Selamat is 
                                                    caught and a full accounting of the lapses that 
                                                    led to his escape are publicly disclosed, foreign 
                                                    confidence in Singapore's counterterrorism 
                                                    credentials will be hard to restore. 
                                                    <br><br>Noises have already been made from 
                                                    Indonesia that if their police again capture Mas 
                                                    Selamat in their country, they will keep him in 
                                                    their own custody rather than deport him to 
                                                    Singapore. The US, too, could be prodded to 
                                                    reconsider its security cooperation with Singapore 
                                                    if and when the details of the mysterious escape 
                                                    finally emerge. <br><br></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Alex Au</strong> is an
