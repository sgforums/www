              <p><cite class="auth">Channel NewsAsia - <span>Saturday, May 10</span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry overpaid nearly S$180,000 of financial aid to people without realising they had died.</p>
              <p>This
                  was one of public fund lapses uncovered by the Auditor—General’s Office
                  (AGO), according to a 6—page report by the Public Accounts Committee, a
                  parliamentary watchdog which scrutinises the annual financial
                  statements of government bodies.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, 10 months after the
                  AGO made its report, the Public Accounts Committee released its
                  findings on the remedial actions that have since been taken.</p>
              <p>The
                  Public Accounts Committee’s report highlighted the various lapses of
                  three government ministries, a statutory board and the Supreme Court.</p>
              <p>The
                  Health Ministry was particularly cited for overpaying S$178,150 of
                  financial aid to beneficiaries who had died. After being informed of
                  the lapse, the ministry said it had since recovered S$85,200.</p>
              <p>However, the rest remains unclaimed since the policy is not to recover payouts made up to 3 months of a person’s death.</p>
              <p>The
                  ministry said it will review its policy of allowing a grace period, and
                  has since agreed to work with the Ministry of Home Affairs to obtain
                  death records of beneficiaries on a monthly basis.</p>
              <p>The Ministry
                  of Foreign Affairs was also found to have S$1.56m of unclaimed medical
                  bills. These were incurred since 2003, during three overseas missions.
                  The Ministry says it is currently filing the claims to its insurance
                  company.</p>
              <p>The AGO’s 2006/07 accounting report on ministries,
                  statutory boards and government—owned companies also said that it
                  uncovered unnecessary expenditure of S$30,789 by the Supreme Court for
                  replacing glass panels. Administrators have since recovered the amount
                  from the contractors.</p>
              <p>The Manpower Ministry was also found to
                  have made excessive advances to a building management agent. The
                  ministry said the law does not allow it to claim interest on the
                  excessive advances paid.</p>
              <p>However, a new contract, effective 2006,
                  states that payments can only be made after works are carried out by
                  contractors. Other safeguards, such as a banker’s guarantee, are also
                  in place to make sure advances to contractors can be recovered.</p>
              <p>The InfoComm Development Authority was found to have mismanaged cash surpluses.</p>
              <p>Under the current legal system, not all government bodies are required to be inspected by the Auditor—General.</p>
              <p>But
                  the latest report recommends an expansion. So the Auditor—General will
                  look into 18 statutory boards in the coming financial year, an increase
                  from the previous 13.</p>
