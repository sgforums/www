It is supposed to be whether Singapore should adopt a protectionist policy and not what is happening in other countries.<br><br>I think by adopting a protectionist policy Singapore could save jobs and places in the varsities for our people but there would be some adverse consequences.<br><br>We would lose out in talents which is essential in a rapidly globalised and highly competitive world. Cities like London and New York are able to remain successful because they are able to attract all kinds of talents there.<br><br>Competition is also important in improving standards and widening vision.<br><br>It is however a tricky job in maintaining a balance between attracting foreign talents and nurturing local talents.<br></div>
