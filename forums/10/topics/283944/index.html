            <div class='col-md body'>A made-in-Singapore coup dÂ’etat25Sep06<br><br>I found this story on thestar.com.my, and strangely not anywhere else.<br><br>Last week, SÂ’poreÂ’s Lee Kuan Yew said that in the event of a freak defeat of the PAP in SÂ’pore, the Opposition may plunder the US120billion reserves. Then, he added that the SÂ’pore military will intervene to stop the plunder.<br><br>There are so many points-of-discussion I donÂ’t know how to start.<br><br>1. The Opposition, once they win an election to become the ruling-party, will have the mandate of SÂ’poreans. If plundering means that they use Parliament to give themselves the highest ministersÂ’ salaries any where in the world, then the precedent has already been set, and thereÂ’s nothing to worry about.<br><br>2. Lee Kuan Yew paints the current Opposition as being untrustworthy and incapable. Well, if that were true, the PAP would have done an excellent job in sidelining the Opposition after decades of intimidation. So, if indeed a weak Opposition comes to power in SÂ’pore, we would have the PAP to thank.<br><br>3. There are also black-sheep amongst the lofty-PAP MPs (such as Kahlid, which I blogged about) so does this paralyse the PAP? If not, why would it not be normal to expect a few bad-hats in the Opposition?<br><br>4. The SÂ’pore Military reports to the Prime Minister in power. Which means if the Opposition wins power, the Military will obey them, and not the PAP (who would be the Opposition, wouldnÂ’t they?). So why is Lee Kuan Yew so sure the Military will listen to him, the Opposition? Not to forget that, SÂ’poreÂ’s military is largely made up of citizens, and in the case of the Opposition winning, it would mean that a majority of the citizen-soldiers voted for the Opposition and NOT the PAP. How pompous of the PAP to assume that their influence would still be intact after losing the election.<br><br>Whatever Lee Kuan Yew says, this is the PAP scaremongering that they have been feeding SÂ’poreans about the dichotomy between the Â‘benevolent PAPÂ’ and Â‘evil OppositionÂ’. Letting the democratic process take its course, the people of SÂ’pore will choose the Government that leads it. Hopefully, SÂ’poreans will vote for the Â‘most capableÂ’, as opposed to voting for the Â‘othersÂ’ to spite the Â‘most capableÂ’.<br><br>However, as voting trends go, the PAPÂ’s popular vote has been ever-sliding to reach just over 66.6% in the last election in May 2006. PAPÂ’s grip on SÂ’pore politics is surely slipping with each election. There is no guarantee that SÂ’poreans would keep voting for the PAP if the economic growth they bring is overtaken by escalating costs-of-living and a stifiling climate of overbearing paternalism.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Will you stand up and go against the Lee Kuan Yew if he really send in the Army to crush the Opposition if the Opposition party really win the mandate in the election?I wonder will U.S.A send in their Army to liberate us from the Lee's regime if this day really come!!!<br></div>

True enough, i suspect our dear PAP regime controlled by the Lee's families don't know secretly keep how many money for themselves in the swiss bank already.Remember the selling of Singapore weapons to the Burmese military Junta?And not forgetting the connections with the drug dealers of Burma.How many dirty money did our Lee's regime had already made?I wonder how come no media reports on this news?<br>Lastly, i know some PAP running dogs will tell us that selling the weapons to the Burma is purely a busines to business things and it benefit the Singapore.I want to laugh till peng! Why?Because our GST keep increasing and our fare keep rising! What is there to benefit for the sales of weapons to Burma?And, don't forget...., selling weapons to a country you know they will use it to kill innocent peoples is morally not accept in today's world.Good luck to those PAP running dogs, because they reap what they sow!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You took this article from a Malaysian blog which misinterpreted LKY's comments. The comments were made during the IMF meetings in Singapore. The one which the Malaysians took us to task for insinuating that their minorities were marginalised. The dialogue is still available online if you are interested in what he said. It certainly isn't along the lines that there will be coup if the opposition takes over.</div>
