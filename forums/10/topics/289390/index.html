            <div class='col-md body'>Whether opposition should be elected to praise or check on the government depends on the perception by the people of the situation we are in.<br><br>It the costs do not keep rising and actions were taken to make public transportation, utilities, medical care and low-cost housing more affordable. then perhaps some credit should be given to the government.<br><br>If the government is still the same with only justifications or minor cosmetics to make people accept the continuation of past policies causing rising costs and uncaring fee increases that deprive the citizens of a better life then it is too early for the opposition to praise the govenrment.<br><br>It will be too naive for the opposition to accept the status quo as the good government and start behaving like the ruling party. What can the opposition do to serve the people? It should continue to think independently and objectively for the good of the people by coming up with alternative programs and suggestions to improve the existing policies and practices which cause problems in the first place.<br><br>A good government of the little red dot must not just try to put up all kinds of look-good policies or keep talking about their own talents.<br><br>It must substantially look into its own people's many problems concerning their lives and works for the greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>If the government only wants to put up a false fronts but keep covering up existing problems created by autocracy and not interested in looking after its citizens and then no matter how good is their external credential they will one day be exposed for their falsehood.<br><br>Now the leaders are once again seen as taking a convenient ride of world economic recovery. There is yet to be fundamental addressing of economic restructuring to build Singapore into a truly first-world nation or motivating its own citizens to maximize their skills and talents. So it is doubtful their claims of success is real and substantial.<br><br>If the fundamentals are not right and people are unable or struggling to keep up with all the rising costs and hardship then no matter what the leaders try to do or pretend to do all will finally be in vain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I am quite disappointed with what Mr low has said. But we can see this perhaps as a technique to divert PXP's big guns from pointing at them, ever since the last election.<br><br>But look at it this way, in my opinion, opposition SHOULD EXIST TO CRITICISE. There is no such thing as a 'good' 'all-rounded' policies. So it is critical that we do have opposition to provide alternative point of views, alternative solutions so as to ferret out all possible flaws, possible negative outcome of a certain policy. Ppls can also make better decision and all views,scope are well-covered. This is just like doing project, even if a member in the team has a brilliant idea, a rigorous debate must be done so as to ensure the idea is not too biased or extreme.........<br><br>Look done the memory lane, haven't we seem too many examples of so called "good policy-gone wrong"? The two is enough campaign seen large amount of efforts to utilise education, media to enforce the idea of controlling the population growth. All these "SG cannot handle a 4 million population, too large population bring more harm than good" is just based on one man's perception and prediction into the future. Had SGreans been more vocal and hardline back then, SG today will not need to beg PRCs, Indians to bcome citizens and the disaster can be adverted.<br><br>Many will say "hey the p65 PXP mps can act as the alternative voice, lift the party whip", in theory yes, but in practise no. Bcos p65 are at the end of the day, members of PXP, would a bright promising PXP mp volunteer to criticise, thus killing the goose that lays the golden eggs? No. Even foreigners in SG can see who is the most impt figures and which 'clan' holds the most power within the PXP circle, so dun expect those p65 to be a chivalrous knight to fight against the authority. Most prob his/her fate will be like that of pres Ong. Besides, most PXP scholar mps have been living a life of luxury with their 10k salary, so most prob they dun understand the issues of ppls living in poverty.</div>

But we can see this perhaps as a technique to divert PXP's big guns from pointing at them, ever since the last election.<br><br>But look at it this way, <span style="color: red;">in my opinion, opposition SHOULD EXIST TO CRITICISE</span>. There is no such thing as a 'good' 'all-rounded' policies. So it is critical that we do have opposition to provide alternative point of views, alternative solutions so as to ferret out all possible flaws, possible negative outcome of a certain policy. Ppls can also make better decision and all views,scope are well-covered. This is just like doing project, even if a member in the team has a brilliant idea, a rigorous debate must be done so as to ensure the idea is not too biased or extreme.........<br><br></div></blockquote>I'm sorry... but i would have to disagree.<br><br>Opps... IMHO is task to counter check the govt and provide counter policy and ideas. Not complaint for the sake of complainting......</div>

The role of the Opposition in Singapore is 2 provide alternatives, as well as question the ruling party on policies that affects people. Their role is not to say that whatever PAP says is wrong.</div>

Worse is when we have a people who easily believe or fall prey to propagandas and lose sight of what is a good government.<br><br>We the people may be the ultimate cause of all the past wrong doings and NKFs as discovered because very few bother to correct the wrongs.<br><br>Let not the government take us people for granted and let us expect when we pay the government the world's highest salaries we really get them to perform like the best leaders to serve the people without propaganda or excuses.<br><br>The M/W must not do as they like and they must govern the country for their own narrow agenda and superficial success.<br><br>Let us check them and make them accountable and not lower our expectation for a job well done. We should tell them to carry on with their job and not always try to talk down on the people or keep using psychology to browbeat us or compare us again and again with the worse countries while they are paying themselves the highest salaries and claiming to be successful with arrogance and boasts. These are not signs of a good government at all.<br><br>Let us have some standard and expect the government to deliver the greatest benefits for the greatest number and not just for the rich and the elites and themselves to show a good report card which does not benefit the people.<br><br>So we should not accept or be conditioned by their propaganda of comparing with the worse and stop checking on their policies and actions such as by comparing us with "people who are starving to death and who have no internet to discuss problem"<br><br>Let us grow up as a mature people so that we could carry our heads high and not be subjected to all the suppressions and wrong doings.<br><br>When the time finally come to acknowledge the government good works we will really do so honestly and not be compelled to do so just because of their propaganda and hypocrisy.<br><br>So please do not shut out our eyes and ears and refuse to see anything else.<br><br>If we as a people is to help we must not easily be cowed by threats or hypocrisy of all kinds being drummed down on us through the powerful press controlled by the government.<br><br>We as a people have not elected a best first-world government yet who is prepared to correct their own past policy errors and mistakes and truly work honestly with integrity for the people.<br><br>This is where we cannot allow to fall into complacency and easily accept a few sweets and be satisfied.<br><br>The government is as good as the people. If we as a people are too simple minded and accept a little economic recovery as progress then we may one day ask for more trouble should the government fail to restructure the economy and there are more job losses and unemployment.<br><br>It is precisely because we have been complacent as a people that there are signs that we may not be doing well.<br><br>The only solution is to grow up and mature as a people who know what we want the government to achieve and not be too simple minded to accept propaganda just because of good presentation.<br><br>Otherwise we will regret when more harsh policies were to come down hard on us and it will be too late to expect any more change.<br><br>How much is enough and what good does the government do yet remain to be seen.</div>
