            <div class='col-md body'>The Ruling Party, despite all their grandiose claims, have no answer to Low Thia Khiang's lift upgrading in Hougang; performed at NO COST to the residents. With a limited budget allocated from town council fundings, he succeeded in completing his upgrading targets, targets he promised to his residents and delivered.<br><br>With a significantly larger funding afforded to each GRC, it is therefore surprising to find that not only have the Ruling Party failed to 'walk the talk', they have also failed to provide any updates or explanations on explicit tardiness.<br><br>Will it come as a shock if the respective MPs give further excuses for delays?<br><br>Perhaps residents affected can propose some form of liquidated damages in the form of their 5% contribution being reduced in the event of further delays, to be compensated by the respective town council funds?</div>
