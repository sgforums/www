              <p>The banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the  people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.</p>
              <p>Basically Currency is printed out and loaned out with a  X percent interest attached</p>
              <p>The modern theory of the perpetuation of debt has drenched the earth with blood, and crushed its inhabitants under burdens ever accumulating."</p>
              <p>the real truth of the matter is,  that a financial elements in the has owned the government ever since the day of andrew jackson</p>
              <p>This age old conspiracy is by far more dangerous than  threat of terrorism , War, Natural Disasters, Disease</p>
              <p>The takeover of currency from nations by private individuals for profit is the doom of mankind that is about to come</p>

              <p> <em>...This third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming
              significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its
              ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and even occult,
              that we may be excused if we devote considerate attention to its
              organization and methods. </em></p>
              <p><em>Essentially what it did was to take the old
              disorganized and localized methods of handling money and credit and
              organize them into an integrated system, on an international basis,
              which worked with incredible and well-oiled facility for many decades. </em></p>
              <p><em>The center of that system was in London, with major offshoots in New
              York and Paris, and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an
              integrated banking system and a heavily capitalized—if now largely
              obsolescent—framework of heavy industry, reflected in railroads, steel
              mills, coal mines, and electrical utilities...</em></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>...The names of some of these banking families are familiar to
              all of us and should he more so. They include Raring, Lazard, Erlanger,
              Warburg, Schroder, Seligman, the Speyers, Mirabaud, Mallet, Fould, and
              above all Rothschild and Morgan. </em></p>
              <p><em>Even after these banking families
              became fully involved in domestic industry by the emergence of
              financial capitalism, they remained different from ordinary bankers in
              distinctive ways: </em></p>
              <p><em>(1) they were cosmopolitan and international; </em></p>
              <p><em>(2)
              they were close to governments and were particularly concerned with
              questions of government debts, including foreign government debts, even
              in areas which seemed, at first glance, poor risks, like Egypt, Persia,
              Ottoman Turkey, Imperial China, and Latin America;</em></p>
              <p><em> (3) their interests
              were almost exclusively in bonds and very rarely in goods, since they
              admired "liquidity" and regarded commitments in commodities or even
              real estate as the first step toward bankruptcy; </em></p>
              <p><em>(4) they were,
              accordingly, fanatical devotees of deflation (which they called "sound"
              money from its close associations with high interest rates and a high
              value of money) and of the gold standard, which, in their eyes,
              symbolized and ensured these values; and </em></p>
              <p><em>(5) they were almost equally
              devoted to secrecy and the secret use of financial influence in
              political life. These bankers came to be called "international bankers"
              and, more particularly, were known as "merchant bankers" in England,
              "private bankers" in France, and "investment bankers" in the United
              States. In all countries they carried on various kinds of banking and
              exchange activities, but everywhere they were sharply distinguishable
              from other, more obvious, kinds of banks, such as savings banks or
              commercial banks...</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/02.html#5">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/02.html#5</a></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em> ...Each of these methods of raising money had a different effect upon
              the two chief financial consequences of the war. These were inflation
              and public debt. The effects of the four ways of raising money upon
              these two can be seen from the following table: </em></p>
              <ol type="a">
              <li><em> Taxation gives no inflation and no debt. </em></li>
              <li><em> Fiat money gives inflation and no debt. </em></li>
              <li><em> Bank credit gives inflation and debt. </em></li>
              <li><em> Sales of bonds give no inflation but give debt. </em></li>
              </ol>
              <p><em>It would appear from this table that the best way to pay for
              the war would be by taxation, and the worst way would be by bank
              credit. </em></p>
              <p><em>How­ever, taxation sufficient to pay for a major war would have
              such a severe deflationary effect upon prices that economic production
              would not in­crease enough or fast enough. Any rapid increase in
              production is spurred by a small amount of inflation which provides the
              impetus of unusual profits to the economic system. Increase in public
              debt, on the other hand, contributes little of value to the effort
              toward economic mobilization...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...This change in the accepted theories after 1934 was a slow growth, and
              formed part of the eclipse of financial capitalism; <strong>in the long run it
              meant that banks would be reduced from the masters of the economy to
              become its servant in a situation where the major economic decisions
              would not be based on the supply of money but on the supply and
              organization of real resources.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> As a matter of fact the whole relationship of money
              and resources remained a puzzle to many and was still a subject of
              debate in the 1950's, <strong>but at least a great victory had been won by man
              in his control of his own destiny when the myths of orthodox financial
              theory were finally challenged in the 1930's.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The end of financial capitalism may well be dated at the
              collapse of the gold standard in Britain in September 1931,</strong> but, on the
              personal side, it might be dated at the suicide of its most spectacular
              individual, the "Match King," Ivar Kreuger, in Paris in April 1932...</p>
