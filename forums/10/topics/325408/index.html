              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Several constituencies have started hosting National Day dinners this weekend. <br><br>In their speeches at these National Day functions, Ministers and MPs have been urging Singaporeans to take precautions in case there is a downturn. <br><br>At the same time, they have also been urging the nation to prepare itself for the future and seize the many opportunities that arise. <br><br>Speaking at the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC National Day Dinner on Saturday night, Defence Minister and MP for the area, Teo Chee Hean, noted that Singaporeans are shopping wisely. <br><br>The consumption of frozen meat has gone up and the sale of house brands has also increased. <br><br>All these have helped to lower the cost of the weekly shopping basket. <br><br>Most importantly, Mr Teo stressed that the community spirit is strong. <br><br>Constituencies have received generous donations, including rice and other necessities, for distribution to needy residents. - CNA/ms</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">This is contradicting to what Tharman said last month.    Congratulations to ministers that they have no problem at all during the bad times for they have taken initiative to increase their salary on top of their already obscene super high pay.    If there is a downtown, we will expect ministers to cut their pay.</span></p>

              <h1>Tharman says S’pore not headed for a recession</h1>
              <p><cite>Channel NewsAsia, 8 June 2008 - <span><strong>1 hour 15 minutes ago</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday gave the assurance that Singapore is not heading for a recession.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a community event, Mr Tharman said, "From all indications we have at this point, I don’t think we’re heading for a recession. But there will be discomfort on the ground. Unfortunately, the fuel price increase in Malaysia does mean that vegetable, poultry and some other prices will go up. We can’t avoid that. Fortunately, rice prices globally are coming down.</p>
              <p>"But overall, we’re in a situation which isn’t temporary — this will be with us for a while. Commodity prices are much higher than what they used to be. But we’re tackling it, and we’re confident of tackling it — both through the government’s measures, the Growth Dividends, the GST Credits, as well as the way in which you see a lot of community initiatives on the ground."</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman was speaking to reporters at the Entrepreneur—in—You Carnival at Republic Polytechnic, where some 7,000 people turned up to pick up tips on starting their own business.</p>
              <p>The carnival included forums, workshops and an exhibition to nurture business acumen.</p>
              <p>There were also winning business presentations by tertiary institutions, and a presentation of the 2008 Youth Enterprise Awards.</p>
              <p>The People’s Association organised the event to encourage Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial. — CNA/ms</p>

              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <span><strong>Saturday, August 2</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Labour chief Lim Swee Say has urged workers to work together to cope with a global economy which may be heading towards a state of stagflation — one sparked off by low growth and high inflation.</span></p>
              <p>The NTUC secretary general made the call in his National Day message.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s National Day is being celebrated amidst concerns about the slowing global economy and rising inflation, said Mr Lim.</p>
              <p>And to tackle these concerns, the labour movement, the employers and the government are addressing two core priorities.</p>
              <p>First, coping with the impact of inflation without being caught in a price—wage spiral.</p>
              <p>"The worse thing that any country does at a time of high inflation would be for the unions and workers to push for wage inflation. Wage inflation is different from wage increment. Wage inflation means you are pushing up wages to fully offset the inflation," said the labour chief.</p>
              <p>He added that companies in the unionised sector are currently in talks on their annual increment.</p>
              <p>One key consideration that is being taken into account in these negotiations is the current state of inflation.</p>
              <p>The labour movement noted that private sector companies in the unionised sector have been giving a higher percentage of built—in wage increases in the first half of this year compared to last year, with the figure in the range of 4.4 per cent against 3.8 percent in 2007.</p>

                  Where is the accountability in Singapore?''</em></p>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <p>Merrill compensates Temasek US$2.5 billion for drop in share</p>
              <p>price.So,it is genius for Temasek,share price up,it will
                                          gain.</p>
              <p>Share price drops,it will be compensated!!</p>
              <p>Will u all guys pl be more professional in discussion.</p>
              <p>Dunt just copy and paste without digestion.</p>
              <p>Temasek is not so stupid just to buy shares blindly and
                                          becomes</p>
              <p>Merrill's largest shareholder.</p>
              <p>When Temasek bought US$5 b shares sometimes back ,</p>
              <p>there was a capital protection provision</p>
              <p>that if Merrill issue share later at price lower than what
                                          Temasek</p>
              <p>bought,Merrill has to compensate Temasek fully.</p>
              <p>Now Merrill compensates Temasek US$2.5 b,</p>
              <p>though Temasek uses all 2.5 b to buy new issued shares.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UBS and CITI
                                          deals are just creditors--no loss yet</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The up or down of UBS and CITI shares are not affecting Temasek</p>
              <p>interest to be collected from these 2 giants,</p>
              <p>unless they go bust.</p>
              <p>I think our learned forumers here know what is creditor!!</p>
              <p>Up to today,Temasek are just lenders ,BUT NOT SHARE HOLDERS</p>
              <p>OF UBS and CITI.The reasons are many,among them</p>
              <p>is Temasek dunt know the full picture of subprime.</p>
              <p>But it is a once in few decades chance to get a big share in big
                                          and great</p>
              <p>companies.</p>
              <p>Temasek is vey cautious in UBS and CITI deals by becoming just a
                                          lender,</p>
              <p>but not a share holder.</p>
              <p>Previoulsy, it is suprised to me that Temasek bought</p>
              <p>Merrill share without protections.</p>
              <p>The truths are it incorporates price protection and ,i read</p>
              <p>from other news,that Temasek get dilutions protections also.</p>
