              <p><strong>Â Thank you message from CSJ</strong></p>
              <p>Tuesday, 17 June 2008</p>
              <p>Singapore Democrats<br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/posters_and_logos/democracy.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="right">Dear friends and supporters,<br><br>It's
              been an exceptional few weeks. The courtroom tension, the coffee-laden
              nights, and my conviction for speaking in public (my fifth one) will
              make May 2008 a month that will not be soon forgotten. And oh yes,
              there was also Siok Chin's and my imprisonment for contempt of court.<br><br>But rather than feel drained and despondent we are energised. For us the fight has only just begun.<br><br>And
              the one thing that keeps us going is your support. For this we say
              thank you. Your messages, articles, court attendance, presence at the
              vigils, etc are the oxygen that feeds the burning ambers of this
              campaign, ambers that will one day flare up into the bright flames of
              freedom and democracy.</p>
              <p><br>Ironically, however, the PAP is helping to fan the fire. Much of
              what we have been doing in the campaign would have gone largely
              unnoticed if not for the reaction of the PAP Government and its media.<br><br>The
              Government takes punitive action against my asociaties and I in the
              hope of deterring others from joining the cause. But it seems that the
              opposite is happening. For every time it cracks down on the campaign,
              our ranks grow. <br><br>This is because when right-thinking
              Singaporeans see the cruel hand of injustice being slammed down on
              defenders of democracy, they are sickened. Unable to look the other
              way, they step forward and say, "Count me in!" <br><br>Consider this:
              When I was first imprisoned in 1999 there was no such thing as a vigil.
              Last Friday, 30 people showed up, and several were new faces.<br><br>But
              why do these people stand up? Because they know that our future lies in
              a democratic and open political system. Sitting back and cowering in
              fear of the PAP is not going to bring about the change that we so
              desperately seek.<br><br>For the first time in the history of
              Singapore, citizens are coming alive because they see that there is
              indeed something that they can do to bring about such change. They are
              beginning to realise that if we apply ourselves strategically and
              intelligently, that if we persevere, we can succeed. They see the hope.<br><br>In
              other words people are beginning to realise that we are not completely
              powerless. They see that adversity can be turned into opportunity for
              further action. They see the liberating value of overcoming their fear.<br><br>In short, they see the power of collective Nonviolent Action.<br><br>This
              is why we are witnessing the growing number within the group of
              activists and party members. I work with such individuals and my heart
              brims with excitement when I see the eyes of these Singaporeans filled
              with determination and hope.<br><br>Among them are real patriots who do
              not look the other way when they see injustice committed. They will not
              keep silent. They are leaders.<br><br>They don't need tea sessions at
              the Istana or be head-hunted and bribed with million-dollar salaries.
              They step forward because they love this country and want to serve its
              cause.<br><br>The days of living in a system of unquestioning obedience
              to Mr Lee Kuan Yew are numbered. This much is clear. Singaporeans are
              no longer willing to be dragged hither and thither just so PAP can
              maintain its grip on power.<br><br>Many more will join this campaign of
              change before the end of this decade. This is not an idle boast or
              words born of machismo. It is an observation made from hard examination
              of reality. In an age where the world is clamouring for openness and
              participation, and where technology now facilitates such practices, Lee
              Kuan Yew's PAP is desperately out of sync.<br><br>It is clearly not
              possible to rule Singapore the way it was last century. Singaporeans,
              especially the younger ones, have seen the benefits of a democratic
              system and they want it for themselves. More important, they are
              willing to make sacrifices for it.<br><br>To be sure, the journey to
              democracy is still long and the travails many. We must not lose heart
              when the going gets rough. We must press on. Our goal cannot be
              achieved it if we remain submissive and timid. As long as we, the foot
              soldiers of justice and democracy, determine not to relent in the
              pursuit of our dream there can be but only one outcome in our struggle.<br><br>Let us fight with passion and courage. But let us also fight with grace and dignity.<br><br>I
              glanced through some of the things written about me by the press over
              the least week or so. Of course, this is not the first time that
              epithets have been thrown at me. But the degree of venom this time
              round is surprising.<br><br>The appeal to (pseudo) medical grounds in a
              concerted and coordinated manner to further blacken my person is
              unprecedented and quite without shame. Just when you think that the low
              road cannot get any lower, it takes another dip.<br><br>How do I retaliate? I shall not. Because to do so would be to engage in the politics of evil that I detest.<br><br>Instead,
              I want to focus on the objectives that we have set out to achieve, to
              reform our political system into one where both ruling and opposition
              parties have a role to play to build up Singapore, and where both
              camps, even as they fight tooth and nail, acknowledge that both have
              the interest of Singapore at heart.<br><br>This latest media blitz on
              me is, however, not totally negative. At the very least, it provides
              Singaporeans a glimpse into the level of anxiety with which the regime
              views this campaign for political reform.<br><br>A government assured
              of its position and legitimacy will not react in such a crazed manner.
              On the other hand dictatorial regimes, desperate to stymie democratic
              change, often resort to spreading poison about their opponents and
              dissidents.<br><br>This is something that activists and reformers
              should take heart from. We are obviously doing something right to earn
              such vile disapprobation from the rulers.<br><br>I take this
              opportunity to thank you again for all your support. I will not tire of
              speaking up for what is just and right. I hope you won't either. <br> <br> In the next few days, I would like to spend a little more time with my
              children. Their being away in Taiwan, the time spent in court and my
              subsequent imprisonment has ravaged my time with them this school
              holiday break. I look forward to being a normal father with them these
              next few days. At least, there are three little people in Singapore who
              think I'm sane.<br> <br> I wish you all the very  best.<br><br> In solidarity,<br> <br> Chee Soon Juan</p>

              Kuan Yew decided to engage in such denigration of Chee Soon Juan on
              more than one occasion. His name calling of him as being a psychopath
              reflects his ignorance as to what a psychopath is.</span></span></span></p>
