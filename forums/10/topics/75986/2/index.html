            <div class='col-md body'>I thikn this is a pretty good idea... however I think the number of people enroled in it will not be enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The only use I see for such a school is when their parents had lost control of their children. No matter how they talked, how they spend time with them or whatever they do, the children just keep creating havoc... In such situations, the parents may not know what to do too. Having such a school may instill discipline into these youngsters and forcefully staighten their life to be good...<br><br>Just think of this scenario. There is this child, after the parents have neglect or didn't pay attention for a while, becomes a "gangster". He skips school, involves in fight, throw packets of drinks at the blackboard while the teacher is writing on it, play truant etc. The parents realise this and try to correct their negligience. However it seems too late as their son do not listen to them anymore, no matter how much effort they made and what they do. This son of theirs just keep playing involves in fight, visit prostitutes, loiter around, steal the family money, beat up his own younger brother etc. I have heard of sad cases where the son use a knife and pointed at the mum neck, blackmailing the father to give him money. What should the parents do in such cases ?<br><br>I believe forcing these kids into military schools where they will be forcefully change may be the best option available... Sad but true... This is life...</div>

If that works, then there wouldn't be hard core criminals in the first place. If sending over them to a disciplined miltary schools, it may forge a sense of discipline into them so as to change their way. In the past they have too much freedom and took things from granted. They never know what future they should seek. If they went to a military school, they are slammed into the cold facts of reality and knows they cannot do things just because they want to. Of course this will turn out to be an issue that deals about psychology.<br><br>Democracy ? I think we better fix the basis on how to live in a society first.</div>

If they do not like their jobs or got themselves injured during training, they cannot have another equally good option available for them.<br><br>Training can make out good officers ? That is true. However how much time should be given to them ? 10 months just purely training up the army aspects of an individual seems to be... sufficient. They too have training for another year of practical training when they are assign to a unit before they get to ORD too. If by your suggestions, that these people need to study as well, I can foresee they do not have the time to do all these 3 areas well. (Tactical, fitness, academic). You may say that the officers that graduate from OCS sucks big time, but then what further improvements should be implemented ? How effective these implementation will be ? Instead of looking at the bad side, there are also wonderful officers that had graduate from OCS. The main problem of it is not the training provided but the fact that they let more academics, who are relatively more used to the softer part in life, to be in OCS...<br><br>Improving on individual strengths, organizational learning and flatter structures to improve flexibility on the ground... I think instead of asking discipline people who has lived through the old system to change the system, it may be wiser to let a new, more creative and had experience in outside privatises organisation to lead the changes. That is asking people who had graduate from the "normal" university to see to the improvment of the structure of the army. Being more focus in training etc just make them more used to the old system and relectant to introduce any new changes.<br><br><blockquote>Westpoint was brought up as an example earlier as a prestigious military academy... it has trained officers, generals and presidents in the USA.<br><br>if we can think about a sports school, and a music school, why can't we think along the same lines and conceive of a military school as well? school CCA offers sports and music as well... but is that enough?<br><br>a diverse and intellectually mature society has to recognise different strains of talents and offer the right opportunities for young minds to develop them.<br><br>could it be because that we dislike our military so much that we do not see the skills needed to run a military as being unique in itself and worthy of a specialised training school? </blockquote>That is an example in USA. China or other powerful countries have such school as well. However there is a difference between USA, China and Singapore. USA and China citizens do not serve NS. They do not undergo 2.5 years of training. They need a school to specially train people into officers. This is already something we have, OCS. We too have "potential president" that came from OCS too.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am going to just give a short reply on it<br><br><blockquote>10 mths in OCS is NOT ENOUGH </blockquote>Plus the 1.5 year practical training in real military units. I guess that makes it sufficient. You can extend the course if you so desire, however do you think the result will improved a lot ?<br><br><blockquote>a narrow "army-aspect" is not sufficient. at best, it teaches one how to act like a puke with a chocolate bar, not behave like a proper officer and gentleman. i think that it doesn't even ensure a minimum level of competency. </blockquote>WHat do you think they should further include ? What does the other military schools teaches that OCS doesn't ?<br><br><blockquote>why not? it depends how long is your course and how u break it down. lets not kid ourselves... when i was taking "a" levels, i had the time of my life... 3 "a" and 2 "ao" isn't bad. i had time to go canoeing, go mucking around orchard road, go home play doom2 (that's how old i am  ) chat on the phone for hours, etc etc... and i still got decent grades  </blockquote>Well... probably you are gifted and you do not need much time to study. However one need to take note that when one is training in <strong>OCS</strong>, does he have the time to play CS, canoeing or mucking around in orchard rd ? I don't think they even have the time to sleep.<br><br><blockquote>i already said... the point is not to have the occassional wild-card, but to ensure that all who go through officer's training are at least minimally competent...<br><br>its not a question of academically inclined versus the rest... academically inclined pple are not "softer" by nature, but that the demands of soldiering requires them to undergo some adjustments which OCS in unable to accomplish in 10 months. </blockquote>There are many people that went through OCS. Not all of them are performed badly after they graduate from it. As I said in my previous points, the quality of people from OCS are not due to the improper training but due to the poor quality (army quality) of people entering in the school. There is nothing wrong with it with the school or its short period of training in the first place.<br><br><blockquote>might a military school help that by training pple who have in depth knowledge of military organization and insights AND old-boy's networks help this situation? it might... they're already pretty immersed by the end of it. some might go off to uni on scholarships or disruption for uni, and they come back armed with more knowledge to apply. </blockquote>That is very interesting. There has always been many officers in the military now and had done nothing to change the system they had adapted to. True, they may be the one that can "change" the environment, however they are the one that DO NOT want to change it. In fact they are probably the ones that resists any changes.<br><br><blockquote>so if u get clueless newbies who might be graduates and smarty pants by any measure, but that doesn't mean that they'll be most equipped to bring in new, workable ideas. </blockquote>How about "experienced and successful" businessmen from other organisation that had gone through a "normal" university education ?<br><br><blockquote>i see a military school as a parallel structure to improve and complement the situation, not replace it... OCS will still be there, but pple with the army as a career in mind might want to have the choice of an education more focused, and a little earlier. </blockquote>Why "more focused" and "earlier" ? When they are 16, their bodies are not even fully developed yet. Why not let them make a choice after they gone through NS and know what is like serving in the army rather than they just get all these ideas from TV or games ? After going through NS, if they really like it, then they can sign on and be an officer. Now the system, instead of asking students to focus on physicial, discipline, academic SIMULTANEOUSLY, they can concentrate fully on academic first during JC or Poly before fully focusing themselves on the army aspect during NS. IMO taking things one step at a time provides better result than attempting to work on all areas at a single go.<br><br>Is one school, OCS really that insufficient to cope with the number of potential officers ? Why waste money, land, resources, manpower to open up another school when the other one is under utilised ?<br><br><blockquote>to reconcile my point with yours, i say the existing structure can be positively complemented by one more path. we need not assume that the existing system is perfect... </blockquote>From my point of view, our system, though imperfect, is already the best possible solution. Opening up a new school for people to join the army ? How many people will go there in the first place ? How many officers are needed by the SAF per year ? How enticing does joining in the army appears to normal citizens ? I guess they need at most a few hundreds which have already been cater by one school, OCS. Extending the time for training just decrease the number of people joining the army as it inevitably extend the length of their contracts.</div>

It is regrettable to acknowledge that beyond youth homes run by MCDS and the limited number of counseling avenues, there are too few other alternatives that can offer a stronger medicine apart from counseling. And due to the established procedures, there are also many cases whereby society can do little about.<br><br>Take the sentencing of a delinquent youth who has been sent into a Home, subsequently released but is still unrepentant for example.<br><br>Without repeated offences or a valid court order, even the parents of the delinquent youth might be helpless to do anything more to the kid. What is persistent will be a rebellious mentality, and unless private counseling is opted for voluntarily, the social structure canÂ’t just step in to intervention and implore for alternate judgments to be meted out on the kid for the harboring of an rebellious and non-mainstream mentality.<br><br>Perhaps the only legal course of action available will be a prolonged and entangling series of recurring talks, with varying degree which might included even those as provided by the Prison Service, and these will all certainly be prescribed with direct relation to a delinquentÂ’s breach of law and order. But apart from that, we are unable to carry out any more pressing forms of corrective actions on such youth delinquents in the absence of a criminal breach of law, without infringing into their basic human right and raising hell with the tyrannical style of approach.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">I will question too on the strength or intensity of the corrective session in relation to overwriting delinquents rebellious nature and sometimes lack of plain discipline and arrogance. </div></blockquote>Hi^5. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">How are you going to reorientate the youth's sense of lost direction ? Is solely talking and counseling a fool proof method of achieving this ? Why not steal off their arrogance, cut off their rebellious nature slam them into the hard facts of reality during military training while in the meantime, provide counselling and talk ? Work on both field at the same time. They will be more receptive then isn't it ? </div></blockquote>The conventional approach and strategy has emphasized mainly on courses of actions to recondition a subjectÂ’s mental phenomena, values and precognitive towards society.<br><br>Your emphasis and stand on sending delinquents into a military school works along the concept of Â‘softening the iron first Â– before hammering it out into moldÂ’, which in essence is truly the crucial element for any corrective attempts.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with the ultimate technical effectiveness of this approach.<br><br>However since the ultimate end goal is for a delinquent to be able to re-enter society again as a better individual, wouldnÂ’t you agree that using a civic setting as the platform for reorientation and reforming work will come better over a military platform?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">To comply and conform is needed before reflect and correct. If they do not comply or listen to any words or meet willingly to a councellor, will their words get in and make them reflect and correct ? </div></blockquote>I think the balance between compliance, conformity, reflection and correction will have to be a continuous process within which all 4 elements must be employed in a balanced and mutually supporting manner.<br><br>To be fair to the issue in discussion, excessive reliance on either the Comply and Conform Approach or the Reflect and Correct Approach will probably result in either further resistance buildup for the C&amp;C Approach and deliberate oblivious for the R&amp;C Approach.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">Is being a criminal, drug addicts or wasting their youth in fights and jails consider an option in life for them ? We should be pulling them onto the right path, not telling them what they had done is their own free will and we have no rights to care for them. </div></blockquote>I am still for the eradication of vice and delinquent mentalities and activities although the personal opinion is that a military boot camp style of approach might come to feel as being slightly overboard.<br><br>So YES. I am for the your stand to pull them back onto the right and orthodox path in Life.<br><br>However, we would also have to remind ourselves of just how deep we should go into such efforts without becoming overbearing down onto another.<br><br>If I were to put this into analogy, it be like describing the case of pulling a delinquent out back on track as the stopping of a car going in reverse where the road at the rear ends with a sharp drop into a valley.<br><br>But apart from getting the car to brake and going into neutral, I cannot force the car to proceed forward in a direction where I personally wish for it to go in.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">I guess my earlier phrasing of statement is a bit bad... What I am trying to say is whether being a nice fellow and resort only to counselling a better method or giving them trainings on discipline and after their trainings they start to receive counseling.<br><br>Therefore this question deals with psychology on people.
