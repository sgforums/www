If such a boot camp can help a delinquent to change his ways, find a family among friends in a more condusive enviroment, I do not se any harm in it. I know alot of guys from broken families finding real kinship in army and till now we are the closest of friends, even closer than our own siblings. And let's say if the person as you put it excel in the school and attain a scholarship to furthur his studies and even get a respectable job in army, I see it something to cheer about. Being a professional soldier requires commitment that is on par with professions like teaching and social work, and sometimes we have to pay our life doing it. If we can get delinquents to achieve that level of thinking and commitment, I would say that we have succeeded in our roles as educators.<br><br>As for the RI or RGS issue, well they are blessed with better academic skills or better families...we cannot fault them on that...they too have skills that are lacking compare to us who have gone through the school of hard knocks. We each have our own set of skills and we serve our own individual roles in society for the common good ultimately.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if we introduce the idea across all schools it may be unacceptable. However if we restrict it to one or two schools maybe we can truly see if anything benificial wil come out of it. However I believe the main concern will be the potential abuse of power by those who run the school. However, it is giving parents too much interference in schools of today that the kids are getting out of hand. A good way will be to have an open carrot and stick system so that parents will abide by the decisions made when the school decides to mete out justified punishment to the would be rule breaker. But of course, the above presumes that those in power are fair and just.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now this certainly is an interesting issue to discuss about.<br><br>Personally, I am in favor of a Military School but itÂ’ll not be the type that places more emphasis on reshaping and reconditioning young delinquents dropout from mainstream school back into their classrooms.<br><br>Just as the Sports School or the Art School has been tasked with additional responsibilities to attain apart from mere academic achievements, the establishment of a military school would certainly be a boost to the standards of future potential professional soldiers.<br><br>Apart from the inculcation of discipline and loyalty, an earlier age entrant into the service of the SAF would also certainly help to see a higher number of officers who would be capable and competent enough to be promoted faster as compared to current, all without compromise to the level of experience and people management skills.<br><br>I acknowledge however, that will also be issues that could make the proposal unlikely to face implementation though.<br><br>For example, taking note of Â’s views that the school could be made open to ASEAN nationalities, I canÂ’t help but to be a little apprehensive about this aspect.<br><br>While I recognize the validity in ,Â’s point out on the small domestic size of a potential intake, I fear to an even greater extend that in an arising of future tension or hostility between nations in ASEAN, generals and lieutenants serving in a potential enemy camp that is hostile towards us would one day used the knowledge that they have learnt from us Â– to fight against us.<br><br>And another area of concern is the question of how graduates or alumni from this Military School will see their role in Singapore beyond their immediate office.<br><br>If there were to be some military school officers who have decided to join in as MPs or other non-military offices / departments in the civil service, who likely is their strong military background likely to impact on the manner, considerations and priorities for a civic matter?<br><br>In view of the potential key roles that officers from the Military School is likely to hold in office, what will the chances also, of an opportunity creation for an elitist power concentration in Parliament, or even in extreme but highly unlikely scenario - a coup happening?<br><br>Of course this is a hypothetical Â‘what-ifÂ’.<br><br>But IÂ’ll really be interested to know, what if it really happens?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And just my 2 cents on the delinquency children in the mainstream schools, maybe if the schools wish to try emphasizing more on discipline, they would be able to achieve this goal better thru :<br><br>1)	Making the average class size smaller, which is supposed to be done from next year,<br>2)	Redesigning a teacherÂ’s work scope into sub specializations eg. HOD, English, Math, Sciences, and Welfare / Disciple, instead of the complete generic functions type which is often the current case. And finally,<br>3)	If they are still not satisfied from the results which (1) and (2) will be able to give them, maybe they might wish to include more disciplined sports such as TKD or Judo to the students?<br><br>Of course we have to balance the degree of discipline desired against what is realistic.<br><br>Cleary mainstream schools must not be abused into instruments that resemble more of a military youth camp than an ordinary civic educational institute.<br><br></div>

Singapore does have such a school, SAFEC. We can improve on this system and make such schools more prestigious and attractive like handing out scholarships and giving appliciants a good career in the Armed forces or even some defense related industries. These schools can be made boarding schools to allow the students to develop close bonds and may to some extend make them more discipline and independent.
