It appears that we need a population of 6 to 8 million to have the critical mass for a local economy. As it is, with only 4 million population, our local retails sales still depend heavily on tourists. Singapore is like hongkong 20yrs ago with 4 million ppl but today we now have a higher standard of living and our local economy needs to be even stronger and vibrant than HongKong 20 yrs ago. Unfortunately high growth in tourism will be difficult to maintain in view of the high costs here and growth in neighbouring countries.<br><br>I believe with proper planning singapore can house 8 million without problem, but landed properties will be reserved for the super rich and driving a car will also be for the rich, and the taxi drivers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  like New York, tokyo, london, hongkong.....<br><br></div>

Specifically if you want to research on this topic, go meet ppl in clubs like the American Club, The French Business Association, talk to mothers picking up kids at Australian International School or the United World College, or talk to the Japs at SICC or TMCC (not many of them there now), you will get a better picture.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SnowFlag:But most dun want to become citizens unless they are from troubled countries[/b]</blockquote> Expats here refer to mostly the angmoh, they come here with big fat benefits, want to stay as long as possible but there is no intention to stay here. I believe these expats are also called FT, but when we complain about FT, we are only complaining about those who came from China, Philippines, India or Sri Lanka. Actually, these angmoh expats are the higher costs in companies. The Asian FT are usually not called expats and their packages are much much lower than those from the western countries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SnowFlag:Hv u consider real cases where GLC retrenched Singaporeans for foreigners.

It is not just in GLC but all companies here, foreigners are replacing singaporean. If we were replaced by ppl, local or FT because they are more capable, or at least cheaper, we probably gam guan. But if you were replaced by some chao angmoh, sent from HQ, don't know any asian culture and languages, only doing something locals can do as well or better, and at much higher costs, how do you feel?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>It is therefore annoying to hear ppl say that many expats decide just to tahan for the time being.</div>
