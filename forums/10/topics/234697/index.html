Jayakumar to meet with Thaksin in spite of their awareness that such act would grossly upset Bangkok.<br><br>"<strong>Singapore doesn't really care about the opinion of its neighbours," said Mahathir, adding that the decision was "unfeeling and not sympathetic".<br><br>"Singapore believes the most important thing is what profits Singapore," he said.</strong><br><br>Thai-Singapore relation has hit one of its lowest points following the controversial meeting. The Foreign Ministry insisted that it has given the island-state prior warning about Thailand's strong objection to the meeting.<br><br>Two weeks ago, army chief General Sonthi Boonyaratglin accused Singapore of spying on Thailand by eaves dropping on telephone conversations, adding more fuel to what was billed as already a difficult situation between the two countries.<br><br>"That's the kind of things they do," Mahathir said. The Singaporean government dismissed Sonthi's claim.<br><br>When asked about his 22 years of dealing with Singapore, Mahathir said "You'll get no where with them either being nice or being tough, they only think of themselves," Mahathir said.<br><br>Nevertheless, Mahathir said both sides to patch things up but "in away that is honorable", which, he said, should start with an apology from Singapore.<br><br>The former Malaysian leader said he would welcome a meeting with Thaksin only if the former Thai premier asked for it. But Mahathir quickly downplayed the idea, saying "I don't have anything to discuss with him.<br><br>Thaksin has publicly praised Mahathir as his role model during his time in office.<br><br>"Although he has said I was his friend and he wants to follow my way. But many of his ways are not my way," Mahathir said.<br><br>Thaksin has been living in exile since his ouster in September. The former premier has launched a media campaign to discredit the military-appointed government in Bangkok and the junta itself, accusing them of mismanagement and being undemocratic.<br><br>Singapore's investment firm Temasek Holdings purchase of Thaksin family-controlled Shin Corp. in January had triggered an outcry in Thailand and exploded into a national scandal that led to his downfall after it was disclosed that the family paid no taxes on the Bt73-billion deal.<br><br>The deal allowed the Singaporean investment fund, Temasek to control operation of mobile phone, Satellite and television network, which the junta deemed as a possible access to security concern areas,<br><br>Mahathir said Thailand had benefited economically under Thaksin but added that his handlings of policy and controversies were not very diplomatic.<br><br>Mahthir dismissed suggestion that Thakisin had followed his footstep by meddling with press freedom. He said his outspokenness against Western countries has put him in a bad light with the foreign press.<br><br>Don Pathan<br><br>The Nation<br><br>Langkawi, Malaysia<br></blockquote>2.Dr M likes talking,like me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I admire Dr Mahathir for he has the weight to talk as he likes...........Many things that he had mentioned, some are with common sense and human touch.<br><br>Being as a human......No matter how knowledgable, powerful and rich you are, you will still have dilemma, quandary and predicament in what you are doing.<br><br>This is a vicious circle of human beings.....ones or their descendant(s)<br>will never be always knowledgable, powerful and rich through out.<br>Any energy that exerted there will be bound to have reactions.<br>It is just a matter of time.<br><br>That's why I said.  Ones do not have to be proud, too happy, arrogant, greedy, power hungry over what he or she is doing.  You can't bring all that with you when time to say GOODBYE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree, I do find our Gov sometimes lacking in human touch, sometimes, just arrogant too.  However, I read what Dr M comments on Thialand issues last night and was wondering, as he always cliam, SG don't listen to neighbours, profit coomes 1st... arrogant, proud, etc....<br><br>May I asked, Dr M in time past also behave the same way towards SG too.  And rightfully claiming MALAY RIGHTS, feeling proud of it telling SG malay in SG being marginalised.  However, what did he do in his own backyard? ,.. ,go read about it from their blog.. even the media has to copuy article from blog to post it in their online news....  Yet he claim SG should not do this, tat as neighbour... but yet he is adding fuel into the fire right now.  You call yourself neigbhour? what sort of neigbhour are you?  loads of hypocrsy!!</div>
