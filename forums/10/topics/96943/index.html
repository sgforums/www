            <div class='col-md body'>Chewren of Singapore are really deprived.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2389" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2389</a><br><br>Policy Watch<br><span class="large"><strong>Much Ado About Nothing, S'pore eases chewing gum ban</strong></span><br>(Sg_Review and AP)<br><br>28 May 2004<br>When an entire nation state celebrates the "liberalisation" of such basic rights, it is a sad reflection of the sorry state of human rights in Singapore. Singapore street cleaners are already complaining about finding wads of gum on the pavements.<br>Ultra-tidy Singapore is lifting its notorious ban on chewing gum after 12 long years -- but only for registered users.<br>Gum dealers face jail if they break the rules.<br><br>Before Singaporeans think about unwrapping a pack of the Wrigley's Orbit gum that's just started selling here -- and only in pharmacies -- they have to submit their names and ID card numbers.<br><br>If they don't, pharmacists who sell them gum could be jailed up to two years and fined S$5,000 ($2,940).<br><br>This Southeast Asian city-state, known for its immaculate streets and tight social controls, outlawed the manufacture, import and sale of chewing gum in 1992 after the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, complained that it was fouling streets, buildings, buses and subway trains.<br><br>Lee, 80, stepped down as prime minister in 1990 but still wields considerable influence under the title "senior minister."<br><br>Gum became a sticking point months ago in Singapore's free trade talks with Washington, when Representative Philip Crane of the U.S. state of Illinois -- home of chewing gum giant Wrigley -- pressed the issue.<br><br>Singapore compromised, agreeing to allow only the sale of "therapeutic" gum in pharmacies. The free trade pact took effect on January 1.<br><br>The Health Sciences Authority, responding to questions from The Associated Press, said it had allowed the sale of 19 "medicinal" and "dental" gum products.<br><br>Wrigleys' Orbit, which the company claims is good for teeth, hit pharmacy shelves just days ago.<br><br>Pfizer's Nicorette, a nicotine gum meant to help smokers kick their addiction, has been available since March.<br><br>Nicorette costs $S19 ($11) for a pack of 30 pieces. A pack of Orbit goes for S$1.60 ($0.94).<br><br>Singaporeans, many of whom have long derided the chewing gum ban, seemed unimpressed by the change.<br><br>"It's ridiculous that it's easier for 16-year-olds to visit prostitutes than it is to get chewing gum here," said 22-year old college student Fayen Wong.<br><br>Prostitution is legal in parts of Singapore -- and no registration is required.<br><br>"Why would I go through the trouble of getting nicotine gum if I can buy a pack of cigarettes without giving my name?" said Wong. "I don't think the new rules will help smokers to quit."<br><br>Change of image<br><br>The Straits Times newspaper, which has close government ties, said on Sunday that street cleaners have already been complaining about the return of spent wads of chewing gum to their once pristine pavements.<br><br>Singapore has been at pains in recent years to shed its "nanny state" image and promote itself as a hip, cosmopolitan hub for media and the arts in Asia.<br><br>But this has proven a difficult task in a country where films and television shows are often censored, home satellite TV antennae are banned and various books, magazines and even popular songs are outlawed.<br><br>Fines are levied for spitting or failing to flush public toilets.<br><br>Critics of restrictions have often cited the chewing gum ban as an example of the government's excesses.<br><br>But the partial legalization of gum is "really a non-event," said Koh Beng Liang, 25, a research engineer who said he hasn't yet bothered having a legal chew.<br><br>"Singaporeans will quickly realize it if the so-called loosening up is for foreign image, and not real change," Koh said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If chewing gum is really a nuisance at public places or MRT stations or trains, let's try to introduce appropriate controls at such places. Sometimes, simple housekeeping will solve problems. Why ban chewing gum entirely?<br><br>If certain behaviour is bad or a threat to public order or harmful to society as a whole, let's try education and impose control on those who are really responsible with proofs and evidences to solve problems.<br><br>So it will be like using a sledge hammer to kill the fly by making all HDB dwellers guilty or presumed to be guilty of negligence in maintaining windows just because of some instances of poorly installed windows. There are too many causes for windows' poor maintenance or conditions. So why generalise or seek some scapegoats to punish? Isn't forebearance sometimes better governance. We can let the ordinary common law proofs take it course when it comes to negligence instead of doctoring the negligence rule.<br><br>To impose all kinds of rules and conditions continuously from the past era to today is not creative or entrepreneurial. To liberalize, HDB and LTA have plenty to learn how solve problems in their context instead of resorting to general sweeping rules and regulations or giving unresponsive replies to public suggestions on improving safety etc.<br><br>Government departments should not opt out of responsibility of management by making people or general public responsible as witnessed by increasing instance of Management Corporations taking over responsibilities for certain wrongs when the management corporations have no power to contain such problems including impositions of proxy responsibility on them when relevant departments have been set up or civil servants paid in the first place to solve them more creatively, e.g. onerous fire regulations etc.<br><br>Such tendency may arise from the same sweeping rules and regulations due to assumptions and top-down approach.<br><br>All the social and cultural restrictions will get tighter unless someone higher up knows about this tendency to opt out of duties and responsibilities to proxies. Good governance should be aimed at education and good management to solve problems at the root or making those clearly responsible for harmful acts instead of more and more prohibitions of all kinds as seen in the chewing gum and such-like rules and regulations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
