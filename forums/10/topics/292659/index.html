Picture: JONATHAN CHOO, SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br>The makeshift barber he goes to offered an idyllic view under a big tree, by a canal along Boon Lay Way.<br><br>'Not very cheap,' said Mashud, 26, who earns $18 a day.<br><br>After all, haircuts in his hometown, Dhaka, costs only $1.<br><br>At 6pm, his barber, a Chinese retiree in his 60s, appeared from a block of flats and started walking down a footpath along the canal.<br><br>Slung over his shoulder was an old barber's chair. In his hand was a small toolbox.<br><br>As he walked, he waved at a few foreign workers, asking them to gather. Only Mashud followed. The others just stared.<br><br>Mashud said: 'It's my first haircut in Singapore. I've been here only 20 days.'<br><br>He was given a broken mirror to hold.<br><br>After he gestured to the barber how he preferred his hair to be cut, the barber produced a shaver from his box and started to work on his head, leaving clumps of hair on the grass.<br><br>'I will clear the hair afterwards,' said the barber, who refused to give his name.<br><br>But he revealed this much: He was from China, and had migrated to Singapore with his son and family a few months ago.<br><br>And yes, he was formerly a barber.<br><br>He said he was bored, and had decided on his impromptu business a few weeks ago after noticing foreign workers cutting each other's hair at the canal.<br><br>So he goes there in the evenings, or during the weekends - whenever he feels up to it.<br><br>The stretch is about 3km from foreign worker dormitories at Soon Lee Road, and is a place where the workers frequently go to relax.<br><br>The New Paper observed the barber for about 90 minutes yesterday. In that time, he had three customers - all Bangladeshi workers.<br><br>'A few others also provide this service on the opposite bank. I am not the only one in this business,' he said in Mandarin.<br><br>He kicked up a fuss when his pictures were taken, saying he did not welcome them.<br><br>'I am a Singapore PR, why are you taking my pictures?' he asked.<br><br>Aram, a 23-year-old Bangladesh construction worker, said a canteen near his dormitory provides haircuts for $5.<br><br>While this canal barber is cheaper, the drawback is he cannot understand English, according to Aram.<br><br>'It's difficult to describe exactly how I want my hair to be cut.'<br><br>So he bargained with the barber and paid only $2.<br><br>Mashud, who realised later that he had paid double the amount, simply shrugged.<br><br>'I am new to this country,' he said.<br><br></div>

He also quite scared. In business, its not so much are you able to do the job but can a younger and cheaper person do the same job for less or the same and being non-family man, does not use the excuse of applying leave to attend to children matters and no need to use excuse of cannot come to work on holidays and weekends due to children.<br><br>Its a no brainer that as you grow older , your market value and employability generally goes down even though you continue to be experienced.<br><br>Of course, this rule does not apply 100 % everyone but in general as said.<br><br>For rexamper, if you inherited from someone.<br>or you have family connections.<br>or you have certain membership.<br>or you have sarkar'ed  (3-legged) enough already.<br></div>
