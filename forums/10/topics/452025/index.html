              <div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Progressive property taxes for a progressive society</strong></span><br> ... because rich Singaporeans and Foreigners shouldn't luxuriate at the expense of the poor.<br> <br> On 03May2012, a Singaporean offered to sell his 12000 sqft(built-in),  20000 sqft / (land) bungalow for $108Million <strong>'S$108m for a Sentosa Cove home'</strong> [<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120509-0000071/S%24108m-for-a-Sentosa-Cove-home">TODAY, 09May2012</a>].<br> <br> According to 'How is property tax computed' [<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=2094">IRAS, 2Dec2011</a>], owner occupied residential properties [<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=2378">criteria</a>] since 1Jan2011 are taxed as follows:<br> Annual Value:Tax Rate:<br> First $6,000:0%; Next $59,000:4%; Amount exceeding $65,000:6%<br> <br> The current Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate in Singapore is a flat 7% 
              for all goods and services provided by GST registered companies/ 
              services. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_%28Singapore%29">Wiki:Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)</a>]: "<em>[GST] was increased to its current rate of 7% on 1 July 2007"</em>.<br> <br> Thus begging the question, shouldn't a large and luxurious bungalow in Singapore, where  according to <strong>'Public housing in Singapore'</strong> [<a href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1585_2009-10-26.html">NLB, 15Oct2009</a>]: <em>"It is estimated that more than 80% of Singapore's resident population now live in public housing..."</em> <strong><span style="color: red;">an obvious luxury</span></strong> be taxed at a rate equal or more than necessities utilized by all/ the poor (food, medicine, water)?<br> <br> The definition of 'Owner Occupied' also begs clarification. Does a 
              foreigner using a Singapore property for property for investment (price 
              appreciation)/ holiday use (2weeks/ annum) but otherwise vacant also 
              qualify for the said owner occupied property tax concessions- how would 
              IRAS know given that taxes are charged prospectively rather than 
              retrospectively? Shouldn't the efficient use of space whether rented or 
              private be equally rewarded? - Why are property renters being 
              unnecessarily penalized?<br> <br> According to IRAS, the usual property tax rate for tenanted and vacant 
              residential properties is 10%: does this artificially distorted tax rate
               then cause property rentals to increase thus forcing all Singaporeans 
              (PRs and foreigners) to own their own properties- a key source of 
              inflation of property prices overall? Are the prices of property rentals
               in Singapore thus inflated, can property prices in Singapore be 
              accurate if property rentals in Singapore are actually inflated?<br> <br> If the intention of charging owners of vacant/ tenanted properties a 
              higher tax rate was on the premise that such properties were owned by 
              rich people, then wouldn't the owner of a $108Million Sentosa cove 
              bungalow be a case of a very rich underpaying for his luxury in a land 
              where food and medicine is taxed unwaveringly at 7%? The government must
               be nuts if not corrupt for tax rates on the poor to exceed those for 
              the rich.<br> <br> In 1Q2012, an Indian national bought surgeon Susan Lim's Sentosa bungalow for $39Million <strong>'Indian national buys Susan Lim's Sentosa Cove home for $39 million'</strong> [<a href="http://business.asiaone.com/Business/My%2BMoney/Property/Story/A1Story20120302-331133.html">BT, 02Mar2012</a>],
               assuming a 3% rental pricing based on cost, the annual value of the 
              S$39M bungalow would be $1.17Million. If the owner were to be charged 
              standard 7%GST on $1.17M, the amount would be $81.9K but based on 
              current owner occupied concessionary rates, the Indian national owning 
              the said bungalow would pay only [(6k*0)+(59k*0.04)+(1.105M*0.06)]= <strong>$68.66K</strong>,
               which is a $13.24K discount compared to if a flat 7% had been charged. 
              With necessities of poorer Singaporeans attracting 7% GST, for what 
              reason should the rich Indian expat be luxuriating on Sentosa whilst 
              enjoying tax <strong>discounts amounting $13.24K p.a.</strong>? Politicians have 
              betrayed the poor in Singapore by choosing to tax necessities of the 
              poor more than luxuries enjoyed by the rich.<br> <br> The current high property prices in Singapore is also a significant depressant on Singaporean birth rates: <strong>'Housing woes affecting birth rates'</strong> [<a href="http://blog.iproperty.com.sg/housing-woes-affecting-birth-rates/">ST, 05Sept2011</a>]: <em>"Although the fertility rate is stubbornly less responsive to many factors, it is possible that <a href="http://blog.iproperty.com.sg/time-to-revisit-hdb-policies/">sustaining housing affordability</a> may help at least in arresting the precipitous decline in the fertility rate"</em> certainly requisites urgent reconsideration if Singaporean birth rates are to be encouraged.<br> <br> In view of this significant asset inequality (as consequent to growing income inequality [<a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2012/04/worsening-income-inequality-in-singapore/">link</a>]) in Singapore, it is suggested that any increase in property taxes collected in going forwards be <span style="color: red;"><strong>REDISTRIBUTED EQUALLY </strong></span>amongst ALL Singapore citizens (aged 0-120yrs) with PRs (residing here at least 182 days or more) receiving about half as a <strong>'National Cohesion Dividend' (NCD)</strong> used firstly to settle property taxes/ rental of flats from HDB as the 
              case might be with the excess channeled to CPF (some OA/ dividend 
              account perhaps)- some low income households sharing cramped quarters 
              might well find themselves with some extra cash given to the fact that 
              the property taxes on their lodgings do not amount to much whilst 
              singles living in expansive bungalows and foreigners speculating in 
              Singapore properties would see their tax bill increased due to fewer (or
               zero) occupants sharing the tax- property would then be used more 
              efficiently, perhaps freeing up some for the market. Those who want more
               comfort or prestige would just have to pay for the luxury whilst those 
              who live with less would enjoy the fruits of this asset re-distribution 
              procedure: overnight, <strong>Singaporeans would find citizenship TWICE as meaningful as it was before</strong> and foreigners would compete for Singapore citizenship/ PR status which
               of course Singaporeans must keep a finger on to avoid dilution of 
              everyone's NCD- however, too steep a fall in property prices locally 
              would also cause tax revenues to fall as conversely affect the NCD so 
              Singaporeans cannot be too fussy either. <br> The CPF dividend account would then be usable for paying certain fees or
               withdrawal (joblessness/ insurance/ CC activities/ self improvement/ 
              medical treatment/ other allowable dues within limits as assessed by 
              government social workers)<br> <br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P_dV47RVSxc/T6nQF5pLhvI/AAAAAAAAAiM/RpaiyNSZF20/s1600/Bungalow+House+For+Sale+-+Sentosa+S%24108Million.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="514">[<a href="http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/9677257/for-sale-the-ultimate-sentosa-bungalow">Bungalow House For Sale - THE ULTIMATE SENTOSA BUNGALOW(D04)</a>]<br> <br> <br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XWVCzfrBS-4/T1cWaLixjjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/K_RLXCaM4hE/s1600/120302-+New+ways+to+raise+revenue+needed,+says+DPM+Tharman,+quote.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="514"></div>

              <p>So U want the poor to continue subsidizing the rich because GST is higher than 'subsidised' property tax for big and luxurious bungalows when BOTH can be equally considered consumer based utility goods?</p>
              <p>People living in bungalows can opt to downgrade, but can the poor be asked to drink less water and eat less food?</p>
              <p>Pls lah, the lack of asset redistribution policies in Singapore is deafening! The govt should really pls stop molly coddling the rich when the poor are suffering.</p>
