            <div class='col-md body'>most ppl in air force/navy are regulars. percentage of nsf in AF/navy less than army. in fact its very very rare to find nsf officers in AF/navy.<br>if you received letter from AF recruitment, mebbe something about you qualifies you for pilot. the computer test is only the first screening pilot candidates go thru. the AF recruitment officer when i was a recruit said after all the screening process, only one in a hundred finally qualify to take up pilot training. and of those who take up the training, some will still drop out. and of those who remain, even smaller percentage given fighter pilot, the rest fly choppers or transport planes. so you do the maths. and you have to sign on to be a pilot of course.<br>in short, only way to go AF/navy is to sign on. i dont know what life is like there. wat i can say is (and those AF or navy guys pls dont think i tryin to sound superior) AF and navy officers given higher pay and the rank coz they handle high-tech and expensive weapons. of course not easy but army officers are about pure leadership. the weapon they control are the human soldiers.<br>like i said, AF/navy guys pls dont get offended. i admit it: you guys get all the glam, the pilot with his sunglasses and fancy car with pix of him and fighter jet in background; the navy guy with his sunglasses and sun tan and pix of him travelling around the world. all i have is mud on my body and a $300 M16 which gets rusty evryday.<br>but i dont regret! shiok!<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with u that AF and NAVY ppl get all the glam and $$.  However, their technical training in handling those weapons systems is also much more intensive. They control weapons systems that will act as force multipliers in war.  Without them, ARMY grunts will be as good musketeers in days of old.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ooopppp....relek ah.....<br>evry force is just as important. sole purpose of army is to gain and hold ground. air force exists to support the attack and maintain air superiority. navy go fishing....i mean er, same purpose as army but on sea not land.<br>this has been the basic doctrine of conventional warfare since mordern warfare began. dont ask me bout counter-revolutionary warfare though.....<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to survive...?<br>Positive attitude.<br>Well, NS life can be as fun as school life i think...<br>juz enjoy the company of your frenz and dun think too much abt your ord date...<br>b4 you know it, you are ording already.<br><br>What i feel is that you gotta put your utmost effort into you NS life. IT's a pity to complete ns and look back in regret when you know you could have done much more, and yet you didnt do. Like when you look back upon your 2.5 yrs, and then you realise you havent actually done much. So my advice is to do your best, and gain the most from your NS life.</div>

Tough?</div></blockquote>1. Depends on your unit. Got many ways. You can be serious in your work, do everything sui sui, and volunteer for any sai-gang. Make friends, not enemies. Also, remember to wayang in front of superiors.<br><br>2. I was in Taurus Coy, BMTC, April 2000. My coy. was (is?) notorious. Got people jump down, I think. Now I am in the fucking scorpion unit. Not to shock you, but got BMTC people (like me) posted inside, escaped, and commited suicide outside.<br><br>3. OCS ... remember to wayang in BMT lor. During sit-test, show lots of initiative and leadership. Know something about knots and ropework as they help you a lot. Tell the assessing officers (and your platoon commander) that it is your dream to enter OCS.</div>

You may not want either! most smart boys acted blur to avoid both glamour and respect, and be happy with a simply chores to pass their 2 and a half years of wayang kulit show quickly and healthily!
