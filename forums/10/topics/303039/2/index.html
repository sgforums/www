And, he shouted at me, he was scolding someone else and not me.Well, i am not happy of his attitude and the way he say was like i am the one in wrong.<br><br>I shouted at him back, 'Go back to China' in chinese, in a very loud loud tone.<br>He was not happy and keep scolding Singaporeans bad words.The more he scolded the more i shouted at him in chinese' go back to your China'.<br>He was mad at me and ran at me full speed.I ran and ran and i took out a handphone and threaten to call the police if he still continue to run towards me.And when he saw me taking out my handphone, he turned his back and ran away.<br><br>This true experience from me, actually tell us that, if our PAP government still keep on letting in these kind of people in for no reason, sorry to say, i will pack my bag and leave with my families to Australia.<br>Haaa, to all those who think that we are part of China because we are Chinese too.Let me remind all these people, the China chinese are not so good towards Singaporeans in nature.I knew alot of them and i know it.<br>Yes, you can give them red i.c.But they still regard themselves as China Chinese.They will not think of themselves as Singaporeans because the day they came here, they already dun like Singaporeans.They only mix with their own China people from what i seen.Open you eyes, my locals mates.Look around and see for yourselves, what Singapore will be like if everyone you saw is from China.<br>Cannot trust them is what i wanted to say.Go to China and see for yourselves how the Chinese people behave and how their culture is and you will know what i feel now, imagine whole lot of them flooding Singapore.<br><br>I rather be in Australia a better welfare foriegn country then in Singapore a country which will one day also become a foriegner's land but a worst welfare country and also a  worst country with not much freedom to talk about.<br></div></blockquote>hmmmm Interesting....</div>

Its totally none of your business and its their problem to solve...<br><br>Yea patriotic singaporean u wanna say, Sometimes u need to see the situation dude. U only make matters worse... Yea, maybe you really are a patriotic Singaporeans but not in the intelligent way<br><br>Sometimes i really wonder. Are Singaporeans really that bad? If not, how come so many ppl especially china man talk bad bout Singaporeans? Is it really their fault or is it only some bad ass Singaporeans didnt do things the right way and be a disgrace to Singaporeans ?<br><br>TS u never even see what is the problem that the china man scolded the man. Is it his fault or the china man's fault and u got pissed off just becuz he said Singaporeans ? WOw..* Shakes head*</div></blockquote>Cannot really say nyob then dun care lei. Like if you see a gal tio molested, you will lend her a hand rite? Somemore that china guy on SG land shout bad things about SG ppl obviously asking for trouble de ma. Since asking for trouble, might as well curse PAP in public. At least he'll get applauded by some for doing that instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

The poor ones on scholarship are the brilliant fellas - they tend to do very well in whatever they are doing except in written english.  They can speak survival english and their way of improving english is to speak english to Asians like me . They refuse to speak to me in mandarin because they want to practice their english.<br></div>

There are some who say alot but fail to make it there so come back and curse the country who welcomed them in the first place. It is called "saving face" ...the business failed not because of their fault  but because of racism . I heard so many excuses like that before and I laugh at it.  My aunt did complain of something similar in Australia when she first started but she stuck on and became a neighbourhood face of her store that no one gave her trouble - she just became one of them .<br><br>There are some who migrated and refuse to return . There are alot who manage to make money in their adoptive country . I got a friend who is a millionaire now after 7 years in Australia. Asian some more. So how to explain that phenomena?  Every one has a different experience and a degree of adaptability. Being thick skinned, helps you know?<br><br>I have distant relatives in canada and all of them are happy there in Alberta and Vancouver. They experience occasional problems but everyone call the troublemakers white trash.<br></div>
