            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">They wear black clothes to protest<br>Fees just went up last August, they argue<br>By Teh Jen Lee and Tay Shian<br><br>February 18, 2006<br><br>IT WAS a Valentine's Day announcement they didn't appreciate.<br><br>On Tuesday, National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduates received an e-mail about a 3 per cent fee hike that will take effect this August. (See report in box on facing page.)<br><br>This sparked protests as a 5 per cent fee increase were just implemented last August.<br><br>Led by third-year science student Alex Ang, 24, undergraduates showed up on campus yesterday wearing their feelings on their sleeves.<br><br>The colour of their anger? Black.<br><br>Mr Ang on Wednesday called on students to wear a black T-shirt to campus.<br><br>He posted an entry on an online forum started by the NUS Student's Union (Nussu) about the fee hike.<br><br>He wrote: 'I hope we can protest against the fee hike by wearing a black top. It will be a symbolic gesture to show our displeasure with the NUS management over its handling of the matter.'<br><br>Mr Ang told The New Paper: 'I heard about the hike only in the media. Some of the students didn't even know about it as they hadn't read their e-mails.<br><br>'I found this very shocking and I wanted to raise awareness on the issue.'<br><br>Mr Ang said that there were many discussions on the forum about launching petitions or asking for a dialogue, but no one seemed to be taking the lead.<br><br>He said: 'There was no action, talk only. So I decided to ask people to wear black as it's the fastest and most visible way.'<br><br>Mr Ang, whose fees are paid by the Ministry of Education, will have to pay $180 more for his honours year following the fee hike.<br><br>After his online posting, word spread from student to student mostly via SMS.<br><br>Some also spread the message through the MSN instant messaging systerm.<br><br>When The New Paper team visited NUS' central forum at about 4pm yesterday, about 50 of the 200 students there were in black.<br><br>About half of those approached admitted that they were doing it to protest the fee hike.<br><br>Graduating science student Paulene Cheng, 21, said she was worried about fee increases becoming a trend as she has younger siblings who may enter NUS in the future.<br><br>First-year arts student Justin Ong, 22, said: 'The amount may not be much when spread over a year, but I feel that there should have been more consultation before the hike is imposed.'<br><br>Some students who missed the protest yesterday suggested on the online forum to extend it till today.<br><br>There was a meeting between Nussu and the university administration last Friday in which the union opposed the fee hike.<br><br>OBJECTIONS IGNORED<br><br>In an e-mail to students on 14 Feb, Nussu president Danny Quek wrote: 'Despite our vigorous objection to the fee increase, the administration still deems such a measure necessary in order to keep up with cost increases.'<br><br>He added that the union was disappointed that requests to be more involved in discussions regarding school policies have gone unheard.<br><br>'There was no consultation before the fee hike was announced,' he wrote.<br><br>However, he said that as a result of the meeting, the university will channel more funds to financial aid in the coming academic year.<br><br>DON'T GET EMOTIONAL<br><br>Commenting on the black T-shirt protest, he said: 'The method was not initiated by the union.<br><br>'We urge the students to engage the administration in constructive feedback instead of showing an emotional response.'<br><br>When asked about the protest, a university spokesman said: 'We understand that some students would like to express their displeasure at the increase in tuition fees.<br><br>'We are committed to helping all our students meet the increase and have put in place a range of financial assistance schemes.'<br><br>However, arts student Hanna Samri, 23, felt that the increase in financial aid does not justify the fee hike.<br><br>'There will always be more students in need that they can provide for,' said a black-clad Miss Hanna.<br><br>But not all students protested.<br><br>Some knew about the protest but didn't join in as they were satisfied with the reasons the university's administration had given.<br><br>Law student Jolie Giouw, 19, said: 'If they have to increase fees, then they have to. Our fees are already heavily subsidised anyway.'<br><br>Undergraduates pay about a quarter of the courses' operating costs while the Government foots the rest.<br><br>Engineering student Darren Luo, 21, was expecting the hike as NUS will be corporatised in the coming academic year.<br><br>He said: 'The only problem is that students feel it came too soon after last year's increase. Corporatisation will benefit the students through improved teaching aids and student facilities.'<br><br>Mr Ang, who started yesterday's protest, went around photographing facilities that he felt should be upgraded if they are going to raise fees.<br><br>He said: 'We have a new University Hall, but student facilities haven't improved. For example, I know of a corridor study bench that has been spoilt for many years.<br><br>'The wooden benches in lecture theatre 26 are all so old, they should have refurbished them to make it easier for us to concentrate.'</span><br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,102214,00.html" rel="nofollow">The Newpaper</a><br><br>ST Writer Kenny Tan wrote in an article today that students should "stand up for rights but in an orderly way".<br><br>But is there any possible manner to stage an 'orderly' but non-violent protest in SG? Had the students worn black t-shirts en masse, their 'ringleaders' would have been singled out and censured by the relevant authorities. The students would have received a global rebuke from the same authority and the fee hike matter would grudgingly recede into oblivion. Nonchalance would once again, as before, cast its dark gloom over the student body.<br><br>In that i have to agree with Student Yeo Wei Sheng that the NUS simply gave '<span style="color: red;"><strong>notification</strong></span>' and not <span style="color: indigo;"><strong>consultation</strong></span> or <strong><span style="color: brown;">clarification</span></strong>.<br><br></div>

I know of poly grads who can do a job better than graduates but the system will not allow us to pay that poly grad more than the NUS grad.<br><br>NUS students work hard and generally they do pretty well in the end...but if they do well, it is inspite of the quality of teaching they get.<br><br>Incidentally, there is a similar debate on BBC about the emphasis of research at the expense of teaching in the Russel group of Universities.</div>

It's not the costs that irk the students but the unethical way it was handled.<br><br>They have unilaterally chosen not to explain their decisions to the one paying body that matters: the students.<br><br>That is a hallmark of high-handedness and brazen disregard in the manner the administration is run. And NUS is not alone. <span style="color: red;"><strong>SMU's 15% fee hike </strong></span>probably stunned their students, while similar 5% fee hikes in NTU, along with rising costs in their student hostels are likewise given lukewarm responses.<br><br>Imagine SMU management students paying the same fees (or more) as engineering students in both NUS and NTU, even though their syllabus does not include lab work or access to sophisticated research equipment.<br><br>While SMU was quick to issue guarantees that the fees would not escalate for the next 4 years, what's to stop both NTU and NUS from continuing to raise their fees, citing continuous surging costs? Everyone knows that rising utility costs coupled with an ever-increasing wage bill is significantly contributing to this climb. But with no detailed data or cost indication to back their claims and explain their position to the students, how can anyone expect the students to react with anything other than disdain?<br><br>There does not appear to be any form of <strong>REAL</strong> transparency in the actions of the administration and given the current state of sorry affairs, this looks set to continue.</div>

Letting it get of control is not good for locals as well as the foreigners in the long run.</div>

The world is bigger than the whole of Singapore, much bigger.<br><br>As for the privatisation and fee hike. Its BS. This privatisation thingy means they behave private when it suits them and they behave stat board when it suits them. The increase fees will go towards not better tuitors but expnasion overseas. You and I may not agree with that but thats the way it is.<br><br>Frankly, I don't think our fees are high. Its just that we are so used to lower fess, we squirm when they hike.
