            <div class='col-md body'>From the Straits Times Forum Page, 28 August 2004.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: blue;">More convincing case for Medishield hike needed</span></strong> </span><br><br>THE Government should put up a more convincing case for the imminent increase in Medishield premiums by providing more facts and figures, rather than resort to a change of law to effect an enlarged Medishield 'risk pool'. The increase will be as good as giving the green light to private insurers to hike their premiums.<br><br>Instead of forcing everyone to be part of Medishield's 'risk pool', the Government should find out why Medishield continues to lose out to other insurance schemes. For example, NTUC Income offers Incomeshield, a similar if not better health-insurance scheme. The coverage under its various plans is sufficient for all.<br><br>If the different plans under Medishield are insufficient, more plans could be introduced. And, again, members should be given a choice as to whether to upgrade.<br><br>The Government could reach out to less-informed members through newsletters and grassroots leaders.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that changes are needed because premiums are outdated. Why are only premiums for Medishield outdated?<br><br>It is said that other insurers are in direct competition with Medishield. Is this not positive as premiums are thus made lower and more affordable for Cannot distribute vertically CPF members?<br><br>Privatisation of the CPF Dependants' Protection Scheme was recommended by the Economic Review Committee in 2002, with the aim of 'generating healthy competition among private insurers and provide better benefits and services to CPF members', as noted by the CPF Board. Does the Government now feel that there are no positive benefits from healthy competition?<br><br>Many CPF members are also more than adequately covered by private insurers. It is unfair to force them to increase their coverage to more than what is necessary.<br><br>The Government is forward-thinking in that it realises demographic changes will burden the state financially. However, if it has to resort to legislation to effect change, it will be reverting to a nanny-state mentality. This does not sit well with many.<br><br>PHILLIP ANG KENG HONG<br><br>The following site will be archived and no longer accessible after three days<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/forum/story/0,4386,269685,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/forum/story/0,4386,269685,00.html?</a><br><br></div>
