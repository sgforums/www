            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">Singapore is run like a corporation. Profit is what matters. If there are any factors which may cause the decline of the country, the govt will take all steps to justify its means.<br><br>Foreign talents are coming in faster than a tap can dispense water and simultaneoulsy, large handful of S'poreans are being retrenched on the quiet.<br><br>If you're this govt, what would you do?<br><br>1) Not take in so much foreign talent, give more jobs to locals and have less revenue in the coffers?<br><br>OR<br><br>2) Take in as many FTs as you can and ensure that S'pore stays at the cutting edge of this global competition?<br><br>An organisation's culture depends on the CEO's style. Take for example, Air Asia has such a vibrant and agressive culture because Tony Fernandez is a daring visionary. Singapore's style of governance is largely determined by the Lees, something which has already been deeply ingrained since our independence.</div></blockquote>I can tell u if u watch beyond the dot showing  talented Sporean going to other countries to develop their talent, contributing to the adopted countries.</div>
