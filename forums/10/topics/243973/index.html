            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body">It seems that the government is painting a rosy picture about the job market at the moment. Today's <a href="http://news.asiaone.com.sg/st/st_20070322_103132.html" rel="nofollow">asia1.com article </a>about Singaporeans avoiding the precision engineering industry is just their way of shifting the blame to Singaporeans - look: there's jobs, you're fussy so stop whining. Period.<br><br>The article goes on to say at least half the workforce in this industry is manned by foreign 'talent', leading them to further justify the need to bring in more FTs.<br><br>In truth, a 'high' starting pay is offset by rising costs of living in all areas, coupled by a stagnant wage package.<br><br>Singaporeans are doing more and earning less compared to our counterparts 20 years ago, given inflation and other monetary factors. Coupled by a pay rise for ministers, it all leads to one thing: dissent.<br><br>On the flip side, let's look at what the govt has done to get jobs for locals. Meet the people's sessions and job fairs have increased and the finger points squarely at those who decline offers on the table.<br><br>If our people are indeed spoilt to such an extent and conveniently blame the govt for their misfortune, then maybe it's time to reflect upon ourselves. </div></blockquote>The article isn't false. To put it frankly, engineering isn't an easy job, and neither will people appreciate it. Besides, it's precision engineering, not something easy. Coupled with foreign talent, Singaporeans probably just don't even want to take up the jobs. For someone working and living in Singapore, finding themselves stuck in a pool of foreign talent definitely won't feel nice.<br><br>Singaporeans are indeed doing more and earning less when compared to 20 years ago. 20 years ago, we were developing rapidly. From doing a lot of things manually to semi-automatic to automatic, we have changed a lot. Fast forward to the current Singapore, where nearly everything manufactured is somehow automated, there's nowhere to go. How far can automation go based on today's technology? Not far. Once a certain peak is reached, things will start going downwards or maintain stagnant, as in the case of Singapore.<br><br>Just think of China and India now. They are right in our shoes when Singapore had just attained independence.<br><br>While no doubt that some Singaporeans are choosy, let's not forget that the employers too are. Too old, they reject. Young with no experience, reject. Qualifications too high for a job, reject.</div>

Not sure if this is also a lame reason.   To me if they corrupt, then investigate and if guilty just do the necessary to impose penalty lah!!!<br><br>He a finance minister, ha ha!!! Think other ministers can do a better job than him!!  Don't think it is a good idea to let him be the finance minister.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Think of price elasticity and economics - you are actually paying around 38% more not 2%.<br><br>If Singapore had stuck permanently to one specialty hub and developed it to an international class hub and then start developing another , Singapore won't be in this predicament now. Instead Singapore is hubbing like crazy for the next money making short term idea. Any economist will tell you that it is not sustainable in the long term. Jack of all trades, master of none.<br><br>Think of the minister's pay as well . 1.2 million per year - you might as well pay a minister 200k -300k per year which is good enough and reinvest the other monies into infrastructure maintenance and development or place it into Singapore's reserves.<br><br></div>

If the LHL is not asking for it, what is it?</div>
