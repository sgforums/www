              <p>Admittedly, political freedom or even individual freedom is more or less, less than desired. But champions of that can be considered as hypocrites looking at how they act.</p>
              <p>There are many that believe political and economic reforms go hand in hand, but China is a good empirical example that it is not so. And Russia provides an even more stark contrast that supports this further.</p>

              <p>i am not sure whether you are asking me about what is the truth political reform in china or in general. in my own opinion it affect few front such as democracy, standard of transparency,accountability, further enhance the completeness of legislation body or in summary political structure.</p>

              <p>whether limited political reform or not, as long as it do good to public, it's ok, democracy maybe could not be achieved in a short run,</p>
              <p>but as far as china is concerned, democracy is not priority, like in the west, almost all the country is occupied by a single ethnicity, many country dissolved, because they cannot handle the inter ethnicity issue well.</p>
              <p>i don't know whether you are aware or not, president Hu put harmony on the table, which is an old traditional chinese culture, if china follow the footstep of the west, china definitely will dissolve.</p>
              <p>So i don't think china could exactly copy western system.</p>
              <p>Xinjiang ,tibet, is just many of the tension china is facing, they are just like a time bomb, if you don't handle it well. it will explode.</p>
              <p>So economy is just part of china's blueprint, stability and as a result sustainbility is top priority</p>

              <p>whether limited political reform or not, as long as it do good to public, it's ok, democracy maybe could not be achieved in a short run,</p>
              <p>but as far as china is concerned, democracy is not priority, like in the west, almost all the country is occupied by a single ethnicity, many country dissolved, because they cannot handle the inter ethnicity issue well.</p>
              <p>i don't know whether you are aware or not, president Hu put harmony on the table, which is an old traditional chinese culture, if china follow the footstep of the west, china definitely will dissolve.</p>
              <p>So i don't think china could exactly copy western system.</p>
              <p>Xinjiang ,tibet, is just many of the tension china is facing, they are just like a time bomb, if you don't handle it well. it will explode.</p>

              <p>And the the product contains melamine, will not affect adult so much, i am not excusing some company from this incident, anyway, the child drink the milk powder, can seek compensation through judiciary procedure</p>
              <p>And i can garantee, this is not last, because from philosophical point of view, as long as human is participating in the industry, they will commit fault, but i can garantee, from now on the milk industry will never have such thing again, china already come up will new regulation,</p>
              <p>anyway, china is not like the old days, only making the low quality product, when i was young, i also never trust china product, i prefer japan product, because of high  quality, but china already not the old china, like lenovo, haier, huawei, many  company already being the top 500 in the world. And what we are producing, is with the highest technology.</p>
              <p>It used to be like this, the high ranking officer in the company are from hongkong , taiwan or singapore, but, now more and more local manager is emerging, consist of 90% of the industry, it's the fruit we get from opening up.</p>
              <p>No one could be exemplified from this case, i hope they can learn a lesson, and i apologize for everyone have been affect by this thing in singapore,</p>

              <p>i am not saying democracy is beautiful nor will it solve china food contaminated issues. but in democracy, the ruling govt will feel the pressure to perform and responsible to the ppl otherwise they will be voted out. this is not happening in a communist rule! maybe the current wenjiabao, hujintao is responsible and willingness to crack down on corruption etc, but what happen to china if the Ren da meeting choose someone who rule like Mao or jiangching? are the chinese going to wait for them to die again and hopefully another deng xiaoping to appear again?</p>
              <p>anyway, whether china is communist or  not, is not my priority la. i just work in china occassionally and i must say agree that chinese ppl are very tolerant and nice to foreigner.</p>
