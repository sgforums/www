              <p>i am not saying democracy is beautiful nor will it solve china food contaminated issues. but in democracy, the ruling govt will feel the pressure to perform and responsible to the ppl otherwise they will be voted out. this is not happening in a communist rule! maybe the current wenjiabao, hujintao is responsible and willingness to crack down on corruption etc, but what happen to china if the Ren da meeting choose someone who rule like Mao or jiangching? are the chinese going to wait for them to die again and hopefully another deng xiaoping to appear again?</p>
              <p>anyway, whether china is communist or  not, is not my priority la. i just work in china occassionally and i must say agree that chinese ppl are very tolerant and nice to foreigner.</p>

              <p>From what i understand, there's always been a difficult relationship between Beijing and the provincial government.  Beijing has always had problems getting the provincial government to do what it wants and the provincial government often resent central interference and regulation.</p>
              <p>I won't say Beijing doesn't care about the fake drugs and food, they know the social impact of it. This is afterall, a country that has seen most of its fair share of peasant uprisings. But i doubt they have full knowledge of what goes on in the provinces until something blows up. </p>
              <p>That's what i feel about the matter, at least.</p>

              <p><br>about the taking full hearted, i think things have change in recent years, the tainted milk problem, actually come out by some farmer who made this melamine in order to make the milk contain more protein when being inspected by the sanlu company, so sanlu's fault is basically being ignorant.</p>
              <p>And there are some interest conflict between local government and central government, local government in order to achieve more economy development, also being ignorant in relugating the industry.</p>
              <p>And again about taking full hearted, i would like to introducing a buddhism term,not being attached, yes we have to take full hearted, but not be blinded by it, we have to step by step make a sustainable development,</p>
              <p>Nowadays the world in order to achieve more economy development, have been ignorant in enviorment, polution, and i guess this world finicancial crisis, is being caused by people's greedy, sometimes, i was wondering, why we always talking about GDP growth rate, if the economy already saturated, why we could not just maintain the growth rate, so history have prove we cannot grow all the way through, some times it bounce back, so i think attaining sustainable development is extremely important, if you don't plan forehanded, you will pay for it in the short future.</p>

              <p>aiya, just because of a tainted milk co went bust and you guys get so long long winded. Go bust go bust lah, there are also many companies that went busted with unethical practices, china will not be spare, and why??? because man are born to be greedy mah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China is one country that i look forward to, she has a very unique situation indeed,  communist rulers controlling a democratic capitalise economy, and still progressing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chinese are well know to take the short cut out, they like to cheat and yet provide, quick thinking and business orientated peoples. Deng xiao peng had once said about chinese peoples, he said "we, the chinese people have the ability to cheat you without you knowing, aren't we clever people, but used in the wrong way, so if we can teach ourselves to use our talent correctly, we will be the best in the Global market, many fears chinese businessmen, for they can wipe out any business with their competitiveness"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China is still an infant in the global markets, the present communist govt have done a good job both in her economy and create wealth for her citizens. As she grows bigger, she will learn from past experiences and strive on to improve it quality and ethical practices, just like korea, samsung, LG and hyundai were formerly a laugh stock product of the world, the mention of them give you thinking of poor quality and cheapsake product, but today....look at them...can anytime beat the japanese in term of cost and quality.</p>

              <p>you cannot blame the businessman here, they are greedy in nature, and you cannot say it's cheating, it's the rule of business, because someone outsmart you or someone else, you call it cheating, i feel that, it's foolish here to rush into the stock market, when you are not really smart, or you donnot realy owe large amount of capital,</p>
              <p>business world is arena, you cannot blame others ,when you step on the court yourself, and you are killed.</p>
