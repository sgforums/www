              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">A thought about social cohesion alternative viewed? <span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Singaporean who lived, worked, and played within the island state knows that they are not going anywhere but to live side by side. So i have no doubt that Practical nature of Singaporean who are borne and brought up here understand Harmony is a quintessential characteristic of living in Singapore. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">I think the fact that we inject foreigners too quick and too fast into Singapore within a short period of time create ripple effect. These are foreigners who at the back of their mind their home country is prefered and they applied their own political history to Singapore. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Does it mean that the entire Singapore populations have to re-learned the history of the 60s all over again? Have to walk thru the Geo politics within this region? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Do we really need to re-invent the wheel all over again to benefit the late comer? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">The one question should be asking; what type of foreigners should we admit? Nearer to our regions with similar history background or nearer to our culture but different social and political viewed? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">What about for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in our History, we have <span> </span>2<sup>nd</sup> generation of overseas borne from Singaporean living overseas? They carried natural emotional ties of Singapore and are keenly aware of their identity, a subgroup that maybe Singapore government needs to pay attention. <span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">What about Asian who grew outside their own ethnics countries but are keenly wanting to move back to Asia. They are educated and carried an open mind keenly wanting to learn about Asia culture perharps that is a social group that Singapore should Tap on before blindly admitting Tom Dick and Harry who carry excessive baggage of social intergration problems and counter political viewed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Singapore isn’t that huge of a place in terms of land and its economies, it needs quality not quantities. <span> T<span>he problems lies in how we perceived our problems and how we solved it. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Should we even look at expanding Domestics demand for the local Economy by increasing population. or perharps Singapore Govt should practices Fiscal Conservative. Stop creating more problems to solve other problems. </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>What PM talks about Social and Racial cohesiveness and harmony is not meant to nail down the locals or the consequences within. If you look at the scenario of today foreigners influx into Singapore as citizens, our PM is asking us to have tolerances and cohesiveness with these peoples, because if we dun do it, in near future, these group of foreigners who become citizens and who came from mostly homogenous society as the like of China, Mynmar, India etc etc may not be able to work together, tolerate each other and have a cohesive mentality with other races. This will lead to riot, protest and chaos for the society.</p>

              <p><br>Many people asked, why PM talked about racial when we are already living in harmony, my malay gfs and bfs also can speak mandarin, and i can even speak malay, very rare to see a young singapore chinese gal speak malay ok, but I am not that fluent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He spoke about racial because he foreseen a racial problem in the near future with so much other nationalities becoming citizenships, we are talking about a million of them ok. Serious, this One Million new citizens will not understand your racial harmony, they care for themselves only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since we are born, me from taiwan, we are already cultivated with racial harmony from pri 1 to university and so on..but not these group of people. LHL understand that you can built a racial harmony social for years, but just because of a spark only, the whole plan can go into waste.</p>

              <p>But Singaporean I believe expect a leader to lead.....provide a direction. You listen did he?</p>
              <p><strong>To ADD</strong>: I mean Singapore has been independent for 40 + years. There is at least 1 generation that grew up together. There may not be perfect cohesion but there are Cohesion....So why brought up this topics of "potential problems"  because it is a problems that was created and he is trying to put a fire on it by doing what PAP being doing for years ........EAT IT.  No Choice.</p>
