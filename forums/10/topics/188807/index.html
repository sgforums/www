            <div class='col-md body'>it has been days since Gomez apologised to the public and explained all about the problems that happened. All that is happening now is PAP keep harping the Gomez issue..<br><br>its like a old hag nagging about the whole issue.. it has been few days and now its the 2nd part of the election race... what voters want to hear about is real election issues...stop the name calling and smearing his credibility... it has lost its flavour... and having MM coming out and callin GOmez a liar and smearing his name is a bit too much from the PAP. Given he is the MM, i would expect better honor and character from MM. The elections has degenerated into a character debate...and that is totally stupid where things degenerated into PAP calling people names and attacking the character instead of dealing with proper election issues.<br><br>ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, character debates should stop at a certain limit... Gomez has already apologised, issued a public statement and explained his actions which the statement was endorsed by Low Thia Kiang... then let us let it go at that. he has been accountable and took responsibility for his actions.. so why the PAP let go at that. let us be reasonable... why does PAP candidates can make mistakes eg. project work at JC level that has been implemented in 2003 while reversing the policy and removing it for the 2005 year onwards. then let us ask the PAP where is your transparency..why Tharman did not come out and explain his actions?<br><br>if we are to talk abt transparency and accountablility..then Gomez has already done it...he came out and apologised..taking up responsibility for his actions... so why cant PAP leave it as that..<br><br>Given the stage of elections it is now...it would be better to concentrate on the real issues rather than the MUD slinging we have in the political arena now!! GROW UP PAP!! be more mature in politics...u wanted a WORLD CLASS OPPOSITION...so stand up and show that u are a WORLD CLASS POLITICAL PARTY, stop all these character debate and name calling by MM, show your calibre by focussing on real problems faced by the nation...SHOW VOTERS THE PROBLEM AND GIVE A SOLUTION!! not the pathetic name calling that serves to shift the public focus from real election issues<br><br>ITS TIME TO FOCUS ON REAL ELECTION ISSUES RATHER THAN ON THE GOMEZ ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN CLEARED UP AND DEALT WITH!</div>
