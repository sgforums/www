The opposition still has some way to go before winning more than 50% of the electorates. It's an uphill task when local media tend to play favouritism when it comes to political agenda. Unless you have secured a close to 50% majority in the past election, else there is no need to make such plans.<br><br>Freedom from oppressive regime who exploit the populace for their own personal benefit.<br><br>A balance of power so that no single party dominates the system and pass oppressive laws and tax.</div>

Your topic question seems like one asking to be taught the basics of flight.<br><br>Instead of asking generically "what opposition can offer", perhaps you may like to read through the history of threads in Speakers' Corner.
