            <div class='col-md body'>The front page of the Straits Times may as well read as 'PAP Ministers and MP's will fight up coming elections to keep their high salaries?' Thats what all this politicians strike me as only being interested in. The lucky MP that gets a walkover, I bet you the first thing that comes into his or her head is 'My monthly MP allowance$ x 12months x 3-4years'. Wah can go buy another car or condo already. Mortgage payments well taken care of for the next couple of years. Nobody really gives a damn about the man on the street. Its all to do with how much will we earn.<br><br>We should ask the walkover MPs to forgo half their salaries. Lets see then how dedicated they would be exactly in serving their constitutens!</div>
