              <p>women should not serve in NS mainly because:</p>
              <p>1) will waste more of SG's financial resources (counsellors, logistics, extra care and welfare etc.)</p>
              <p>2) after they serve NS, their face and body structure will be more manly and flesh will be harder, so they will be very gross and disgusting to hug and sayang</p>
              <p>3) if all girls serve NS, the word "xiao mei mei" will cease to exist in Singapore</p>
              <p>4) will have even more chaos and politics in SAF....now, with a male-majority environment, there's already do much back-stabbing</p>
              <p>5) if go to war, enemies will rape our female troops here as this is the ultimate form of humilation to a country. This is the reason why the US army has a rule saying they don't allow women to take on combat / front-line roles, and women in the US army are limited to logistics, intelligence, armour signals and clerical stuff etc.</p>
              <p>6) i will lose all interest in girls if i see them in farking smelly No. 4.....KNN.</p>
              <p>7) will cause more deaths in SAF due to guys unable to concentrate properly during live firing exercises and gun will end up shooting wrongly at some other guy when attention is distracted, and hand grenade practice will go haywire if guy sees girl while preparing to throw bomb</p>
              <p>8) a lot of SG girls in general are already quite rough and chor-lor already....if they go NS, they'll be worse than a male beast when they ORD</p>
              <p>9) if girls go to war and fight alongside guys, the guys will have a natural instinct to protect the girls and this will end up screwing up the planning etc</p>
              <p>10) if girls and guys go into NS, sooner or later, girl will definitely commit crimes of passion (using gun to shoot another girl etc) due to love problems (suspect boyfriend loves another girl in his camp etc).</p>

              <p><br>X3. how many times do i have to stress again that national service =/= military service. just like you sing <strong>National </strong>anthem, not army anthem.</p>
              <p>in NS, you do stuffs which benefit the country. in military service, u do stuff which benefit the army and the country.</p>
              <p>CIP is also a form of NS. as many had mentioned on this forum, in Germany, people are allowed to do public works in lieu of military service.</p>
              <p>examples of public work: civil defence, gardener, social worker, anything that is of benefit to the society.</p>
              <p>i can't see why women are in any sense physically unsuitable to contribute in the above fields. if they want to join the army as their NS, its their own choice. we are not saying that all women who serve NS will serve only the army.</p>

              <p>women should not serve in NS mainly because:</p>
              <p>1) will waste more of SG's financial resources (counsellors, logistics, extra care and welfare etc.)</p>
              <p>2) after they serve NS, their face and body structure will be more manly and flesh will be harder, so they will be very gross and disgusting to hug and sayang</p>
              <p>3) if all girls serve NS, the word "xiao mei mei" will cease to exist in Singapore</p>
              <p>4) will have even more chaos and politics in SAF....now, with a male-majority environment, there's already do much back-stabbing</p>
              <p>5) if go to war, enemies will rape our female troops here as this is the ultimate form of humilation to a country. This is the reason why the US army has a rule saying they don't allow women to take on combat / front-line roles, and women in the US army are limited to logistics, intelligence, armour signals and clerical stuff etc.</p>
              <p>6) i will lose all interest in girls if i see them in farking smelly No. 4.....KNN.</p>
              <p>7) will cause more deaths in SAF due to guys unable to concentrate properly during live firing exercises and gun will end up shooting wrongly at some other guy when attention is distracted, and hand grenade practice will go haywire if guy sees girl while preparing to throw bomb</p>
              <p>8) a lot of SG girls in general are already quite rough and chor-lor already....if they go NS, they'll be worse than a male beast when they ORD</p>
              <p>9) if girls go to war and fight alongside guys, the guys will have a natural instinct to protect the girls and this will end up screwing up the planning etc</p>
              <p>10) if girls and guys go into NS, sooner or later, girl will definitely commit crimes of passion (using gun to shoot another girl etc) due to love problems (suspect boyfriend loves another girl in his camp etc).</p>

              <p>Refuted point by point:</p>
              <p>1) As with all asset management, you might expend more resources, but in return you ask yourself what is the benefit you get in return. If the inflow of benefits outweights the outflow of extra resources, then overall there is a net gain.</p>
              <p>2) Having looked at those girls, many of whom aren't models posing for a pic but actual servicewomen, I have to say I disagree.</p>
              <p>3) You guys serve NS and many of you are still xiao di di anyway. Some immature people here make that pretty evident.</p>
              <p>4) Honestly, I don't think things will be better or worse. In my experience, guy and girls can be equally bitchy and backstabbing.</p>
              <p>5) You have answered yourself. There are many non-combat roles for women so that they CAN serve NS without being at risk of combat or capture (although I personally think thats just unwarrented sentimentality. At the end of the day, combat isn't about symbolism, it's about who's left standing and alive and victorious)</p>
              <p>6) So if men didn't serve NS and walked around in smelly no.4s u'd be interested in them too?</p>
              <p>7) Distraction is a good thing. Heres an anecdote:</p>
              <p>I'm trying to remember which documentary it was (2006), load of Yanks arguing with a large crowd of very angry Iraqi men. Anyway one of the Soldiers pipes up "Lets get the LT".<br><br>Shortly thereafter a very cute lass with freckles and the worlds tightest ACU's arrives. The previously upsets locals were completely overwhelmed and the cameraman suddenly found a new subject down south. Diplomacy in action.</p>
              <p>8) Seeing the way you guys are, you can't blame girls for evolving that way to deal with you.</p>
              <p>9) When I have my combat training the guys aren't overly protective towards me. In fact I'm often choosen to unsling my primary and rush a holed up enemy around the corner with a sidearm or knife since I'm small and can move faster.</p>
              <p>10) Boys aren't known for their rationality when it comes to crimes of passion (more hot headed remember?) If you guys aren't shooting each other much, what makes u think girls will?</p>
