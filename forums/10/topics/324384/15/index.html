              <p><br>I'm glad someone wants to have a civilized conversation, too many trolls like the one who just posted above me acting like retards.</p>
              <p>Ok 1st, this question is abit broad. When we says "should women serve" what is the question being asked here? From the variety of answers, people define it from "should women participate in front line combat" to "are women capable of contribution?"</p>
              <p>I shall see the question as saying "should women contribute to national service in some form?" and my answer is yes, The rationale would of course be all the usual stuff like the WW2 information I've posted. More importantly, I once held the view that women shouldn't serve because I felt that men's lives were less valuable and thus are expandable. I've since come to adopt see that a woman and a man's life are equally valuable, and that if one can die in defence of the country so can the other. If thats true, then serving in a militry capacity alone shouldn't be an issue anymore. However, sentimentality is a pratical issue, so right now I feel that as long as the service is within the military, it should suffice without needing women on the frontlines yet. We are not in a situation where we'll need it anyway, and God forbid we should ever do so.</p>
              <p>Does that explain my stand clearly? If not let me know where I can further clarify. Thanks</p>

              <p>i want how many guys sacrificing their youth for singapore? erm, isn't already all male singaporeans serving the nation? what the heck are u talking about?</p>
              <p>instead of making guys serve 4 years, why not let females come and serve 1 year? afraid of using camo cream instead of your blushers?</p>
