              <p>That's where you are wrong. Taking nursing for example, don't say serving NS as a nurse. Probably just a 6 month course on basic first aid and stuffs then ladies are free to do what they want. But in time of crisis, they will know what to do.<br><br>Men are supposed to protect their women. But in any case the men are wounded, if the ladies have some nursing knowledge, it would be great help and of course probably a morale boost for the men to know everyone is together as one.<br><br>Unless when men are injured, women are helpless (with no proper fighting knowledge) and we all go down. Which is the prefered scenario?<br><br>This is just an example and I know the arguement will go on... and the list of examples are exhaustive.. So just my 2 cents.</p>
