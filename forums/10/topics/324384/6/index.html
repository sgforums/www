              <p>Nope I don't agree, male and female are obviously different gender and you don't need to be educated to know the difference.</p>
              <p>Trying to imagine them as equal would be incorrect, Guy != Girl, whoever thinks Guy == Girl is retarded.</p>
              <p>So if both entities aren't equal, it means they aren't equal and should never be made equal. That's the law of nature ok?</p>
              <p>Hellooo......be good boy and obey the law of nature ok?</p>
              <p>Never forget everyone came out from woman's vagina. So be respectful, have a little bit gratefulness and stop trying to normalise the gender. We don't even count the no. of times our breast got sucked by men.</p>
              <p>Calculative men are not known to have good relationship with their women.</p>
              <p>I thought Singapore men are real MEN compared to overseas counterparts because they can overcome NS. But perhaps I thought wrongly....</p>

              <p><br> i am not talking about army nurses. just nurses in general. and it

              <p>just a few day ago, the newspaper announce that there is

              <p>and imagine that u r a foreign nurse in singapore. U may stay
              here if SARs and avian flu is on the rampage. but would you do the
              same, when bombs are dropping around you? look at Israel's invasion

              <p>That makes it why NSFs are paid lesser while regulars are paid much more... Though one can argue regulars are doing it as a profession while NSFs are conscripts.<br><br>As with the argument you made, reservists are paid their full salary unless they are unemployed during the reservist period.</p>

              <p>when ur life is threaten by war, which would you choose, ur life or payrise? there is no point in having a payrise if you can't spend it, dead or alive (who would still be doing business during a war?)</p>
              <p>looking at the army, the presence of over 30,000 nsf doesn't deflat the wage of the regulars. not to mention that maintaining this large a peacetime army is pointless. you are paying people to keep fit and march around, which are activities of low economic benefit. NS is just a polite term for forced cheap labor. look, a nsf is paid $400 for full time NS, less than what a part time foreign labourer earns in a month.</p>
              <p>so far, we are lacking in both doctors and nurses. and the government doesn't seem to be doing much to raise our own local doctors and nurses either. we still produce only 200 doctors a yr, about half of wad we really need. as for nurses, it is pathetic. NUS nursing doesn't even exist a few years ago.</p>
              <p>and obviously not every girl would want to do nursing as NS. some are genuinely interested in a career with SAF. also, you must consider that there are many many ways one can serve NS. you need people to handle the logistics and admin. and last read on the news, our police force is understaff, as compared to HK and NY police dept.</p>
              <p>our customs officers are also overworked, clocking the highest OT across all civil servants. some even clock over 90 hrs/ mnth.</p>
              <p>thus, i would safely say that there are unlimited outlets for girls to serve NS. we have a labour shortage here. and as jojo pointed out, nursing is a more useful qualification than soldiering.</p>

              <p><br>obviously, the "more professional nurses" would have their perks. they can be chief matron in charge of multiple NS nurses. they would be retain with higher wage etc. and since the government did not do away with army regulars, i doubt that they will be replaced by nsf nurses.</p>
              <p>however, the foreign nurses would be replaced. ( thats the original aim)</p>
              <p>and it is the business of girls whether they want to go overseas and be nurses, after serving NS. when serving NS, their serving of NS will be gurranteed by the Enlistment act, where they would be jailed for not doing NS.</p>
              <p>and i also doubt that the average girl would still be working as a nurse after her NS. she may be interested in other things, e.g. study, business, working in other industries etc. likewise, we don't see many of our guys signing on as regulars, even though the salary is attractive.</p>

              <p>when ur life is threaten by war, which would you choose, ur life
              or payrise? there is no point in having a payrise if you can't
              spend it, dead or alive (who would still be doing business during a
              war?)</p>
              <p>looking at the army, the presence of over 30,000 nsf doesn't
              deflat the wage of the regulars. not to mention that maintaining
              this large a peacetime army is pointless. you are paying people to
              keep fit and march around, which are activities of low economic
              benefit. NS is just a polite term for forced cheap labor. look, a
              nsf is paid $400 for full time NS, less than what a part time
              foreign labourer earns in a month.</p>
              <p>so far, we are lacking in both doctors and nurses. and the
              government doesn't seem to be doing much to raise our own local
              doctors and nurses either. we still produce only 200 doctors a yr,
              about half of wad we really need. as for nurses, it is pathetic.
              NUS nursing doesn't even exist a few years ago.</p>
              <p>and obviously not every girl would want to do nursing as NS.
              some are genuinely interested in a career with SAF. also, you must
              consider that there are many many ways one can serve NS. you need
              people to handle the logistics and admin. and last read on the
              news, our police force is understaff, as compared to HK and NY
              police dept.</p>
              <p>our customs officers are also overworked, clocking the highest
              OT across all civil servants. some even clock over 90 hrs/
              mnth.</p>
              <p>thus, i would safely say that there are unlimited outlets for
              girls to serve NS. we have a labour shortage here. and as jojo
              pointed out, nursing is a more useful qualification than
              soldiering.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well if NS is the best option to increase doctors and nurse counts.</p>
              <p>Then why isn't the government training NS men to become doctors and nurses ? Men can be nurses too.</p>
              <p>Instead why do they make young intelligent men do useless training and waste our tax payer's money ?????</p>
              <p>Why couldn't they simply redirect the abundant human resources to plug the holes in those profession ?</p>
              <p>WHY ?</p>
