              <p><br>1) Logistics is a trueism of war you cannot escape from, whether its WW2 or WW3.</p>
              <p>2) Factors like terrain, weather, force multipliers are all still trueism of wars, whether WW2 or WW3.</p>
              <p>If you bother reading stuff from military analysists, war historians etc, you'll see that much of modern day tactics are developed from WW2 lessons, and that within the military community, there are lots of parallels drawn up between WW2 and modern day wars. In fact there was a documentary comparing the Battle of Britain and the 91 Gulf War, analysing why in one the attacker failed and while in the other the attacker succeeded.</p>
              <p>Only those with a superficial understanding of anything military would make the claim you've made. Nobody with a real in-depth understanding of military affairs would dare claim that WW2 is irrelevant.

              <p>I believe every girls will have an opportunity to join the military, but it HAS to be based on her OWN FREE WILL.</p>
              <p>Enforcing girls to serve NS is wrong. It doesn't shows equality, but it does shows the little value and respect that guys have for girls.</p>
              <p>Or we can put it this way, only people whose Mum and Sisters are/were in the military have the rights to suggest or push for this kind of enforcement.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, try asking your own Mum and sisters and girlfriends to join NS before you even think of suggesting it. Cos it would be more credible to generate more positive response if the females in your family has done it.</p>

              <p>You guys keeps discrediting women's ability to child bearing. You should be telling what you think to those guys instead.</p>
              <p>I can understand SG men's frustration to that disadvantage.</p>
              <p>But why keep pushing this same misery to the women ?</p>
              <p>If the guys are not happy with NS in SG.. it's up to the guys to fight for the rights.</p>
              <p>Insisting females join NS and discounting their contribution to society.. does not make the arguments any more creditworthy.</p>
              <p>Yes, we'd love to give you guys a break.. but are you guys giving us the female folks a break ?</p>
              <p> And remember.. you don't insult another female and yet exalt your own mother and sisters.</p>

              <p><br>then explain to me why the USA lost in vietnam, and currently losing in Iraq and afghanistan. since from ur theory abt the relevance of WWII, usa being the victor of WWII, should have more than enough experience to win these localised wars.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>USA did not lose in Vietnam. They succeeded in their goals for as long as they were there. Those goals were to prevent the invasion of the South by the North. They weren't forced to withdrawl by the NVA. They ultimately went home because the people and more importantly, their civilian government no longer gave them the mandate to wage war. If you were stationed at say, place A and told to prevent A from being invaded by B, and you did so until you were brought home 6 months later, Would you say you failed? No. Would you say you've failed if B invaded A AFTER you were brought home? No.</p>
              <p>Once again I cannot fail to emphasise on the current stalemate in Iraq. I wouldn't say either side has won, but USA DID smash the Saddam regime, which is a military victory in itself. In fact during the 1st Gulf War in 91, the US won because of lessons from WW2 and Vietnam learnt by their able commander Norman Schwarzkopf.</p>
              <p>Again for Afghanistan, I'd be a fool to say outright that the allies have lost. I currently see it as a stalemate, but similiar to Iraq, that stalemate came about AFTER a military victory and regime change. How did the US manage to smash thru the standing military of the former Afghanistani regime? Same thing. Lessons and tactics developed, learnt and refined since WW2.</p>
              <p>The major sticking point for the latter 2 examples is the heavy involvement of religion, which is why the after-effects of the war continues to be felt.</p>

              <p><br>with rgds to ur earlier post. i consider being forced to withdraw, regardless of whether the pressure is from abroad or from within, as defeat. it is like in a gang fight, u may knock out the opposing ringleader. yes, you won a battle. but if you kena hamtam until u cannot  tahan and call for a retreat, i would say that you still lost in the end.</p>
              <p>only when you can leave in absolute peace, without succumbing to external pressure, do i classify that as a win. in vietnam, the usa is forced to withdraw because they can't take it anymore. and like i said, the us retreat in shame, with the north vietnamese entering Saigon as their last helicopter leaves. they are forced to retreat before they become POWs.</p>
              <p>same in Iraq and Afghanistan. the americans can't tahan the war anymore, socially and financially. and right now, they are being force to retreat, before they have reach their objective to eradicating terrorism from the middle east. same thing in vietnam. not only did they not manage to wipe out communism from north vietnam, they too are unable to hold off communism from south vietnam.</p>
              <p>and stop insisting that you are right. Vietnam <strong>is acknowledged </strong>to be a defeat, from all accounts, may it be by a brit, french, chinese, viet or american.</p>
              <p>and by strike force, i don't mean CIA. i mean elite forces. e.g. commandos. in modern wars, territory are gained by elite forces, and hold by regular forces. WWII is where the general infantrymen chiong at the frontline. you try chionging with normal troops today, u will get another vietnam.</p>
              <p>and if you want to quote russia, fine, i shall play along with you. Russia invade afghanistan with regular conventional army and in the end still lose the war. the government was force into withdrawing by the circumstances, not of their own free will.</p>
              <p>and note, the conventional im refering to doesn't mean all sort of conventional forces. i am talking about regular forces, i.e. general infantry.</p>
              <p>and the use of elite units was almost non-existant in WWII. name me any WWII elite units with the likes of commandos, SEALs, etc.</p>
              <p>one last example. look at WWII japan. they held on to singapore until WWII was over. do you say that they won the war? no.  the japanese army was forced to pull back and surrender, when they could easily continuing holding on to singapore until the americans arrive with armed forces to drive them out. therefore, this shows my point again that holding on to territory doesn't equate to winning a war. winning a battle it is. but winning a war it is not.</p>
              <p>and i define winning as:</p>
              <p>1) successful permanent hold on territory. i.e. china held on to tibet and xinjiang for hundreds of years. that is a real victory. up till now, they haven been force to withdraw their presence from these territorities yet.</p>
              <p>2) ability to leave conquer country in peace, as in post WWII, where the allies are able to occupy germany and leave the country 5 yrs later with no insurgency against them. the country remains stable even when occupied.</p>
