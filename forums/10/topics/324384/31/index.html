              <p>Women should either serve NS or pay higher taxes to foot free medical benefits for men who have served. Women can serve their NS in public hospitals and in the Civil Defence as nursing staff, health attendants and medics.

              <p>i disagree on higher taxes, it doesn't make sense. ns doesn't always have to be in traditional form of uniformed groups, it can also be as volunteers, that way we can even free the students from such "duties". and women should be made to serve ns just because of some idea of "equality"  that both sexes moust serve, just like ns for guys is a need for the nation it should be like wise for the girls.</p>

              <p>you realised all foreigners who studied in local uni are required to serve a 3yr bond with the government. if we have more of our locals working in their places, i'm sure they will cut down the no. of places open to foreigners, as there isn't enough places for the foreigners to serve their bond.</p>

              <p>the so called elite units in WWII are simply a bunch of men with outstanding merits, where they promote from regular infantry into ranger unit. yes, they are good, but these "rangers" are not the commandos we are familiar with now. it is essentially just a brand name, establishing the fame of the fighting unit.</p>
              <p>Likewise, you do not equate the top fighting unit of the SAF infantry to commandos, guards. they simply differ in the type of training they were given.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry, go tell the british commandos who carried out the raid of St Nazaire that they're not commandos and see how they kill you.</p>
              <p>If your history is so poor that you do not know how many elite commando units played a vital role in WW2, nothing you've said is even warrents a reply. Anyone who has half a decent knowledge of WW2 will know that groups like the Green Berets, SAS etc were founded during WW2, often around 1941, and had plenty of chances to catch action. Even allowing for your argument that Rangers and Marines aren't Elite units, what about the SAS, SBS, Brit Army Commandos, Candian Navy Command 'W', The Norwegian Commandos responsible for the Telemark raid? They're undoubtedly elite units.</p>
              <p>So really, just admit you're ignorant and full of yourself and stop sprouting nonsense here. You've just proven why any decent military commander in the modern era should have an indepth knowledge of WW2, if only for the simple reason of not looking a fool like you do.</p>
