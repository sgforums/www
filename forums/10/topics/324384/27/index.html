              <p>how is a war fought 60 yrs ago, with primitive technology going to be relevant? look at WWI and WWII, which are only like 20+ yrs apart. alr they were irrelevant in WWII. we don't see chlorine gas, mustard gas being use in WWII. nor do we see million of men entrench along the frontline.</p>
              <p>today, wars are fought with missiles and planes. ground units no longer form the bulk of the attacking forces. stop quoting ur textbook knowledge of pre 90s facts.</p>
              <p>In 1st Gulf war, strategic targets are wiped out with missiles, with planes to do follow up on stray targets. elite forces i.e. delta force is later sent in to clear stray pockets of resistance. Same situation in 2nd Gulf War. the war is won before it is fought.</p>
              <p>and again, i shall remind you that Iraq at that point of time (in fact both times), has the world's 4th largest army, behind China, N.Korea, and Russia. with that size, it should be safe to assume that they can handle any conventional war. but alas, they still lost both wars. So there goes ur point about the relevance of large armies and conventional warfare.</p>
              <p>so, please stop harping ur crap about WWII.</p>

              <p>Pt 2 mentioned are important at the immediate war front. In the bigger strategic planning, pt 1 is important (was a QM during NS), because your ammo and other supplies would have sort of run low. You need ample and precise logistics resupply before you can carry on the next fight.</p>

              <p>Pt 2 mentioned are important at the immediate war front. In the bigger strategic planning, pt 1 is important (was a QM during NS), because your ammo and other supplies would have sort of run low. You need ample and precise logistics resupply before you can carry on the next fight.</p>

              <p><br>Ultimately no matter what, past wars are never irrelevant. All brilliant strategic masters in the past were people who understood the relevance of history, not people who think they know better and dismiss it out of hand. No doubt if deathmaster lead an army, they'd be on the highway to defeat.</p>

              <p>To be fair, men have it easier in the process of creating life.
