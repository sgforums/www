              <p>So if I tell you, that is my choice to die protecting my children with my body, is that your problem in the first place?</p>
              <p>Don't tell me what I should be doing best for my own children, just because you have no confidence or ability to protect woman like me.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should understand that not all woman are just like you, who is willing to kill another using war as an excuse to do so. Some women refuses to take lives, just like me.</p>
              <p>I have made up my resolve to die for my children, have you made up your resolve to die protecting your woman and children? Or are you still seeking to hide behind some excuse for not doing so?</p>
              <p>IF you're a real MAN, make up your resolve and stand by it even if it will cause you to die.</p>
              <p>You certainly don't need to convince me and jojobeach to share the same resolve as you, unless you're afraid of making the wrong resolve?</p>
              <p>You're a guy right? Then you don't need to hold hands to go toilet with me and jojobeach.</p>
