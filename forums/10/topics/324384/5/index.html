              <p>NS is any form of service to the country, i.e. welfare service, nursing etc, does not have to be army. as <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/70150">333225520</a> had mentioned, getting our ladies to serve at hospitals is a good idea, since we are so short of local nursing staff. even in the SAF, there are foreign nurses working in the military hospitals.</p>
              <p>so, in a hospitals, do you expect these "foreign talents" to diligently stay at their workplace and serve the wounded, when there's a war going on around them? or do you expect to hire more foreigners into the army hospitals to work for you?</p>
              <p>and i would like to point out something i observed. is it that valid to compare a 2 yr NS with a 9 months pregnancy?</p>
              <p>the birthrate for singapore is currently 1.29 per women. so, it means that most women now have only 1 child, with some having 2 kids. 9 months X 2 = 18 months, still doesn't match up to 24 months in SAF.</p>

              <p>feel that all including women should serve NS.</p>
              <p>although some might argue that it has been scientifically proven
                                      that women are physically weaker than men, it is not entirely true
                                      that women are mentally weaker than men. at the same time, some may
                                      also argue that having females in the army is a distraction to
                                      men.</p>
              <p>i beg to differ. although at times it might be a distraction,
                                      men can learn from the neatness habits and discipline of women.</p>
              <p>also, women can be trained to assist in first aid and the
                                      provision of food during war, allowing the men to concentrate on
                                      the battle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these are my views.</p>
              <p>what are yours?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Sure, why not?<br>But so as to not have the same thing happen in Malaysia with their poorly executed carbon copy NS, such as rape of the female members by those of the opposite sex, it should be segregated.</p>
              <p>Perhaps females should be sent to more 'female' oriented units as being of the weaker sex, they would be more of a liability than an asset (generally speaking, no sexism here, just being objective.) as they might require more 'rescue' missions to rescue them and thus compromise the group's safety/mission.</p>
              <p>"Female" oriented units include:</p>
              <p>Intelligence dept, air force, navy, communications, tech, trainers.</p>
              <p>First aid and food provision is also not a bad idea, but I say, if you're going to do something, do it all the way, so integrating these women into more roles in NS would be beneficial to the country as you would have double the amount of people.</p>
              <p>However,</p>
              <p>Singapore places NS 'extra' pay as a way to imbue a sort of patriarchy, because men goes to NS and thus has higher wages to 'compensate' for his 2 years sacrifice.</p>
              <p>It should be like Israel, male and female go to war.</p>
              <p>It might also reduce rape cases as females can defend themselves and karate chop the old chee ko peks instead of scream like idiotic ninnies.</p>

              <p>Its unfair to be 24 months right ? So u do feel some sense of unfairness. Just minus the bitching and moaning part; and the fact that you already been thru ns and out now does not quite put u in the category of ppl demanding women serve ns when they themselves have not even served ns before.</p>

              <p><br>i am not talking about army nurses. just nurses in general. and it is a fact that nursing is a foreigner-dominated job, with rgds to military, civilian etc.</p>
              <p>just a few day ago, the newspaper announce that there is currently a dearth of nurses, foreign or local, in our hospitals, esp nursing homes where patients require long term treatment.</p>
              <p>and imagine that u r a foreign nurse in singapore. U may stay here if SARs and avian flu is on the rampage. but would you do the same, when bombs are dropping around you? look at Israel's invasion of Lebandon. the first among the first to flee are their foreign professionals.</p>
