              <p><br>Well I guess then that you haven't been following the CONVENTIONAL warfare that has been raging on the past 48 hours in Eastern Europe. Yes, set piece battles, tanks, troups attacking strategic objectives. The massive EU vs Russia conventional war that has been threatening to happen throughout the 70s and 80s during the cold war has ironically happened after the end of the cold war.</p>
              <p>It's a fool who doesn't realise that WWII facts are relevant because they've contributed to the evolution of warfare theory, and more importantly, because Russia still largely employs methods of conventional warfare thats not far off from WWII tactics. And now, we have a shooting war that Russia is directly involved in. Suddenly WWII facts don't seem that irrelevant anymore ^^</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>how is a war fought 60 yrs ago, with primitive technology going to be relevant? look at WWI and WWII, which are only like 20+ yrs apart. alr they were irrelevant in WWII. we don't see chlorine gas, mustard gas being use in WWII. nor do we see million of men entrench along the frontline.</p>
              <p>today, wars are fought with missiles and planes. ground units no longer form the bulk of the attacking forces. stop quoting ur textbook knowledge of pre 90s facts.</p>
              <p>In 1st Gulf war, strategic targets are wiped out with missiles, with planes to do follow up on stray targets. elite forces i.e. delta force is later sent in to clear stray pockets of resistance. Same situation in 2nd Gulf War. the war is won before it is fought.</p>
              <p>and again, i shall remind you that Iraq at that point of time (in fact both times), has the world's 4th largest army, behind China, N.Korea, and Russia. with that size, it should be safe to assume that they can handle any conventional war. but alas, they still lost both wars. So there goes ur point about the relevance of large armies and conventional warfare.</p>
              <p>so, please stop harping ur crap about WWII.</p>

              <p><strong>2. to inculcate discipline to our boys so that they will not

              <p>If you want to say women who don't have children should serve NS to make it fair . OK.. so they start serving NS when they are past 40 ? Say.. after menopause ? If not.. how you know which ones will confirm not give birth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have some married friends.. when they got married.. they agreed not to have babies.. but after a couple of years later.. a baby pop out, then few years later , another one pop out. How to explain this ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then females who serve NS AND give birth.. makes it very unfair already mah. Are you guys prepared to give more to the mothers who served NS ? Please don tell me got mothers day ok ? </p>

              <p>who doesn't have parents to take care of?</p>
              <p>how many women (young women specifically), have childrens and in-laws to take care of? not to mention young women, even alot f the middle age women remain single, with no one to care for.</p>
              <p>and if you had been observing the news, only 59% of babies this yr are born by singaporeans. so much for ur stereotypical view that singapore women will 100% have a baby. alot of local couples, from my observations, are choosing to remain childless.</p>
              <p>in this case, do you still insist on arguing that women need not serve NS since they will be serving the country by having more children? what about those women who remain single / childless? from your theory, doesn't it mean that they will get to enjoy the whole of their lives at others' expense, not having to undergo the "9 month pregnancy ordeal" or the "2 yr ++ NS ordeal"?</p>
              <p>therefore, since singapore women are obviously not having more children, what reason is there remaining for them to not serve NS?</p>

              <p><br>If we got 2 to 3 babies, it not just 9 months, it 9+9+9, and for your info, every women like to have childrens, it is just that the influential and demanding society create here called for less childrens or even not marrying, as on equal footing with our male counterpart, we do contribute to the economy as a whole, and bear in mind if we are to pull out of the working class, the economy will collapse. I am not saying who is right or wrong, but definitely, to hv childrens, it need a male and female to join, solely blaming us get you no where, and asking us to enrol in NS, could only further reduce the birthrate. And for your male sake, NS is the last pride you guys have to uphold in comparing with us. </p>

              <p><strong>2. to inculcate discipline to our boys so that they will not dispel themselves into crimes and anti vices action as most countries boys do at this stage of boy's puberty.</strong></p>

              <p><br>it is true, and also one more thing which i hv to admit, due to education, we singaporeans female lost our feminism kind of stuff, just like we dun care our lover as what foreign gals do, it is natural for us to be abit proud n stuck up, that i hv to admit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, to most singaporean males, to marry down is better than to marry up. To us, gone are the days where male are the house chief, if u see the nos of foreign gals coming here for marriages, you will know, and these gals are a big big threat to us.</p>

              <p>We should have a professional army. Only those who want will join.</p>
              <p>Since the garbrament likes to use money to retain talent, how about we pay:</p>
              <p>Recruits: $2K/month</p>
              <p>LCP: $2.5K/month</p>
              <p>CPL: $3K/month</p>
              <p>3SG: $3.5k/month</p>
              <p>$500 pay increase per promotion. Plus 2.5month bonus every yr. Attractive enough?</p>
              <p>Singapore can well afford it. We dont need so much soldiers. So-called 3G army.</p>

              <p>According to the garbrament, if you are highly paid=talented.</p>
              <p>So they pay people huge amounts of money and 'label' them 'talent'. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>I wouldn't know whether they are talented or not, would I? LOL</p>

              <p><br>it is true, and also one more thing which i hv to admit, due to education, we singaporeans female lost our feminism kind of stuff, just like we dun care our lover as what foreign gals do, it is natural for us to be abit proud n stuck up, that i hv to admit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, to most singaporean males, to marry down is better than to marry up. To us, gone are the days where male are the house chief, if u see the nos of foreign gals coming here for marriages, you will know, and these gals are a big big threat to us.</p>

              <p>Wah you contradict a lot leh, at one time say you like to take care of family, children, etc, making yourself sound like an ideal housewife; now saying you're stuck up.</p>
