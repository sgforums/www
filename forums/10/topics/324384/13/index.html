              <p>It's hard not to see combat when the neighbourhood you live in is a warzone, idiot ^^ Going shopping with makeup on, and with a Uzi or M-16 is an everyday thing. So yea, you compare simi? Just because they have makeup on "ooo they're not real army girls". Hah. No doubt in a firefight you won't last 2 seconds <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. And let an Israeli girl hear you say that, she'll make sure you won't be able to reproduce. Not that it's a bad thing mind, stops the gene pool from being polluted.</p>

              <p>in monetary terms, outside earn more money</p>
              <p>in case of advantages, outside got freedom, got time.</p>
              <p>but having said so, I still think NS did mould some guys into better men in character though some became more pessimistic with life. the effect might not turn out that right for females, they might become rowdy and rough after the supposingly enforced NS.</p>

              <p>Jeff86, honestly, lots of guys also aren't tough enough to do NS but thats no justification for them not having to do it. I say, make everyone go do it, tough enough or not. BMT will sort out who are the ones suited for combat and who aren't, regardless of gender.</p>
              <p>And yes I agree about the bonds forged. Girls SHOULD give it a try. And like I said, I don't think people should worry about men being overly sentimental about protecting women. I get the role of pointwoman a lot of the time during CQB training because I'm actually well suited to go around a corner (being small and thus able to move faster), and the rest of the team are guys.</p>

              <p>Maybe less people should be involved in NS. Its just basically working for the govt with low pay unless they sign on. My views may change if SG ever change their govt, no longer PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for girls to serve NS, you can see cases of peeping, outrage of modesty increases. And it will be a common scene when you see those hamsap enciks sent to DB.</p>

              <p>True. Alot of my officers are good for nothing! Only know how to talk but don't know how to do. They visit those LSB even though they are married with children. When wife pays a visit, they pretended to be good husbands.</p>
