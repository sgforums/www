              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thanks for your reply and your attempts to answer, in your personal perspective, on the points i had raised.</p>
              <p>However, it seems that you still hold on to your cherished ideal that logistics and numerical advantage/force multipliers is the key to winning a war.</p>
              <p>I know not your arguments with Reyes, nor wish to take sides, or even to prove you wrong. But only for discussion's sake, i only wish to point out that such ideology is unfortunately flawed, as Dick Cheny had found out, after much american lives had been lost.</p>
              <p>US with the greatest logistics and the manufacturing capabilities found this doctrine true as it could win a war in the 1940s against germans. Such doctrine held, even during 'Nam.</p>
              <p>They failed to realized the truth of a change in modern warfare, which was that the highly motivated north vietnamese were prepared to fight for 100 years to regain their motherland, using attrition guerilla tactics till US goes broke. USA was sick of the fights and the money spent.</p>
              <p>China of the billion people sent its million soldiers in waves to stop the vietnamese in 1979, but failed to humble Vietnam. ( although politics did play a part, but still the feared CCP army lives were lost)</p>
              <p>USSR lost the war in Afghanistan in a similar way. The relentless motivated mujuhideen guerillas never stopped thrashing their supply lines or give them one day of peace in their 10 year war, then blended back as goatherds or nomads, with the russian troops none the wiser.</p>
              <p>I cannot comment on Iraq now, for win or lose, only time will tell, but i do know Dick Cheny and his doctrine is out of the picture.</p>
              <p>In modern warfare, it is not enough for a Chief of Staff or Supreme Commander to win battles or just hold ground. They are promoted to WIN A WAR. And winning a war means pacifying the armed and unarmed enemies as well, otherwise, the military hardware and efforts spent would be lost.</p>
              <p>Thus, for any nation to wage war, it is best that they look into how to win a war and not just battles. Moments of instabilities, protests, hunger, destabilisation, etc are the best times to move a conquering army in. Most reputable military colleges are thus refining their doctrines.</p>
              <p>Numbers alone mean nothing. Give me a thousand motivated men and i will annhilate a million well equipped soldiers, piecemeal by piecemeal. As the vietcong had said ' I owned the night!' </p>
              <p>PS: By the way, aren't we off-topic?</p>

              <p>I already pointed out in my post that the USA did not fail entirely in it's military objectives, and indeed arguably, did succeed in its goals while they were there. The lack of will to stay on, was not one factor the military was responsible for. In fact, the military WANTED to stay on and finish the job. It is the civilian government who was responsible for that. Any military commander's job is to win battles, and he cannot do so unless his governmental bosses have the will to let him accomplish that whatever means necessary. In that respect, I agree with you that hearts and minds is important, but disagree that it is the most important, or that it is a major responsibility of any military commander. Like you pointed out, its the consideration of the nation, it's leaders, and not it's military generals. Military generals are versed in military tactics and manuvers, anything else like hearts and minds, is up to the leaders of a nation waging war, to TELL the military commanders to do.</p>
              <p>I also pointed out that the muhajadeen did not make a major impact on the Soviet military forces until they started getting proper logistical support from the CIA. They were i fact, getting their asses kicked by the Soviets and their helicopters until the CIA supplied them with Stingers. If that doesnt show how important logistics is, I don't know what does.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, nobody can win a fight with nothing but willpower, bare hands and a hungry stomach.</p>
              <p>I am willing to take a million decently motivated men who are well equipped, trained, and dug-in, and meet your 1000 fanatics. I think we'll see that your boast might have been a bit exaggerated.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>My stance, in summary:</p>
              <p>1) Women are equally capaable of serving in a military capacity as men.</p>
              <p>2) Just because we are capable doesn't mean we must, but just because men are capable doesn't mean they must as well.</p>
              <p>3) I do not support national service for a regime I do not support.</p>
              <p>4) However in the interest of fairness, if a country has national service, women should be liable for it as well.</p>
              <p>5) A woman's life is not more or less valuable than a man's. The life of a man and the life of a woman are equally valuable.</p>
              <p>6) However, national service for women, for practical purposes, can consist of civil/social service in addition to military service. It does not have to be only military or only civil/social.</p>

              <p>If you as the conqueror, having won in a military battle against my military hardware, and resulting in me and my men fighting underground, can offer these ideals, you would have won our hearts and mind, and the war. Peace will be within grasp. </p>

              <p>However, people like me can be stopped. No one wants to fight forever. Everything is negotiable. If you can educate and convince me that you can offer a better life for my men and those that i am fighting for, my men will lay down their weapons.</p>
              <p>Freedom and equality, freedom from hunger, freedom of worship, freedom from poverty, freedom from illiteracy, freedom from discrimination, equal opportunities for all, etc - are the basic ideals most men would fight for.</p>
              <p>If you as the conqueror, having won in a military battle against my military hardware, and resulting in me and my men fighting underground, can offer these ideals, you would have won our hearts and mind, and the war. Peace will be within grasp. </p>
              <p>And that is what US is trying to achieve in Iraq.</p>

              <p>I meant the academic debate, silly :)</p>
              <p>As for your men, I'd like to see your men do that when I rotate my men in 4 shifts with 250,000 per shift. Of course it seems you didn't bother to read my post.</p>
              <p>"I am willing to take a million decently motivated men who are well equipped, trained, and dug-in, and meet your 1000 fanatics"</p>
              <p>And oh all your tactics will only work... if I give you time to. I can simply crush you in one overwhelming blow, without consideration to what the international community thinks. When I kill all 1000 of you within 48 hours, I'd like to see you try any of what you've mentioned.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I recommend you read Sniper One. See what motivated Iraqi Insurgents managed to do against a well trained and well equipped British Battalion with strong logistical network. After 6 months, before a new battalion was rotated in, the death toil for the insurgents stood at over a good several thousand, while the death toil for the brits stands at... 4(1 of which was due to an accident and not enemy fire).</p>
              <p>I don't think you know enough of real soldiers to know that they're nothing like what you describe:</p>
              <p> "your men will be shivering in between the sheets and having sleepless night, wondering whose turn tonight to meet us and wake up in hell"</p>
              <p>During their stay in Iraq, Al Amarah, the british battalion were actually eager for action. Their mindsets weren't "whose turn is it to meet the enemy tonight". It was more a "lets go out and fuck 'em over". I honestly suggest you speak to enough Iraq veterans before you start heaping scorn on professional soldiers.</p>

              <p>My stance, in summary:</p>
              <p>1) Women are equally capaable of serving in a military capacity as men.</p>
              <p>2) Just because we are capable doesn't mean we must, but just because men are capable doesn't mean they must as well.</p>
              <p>3) I do not support national service for a regime I do not support.</p>
              <p>4) However in the interest of fairness, if a country has national service, women should be liable for it as well.</p>
              <p>5) A woman's life is not more or less valuable than a man's. The life of a man and the life of a woman are equally valuable.</p>
              <p>6) However, national service for women, for practical purposes, can consist of civil/social service in addition to military service. It does not have to be only military or only civil/social.</p>

              <p>If you read point 6, you can see I said that for pratical purposes, women should be able to serve in civil/social services as part of NS.</p>
              <p>And you asked a question out of ignorance and got pwned. Don't follow it up with belligerence because that won't get you out of the hole you dug yourself. It just gets you deeper.</p>

              <p>its not a matter of getting pawned or not, that dun hurt me a single cents lost, But your insistence in getting we women folks into NS is quite ridiculous indeed.</p>
