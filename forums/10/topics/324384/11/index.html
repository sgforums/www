              <p>you ppl here are really thinking of really extreme scenarios.</p>
              <p>the point of first aid in a war, isn't really about aiding the soldiers. they have medics to serve that purpose in the saf.</p>
              <p>maybe you do get wounded soldiers on ur doorsteps, but if that really happen, it is time for u to worry.  something wrong must have happen to the entire unit . i.e. entire unit wiped out etc.</p>
              <p>rather, civilian first aid is useful for injuries such as burns, cuts, etc. in a war, they are going to drop bombs all over. you can't have soldiers position everywhere all over the country. they are concentrated in certain areas, and that is the characteristic of any army (other than guerilla army).</p>
              <p>so, if a bomb land through ur neighbours' roof, you will be the immediate person available to apply first aid, since it is obvious that medical aid will take some time to arrive, esp during wartime.</p>
              <p>and in this time and age, with terrorism on the loose, you may never know when you will be around when there's a terrorist bombing. your father/husband/boyfriend/son may not be always be around to protect/help you.</p>
              <p>in the end, the only person you can depend on is still yourself. therefore, i think it is very important for everyone to learn first aid.</p>
              <p>and parn, i don't disagree with you that it is the job of soldiers to defend the country. but dcx is also right to say that we should have at least some sort of weapon proficiency courses available to the average woman.</p>
              <p>operating a weapon is not as easy as it appears on movies. it takes expertise to use a weapon effectively. look at the SAF forums, and u will find that most of the army guys actually do not fare very well in their marksmanship test.</p>
              <p>even these "trained" guys can't shoot accurately, how do you think an ordinary civilian with no prior knowledge of operating a gun will fare?</p>
              <p>if singapore is ever to be invaded, the enemy may not have such a high moral conduct like the US. look at the indonesian riots of 1997. if they are able to be so cruel to their chinese countrymen, you think they will be so caring to you meh?</p>
              <p>and like someone mentioned, it would be very stupid for anyone to pick up a random weapon from the ground, and not knowing how to operate it. it is also stupid to go around without some sort of defense when the enemies are very aggressive.</p>

              <p>Wow...yet another long-lived thread. I agree with deathmaster's points.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure with armed forces of other countries, but I believe Singaporeans are generally nice people. We will only be at war when we are made into it. So I don't think our soldiers will treat civilians badly. But you also have to consider the safeguard of our soldiers. If they ran into some civilians, asking them to drop arms but instead, the civilians fire back, then I guess our soldiers has no choice but to take them out.</p>
              <p>And there's a guy mention a good point, our armed forces prepare us for war, not making us to go to war. Anyone who is well-versed with the armed forces mission statement will understand this.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, I believe women should go to NS, but not necessary a uniformed-NS. Maybe make them do VWO stuff for 2 years? I don't know, but since I believe there's a demand in VWO for manpower and since NS would have tested the guts and hearts of an average Singaporean male, then I guess it will be fair and natural for women to go through some kind of service to test their hearts and minds too.</p>
