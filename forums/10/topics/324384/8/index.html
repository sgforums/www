              <p>Shen Jing Bing.......if he can make it to my place and ask me to tend to his wound, then he's probably not that wounded!!! Most I'll do for him is to call a taxi for him and ask the uncle to send him home or back to his camp.</p>

              <p><br>If you will to be taught on how to use a gun weapon, will you choose to use your 30CM kitchen knife or a gun weapon? Which will have a higher chance of protecting yourself n children?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By common sense would have tell you that a gun weapon would be the ideal choice compared to a kitchen knife...and that's when you know how to use the gun weapon...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tell me, for the distance between u &amp; the enemy is 50metres, is the kitchen knife more effective or the gun weapon?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And how many kitchen knifes will you have with you?</p>

              <p>Like I have mentioned before, I do not wish to kill the enemy as much as you do.</p>
              <p>I will do my best to protect my children.</p>
              <p>Maybe you need to understand that women are not meant to kill but mostly only to be killed.</p>
              <p>And what can MAN do if woman like me has made up my mind to sacrifice for my children instead of killing the enemy?</p>

              <p>What i've been trying to bring is self protection/protecting
              your children/parent when in need by understanding the knowledge of
              serving NS...6months should be more than enough....</p>

              <p>Never assume that you know the enemy very well based on your

              <p>Ohh.. 6 months ah... can lah.. but no need BMT right ? No need reservist right ?</p>
              <p>All they need is go to classes .. then get certificate right ? Then go for 1-2 day refresher course every year after ROD...</p>
              <p>Then that one is not call NS...that one is call survival training lah.....</p>
              <p>Here in USA also have... CPR certifications and first aid lah....</p>
              <p>Most community colledge offers this kind of classes one.....</p>
              <p>In fact.. people here hire nanny to take care of their young children.. they want this kind of certifications...</p>
              <p>Relax lah..</p>
              <p>Singapore should include this kind of training into their school curriculum lah....</p>
