              <p>We're only discussing whether should women in Singapore do NS as well, and at least 3 of us, deathmaster, mancha and I realised that NS doesn't necessarily have to mean SAF, SPF or SCDF. Any other social-service related vocation can be considered as NS as well.</p>

              <p>you really remind me of the pussycat dolls you know. seemingly an ambassador for feminism, yet only on the grounds that you are capable of child bearing and enduring through pregnancy. at the same time, still flaunting your sexuality for guys to oogle over.</p>
              <p>feminists i do have respect for argue that despite their biological differences with men, they are equally as capable leaders and thinkers. some even argue that it is their biological difference that makes them even better leaders and thinkers as compared to men. really, you should not be that superficial.</p>
              <p>the undeniable fact is that 2 years of national service stifles a person's development, especially in his youth. it is perhaps out of spite and the demand for "fairness" that has lead to ppl in this thread demanding that women should also serve national service- because the men themselves have realized their growth has been stifled. i myself must plead guilty to that.</p>
              <p>on a serious note, getting women to serve NS is unreasonable and unnecessary as well. but history has been more unfair for the male gender in the sense that we HAVE ALREADY wasted our 2 years (or more) in NS, while the debate lingers on about whether women should suffer the same bad fate.</p>
              <p>therefore if i were you, i would give men the license to bitch</p>

A job that has very much different jobscope as compare to the civillians as well.

              <p>Before you say something like this, take a step into other people's shoes and consider that they, unlike you, did not need to pause and think about their next step, and would have gone on to a brighter future sooner if not for NS. For people like them, it CAN be a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Yes of course the upside(theres always 2 sides to a coin) is that one experiences a great many things one otherwise never would in civilian life. The downside is ALSO that one experiences a great many things on otherwise never would need to in civilian life.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, asI already said, NS is a necessary evil.</p>

              <p>feminists i do have respect for argue that despite their biological differences with men, they are equally as capable leaders and thinkers. some even argue that it is their biological difference that makes them even better leaders and thinkers as compared to men. really, you should not be that superficial.</p>
              <p>the undeniable fact is that 2 years of national service stifles a person's development, especially in his youth. it is perhaps out of spite and the demand for "fairness" that has lead to ppl in this thread demanding that women should also serve national service- because the men themselves have realized their growth has been stifled. i myself must plead guilty to that.</p>
              <p>on a serious note, getting women to serve NS is unreasonable and unnecessary as well. but history has been more unfair for the male gender in the sense that we HAVE ALREADY wasted our 2 years (or more) in NS, while the debate lingers on about whether women should suffer the same bad fate.</p>
