Nothing else. SMRT and SBS will never let them use the space without making them pay. Either that or an extra fare hike for the rest of us. The term "Social Responsibility" is alien to them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Sure if the loanshark wants to pay or you want to pay the space for your missing pet, go for it. I'm sure LTA would be happy to earn your $$. We're also not talking about soliciting for some Charity Drive etc but to appeal to the public to look out for missing people.<br><br>As well, even if they wanted to give some free space, they can have some form of adopted Charity for the month/tri-monthly/year whatever if they don't want to concentrate on just one Non-Profit Organisation.<br><br>LTA is part of the government!!!

If you look at Singapore as Singapore Inc, just like any company, you have the CEO, Managers, different departments etc<br><br>LTA is a department of Singapore Inc which is in charge of anything pertaining to transportation issues or use of their space etc.<br><br>This is not even a major issue. It's about free advertisements. It's like saying  you need to go to Mr Bill Gates to ask if their supplier/customer/whatever can place a free ad on some of their software boxes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If the CEO or our Mr Prime Minister have to decide on these minor issues our country is in MAJOR trouble.<br><br>The customer makes a proposal to your company, as the executive in the department in-charge of the issue, you will have to make proposals to the management first and the management will have to decide. If management cannot decide then they bring it up in their management meeting to discuss.<br><br>Basically what is happening now is that it is likely the executive don't want to make a recommandation and it's easier to say no then to propose to management why it  is a good idea, $ aside. Anyway if this is a major issue I would agree go direct to the boss, but this is more of a value added social service which is not essential. Good to have but can live without which is not necessary to go direct. Anyway this can be handled just by the head of department <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
