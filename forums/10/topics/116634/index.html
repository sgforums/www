From schools to parents, from friends to media. Some teachers are really just there for the money, some really work their asses off. Children being more difficult to teach is not just a national problem. IT IS A WORLD PROBLEM.<br><br>If any parent who feels that the teacher or the school is not good enough for their child, by all means, find another school. Govt schools are like HDB flats. It is subsidised and this is all our govt can give. If you don't like it, you can buy a condo or a plot of land and build your own house, that is, if you can afford to. Similarly, you can find another so called better school.<br><br>Please get this right. It is not the schools that forms the students, rather it's the students that form a good school.<br><br>JusticeLegal or LegalJustice, if every teacher can do a 100% percent job, do you think you would have a chance to be a tutor?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not really. During the so called December and June holidays, teachers have to go back to school to work. I believe they have at most two weeks of free time a year which is quite similar to the rest of the working force.

I am signing my letter of appointment tmr but none of these things mentioned in either the previous threads or this is going to stop me from doing so.<br><br>Ok here's some additional points to Justicelegal or LegalJustice which ever way it is... frankly being a tutor does not allow you to see what teachers are really going through, even as someone in the other thread told you to undergo relief teaching but still it is really different from wat real teachers are experiencing.<br><br>I been a tutor for more than 5 years now and i did relief at my former primary school for 3 mths after my JC too. Both are really a breeze to me... I knock off straight at 1pm after teaching and went orchard road while my former primary school teachers stay back for meetings, to mark book or just to prepare for the next day teaching material. Many times i asked my teachers why did they take up teaching in the first place and whether they regret doing so and if i should join teaching... the replies i got are nothing but positive<br><br>I would agree with what u say a few years back when i did once thought that teaching was a half day with high pay lotsa holiday job (although that was not the reason i took up teaching)...<br><br>but now... i can only say try not to jump into conclusion so quickly about something u have no completely no idea of.  The world of teaching is not as rosy as u have thought.<br><br></div>
