              November manufacturing output declined by 7.5 per cent compared with
              the same month last year, according to the Economic Development Board
              Friday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>On a seasonally adjusted
              month-on-month basis, output rose 6.2 per cent in November, due to a
              higher level of production in the biomedical manufacturing cluster, the
              state agency said.<br><br>The three-month moving average year-on-year index for November fell 5.5 per cent compared to the same period last year.<br><br>Cumulative manufacturing output for the first eleven months of 2008 fell 3.3 per cent compared with the same period last year.<br><br>While
              biomedical the manufacturing and transport engineering sectors
              expanded, output of the chemical industry dropped by 20.1 per cent
              year-on-year, while the petrochemicals segment was down 31.6 per cent.<br><br>The electronics cluster shrank 19.4 per cent in November, compared with the same month last year.<br><br><em><a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1450261.php/Singapore9s_November_manufacturing_output_declines_by_7.5_per_cent_">http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1450261.php/Singapore...</a><br></em><br><strong><br>Singapore sees 9.7-per-cent drop in November visitors</strong><br><em>DPA<br></em><br>Tourist
              arrivals in Singapore fell by 9.7 per cent in November to 760,000
              visitors compared to the same month a year ago, the Singapore Tourism
              Board (STB) said Friday. <br><br>Indonesia, China, Australia, Malaysia
              and India were Singapore's top five visitor-generating markets,
              accounting for 49 per cent of total visitor arrivals for the month. <br><br>The
              STB said the visitor arrivals in Singapore had been declining since
              June, reflecting the continued impact of the worsening global economic
              slowdown on consumer sentiments and discretionary spending. <br><br>Visitor
              arrivals and tourism receipts were expected to fall short of this
              year's targets of 10.8 million visitors and earnings of 15.5 billion
              Singapore dollars (10.74 billion US dollars), respectively. <br><br><em><a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1450263.php/Singapore_sees_9.7-per-cent_drop_in_November_visitors_">http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1450263.php/Singapore...</a></em></p>

              <p>C'mon, you guys, messengers of doom and gloom, give the revered old man a break.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is often easy on HINDSIGHT, with full end result in view, to blame others except ourselves for our lack of foresight. It's no use playing the blame game. I never did blame anyone of you, being educated yet unable to forsaw this impending doom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who suspected, they have no evidence to prove themselves right. It's like you have seen an UFO and tell others, but without any photographic proof or credible eyewitness, who can be blamed for not believing you? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No one can be blamed, except for that despicable group of loan managers who gave away money to those that are not capable of repaying it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone trusted the financial system, and those who were in charge are deemed to have done their regulatory work to process the loan and repackaged it as securities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defaulters are common in any loan instruments, but not in significant numbers that can cause an entire collapse of the market before. Credit card defaults had been around over the years, but it never did cause any major problems, because there were regulatory due process being perform to weed out the unsecured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for loans packaged into derivatives, there were none. What cause the dramatic collapse was not the numbers of defaulters, but a total absolute lost of confidence in the financial markets. Everyone panic and hoarded their money instead, fearing exposure to such instruments, leading to a collapse in the REAL economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without capital or loans, real economy biz enterprise cannot move forward. No one saw this comming, or had the facts and figures convincing enough to rectify it earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, almost everyone claim they saw it comming, becoming prophets overnight! Worse still, in their delusions, they blame everyone else for their bad foresight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thing is, playing the blame game is too late. We need to find solutions and move forward. Hoarding money is not the answer. It is only a lack of confidence response. Everyone loses out in the end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have no confidence, why bother working? You might not get paid. Better to hide at home. And when you run out of money and need to eat, why bother to think of selling your gold jewellry? What makes you think that if you have no confidence in others, why would buyers or employers have confidence in you and your product or skill?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a message of hope instead of gloom, think of the market as going thru 'creative destruction'. Only the best will survive, not ALL industries will die. From those that survive will a stronger economy arise. Thing is, which industries or companies will be the ones that will survive. I am sure many will have eyes to see and know, and to act accordingly, instead of whining doom and gloom.</p>

                  view, to blame others except ourselves for our lack of
                  foresight. It's no use playing the blame game. I never did blame
                  anyone of you, being educated yet unable to forsaw this impending
                  doom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who suspected, they have no evidence to prove
                  themselves right. It's like you have seen an UFO and tell others,
                  but without any photographic proof or credible eyewitness, who can
                  be blamed for not believing you? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No one can be blamed,
                  except for that despicable group of loan managers who gave away
                  money to those that are not capable of repaying it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone trusted the financial system, and those who
                  were in charge are deemed to have done their regulatory work
                  to process the loan and repackaged it as securities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defaulters are common in any loan instruments, but not
                  in significant numbers that can cause an entire collapse
                  of the market before. Credit card defaults had been around over the
                  years, but it never did cause any major problems, because
                  there were regulatory due process being perform to weed out the
                  unsecured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for loans packaged into derivatives, there were none. What
                  cause the dramatic collapse was not the numbers of defaulters,
                  but a total absolute lost of confidence in the financial markets.
                  Everyone panic and hoarded their money instead, fearing
                  exposure to such instruments, leading to a collapse in the REAL
                  economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without capital or loans, real economy biz enterprise
                  cannot move forward. No one saw this comming, or had the facts and
                  figures convincing enough to rectify it earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, almost everyone claim they saw it comming, becoming
                  prophets overnight! Worse still, in their delusions, they blame
                  everyone else for their bad foresight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thing is, playing the blame game is too late. We need to find
                  solutions and move forward. Hoarding money is not the answer. It is
                  only a lack of confidence response. Everyone loses out in the
                  end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have no confidence, why bother working? You might not get
                  paid. Better to hide at home. And when you run out of money and
                  need to eat, why bother to think of selling your gold jewellry?
                  What makes you think that if you have no confidence in others, why
                  would buyers or employers have confidence in you and your
                  product or skill?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a message of hope instead of gloom, think of the market as
                  going thru 'creative destruction'. Only the best will survive, not
                  ALL industries will die. From those that survive will a stronger
                  economy arise. Thing is, which industries or companies will be the
                  ones that will survive. I am sure many will have eyes to see and
                  know, and to act accordingly, instead of whining doom and
                  gloom.</p>

              <p>This "total absolute lost [sic] of confidence" is a reaction, a result. Obviously its not a <em>cause</em>. Just like you may lose confidence in (a result), for instance, a friend, because he made a tragic mistake (cause).</p>
