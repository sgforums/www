            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed that teachers should allow the kids to play sports that they enjoy. If they enjoy the sports a lot more, then the each individual session wouldn't feel like a chore to them.<br><br>Exercise and sports shd feel like fun- so that people will continue to get motivated and stay on course. The more you make it regimentated however, the more demoralising it will be for those who go through it.<br><br>TAF PE teachers shouldn't behave like a commando drill officer 99% all the time.</div>

I was in there coz I was borderline overweight and I dropped 16 kilos when I was in there. For the first time in my life I could see six packs! Became bloody fit after that when I went to combat unit. NS is the best for weight loss man....I tell you after that I got so many calls from girls.

That's obvious. Even if ur not gonna be fat, your high blood pressure and other stuff will get u into trouble.<br><br>So the cue is: have a balanced diet. Balance ur meals with some or more cooked veggies, fish, complex carbo and lean meats while eating ur fav(but oily stuff) food once a while. If u eat healthily most of time, a trip to the Mac or a plate of chao mian won't kill you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>while we try to make exercise as fun and enjoyable as possible, it cannot be too easy or too relaxed, otherwise there wouldn't be any health benefits and we would all be wasting our time.  a certain balance is needed.  not too demanding as to put people off but not too easy either as to render the exercise futile.<br><br>if in the professional's view, a certain minimal amount of cardiac activity is required to shape things up, then those standards should not be lowered just because some students protested.  why?  if the student gets his way every time by making some noise, what will he grow up to become?  every time he encounters difficulties he will take the easy way out by making noises and hope that the situation will be changed to suit him rather then biting the bullet and rising up to the challenge.<br><br>sometimes you don't know how far you can go unless you've been pushed.  and before you know it, you have gone further than you could ever have imagined.  you would turn back and thank the person who helped transform you.<br><br>it's like parenting.  too soft and the kids grow up spoilt, too hard and the kids grow resentful. but with the right amount of stress and release, stress and release, the kid grow up wholesome.</div>
