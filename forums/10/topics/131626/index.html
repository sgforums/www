            <div class='col-md body'>when i read the topic, i had a hard time deciphering the acronym.  first i thought it was Tengeh Air Field.  took me a while to guess it's trim and fit (hope i didn't get it wrong).<br><br>anyway during my time we never had such clubs.  guess times are different now.  we eat better and we eat more so obesity has become an issue.  the fact that the ministry goes through all these trouble to shape our kids up goes to show that they do care, at least from the policy point of view.  a healthy lifestyle is best inculcated from young.  if it cannot be done from home, the next best place would be the school.<br><br>having said that, kids nowadays are a lot more sophisticated then they used to be, so the good old "do as you're told" methodology apparently does not work as well anymore.  so perhaps we can approach the issue slightly differently.<br><br>1.  get them interested in sports<br><br>we can expose them to a few sports and along the way if they find something that they like or suits them, they will naturally do more of that (those) sport(s).  exercise / trimming / keeping fit then creases to be a chore but becomes fun and enjoyable.  instead of exasperating ourselves and making them miserable, they become self motivated and we sit back and appreciate / encourage their progress.<br><br>2.  glamorise sports<br><br>when something becomes hip, that something is chased after by the kids and teenagers.  i know it's kind of hard to glamorise such things as badminton or tennis but really it can be done.  have inter-class competitions.  let the competitions be held in front of the whole school.  let the champs be put on a pedestal like a hero for fellow kids to emulate ...<br><br>3.  make them understand<br><br>unlike in the army where everything is complied to unquestioningly, for kids, especially when they're going through pain, it's easy to forget about the purpose or the goal.  adolescence is the time of raging hormones which is the source of powerful energies or impulses that would be best channeled into sports.<br><br>sports is something you enjoy for life.  you feel the exhilaration of speed when you're coming round the bend, the rush of adrenaline when diving to retrieve the shuttle, the breezy swooshes around your face when you're slicing through air, the spirit and comaraderie of team sports which build character ...<br><br>later on in life, it becomes a topic for conversation, a bond between friends, an occasion for you to meet new people and even possibly your future spouse, employer, customer, lucky star ...<br><br>be it for the love of sports or a genuine desire to become trim and fit, staying fit and healthy also means that you will look good, which in turn affects such things as your image, the confidence you carry with yourself which in turn affects your popularity and basically shapes your destiny.<br><br>4.  do something else<br><br>if running is too tough, then perhaps they can start off with aerobic or mass exercises in the hall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i second the idea of having TAF but perhaps they can conduct the sessions in more discreet manner e.g. indoor. so that the participants wont feel discriminated.</div>
