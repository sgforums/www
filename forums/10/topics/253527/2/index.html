Young people may leave because the pay is better overseas or because their skills cannot compete with those of cheap foreign workers. Judging from the rants in this forum, it's probably the latter. We want top talent to return (and they will, if we pay well enough) but as for those who cannot make it here, it's better they develop their careers elsewhere.</div>

Sad to say after so much problems were created by their self-serving policies to benefit their own kind for years they still do not appear to understand what is loyalty to the country and one's own citizens who elected them and give them the opportunity to serve fellow citizens with honour.</div>

Never mind the people. It's the money that matters. People can go to the graves for all they care, so long as the treasury continues to flow with cash.
