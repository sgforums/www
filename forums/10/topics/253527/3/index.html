Foreign Investment, like it or not, will never bring the same kind of holistic growth  as startups do. Unfortunately we have a dearth of high tech startups, and small mainstream companies won't do much good to the level of technology here.<br><br>Unfortunately, it is one thing to say give funds to startups, it is another to encourage people to start up a company. There is little incentive to do so when the majority of university undergrads graduate with debt and have to first work on paying it up. After working for a long while, buying a ridiculously expensive flat, and getting married, the inertia to start a business is so great naturally we don't have much by way of start ups.<br><br>Face it. We will never match the Israelis or Americans in terms of tech entrepreneurship with so many underlying social and financial factors. There will never be a Singapore YouTube or what not. It is not easy to rent a flat and given that people overseas rent flats and not OWN them initially after graduation is enough to put a damper on any aspirations. Now we hear that foreigners have to pay exorbitant prices for rentals. Well Done Singapore. Continue digging your grave.</div>

With globalisation, there is free movement of labour and capital both ways. Talented workers move out  where the pay is better and those who cannot compete move out to places where their skills are are needed. Investment managers may move to London for the millions they pay and the production line supervisor may have to move to  Dubai if they lack such skills. Far from 'lamenting', I welcome it.</div>

To do that, we must be ruthless with our policy to ensure we do what needs to be done for the good of the nation. Biotech is a good bet but never put all your eggs in one basket. With an aging population in the developed West, there will be increasing demand on healthcare. This sector will grow. In addition to that, we should also go into green technology, as the government appears to be doing. If the green lobby in the West gains momentum and the system of carbon trading or personal carbon credit takes off, there will be a demand for green technology.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Unfortunately you fail to comprehend simple English. With globalisation, there is free movement of labour and capital both ways. Talented workers move out  where the pay is better and those who cannot compete move out to places where their skills are are needed. Investment managers may move to London for the millions they pay and the production line supervisor may have to move to  Dubai if they lack such skills. Far from 'lamenting', I welcome it. </div></blockquote>Refer to your posts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">The pay differential is too much...investment managers earn much more in London or New York. Someone with qualifications from LSE, Havard or Wharton would rather work in Wall Street or the City. We need to recruit more foreign talents to build up the momentum...when our industry is able to pay the kind of million dollar wages top fund managers get in London, they will return. </div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Globalisation means there will be free movement of labour and capital. Young people may leave because the pay is better overseas or because their skills cannot compete with those of cheap foreign workers. Judging from the rants in this forum, it's probably the latter. We want top talent to return (and they will, if we pay well enough) but as for those who cannot make it here, it's better they develop their careers elsewhere. </div></blockquote>So are you foolishly self-contradictory or is your English so inept you can't even see the irony of your statement in the above 2 posts?<br><br>In the first post, you alluded to the fact that globalisation and market forces will dictate where capable people would go actually depends on the principles of a market economy.<br><br>In the latter, you further confirm the believe that globalisation means a "free movement of labour and capital" ( note : we're talking about labour and talents of all sorts here which includes the genuinely talented and what you regard as "cannot make it" ). Yet, you foolishly go on to conclude "We want top talent to return but as for those who cannot make it here, it's better they develop their careers elsewhere". Is globalisation and free market economy simply a matter of "wanting"? If you haven't got the market instruments and forces in place to compete, you simply can't compete. Period. Why would/should any eligible and talented Singaporean who subscribes to the notion of globalisation (which explains his/her departure from these shores in the first place) respond to something that isn't remotely dictated by market forces?<br><br>More pertinently, while you alluded to the fact that globalisation means a free movement of labour and capital, you obviously fail to see - or simply remain oblivious to it - that also means if this regime attracts those "who cannot make it", that in truth paints a dire reflection of how inept this regime is at adapting to globalisation. In a global market place where talents are remunerated on the basis of market demand and supply, surely it's no coincidence that this regime's uncanny ability to attract those who "cannot make it" is actually a terrible reflection of how pathetic this regime actually is that it's actually unable to attract more top talent that it wants and instead, ends up with a larger-than-required pool of liability?<br><br>So is your English letting your down or are you simply unable to grasp the geist of your argument? Or perhaps, you're obstinately immuned to the fact that this regime has more flaws than your propaganda-inundated mind would permit you to believe?</div>
