They are just not coming home to Singapore. There are many Singaporeans based in London and New York doing investment banking and all the high finance stuff. But from their perspective, Singapore is still too small to warrant pursuing their careers back home. No point fishing in a really small pond.</div>

Why not let more diverse viewpoints and facts be available in the national media?<br></div>

I wonder if this is the reason why LIM Swee Say, a gentle man, is giving up after the next election?<br><br>Do we earn as much as an American worker?  I dont think so!<br><br>Have as much rights?  I dont think so!<br>Do our unions <strong>fight for Government </strong>unfair wage policies?  Yes!<br>Does NTUC fight to protect workers salaries?  NO!<br><br>In USA, whether its bad time or good time,  workers salaries are mostly unaffected.    In here, its just the opposite.<br><br>The regime  will often step in to halt  workers salary increases as it  continues to pile up their huge money collection in MAS - during good times or bad times.  They have more than enough to help maintain our competitiveness without freezing wage increase for long periods.<br><br>And, now the ex-NTUC boss is given a well paid job in the PMO, isnt this weird?<br><br>This, my friends, is the big diff between us and the other successful developed globalised countries.<br></div>
