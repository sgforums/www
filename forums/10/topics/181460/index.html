            <div class='col-md body'>Amidst the election buzz, an interesting development is brewing at the oppositionsÂ’ camp. It is reported that veteran politician, JB Jeyaratnam (JBJ), is attempting a last minute bid to get himself out of bankruptcy in order to be eligible to contest in the coming general election. He has made an application to the court to pay off all his debts of about S$600,000, thus wiping his slate clean. These debts arose mainly from defamation suits in 1996 and 1997. A court hearing is set for next Tuesday, Mar 14th. If he succeeds, the oppositions will have to review their election strategy, particularly the WorkersÂ’ Party.<br><br>If JBJ succeed in discharging his judicial liability, he will have three options in his political paths. Firstly, he can run as an independent candidate either in a SMC or GRC, or form a totally new party to do so. Secondly, he can join other political parties like SDA or SDP. Thirdly, he can seek a return to the WorkersÂ’ Party. Whichever path he takes, he will bring an air of charismatic flair and excitement to this political competition. But what are the ramifications of his inclusion on the other political players? Lets start with the ruling party, PAP.<br><br>Whichever political route he takes, he will always be a pesky thorn to the PAP. He is a handful, especially to the younger and lesser experience politicians in the ruling party. Only LKY and a handful of 2nd Generation PAP leaders can take him on in electioneering. As the party is now mainly made up of newer members, it is a threat that cannot be taken lightly. As a maverick with a firebrand character, we can expect to see JBJ constantly Â“pushing the envelopeÂ” and challenging the boundaries of the OB markers. It has gotten him into serious troubles in the past, and I wish that he doesnÂ’t get carried away and get himself into a spot again in this election. Despite his age, he is still a very difficult opponent, and I am sure that PAP should take his entry into this election seriously.<br><br>In the opposition camp, they will have to go back to the drawing board to review the division of territories among the different players to avoid a three-corner fight among themselves. It is reported that in view of this latest development, another of such meeting will be taking place very soon. This is especially important if JBJ decides to go independent to contest in a SMC or a GRC. No opposition party would want to collide with JBJ, considering the clout that he still possesses. Instead of going independent, JBJ could also join SDA or SDP. However as a maverick, it will be difficult for JBJ to share power with the current partiesÂ’ leaders like Chiam and Chee. The strong personality of each individual will make cooperation and accommodation an unresolvable issue. In my opinion, it will be better for him to set up a new outfit than to join these two parties. However in politics, strange things do happen, so I shall not rule out this possibility.<br><br>The third option for JBJ is to seek to return back to the WorkersÂ’ Party. I believe that he is still passionate about the party he once led until he was unceremoniously ousted by the current party head, Low Thia Khiang. I shall not dwell on the details of this event, and would direct those wish to know more to this url link: http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/02Ds/061102.html<br>In this option, the real issue lies with whether the current leadership in the WorkersÂ’ Party will want to accept JBJ back into itÂ’s rank and allow him to contest under the partyÂ’s banner. They will not for three main reasons. Firstly, LowÂ’s leadership in the party will come under threat from JBJ. In his analysis, Seah Chiang Nee in his website describe Low as having a lesser flamboyant style than JBJ. In his opinion, Low is a collective leader, non-combative but very strong in organizational capability. By comparison, JBJ is individualistic, opinionated and a strong debater. Therefore, Low always will be overshadowed by JBJ in this aspect. Furthermore in my observation, Low is easily cowed when challenged, while JBJ will respond head on. The recent episode where Low remained meek and passive while the Prime Minister lambasted his partyÂ’s manifesto reveals a lack of conviction and leadership quality. Low will face a meltdown in his leadership position should JBJ be allowed back into the WorkersÂ’ Party. Therefore he will definitely veto any decision to do so.<br><br>Secondly, the party, which has been courting acceptance from the government, would not want JBJ to jeopardize this cordial relationship. With JBJ, the ruling party knows the threat and is prepared to use whatever means to destroy his political career. In contrast, Low is considered as Â“acceptableÂ” by the ruling party. As such, he is allowed to hold on to his Hougang seat with the ruling party providing just token challenges in this SMC. Even in the latest ERC report, an exception was made to Hougang to remain as a SMC, despite population changes that would necessitate it to be absorbed into a GRC. The WorkersÂ’ Party reciprocated by transforming itself from a full-fledged opposition party to one that provide selective opposition to the ruling party. It went one step further by renaming itself as an Â“alternativeÂ” party. Whether it is really an opposition or an alternative party is debatable. However it will not want to turn back the clock and bring itself to a confrontational mode with PAP, especially when Low is non-confrontational by nature. In contrast, JBJ is fiercely confrontational. Any shift against this approach will jeopardize LowÂ’s seat in Hougang, so it is to LowÂ’s interest to maintain the status quo.<br><br>Thirdly, there is the threat of internal strife within the party as LowÂ’s political approach and values is very different from JBJ. He has managed to shape the partyÂ’s culture and values to reflect his very own through the years, and will not allow it to be re-shaped by JBJ. He has managed to bring in new members who share his political values and approach. If JBJ is allowed back to the party, his followers will also flock in with him. That will be potentially destabilizing for the party. And, it will be difficult for the party to attract new members, which has been a perennial problem for all opposition parties.<br><br>To conclude, despite all the pleasantries being exchanged and expressed, the WorkersÂ’ Party leadership is secretly against having anything to do with JBJ. All itsÂ’ members are now chorusing for JBJ to run as an independent candidate in one of the SMC. They are either silent, or would avoid answering questions about JBJ and the WorkersÂ’ Party. As such, there are only two realistic options for JBJ now. Either form a new party, or run as an independent.</div>
