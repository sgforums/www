            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">What is the population of Hong Kong? Have you heard of per capita rates?<br><br>Public spending includes the salaries of public servants who carry out the policies of the government. Read the referenced paper. Singapore has one of the lowest public spending rates and best social progress index for the moeny spent. In other words, Singaporeans are getting good value for money, unlike most other governments. Hong Kong looks like they are in the same category but no figures were available for this study.<br><br>In the words of the author,<br><br>"With the exception of Singapore (and Hong Kong, if the data were available), the world's most developed countries receive no gains in social progress for much of the GNP consumed by government."<br><br>http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s232/table2.gif<br>http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s232/s232.html</div></blockquote>You mentioned in an earlier post:<br><br><blockquote>"Singaporeans enjoyed a 'high quality but cheap government', Mr Lee said. Public spending stands at 14 to 15 per cent of the country's total output, or GDP - among the lowest in the world."<br><br>(Straits Times 14 Nov) </blockquote>So now you are telling me what I was trying to correct you.<br>Listen, when the gov has less public spending, it doesn't mean that they are spending less on governing (meaning the policy making body), it just means that they could be spending less on the public, environment, healthcare, education, etc.<br><br>You asked the population of Hong Kong. You obviously don't know any maths; or you don't have any idea what is the population of Hong Kong; or you don't ANYTHING at all. Hong Kong has a population of 7 million, Singapore has a population of 4.2 million. Hong Kong usess 10.4% of GDP on public spending, Singapore uses 14 - 15 % (according to you) on public spending. This does not reflect the cost of government!<br><br>According to "The Economist" World in Figures 2005 ed., "The Quality of Life" Human Development Index, Hong Kong Ranks 25th while Singapore Ranks 27th.<br><br>Also Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):<br><br>Hong Kong:  76.1<br><br>Singapore:   65.7<br><br>USA (Base): 100.0<br><br>Your figures from NCPA is ancient history!!!<br>Year 2000!!!<br><br>*FAINTS*<br><br>You might as well dig up 1941 to compare, then we can compare ancient historic economic policies in the new millenium. Better still, dig up the economic policies of mesopotamia to compare.<br><br></div>

WAKE UP AND SMELL THE ROSES!!! Alot of companies have already moved out of Singapore, into China, India, Vietnam, etc. If Singapore is such a good place for business then the gov should have encouraged our home grown companies to continue with it's exisiting operations in Singapore and NOT encourage them to move overseas.<br>You can tell those national companies that we have very favourable tax rates.<br><br></div>

If the govt feels obligated to "take care" of the old guards and ministers who "contributed" to Singapore's growth, should the govt also have a responsibility to take of elderly citizens?<br><br>Why must we treat the elderly like leeches? Do we want our children to treat us the same way? What kind of morale are we teaching the kids these days?<br><br>Incidentally, I just had a chat with a financial adviser friend of mine; a FT who married a close friend of mine. He broke the news that in 5 years time, he is uprooting the family and taking them back to France.<br><br>So we went into the discussion of income tax and GST and he made a very interesting observation.<br><br>He said that while it is true that he pays less taxes here, the amount he spend on other stuff, especially on his son equalize all the savings. In France, his son can get free education, medical services, meals etc.<br><br>He cited another reason that when he grows old and is incapable of generating income, a good welfare system is very important as that is when you need them the most.<br><br>So all in all, paying a higher income tax in France is the same as paying less taxes but spending more on daily necessities; but France offers him the peace of mind and guarantee that he'll be taken care of when he grows old.<br><br>He doesn't want to be cleaning tables are working in MacDonald's; he said sarcastically.<br><br>Interesting observation.

            <div class='col-md body'>oxford mushroom, if I were you, I wouldn't post such threads in sgForums... Seems like the opposition parties have planted their supporters in this online forum... I'm not taking sides with the PAP or wat, but I do realise that there's a trend to criticize whatever policy made by the government, be it good or bad... If it's good, they will say that the government has an ulterior motive... If it's bad, they will take the chance to shoot off like there's no tomorrow... This only happens in sgForums...<br><br>So my point is... mushroom guy, just give up lah... abandon this thread and never start threads regarding the government anymore...

Assuming incme relief in total is 4k (I think I am being generous as the average of total relief could be lower), thus residents with annual income of 24k will incur tax. From http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/annual/ghs/r1/t54-61.pdf, only about 997k residents earned more than 24k in 2005. If residen population is 4m, then 25% of resident pays income tax.<br><br>However, from the same source,  residents (age&gt;15yrs) that worked  in 2005 numbered about 1.65m (i.e. excludes retirees, students, etc).
