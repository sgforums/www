That is a fact of life. The tax policy in Scandinavian countries like Finland penalizes the young workers to benefit the old and unemployed. As a result, tax payers like this Finnish guy would rather bring his skills to Singapore, where he is better off financially.<br><br>As stated in a review by KPMG, ".. from our past 14 yearsÂ’ tracking experience it appears to be economically and socially desirable for countries to strive for lower corporate income taxes. Corporations are sensitive to income tax rates, and the enhanced mobility of capital and labor all over the world increases their ability to transfer functions from a high tax regime to a low-tax country."<br><br>(http://www.kpmg.com/Services/Tax/IntCorp/CTR/)</div>
