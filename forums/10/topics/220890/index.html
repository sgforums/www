Increasing revenue from direct taxes will penalise the very people who have been contributing to the nation's coffers. With countries in the region cutting their corporate taxes, Singapore has to rely on higher indirect taxes and reduce the proportion of revenue arising from income and corporate taxes. Otherwise, the minority tax payers can very well vote with their feet and offer their investments and skills to someone else.<br><br>On transport, the government should increase ERP charges and road tax for private vehicles and invest revenue towards improving public transport or subsidizing the transport costs for the poor. Higher taxes for private vehicles can be used to give poorer Singaporeans a significant discount on public transportation.<br><br></div>

With a declining birth rate and a greying population, this group is made up of increasing elderly people who are living longer and need more welfare services, whether it be healthcare, retirement costs or transport needs.<br><br>Not only are they not contributing to income tax revenue but they are also consuming more of the nation's resources compared to younger, working tax payers. The tax burden on the diminishing work force (as a consequence of a low birth rate) will increase progressively if we fund the nation;s budget primarily by direct taxation.</div>

Read carefully before you shoot. Secondly, you should read newspapers as well before you comment:<br><br>"Singaporeans enjoyed a 'high quality but cheap government', Mr Lee said. Public spending stands at 14 to 15 per cent of the country's total output, or GDP - among the lowest in the world."<br><br>(Straits Times 14 Nov)<br><br><blockquote>You don't need to bring in more bakers to complicate the situation, all the policemen have to do is take what is more than enough, not a gross portion.<br><br>Simple Equation:<br><br>Big Pie = Baker's_Portion + Policemen's_Portion<br><br>Reduce the Policemen's portion and Bakers will have more to eat.<br><br>Why do you need to bring in Foreign Talent Bakers to complicate a simple equation.</blockquote>The policemen are not taking more...they are taking less than what others do. The fact is that there are not enough bakers with only 40% of Singaporeans paying income tax and more mouths to fed with an aging population. So we need to hire foreign bakers to make a bigger pie..bakers who can be sent home when they are old and turn from baking to eating.<br><br></div>

On top of that, not all of them (eg. housewives) were working.<br><br>If you were a tax payer in 1950, old people with cancer were given a supply of morphine for pain and told to go home to die. Healthcare was cheap. With escalating healthcare costs, the small amount you paid in your younger days will not cover the cost of modern medicine today. Similarly, the healthcare costs for us when we retire will cost far more than the taxes we pay today (unless we want the high taxes people pay in Scandinavian countries). That's why we need to save for our retirement and plan for future healthcare needs with medical incurance etc. </div></blockquote>If you are taxpayer in 1950, you must be still making lots of money in those days. Oh yeah, for your information, there was no Income Tax Act Ch.134 in 1950.<br><br>I am impressed, you are a taxpayer (making money) and yet they give you a free "supply" of morphine for pain and tells you to go home to await death.<br><br>These days, if you don't have money, they won't even register you in the hospital. My friend a chicken rice seller, experienced it when he brought his dad to hospital, they won't even register his name, it's just that the money was with another brother, they thought he had no money.<br><br>What determines the cost of healthcare? All the underlying cost (house, car, dining, luxury goods, utilities, etc) If the doctor doesn't make enough to cover all these, the cost will generally go up.<br><br>Insurance for healthcare will only drive the cost of healthcare even higher, therefore raising the cost of the insurance premiums. Why? Simply because of this term call "Moral Hazard" (which means people are more likely to act indiscriminately once the contract exist). You get a good understanding with the present car insurance scheme. Before they had all those new controls requiring that another independent person assess the damages to car, car owners were claiming inflated repair cost.</div>
