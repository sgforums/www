            <div class='col-md body'><p>President-elect promised change, picking insiders<br><br>Nov 20, 7:14 AM (ET)<br><br>By KEVIN FREKING<br><br><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20081120/D94ILB280.html">http://apnews.myway.com/article/20081120/D94ILB280.html </a><br><br>WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Barack Obama promised the voters change but has started his Cabinet selection process by naming several Washington insiders to top posts.<br><br>Obama is enlisting former Senate leader Tom Daschle as his health secretary. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a well-known Washington personality, seemed more likely than ever to be his secretary of state. Clinton is deciding whether to take that post as America's top diplomat, her associates said Wednesday<br><br>Obama is ready to announce that his attorney general will be Eric Holder, the Justice Department's No. 2 when Clinton's husband was president. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, is another veteran of the Clinton White House.<br><br>Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano is Obama's primary choice to be secretary of the Homeland Security Department, several news organizations reported Thursday. The New York Times, citing Democrats with knowledge of the process, said Napolitano was about to be offered the job. The Washington Post also reported that she was Obama's choice.<br><br>Chicago businesswoman Penny Pritzker, who was national finance chairman for Obama's presidential campaign, is his leading choice for commerce secretary, the Times reported. The newspaper said Pritzker was in the final stages of vetting by Obama's transition team.<br><br>Daschle's selection to head the Health and Human Services Department - confirmed Wednesday but not yet announced - isn't at the same level of Cabinet prestige as the top spots at the State and Justice departments. But the health post could be more important in an Obama administration than in some others, making Daschle a key player in helping steer the president-elect's promised health care reforms.<br><br>Daschle could push Obama for quick action on health care reform next year, if he follows his own advice.<br><br>Daschle said efforts during the Clinton administration, led by Hillary Clinton, took too long and went into too much detail, giving every interest group an opportunity to find something they didn't like about the plan.<br><br>"The next president should act immediately to capitalize on the goodwill that greets any incoming administration. If that means attaching a health-care plan to the federal budget, so be it," Daschle wrote in a book he released this year, "Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis.""This issue is too important to be stalled by Senate protocol."<br><br>The former South Dakota senator's return to the government will be a vindication of sorts. He was the Senate Democratic leader when he was defeated in 2004 by Republican John Thune, who convinced voters back home that Daschle was more concerned with Washington than with them.<br><br>In fact, Daschle stayed in the capital city after his defeat, becoming a public policy adviser and member of the legislative and public policy group at the law and lobbying firm Alston &amp; Bird. Daschle isn't registered as a lobbyist. He advises clients on issues including health care, financial services, taxes and trade, according to the firm's Web site.<br><br>Health care interests, including CVS Caremark, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and HealthSouth, are among the firm's lobbying clients.<br><br>Daschle's appointment was not formally announced, but Democratic officials said the job was his barring an unforeseen problem as Obama's team reviews his background. One area of review will include the lobbying connections of his wife, Linda Hall Daschle, who has worked mostly on behalf of airline-related companies over the years. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.<br><br>Republicans sniped at what they saw as an unwelcome trend. Alex Conant, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said, "Barack Obama is filling his administration with longtime Washington insiders."<br><br></p></div>

              <p><strong>The Imperialism You Can Believe In</strong>- While Leftists Celebrate “Change,” Obama Appointees Suggest Massive Expansion Of Bush War Doctrine</p>
              <p>Paul Joseph Watson<br> <a href="http://prisonplanet.com/">Prison Planet.com</a><br> Thursday, November 20, 2008</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-imperialism-you-can-believe-in.html">http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-imperialism-you-can-believe-in.html</a></p>
              <p class="unnamed10">While naive, giddy and myopic
                      establishment leftists have been celebrating the great “change”
                      heralded by the election of Barack Obama, the President elect has been
                      busy appointing people to key positions who advocate the same Neo-Con
                      imperialist foreign policy crafted during eight years of the Bush
                      administration.</p>
              <p>The New York Times, widely recognized as the voice of the
                      establishment Democratic left, set the tone of what we can expect from
                      an Obama foreign policy in a lead editorial last Sunday entitled,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/opinion/16Sun1.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin"><span style="color: #205580;"> “A military for a dangerous new world.”</span></a></p>
              <p class="unnamed10">The editorial calls for U.S. military
                      imperialism not to be scaled back under Obama, but to be vastly
                      expanded both in terms of budget and scope.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Iran, China, Somalia, Russia and
                      Pakistan are all listed as potential targets of U.S. military
                      aggression and the paper echoes what Obama himself has said he will
                      implement - an addition of nearly 100,000 more soldiers and marines to
                      American ground forces, bringing the total to 759,000 active duty
                      forces, at a cost of $100 billion dollars over the next six years.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Does this sound like a “change” from
                      the Project For a New American century framework of endless
                      “multi-theatre warfare,” the inspiration for eight years of Bush
                      administration militarism, or an expansion of that very doctrine?</p>
              <p>Obama’s announced appointees and those that are expected to follow
                      differ only from their Bush administration contemporaries in
                      proficiency and competence, their zeal for military adventurism is
                      coequal, while others that shaped eight awful years of spying, torture,
                      eviscerations on freedom and unprovoked military attacks on sovereign
                      nations will merely stay on in their roles.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Welcome to the “change that you can believe in”.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Obama’s likely selection of Hillary
                      Clinton for the position of Secretary of State highlights the brazen
                      hypocrisy with which the “change” agenda has begun to be implemented
                      since Obama won the election two and a half weeks ago.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Clinton voted for the invasion of
                      Iraq, a point on which she was attacked by Obama during the phony punch
                      and judy show of the debates. Obama also denounced Clinton for voting
                      in favor of a Senate resolution branding the Iranian Revolutionary
                      Guard a terrorist organization. Clinton promised to “obliterate” Iran
                      if it attacked Israel, a mantra echoed by Obama when he assured AIPAC,
                      the notorious Israeli lobby, that military strikes against Iran were
                      very much on the table.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Does this sound like the language of diplomacy or a change from eight years of the Bush doctrine?</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Likewise, one of the favorites to
                      become Obama’s Defense Secretary is Michèle A. Flournoy, deputy
                      assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration and
                      president of the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10"><a href="http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/pers-n19.shtml"><span style="color: #205580;">As Alex Lantier writes</span></a>,
                      “Members of CNAS, a rather small Washington think tank with a staff of
                      30 employees founded in 2003 by (John) Podesta and Flournoy, play an
                      outsized role in the Obama transition team.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">“So many CNAS members are likely to
                      join the Obama administration that CNAS officials told the (Wall
                      Street) Journal they were concerned the think tank might fold after
                      Obama’s inauguration.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">CNAS has opposed a set timeline for
                      withdrawal from Iraq, has advocated the deployment of more troops in
                      Afghanistan and has called for U.S. troops to be stationed in Pakistan.
                      CNAS has also urged military spending to be beefed up in order to
                      compete with China’s growing Navy.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">“CNAS publications, many of which are
                      publicly available on its web site, make it clear that the Obama
                      administration’s foreign policy will have a thoroughly imperialist
                      character,” notes Lantier.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">How does this represent a “change”
                      from eight years of Bush administration foreign policy? How does this
                      represent a shift from a strategy of diplomacy based on intimidation,
                      invasion and occupation?</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Obama’s advisors have also been
                      floating the likelihood of Robert Gates remaining as Obama’s Secretary
                      of Defense, so it looks like we’re either going to have a warmonger or
                      a warmonger in the position - what a choice!</p>
              <p class="unnamed10"><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/a3779da6-b5d9-11dd-ab71-0000779fd18c.html"><span style="color: #205580;">The Financial Times reported</span></a> this week, “President-Elect Barack Obama and Robert Gates are
                      negotiating terms under which the defense secretary would remain as
                      Pentagon chief in the new administration.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Gates of course has a history of
                      entanglement with the military-industrial complex having pushed for the
                      U.S. bombing of Nicaragua when he was deputy director of the CIA and
                      later being indicted for his involvement in covering up the Iran Contra
                      scandal.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Gates was the primary advocate for the Iraq “surge” which increased the U.S. military presence in the country.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Obama’s decision to appoint Eric
                      Holder as Attorney General caused a flutter of controversy considering
                      Holder’s involvement in ensuring billionaire fugitive investor Marc
                      Rich received a presidential pardon at the end of Bill Clinton’s term,
                      but the real dirt on Holder is far more shocking.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">After leaving the Clinton
                      administration, Holder, who played a key role in the 2005
                      re-authorization of the Patriot Act, which Obama voted for, set up the
                      legal and lobbying firm of Covington &amp; Burling. The firm’s most
                      high-profile case was its defense of Chiquita Brands International,
                      Inc, whose executives were facing charges of aiding terrorists for
                      bankrolling and arming right-wing death squads in Colombia.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">As Bill Van Auken writes, “Using his
                      longstanding ties at the Justice Department, Holder managed to get
                      Chiquita off the hook with a fine that amounted to 0.55 percent of its
                      annual revenue. This was despite the overwhelming evidence—and the
                      company’s own admission—that it had paid out millions of dollars to the
                      United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (known by its Spanish acronym
                      AUC), as its gunmen carried out the massacre, assassination, kidnapping
                      and torture of tens of thousands of Colombian workers, peasants, trade
                      union officials and left-wing political activists.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">“Holder’s record is not that of a
                      champion of civil and democratic rights or a defender of the oppressed,
                      but rather a legal servant of the corporations and the state, complicit
                      in their criminality and repression.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">Holder’s law enforcement deputy in
                      the Obama administration is likely to be Robert Mueller, who will
                      remain as FBI Director despite his involvement in the use of National
                      Security Letters to illegally spy on American citizens via the
                      collection of email, telecommunications and financial records.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Obama’s head of the CIA transition
                      team is none other than John Brennan, an aide to former CIA director
                      George Tenet and a key participant in the formulation of policies that
                      led to the torture scandal, extraordinary renditions and secret prisons.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">Van Auken notes, “Brennan, like
                      Tenet, deserves to confront a war crimes tribunal, yet he is shaping
                      intelligence policy for Obama.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">“Given these appointments, a report
                      published Monday by the Associated Press that the incoming Obama
                      administration “is unlikely to bring criminal charges against
                      government officials who authorized or engaged in” torture hardly comes
                      as a surprise.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="unnamed10">Then we have Rahm Emanuel, “the enforcer”, and Obama’s new chief of staff.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Emanuel is the <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/obamas-first-appointment-is-son-of-zionist-terrorist.html"><span style="color: #205580;">son of a member of the Zionist terrorist group Irgun</span></a>,
                      which was responsible for bombing hotels, marketplaces as well as the
                      infamous Deir Yassin massacre, in which hundreds of Palestinian
                      villagers were slaughtered.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Upon news of his appointment,
                      Emanuel’s father, Dr. Benjamin Emanuel, told the Jerusalem Post,
                      “Obviously he will influence the president to be pro-Israel. Why
                      wouldn’t he be? What is he, an Arab? He’s not going to clean the floors
                      of the White House.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">But forget sins of the father, Rahm
                      Emanuel himself is a former Israeli IDF soldier who has a penchant for
                      making death threats against his political enemies while crazily
                      slamming a knife into a dinner table. Sounds like a diplomatic kind of
                      guy.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">When Emanuel’s appointment was confirmed, top Israeli newspaper the <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=97465"><span style="color: #205580;">Maariv Daily hailed the news </span></a>with the headline, “Our man in the White House.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Another Israeli news outlet, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3618543,00.html"><span style="color: #205580;">Y Net, reported</span></a>,
                      “Emanuel is pro-Israeli, and would not be willing to consider accepting
                      the job unless he was convinced that President-elect Obama is
                      pro-Israel.”</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">Recall that President elect Barack
                      Obama’s first act of “change” upon winning the Democratic presidential
                      nomination back in June was to don a joint US-Israeli label pin, head
                      on over to AIPAC and prostrate himself in front of the Israeli lobby,
                      vowing to keep military action in mind for Iran and promising to hand
                      over another $30 billion of American taxpayers’ money in military
                      assistance to the Zionist state.</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">It seems that Obama has already
                      answered the question of whether he can be a more hardcore Israel
                      hard-liner than George W. Bush - ‘yes he can’!</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">When are left-wing establishment
                      liberals going to overcome their inane idolatry for Obama and realize
                      that the people he is putting into positions of power are the same and
                      in some cases worse than the Neo-Cons who ran eight years of Bush
                      foreign policy?</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">When are leftists going to get over
                      their petty power trips and understand that the mantra of “change” is a
                      mere illusion to provide left cover for a massive expansion in U.S.
                      imperialism the likes of which the Bush administration could never have
                      accomplished?</p>
              <p class="unnamed10">When are liberals going to stop
                      behaving like gloating children and understand that Obama’s exalted
                      messiah status and political capital, allied with his publicly stated
                      agenda and the nature and track record of those he has appointed to key
                      positions, is a recipe for a new wave of militarism and an expansion of
                      the pre-emptive Bush foreign policy doctrine that Obama himself
                      campaigned against with his rhetorical and empty promises of “change”?</p>

              <p>Paul Joseph Watson &amp; Alex Jones<br> <a href="http://prisonplanet.com/">Prison Planet.com</a><br> Tuesday, November 4, 2008</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/?p=5755">http://www.infowars.com/?p=5755</a></p>
              <p>The messianic fervor which has preceded Barack Obama’s
              expected ascension to the White House has alarming implications for
              freedom and is a painful reminder that most Americans have once again
              been suckered into believing that the two-party monopoly offers any
              kind of solution to the crisis that we face.</p>
              <p>For eight years during the term of Bill Clinton, Alex Jones was
              labeled a right-wing fascist for opposing him and for the past
              near-eight years Jones has been derided as a communist and even an
              Al-Qaeda member for railing against the Bush administration.</p>
              <p>Now even regular readers of our own websites are
              calling Alex a right-wing racist once again merely for questioning the
              ascension of the new great leader - Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>The messianic complex that has been attached to Obama is truly frightening. <a href="http://www.infowars.com/?p=5731">Bishops like Cornal Garnett Henning</a> are calling Obama the new “Moses” while his supporters refer to him as<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081348/Can-black-Jesus-escape-assassins-bullet.html"> “the black Jesus”</a>.</p>
              <p>In one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P36x8rTb3jI">You Tube clip</a>,
              a woman hails Obama’s Godly powers by proclaiming that as soon as he is
              elected, all her problems will simply disappear, saying that Obama will
              help her personally almost like Jesus healed the sick and wounded.</p>
              <p>The election of a new president should not be a
              mindless act of idolatry and fanfare, it should be a solemn commitment
              to find a leader who will follow the Constitution.</p>
              <p>But Barack Obama will ride into office with a gigantic
              approval rating to rival that of Bush after 9/11, along with a complete
              power monopoly over the executive, the legislative, the judicial as
              well as widespread media support.</p>
              <p>This makes Obama more dangerous than Bush and certainly
              a damn site more dangerous than a McCain administration, because his
              policies for at least a year or two will enjoy universal acclaim and
              voices of dissent will be drowned out by a wave of droning acquiescence.</p>
              <p>Obama has all the political capital he needs to
              implement the terrifying policies that he has already announced and
              beef the architecture of the police state crafted by Bush.</p>
              <p>- The creation of a <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/07/obamas_civilian_national_secur.html">“civilian national security force”</a> that is “just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded” as the U.S. military to enforce Obama’s <a href="http://www.carbontax.org/blogarchives/2007/07/31/obama-extols-carbon-tax/">carbon tax scheme</a> and the total regulation and control of the American middle class.</p>
              <p>- Obama has talked openly about his intention to <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/2007/08/01/remarks_of_senator_obama_the_w_1.php">bomb Pakistan under the guise of pursuing terrorists</a>, continuing a Bush administration policy of violating the sovereignty of foreign nations.</p>
              <p>- The g<a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/obama%E2%80%99s-energy-plan-bankrupt-coal-power-plants-skyrocketing-electricity-rates.html">uarantee to “bankrupt” coal power plants</a>, costing millions of American jobs and skyrocketing energy prices.</p>
              <p>- Unbridled implementation and expansion of the banker bailout that is <a href="http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/09/26/ap-poll-most-americans-oppose-bailout/">hated by the majority of American citizens</a> yet was <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/29991399.html">vigorously promoted by both Obama</a> and McCain. Doling out taxpayer’s money to Wall Street, causing rampant
              inflation, a lowering in living standards and the destruction of the
              dollar.</p>
              <p>- Obama has rhetorically supported the second amendment
              and an individual’s right to bear arms, but his actions tell a
              different story. <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Barack_Obama_Gun_Control.htm">Obama supports local gun ban laws</a>, including his endorsement of a state ban on the sale and possession of handguns in Illinois.</p>
              <p>- Obama grandstands on the notion that he supports environmentalism with his climate change rhetoric, but his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/politics/23ethanol.html?pagewanted=print">intention to extend biofuel subsidies</a> will only accelerate price food costs that have already<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1233058"> risen 75 per cent</a> since 2002, causing economic distress and rioting in such countries as
              Haiti, Egypt, and Somalia, as well as deforestation on a massive scale.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>Mark our words - the causes that the liberal left has been fighting
              for over the last eight years will simply be forgotten just like
              conservatives were put to sleep when Bush came to power. Obama is the
              pacifier that the establishment needs to quiet the simmering anger
              amongst Americans that has been threatening to boil over.</p>
              <p>It will no longer be “fashionable” to fight the police state amongst the political left.</p>
              <p>Mark our words - there will be no repeal of the Patriot
              Act, there will be no repeal of the John Warner Defense Authorization
              Act, there will be no repeal of warrantless secret surveillance of
              American citizens.</p>
              <p>Democratic control of Congress and the Senate since the
              2006 elections has achieved nothing in the way of reversing the Bush
              administration’s assaults on the Constitution, so why should we expect
              Obama to do anything different?</p>
              <p>Obama may eventually withdraw a portion of troops from
              Iraq but mark our words, they won’t be home long before they are sent
              off to bomb another broken-backed third world country, this time in the
              name of a United Nations-backed “humanitarian” war, just as Bill
              Clinton presided over in Somalia and Serbia with the full support of
              the establishment political left.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Obama’s running mate <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/what-will-obamas-international-crisis-be.html">Joe Biden has already “promised”</a> and “guaranteed” that Obama will be faced with an international crisis
              that will mandate him to take “unpopular” and “tough” decisions in the
              context of foreign policy.</p>
              <p>Don’t think for a second that our warnings about Obama
              are an endorsement for John McCain. We have tirelessly attempted to
              educate Americans about the two party monopoly and the fact that
              Democrats and Republicans serve the interests of the elite, not the
              people, and have for at least five decades since Kennedy was killed.</p>
              <p>Obama is Coca-Cola and McCain is Pepsi - at the end of the day you’re still drinking the same beverage.</p>
              <p>The two-party monopoly <em>offers no solutions</em> for
              the problems we face, in fact the two-party monopoly that you will be
              helping to maintain should you vote for either Obama or McCain - <em>is the problem</em>.</p>
              <p><em>Stop falling for the same bait and switch trick again and again every eight years.</em></p>
              <p>When George W. Bush was elected, conservatives were in
              adulation and awe, confident that after eight years of federal
              government expansion under Clinton, Bush - complete with slick
              conservative rhetoric and promises of change - would shrink the size of
              government and restore dignity to the office of President.</p>
              <p>Nearly eight years later and what have we witnessed, a
              record expansion in the size of government and an almost universal
              contempt for America around the world.</p>
              <p>When Tony Blair swept into power with a landslide in
              the British general election in 1997, the country breathed a collective
              sigh of relief that this new young dynamo would put right years of Tory
              malfeasance and provide the “change” that everyone was crying out for.</p>
              <p>When Blair left office in 2007 he had created a
              Socialist surveillance police state and eliminated a huge popular
              approval lead the Labour Party had enjoyed over the Tories, leaving
              most of the public once again to demand Conservative rule.</p>
              <p>When are we going to wake up to the fact that voting in the lesser of two evils is not a solution?</p>
              <p>When are we going to realize that participating in a
              rigged system, where our vote means virtually nothing anyway because it
              is counted by a completely compromised and hackable voting machine, not
              only fails to address any of our problems, but actually compounds them
              because of our passive obedience in participating in the phony virtual
              reality presented to us as “democracy”?</p>
              <p>When are we going to realize that by continually
              electing Democrats and Republicans, we are voting away our own freedom
              as the march towards a new world order and an American police state
              proceeds no matter who takes office?</p>
