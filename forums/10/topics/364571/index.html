              <p><strong>The Kent Ridge Common, 17 Jun 2009, Christopher Ong</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Twitter Revolution in Tehran</strong></span><br> <br> When a US State Department Official made a request to the social
              networking site Twitter to delay its scheduled maintenance so that the
              world could be kept abreast of the developments in the aftermath of the
              Iranian elections, the role of new technology in potentially changing
              the course of history in Tehran cannot be anymore doubted.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Who would have ever thought that an internet
              service only a couple of years old that invites users to blog on the
              one premise – “What are you doing?” could have invited such broad
              ramifications?</strong></span><br> <br> Certainly not Ahmadinejad.<br> <br> In the aftermath of the Iranian elections whereby news channels and
              sites like the CNN and the BBC are blocked, hundreds upon thousands of
              Iranians are joining the Twitter revolution in posting minute by minute
              photos, updates and links to the opposition protests in Iran.<br> <br> International coverage of the opposition rallies are not allowed
              without explicit approval, and reporters from international news
              agencies are barred from leaving their hotel rooms or offices to
              discuss this event.<br> <br> So far, only the Iranian-run state television have been offered
              unbridled access to the aftermath, and on Tuesday showed a
              pro-Ahmadinejad rally where thousands of his supporters crowded central
              Tehran.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Still, this has not stopped ordinary Iranians who
              have been generally tech-savvy enough to use proxy-sites and other
              means to bypass the blockade of access to online information. And the
              role of a new technology not even existing 5 years ago in Twitter as an
              alternative medium of information is becoming crucial.</strong></span><br> <br> “Basij militia are constantly vandilizing the city and state tv is
              constantly blaming it on Mousavi supporters!!” wrote one Twitterfeed,
              IranRiggedElect. “Keep your doors open,” wrote another, “so people can
              escape from the riot police.”<br> <br> Certain TwitterFeeds boasts of 25 million connections within Iran and
              another 8 million outside. Indeed, a revolution is a revolution in its
              sole being as unstoppable. And nothing at this point seems capable of
              stopping the Twitter revolution.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>“If we ever succeed then the power goes to the
              people for fact &amp; not as a formality,” said NetRevolution. “this is
              the first Net Revolution.”</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Will Singapore ban Twitter-feeds at the next general elections?</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>At the last general elections, political podcasts and videocasts were banned.</strong></span> Dr Lee Boon Yang, an interview with AsiaMedia, views these new internet
              mediums as a different kettle of fish, because they have a “greater
              impact to influence, due to the nature of the medium.”<br> <br> Calling for political debates to remain “serious”, he suggested that
              individuals who participate in it must take “responsibility” and
              “cannot remain anonymous.”<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Indeed, there is no certainty a new technology
              such as Twitter — that may prove to be crucial source of alternative
              information away from the mainstream media — will not be blocked from
              coverage of the next general elections.</strong></span> Some Twitterfeeds are anonymous, with one even recently masquerading as the Official Twitter Feed of North Korea.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>But the next generation of Singaporeans who are
              increasingly becoming better-educated are thirsting for alternative
              sources of information and news,</strong></span> as evinced in the high
              amount of readers that flocked to online socio-political sites during
              the events of the recent AWARE saga.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Will the Twitter revolution hit us during the General Election?</strong></span><br> <br> For all you know, Twitter may only be visited at the Jurong Bird Park.<br> <br> <strong>Discuss: Will Twitter or other forms of new technology play a
              critical role in shaping the next general elections? What would your
              reactions be if Twitter or other forms of new technology were banned?</strong><br> <br> -------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>Do not underestimate the will to survive. This got nothing to do with Twitter....This has everything to do with a regime that sat too comfortable at the top and ignore what happen at the ground level. In any case the supreme council put themselve in that position.</p>
              <p>China govt go to far extense to acquire block software to perch out all negative news about China. Govt try to insulate their citizens from any negative issue about their own govt are doom to fail.   </p>
              <p>These days if you block internet it is a given that you will force netcitizen to go underground and revolution. Socially you further isolate the net citizens. It is stupid to block any access or communication......Learn from Obama, use the net on how to get your message across rather than ban it.</p>

              <p>Is not Paranoia..........Neda.  A case for changing the way news are reporting. Its call civilian reporting.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="program"><a href="http://www.npr.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">NPR.org</span></span></a>,</span> "<span class="date">June 22, 2009 · </span>The video was so graphic that CNN was compelled to put up a rare black-screen warning before showing it. The images of a young woman bleeding to death on a street in Tehran were haunting and, indeed, as disturbing as the network warned.</p>
              <p>.................................................</p>
              <p>Forget the political message it sends about what's going on in Iran. The broadcast of the dying moments of a woman called <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/06/by_mark_memmott_as_the.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Neda</span></span></a>, who reportedly had been shot during anti-government protests, also represents an important moment for media and for the technology that delivers what we call news today.</p>
              <p>We might flinch, but we are now willing to watch someone die on television. For real. Not just as a work of dramatic fiction.</p>
              <p>Whether or not the networks' standards are loosening, it is clear they are feeling pressure from the unfiltered, digitally viral world of the Internet.</p>
              <p>It has taken decades, and the advent of new technology, for this situation to evolve. After all, it took days for stills from the <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/organ2.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Zapruder film</span></span></a> showing the assassination of President Kennedy to be made public in <em>Life</em> magazine. (It was years later before the film itself was shown.) Footage on nightly news reports from <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/V/htmlV/vietnamonte/vietnamonte.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Vietnam</span></span></a> was delayed for several hours or days while the film was flown back for later broadcast. Satellite video phones brought us the Iraq war in real time, but the images were still filtered or delayed by the networks.</p>
              <p>We are now on the cusp of live, unfiltered video coverage from citizen journalists around the world. Services like <a href="http://qik.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Qik.com</span></span></a> allow us to stream video live from our cell phones. It's only a matter of time before we'll see HD-quality video transmitted live wherever cell phone coverage is available. And broadband wireless will spread that capability far and wide.</p>
              <p>So where does that leave us? Thanks to readers' and viewers' changing habits and competition from the Internet, the gatekeeping roles of print and broadcast journalism have been redefined. They are no longer the sole arbiters of what's proper for the masses to read, see and hear.</p>
              <p>That unforgettable video showing the death of a young Iranian woman is only the latest evidence of that.</p>

              <p><br>How many people did the regime kill in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The LKY regime has "killed" quite a few lives in the 52 year history.</p>
              <p>The lives destroyed included</p>
              <p>Lim Chin Siong, secretary-general, Barisan Sosialis</p>
              <p>S. Woodhull, vice-chairman, Barisan Sosialis</p>
              <p>Fong Swee Suan, secretary-general SATU and executive committee member, Barisan Sosialis</p>
              <p>James Puthucheary</p>
              <p>Dominic Puthucheary, committee member SATU and Barisan Sosialis, vice-president Singapore General Employees' Union</p>
              <p>Said Zahari, former editor of Utusan Melayu</p>
              <p>Tan Teck Wah, president of Singapore General Employees' Union, vice-president, SATU</p>
              <p>A. Wahab Shah, chairman, Party Rakyat</p>
              <p>Lim Hock Siew</p>
              <p>Poh Soo Kai</p>
              <p>The above list of names are the better known ones from a list of 111 who were arrested in Operation Cold Store in February 1963 - no one knows what has happened to the 111 arrested for their political activism in opposing the PAP.</p>
              <p>New information from the archives from the Colonial Office revealed nothing about those whom LKY and the PAP accused of having links to the Malayan Communist Party.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;q=chia+thye+poh&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=">Chia Thye Poh </a>was another life destroyed by LKY false accusation that he was a Communist - imprisoned in solitary confinement for 32 years.</p>
              <p>Then there was the persecution of Tan Liang Hong after he stood as a Cheng San candidate against the PAP in the hotly contested election of 1998.</p>
              <p>So were the lives of younger Singaporeans such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://swordofdemocles.blogspot.com/2005/07/price-of-truth.html">Tan Wah Piow </a>who was the president of the University of Singapore Students' Union, - in "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=aJHy50jDUlMC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=singapore+tan+wah+piow+phey+yew+kok&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jAga8jy3Rq&amp;sig=c81bTQ59XCww1_zEvOipp0r_6Nc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k3VASqXaBJf6kAXSy8hw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4">The case of Public Prosecutor v.

              <p>No efforts have been made by the PAP Government to arrest Phey, who remained at large till this day - even as thousands of dollars were spent to track Francis Seow's movement in the USA, simply to disgrace him.</p>
              <p>Then there was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1008-conflicting-information-from-imh-about-m-ravi">M. Ravi from the SDP </a>who was sent by the PAP Government to the Institute of Mental Health in August 2008.</p>
              <p>In a Singapore ISD <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Spectrum">Operation Spectrum 21 May 1987 saw 22 young Roman Catholics church and social activists and professionals detained without trial. </a></p>
              <p>All being arrested under false charges of being Marxist Conspirators in the Catholic Church to subvert Singapore and over-throw the PAP Govenment.</p>
              <p>Amongst those caught in LKY's web was a very capable lawyer - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/teo.htm/">Miss Teo Soh Lung  </a>- whose social concerns and activist involvement in churchl work got her into trouble. Her troubles came after she represented the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=77oVpLOEiSQC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=1987+politics+created+singapore+academy+of+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VjAuOyGPRL&amp;sig=8O5jYk7PT8BnqwdnQMX7jyOM3w0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdYxSpPWFcWNkAXQ6KyKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10">Law Society and supported JBJ in confronting LKY in open court. </a></p>
              <p>It was one of the darkest day in Singapore's political development.</p>

              <p style="clear: both;">Deng, a 21-year-old waitress from Hubei Province who fatally stabbed a Communist Party official after he tried to force himself on her, became an Internet sensation in China after she was arrested on suspicion of voluntary manslaughter a month ago.</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">According to the police investigation, two local officials, Huang Dezhi and Deng Guida, were customers at the Fantasy City Bathhouse, a karaoke parlor in rural Badong County, on May 10th when they approached Deng and demanded "special services." (In China, bathhouses are often fronts for brothels.)</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">When she refused, Deng Guida (who was not related to Deng) allegedly threw a wad of money at her face and pushed her onto a nearby sofa. As they proceeded to attack her, she pulled out a fruit knife and repeatedly stabbed and killed Deng Guida.</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">Deng immediately turned herself in to authorities and police initially charged her with manslaughter.</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">However, details of the case soon leaked out on the Internet. <a href="http://zonaeuropa.com/200905c.brief.htm#011"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Deng told her side of the story to a Chinese newspaper</span></span></a>, and the county government went into overdrive to downplay allegations of similar acts of aggression by Deng Guida and Huang Dezhi. </p>

              <h1>Iranian Election Divides Arabs, Their Leaders</h1>
              <p class="byline">by <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100740"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Peter Kenyon</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span class="date">June 25, 2009 · </span>Around the Arab world, reactions to the Iranian election have ranged from street demonstrations to Internet protests. But Arab leaders, many of whom are wary of the regime of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, have either remained silent or embraced his re-election as legitimate.</p>
              <p>The gap between the public and their leaders in the tightly controlled, economically powerful Persian Gulf states has rarely been this clear. In the wake of the Iranian vote, as government repression of street demonstrations turned violent, the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister spoke out, as did his counterpart in Bahrain.</p>
              <p>Both echoed the regime in Tehran, railing against what they called "foreign interference" in Iranian affairs. The Emirati minister added that no country wants to be exposed to instability.</p>
              <p><strong>Ordinary Arabs Show Support For Reformers</strong></p>
              <p>At the street level, meanwhile, the reaction was much more supportive of the demonstrators seeking a new election. In Dubai, where property prices are generally the first topic of conversation, demonstrators — many of them Iranian expatriates — took to the streets outside mosques and the Iranian Consulate in a rare display of sustained public protest.</p>
              <p>When the demonstrations showed no signs of evaporating after several days, the police were called in to break them up. Even so, on a recent night, hundreds of people showed up for a silent candlelight vigil featuring a memorial to a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105763302"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">young Iranian woman</span></span></a> whose apparent shooting death in Tehran had been captured on video.</p>
              <p><strong>Cautious Reaction Of Arab Leaders Not Surprising </strong></p>
              <p>Abbas, an Iranian businessman who asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution against family members in Iran, says the attacks on civilians in the streets dismayed him. He has no doubt that the election should be annulled and redone. But he also admits that he is not surprised by the cautious reactions among Arab leaders.</p>
              <p>"I think the rulers of the countries around us are wise to keep quiet until they know what happens, because it is either Mr. Ahmadinejad or the reformists who [will] come to power. They are right in being silent until this is known," he says.</p>
              <p>In several Arab countries, the state-run or pro-government press has buried stories about the unrest in Iran, preferring to lead with articles about swine flu or the latest wrinkle in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On the Internet, activists engaged in lengthy debates over whether the Iranian protesters were the descendants of the 1979 revolution or pretenders in designer jeans.</p>
              <p>In Cairo, Mahmoud Salem, who blogs under the name "Sandmonkey," says some officials seem worried that political unrest could spread to Egypt, but he thinks the Egyptian leadership would love to see the Iranian regime fall.</p>
              <p>"Our government is loving this. Our government hopes Iran falls down. Because no Iran, no Hezbollah and no Hamas. Hamas has to toe the line. Egypt is back in the driving seat in the region," he says.</p>
              <p>He claps his hands together as if to say, "That's it, problem solved."</p>
              <p>But of course it's not that simple, he adds, noting that one of the biggest beneficiaries of regime change in Iran would be Israel, and that's an outcome that would satisfy no Arab leader.</p>
              <p><strong>Opportunity May Be Slipping Away</strong></p>
              <p>In the United Arab Emirates, Iranian expatriates such as Abbas scan the Internet for the latest theories on how Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, might be forced from power. Some are excited by a report on the Al Arabiya channel that former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani might convene the Assembly of Experts, a clerical governing body, for a vote to replace Khamenei with a committee of ayatollahs, some of whom might favor redoing the elections.</p>
              <p>But Abbas worries that time is not on the reformers' side.</p>
              <p>"I think this is the only possibility, the only chance Iranians have to create some change. If they fail to do it this time, they might really have to shelve it for a long time," he says.</p>

              <p>This only works if the govt leaders are clean and uncorrupted which in singapore , is really true...</p>

              <p>Look at all the other countries... govt is corrupted... mass protesting is allowed... their country is so messy and this things bring so much problem ...innocents people get killed, property can destroyed...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that is the reason why singapore can be no 1 in many areas... because the other countries always in confused internal state...</p>
              <p>many countries govt are really corked up.. unlike our singapore...</p>
