            <div class='col-md body'>Yellow Ribbon is a good campaign that gives ex convicts a 2nd chance in job opportunities. A turning point for the government to emphasise some social aspects to getting them a decent way of life. Well, ex convicts also want to get a decent job and lead a life. If ex convict have difficulty getting a job, then they might resort to stealing and many other crimes. To change their mindset, they need a job to steer their thoughts to getting a better future.<br><br></div>

There will always b people who regret going to jail for a stupid, silly offence and will wanna rebuild their lives once they are released.<br><br>At the opposite end, there are hardcore criminals who will always be the bad ones, whether in jail or not. If they cant promise to change their ways or break their trusts and bail, then I would rather just extend their jail sentences instead of releasing them.<br><br>Because I do know these people simply will not use their 2nd chance as an opportunity to improve themselves and change for the better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm worried about a few things:<br><br>1) In my impression, I thought by the time the convicts are released, shouldn't they be ready for the society? Isn't the amount of time spent behind bar which correlate with the seriousness of the crime which correlate with the amount of time the prison can help to correct that person?<br><br>Hence, if someone is released from the prison, should we start to believe in the corrective action done by the prison? If not, why release him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2) An even more serious problem.. Convict is a label. Ex-convict is another label. Why do we have to emphasise on the term ex-convict at all? And wouldn't a project such as Yellow Ribbon make their identity as an ex-convict even more salient?<br><br>3) I'm not sure, but I thot you do not have to disclose everything when you apply for a job.. And a record such as this will be available most likely only to the civil service.. Wouldn't it be better for the government to take the lead in employment? Rather than to label them as ex-convicts?<br><br>4) If a society requires the government to remind their citizens not to discriminate, what kind of society would that be?</div>
