The only time we would have the yanks and the Brits invading us for regime change would be when the following occur transparently:<br><br>1. We got no fancy glass tower buildings<br>2. No hip hop or dancing or bars or night life<br>3. Starving black babies living in huts<br>4. Crazy Ah Bengs with dynamite strapped to their chests yelling :<br>"FOR LEE KUAAAN YEWWWW!"<br>5. Pai geahs hi jacking 747s and crashing them into British or American buildings<br>6. If Islam becomes a national religion<br>7. If we openly say on TV that G.Bush is  a fag<br>8. No education<br>9. Slavery<br>10. Disease e.g lots of people with HIV like some black countries.<br>11. Other shit etc etc etc<br><br>Only then will USA and UK invade... cos even though PAP does suck... all PAP's bad pts is covered up with our fancy buildings.... our wages.. our racial harmony d`ay, our channel 5 movies, our radio music, our NICE STUFF, ALL THE NICE STUFF just like they have in USA or UK.<br><br>So my point.... SIngapore has a lot of deterioration to accomplish before the Western powers invade us.... lol... more likely they will invade Malaysia or Indonesia cos they are muslim and they are brown, also their governments seem to have more sh*t than ours. In fact, they would not invade Singapore, or Phillipines, simply cos Phillipines is mostly Christian and "civilised", look @ Singapore, it is the only small flame of "Americanisation Civilisation" in SEA, compared to all the neighbouring Muslim countries, as percieved by the Americans. Thus they won't invade us, not yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is incorrect.<br><br>The yanks were already supplying England with war materials in their struggle with the third reich. They were not abt to let europe "rot" so to speak.<br><br>In fact, the US joining the war was only a question of time. The bombing of pearl harbour only accelerated their declaration of war on japan and provided a convenient back door excuse for hostilities with Germany as well.<br><br>After all, German U-boats had already sunk a sizable number of US vessels in the atlantic while they were still neutral.<br><br></div>
