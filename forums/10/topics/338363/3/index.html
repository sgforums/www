              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Globalization is a word used today, often without precision. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">If we use the
              word globalization to refer to the entire process of IMF and WTO-led
              neo-colonialism under the Dollar System, then it is a descriptive term. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">It
              describes the creation of a global dollar imperium, a Pax Americana.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;"> Establishment critics of the IMF system such as Joseph Stiglitz, himself a
              former Clinton adviser and World Bank official, make accurate charges against
              the IMF.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;"> They assume, however, that it is merely misguided policy that leads
              to the problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;"> The entire IMF institution, along with the World Bank and
              WTO, however, have been deliberately developed to advance this globalization
              of the Dollar System, the second pillar of Pax Americana after the military
              power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;"> It is no mistaken policy, no result of bureaucratic blunders. That is
              the crucial point to be understood. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The IMF exists to support the Dollar
              System.</span></p>

              <p>All good stuff, but lets have some actual output.</p>
              <p>Its not simply a policy of imperialism by the US. But a case of economic warfare by corporations, which have already hijacked the US Government, to enslave Third World nations. Why do people like xtreyer persist in promoting such a system, whitewashed by textbook propaganda, when all evidence points towards perpetrating human suffering is much a mystery.</p>

              <p>Look at xtreyier. Because of the brainwashing that goes on inside schools. They push theoretical frameworks but never expose the machinations of the corporate elites, which incidentally control the education system as well. Thats why people cant see the truth.</p>

              <p>...To get back to sovereignty and the structure of the state, another
              cause of today's instability is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we now have a society in America,
              Europe and much of the world which is totally dominated by the two
              elements of sovereignty that are not included in the state structure:
              control of credit and banking and the corporation.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These are free of
              political controls and social responsibility, and they have largely
              monopolized power in Western Civilization and in American society.</strong></span> They
              are ruthlessly going forward to eliminate land, labour,
              entrepreneurial-managerial skills, and everything else the economists
              once told us were the chief elements of production. The only element of
              production they are concerned with is the one they can control: capital</p>

              private power of money flows and corporation activities.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I want to read
              you a summary from James Willard Hurst, "The Legitimacy of the Business
              Corporation in the Law of the United States from 1780 to 1970". He
              points out that there was powerful anti-corporation feeling in the
              United States in the 1820's. Therefore, it was established by the
              states that corporations could not exist by prescription: they had to
              have charters.</p>
              <p>They had to have a limited term of life and not be
              immortal. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Corporations today are immortal: if they get charters, they
              can live forever and bury us all.</strong></span> They had to have a limited purpose.
              Who is giving us this bread made of sawdust? ITT: International
              Telephone and Telegraph, the same corporation that drove Ivar Kreuger
              to suicide in Paris in April 1931, when it actually was an

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by freedomclub:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>You have not presented anything except theoretical scenarios, which is the rice producing country etc (which I've obviously read). It works great in the textbook, but when it comes down to the real world, things are horribly different. I do not believe I've engaged in any personal attacks, merely trying to get you to look at the evidence I presented. Look at Ecuador, just one of the many examples (but it doesnt seem like you even looked at- otherwise, you would have responded to it). <strong>During the 1970s, Africa was almost self-sufficient in food. Now, they're about 70% reliant on foreign imports. When fuel prices spike, like during the first half of 2008, people cant get food to eat. And the riots break out. Why? Because Big Agri (western corporations) barge in there and destroy domestic capacity so that they can earn more profits.</strong> As I've said, when corporations place profits/power above human concerns, its merely makes society more inhumane. <em>Economics is just a pile of deceptive words like "economic efficiency" and "pareto optimality" that doesn't not address the human dimension.</em></p>
              <p><strong>It is because "free trade" breaks down barriers to corporations that they are able to infiltrate Third World countries and ruin peoples' lives. Malawi was thriving in the 1960/70s (I think), and they sustained themselves by growing their own food. Because the Malawi government provided free fertiliser, the country could export food. But the WTO and its western cronies didnt like that at all, because it meant lesser profits because of Malawi food independence. So the WB/IMF got the Malawi government to curtail fertiliser give-outs and that resulted in food productivity plunging so that Monsato/Cargil could jump in, destroy domestic production and get the Malawi people to become corporate dependencies.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Look, more real-world evidence for protectionism. Protection from western corporations looking to make more money off human suffering. During the Cold War, Latin American countries like Guatemala, Chile and Panama, even Iran, were messed up by the CIA because their leader implemented <em>humanitarian reforms</em> such as distributing land to the peasants. Of course, the western corporations like United Fruit in Guatemala, for instance, didnt like that. They brought in the CIA and propped up dictators that oppressed the people.</strong></p>
              <p>"Free trade" is just semantic deception for western corporations to exploit the native people and to make even more profits. Now, compared to the theoretical increase in wealth (besides in the age of globalisation, the income gap is increasing) that the theory of comparative advantage offers, I believe my evidence is more than enough to tear it to shreads. Why cling on to non-real theories and perpetrate misery when you can recognise the sufferning that "free trade" causes in the name of profits? <em><strong>Is this not "logical"? I'm beginning to think that your defence of textbook economics serves to fuel the egoistic academia inside you, disregarding all other real-world evidence.</strong></em></p>
              <p>I could have gone deeper, but not before you recognise how inapplicable such economic theory is in the corporate-dominated real world. Ponder on this, (war criminal) Henry Kissinger said, <strong>"Control oil, and you control nations. Control food, and you control people."</strong> (thats why my examples are so pertinent to food)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There is a fatal flaw in your defense of protectionism - your use of 'greedy corporations' to shoot down theÂ policy of free trade. <strong>Give me a break please! Your conspiracy theories again?</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>There is scientific basis to the field of economics. Economics taught is the same everywhere (almost) and even textbooks and their authors similar from country to country. Where economists differ are in their interpretations of data, stats, and calculations.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>However, no matter how precise an interpretation may be, it is the elected representative of a people or a dictator that decides how its own economy is to be manage. He may even use his own theory, with absolutely no scientific basis, as with Mao in his disastrous 'Great Leap' campaign.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>Thus, those examples you provided did not, and is not, sadly, relevant to counter the theory of free trade. It is more corruption and mismanagement by the political leaders than a failure of free trade practices.</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>It is politicians, who should lead and control, not corporations who do. Where corporations lead, then the failure lies with politicians and itsÂ  voters or citizens and not economic theory.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>As with Nuclear Technology, it is not science to be blamed, for it was meant as an alternative to fossil fuels and a deterrant to further wars, but it is politicians, such as Iran's mad president, whom warp such tech and wants it to murder a neighbouring nation.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>If you want an example of why protectionism is a flawed ideal, we only have to look no further than Singapore, our homeland.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>In the 60s and early 70s, we were self sufficient in furniture industry. But when foreigners such as ikea and courts moved in, carpenters went out of jobs, our companies relocated overseas. Should we have protected this industry?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>No. We did not. Because those foreign companies were selling furniture cheaper and our citizens benefitted from the lower prices, meaning they had more money left in their pockets than otherwise supporting local industries.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Did our carpenters suffered? No, they upgraded their skills and earned better being CNC operators, or work as supervisors in specialty renovation firms which gave better salaries. Carpentry skills became obsolete, freeing our ITE syllabus for more relevant other courses which can help better paid employment, for both our young and instructors.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The foreign companies still had to employ locals. Although the bulk of our money went into their profits, there was still enough left over to circulate within our economy.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Thus, free trade theory did work to our benefit, for our country.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â While we did became an import dependent nation, the social and economic costs were lower than if we had 'protected' our industries.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â Eg, think of how thousand blocks of flats have to be demolish if we wanted to be self sufficient in rice. Think of how much wood we would still need to import to keep the furniture trade alive.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The costs offered by foreign purchases were cheaper than what we could have bought if we had protected our industries.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>NOw, if our entreprenuers will do the same as what those and other foriegn companies did, or invite foreign capital to come here to set up high yield production, hiring cheap foreign labour while maintaining our locals in better paying supervisory and mgmt roles, producing better mass acceptable products, our exports will help our nation earn revenue for social spending.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>In order to realize this dream, our trading partners, whom we buy from, must remove their barriers to our entreprenuers' goods.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>-What i had written is no longer theory:- drive down to Tuas and face up to reality of what niche industrialization had done for our country.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>-What i had written is no longer theory:- ask those CEOs who accompanied PM Lee for the APEC summit if they had been fighting for the livehood of our exporters with our trade partners.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>-What i had written is no longer theory:- ask SM Goh, who was a member of a higher powered international committee to research on why nations fail or succeed, on whether it is governance or corporations to be blamed for free trade failure.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Protectionism is an evil, for it encourages sloth and complacency, benefitting not the famer or the consumer, regresses society and must be destroyed.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>It's back to basics. A wit from this forum once said the international market had gone into reset mode. It will be the basics that will help us rebuild the world again, removing its excesses which mankind had suffered in the past.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Simple and uncomplicated reality. No convoluted heresay conspiracy theories needed.</p>

                  for the American people or any other people to assert greater control
                  over monetary policy, they need to have a doctrine of just what a good
                  monetary policy would be. Early in the 19th century the followers of
                  St. Simon in France began to develop such a policy. By the end of that
                  century, Central Europe implemented this policy, mobilizing the banking
                  and financial system to promote industrialization, in consultation with
                  the government (and catalyzed by military and naval spending, to be

              Chicago School is known for its censorial intolerance. The first thing

              <p>...<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In
              the 1990s I sought to publish my history of international trade theory,
              and contacted the editor of University of Chicago Press, who had just
              come from Pantheon on New York, with which I was on good terms before
              the mass resignations in the late 1980s. The editor came back to me
              somewhat chagrined, and said that the entire board of the U/C Press had
              threatened to resign if they published my book. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It was a critique of

              the U/C supported. Their teaching was like the Terminator. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You canât

              <p>In this refreshingly revisionist history, Erik
              Reinert shows how <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rich countries developed through a combination of
              government intervention, protectionism, and strategic investment,
              rather than through free trade.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Reinert suggests that this set of
              policies in various combinations has driven successful development from
              Renaissance Italy to the modern Far East. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet despite its demonstrable
              sucess, orthodox developemt economists have largely ignored this
              approach and insisted instead on the importance of free trade.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Reinart
              shows how the history of economics has long been torn between the
              continental Renaissance tradition on one hand and the free market
              theories of English and later American economies on the other.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our
              economies were founded on protectionism and state activismâlook at
              China todayâand could only later afford the luxury of free trade.</strong></span> When
              our leaders come to lecture poor countries on the right road to riches
              they do so <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>in almost perfect ignorance of the real history of national

                                                      Because the Malawi government provided free fertiliser, the country

              <p>Could you explain to me how does all this information not destroy the arguments for "free trade". As I understand it, "free trade" abolishes trade barriers so that foreign goods and companies are able to set up operations within a country. Based on the above information that I quoted, it is the act of removing trade barriers, allowing western corporations to enter a country that resulted in more poverty, more starvation and more human suffering. I dont deny that "free trade" increases wealth in the world, depends whose wealth you're talking about, but overall, it increases the income gap and perpetrates suffering in the Third World, when Humanity possess the technology to bestow a comfortable standard of living to everyone.</p>
              <p>So after you've read (I assume) all that, can you really say that the free movement of capital and goods really benefits people? Or do you just think, "Well, if I can enjoy the fruits of humanity, who cares if millions of poor people starve?" Or do you think, "Not in the textbook, so must be false"? And Singapore does not apply because we are uniquely small. Because of land constrains, we're forced to convert to a knowledged-based economy. In the process, we could benefit from corporate involvement, but I bet it wont be long now... Otherwise, corporate activity in the Third World has certainly hindered social progress, as evident from the above.</p>
              <p>You are absolutely right. The <strong><em>theory</em></strong> of free trade may sound right, but ironically, reality is not so simply, and it is complicated. <em><strong>If it were the case where government worked for the interests of their citizenry, "free trade" would benefit. But as it is, today, corporations now dominate countries.</strong></em> In fact, in a list of the 100 most wealthy countries, based on GDP, 50 of them are corporations and most of them are based in the US. In addition, it is the case of corporations taking over governments. Let me give you an example of corporate insiders in government. The present head of the world bank, Robert Zoellick (CFR member). Not only did he work for Enron, Fannie Mae and Goldman Sachs and the US Government, but he was attended the Bilderberg Meeting (an annual meeting where 125 of the world's most powerful business and political elites meet in secret- conspiracy fact, not theory).</p>
              <p>Because of this perversion, sound economic theory cannot work because they dont factor in corporate infiltration.Thats why reality is not simple, and it is complicated.</p>
              <p>And by the way, since you agree with the mainstream view that Iran ruled by the maniacal Admadinejad (actually Khamenei)- who willingly had a discussion with American anti-war activists- wants to build nukes (even though the IAEA says otherwise- a sign of where you get your information from), perhaps you also believe that there were WMDs in Iraq and the war plans for the invasion of Afghanistan were not on the table before 9/11. Indeed, its a strange world.</p>

              <p>In the 1950s, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the
              world, suffering the aftereffects of decades of brutal Japanese
              colonialism and war with its northern counterpart. During his
              childhood, Chang (<em>Kicking Away the Ladder</em>), a respected
              economist at the University of Cambridge, witnessed the beginnings of
              Korea's postwar economic miracle as Gen. Park Chung-Hee's dictatorship
              (despite its corrupt machinations) set the economic groundwork that
              would lift Korea out of poverty.</p>
              <p>Though Korea's strategies are
              heretical to first world, free-market economists, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chang argues that the
              world's wealthiest nations historically relied on the same heavy-handed
              protectionist approaches in their quests for economic hegemony. </strong></span>These
              wealthy, first world economies, which preach free market and free trade
              to the poor countries in order to capture larger shares of the latter's
              markets and to pre-empt the emergence of possible competitors are
              Chang's bad Samaritans.</p>
              <p>Chang builds his outsider stance through a
              history of capitalism and globalization and stories of other struggling
              countries' economic transformations. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The resulting polemic about the
              shortcomings of neoliberal economic theory's belief in unlimited
              free-market competition and its effect on the developing world is
