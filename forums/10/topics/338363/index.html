              <p>To help the common masses understand better the evils of protectionism, here goes:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Country Korvenia is self sufficient in rice cultivation and production. It costs only $1 for a 5kg packet of rice to be produced, but is sold at $5 for a 5kg packet to Korvenians, making those in the rice industry rich with the 'marked up', leading to excesses and complacency in productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Country Bruviapore is equally self sufficient, but productive, and has excess rice to sell at $3kg per 5kg packet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It attempts to sell to Korvenia, but korvenian rice lobby groups blocks such sales with import taxes, etc, thru their government, resulting in Bruviapore rice being sold at $8 per 5kg packet, with $5 each packet being paid to Korvenian govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Korvenian consumers are thus the losers, stuck with buying rice at $5/ 5kg packet from their own producers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, in its simplest form, protectionism kills productivity, enterprise and creativity in the industrial and biz process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It only protects those who benefits from the 'marked -up' - the CEOs, suppliers, distributors, Union and hedg fund operators, NOT the farmers or consumers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the latest Apec decision to remove 'protectionism, it means lesser import taxes and tarrifs, or none at all. In this climate, people everywhere are not spending anyway, benefiting not even the protectionist groups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, with trade barriers removed, productive and cheaper manufactured goods will be acceptable to attract consumers to spend, circulating money and promoting growth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a significant and important developement, which will directly help our export industry greatly as well as attract investors to set up production on our shores.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will provide jobs for us all and increase our treasury for social spending. With our nation holding the Apec chair next year, may we push hard to remove this unneccessary evil call protectionism in our planet and help save the world.</p>

              <p>Any shopkeeper will know this. It's either you sell a product at eg, (A) $200 to earn $100 profit, or you sell a product at (B) $2 to earn $1 profit, but sold to 100 people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your product is exclusive, system A is best. But if not and very competitive, system B is a survival alternative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since the recession in the 80's, Spore had opted for alternative B. No doubt our workers were paid low, but our products were better priced, which means more consumer appreciation, and allow jobs to be retained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have also not drop alternative A, thus the spending on R&amp;D, to develope niche and exclusive products in bio-med and hi-tech industries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So before you complain about low wages, would you prefer to live with NO wage?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May President-to-be Obama see this light too. We need the richest country in the world to spend as well.</p>

              <p>No need to get too greedy and want it all. Thats what protectionism does - want it all for short term gain instead of sharing that wealth for long term growth.</p>

              <p><br>If you mean entreprenuership, then any entreprenuer worth his salt should either go into niche industries to survive or have deep pockets to use system B to muscle his way in. Biz is  a cruel world where pity has no place, unlike societies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you mean new industries, then there is no need to protect anything, because you are developing something new and no one can copy it, at least for the moment, and Singapore is a signatory to international copyright legal issues.</p>

              <p>In all Economic books, they always advocate Free Trade based on the theory of Comparative Advantage.<br><br><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/comparative_advantage_1.png"><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/comparative_advantage_1.png" alt="image" width="288" height="244"></a><br><br>In such a situation, it's beneficial to engage in Free Trade as the quantities produced for computers and apples, will far exceed what both countries would produce if they had decided to produce at their own combination of both products. This is irregardless of the country's efficiency in production, whether you are efficient or inefficient, you tend to gain from Free Trade.</p>

              <p>Protectionism doesn't help the farmers and (domestic) consumers? When subsidised foreign goods are prevented from destroying native industries, wouldn't that advance the social good? Natives enjoy employment and the society isn't getting ripped off by foreign corporations. Besides, it maintains self-sufficiency in crucial areas like agriculture and industry.</p>
              <p>The term "free trade" is the biggest misnomer of all. Its simply semantic deception when institution like the WB and IMF, acting as a front for western corporations, systematically eradicate domestic economic capacity of Third World nations and establish economic slavery.</p>
              <p>From1966-1970, Africa was a net exporter of food, averaging 1.6 million tons in food exports. However, when the WTO together with its corporate-runned partners in the WB/IMF stepped in to so-call implement 'free trade', subsidised western food imports destroyed African agriculture so that hunger has ravaged the continent. Just look at the IMF Structural Adjustment Program, to help a country, it privatises public services (good news for western corporations looking to enslave Third World countries), reduces state regulations (more good news for monopoly capitalism), devalues the currency (more exploitation due to cheap raw materials), cuts social spending (plunging the population further into poverty, thereby making corporate control easier) and finally, removing trade barriers (destroying domestic employment and control of national resources). It seems that protectionism is really what it seems, protecting a people from corporate greed, and letting a country use its resources for the better of its people.</p>
              <p>When you say that protectionism works against the common good, you're not taking into account corporate-political collusion. The dominant political system in the western world today isn't democracy or socialism, its corporate-fascism. Just look at the US right now, $7 trillion in tax-payers' money to the banks while $25 billion to save 2.3 million jobs is much a big deal. But I digress, free trade is just another gimmick for corporations, in control of western government, to conquer Third World countries not with the sword, but through debt.</p>

              <p>All that i would advise is for you to calm down, rationalize it and look at it from a bigger perspective, study the society that Africa really is, from its first known inhabitants, the Olmecs to present.</p>

              <p>As for your claim of my 'inhumanity', it is only your opinion, of which i have no control, nor seek to control, or have any control. All i can say is that we all have no right to interfere in another's society on how it is managed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, you and i would have reacted with shock and disgust at Myammar's method to keep its citizens servile.</p>

              <p>There were calls to arms to 'liberate' Myammar, but it would only lead to another tragedy of the likes of Somali, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>My point is, how can we outsiders 'liberate' or give freedom to a society, which only society themselves can bestow upon their leaders? </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Freedom had always been fought for, toppled monarchies and tyrants with it, shed blood for it and in our case, got kicked out and left to die for it, all by society ourselves?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What right do we, outsiders, have, to stop our own progress or resolve our own citizen's hunger, and wait for other societies if their own leaders lead them to , mismanagement of resources, economic doom and exploitation instead of socia - technological progress?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In your angst, it is easy to condemn others, fill your stomach with hot and heated air,  and stand upon your high horse of moral righteousness.</p>

              <p>I pointed out that you totally disregarded the corporate agenda of "free trade". I admit my argument was emotionally fueled, but the "inhuman call" you refer to is based on the exploitation of the Third World by corporate institutions like the WB/IMF. Its not mutual trade. If it is, I can have nothing to say. But as it is, "free trade" just deprives the Third World of their "fair share of the international economic pie". As you rightly said, foreign powers have no right to interfere with the affairs of other countries. But that is what "free trade" does under the banner of the WB/IMF. How is the globalisation of monopoly capitalism "fair" when during the second half of the 20th Century, global income inequality doubled, poverty rose 17% despite global GNP rising 40%. While the WB was "restructuring" Ecuador's economy from 1968-1998, poverty rose by 60%. Is that humane? I'm asking you now.</p>
              <p>I'm not rejecting your arguments. You probably took that out of some economics textbook and its definitely theoretically sound, but which unfortunately leaves out realpolitik. If you can prove that humanity has benefited from "free trade", I'm ready to accept that, provided you have evidence. I don't close my mind off to other viewpoints. Isnt that what you're doing, by ignoring the corporate infiltrated global institutions? While we benefit from "free trade", of course we would support it. Look at the Third World and say that "free trade" benefits them. It is precisely because of "free trade" that western corporations have invaded Africa in a free-for-all resource grab. To make your handphone, innocent Congolese die amid a civil war backed by 100 major corporations, thats from a UN report, not my opinion. Isn't that nice? The visible gun of fascist powers.</p>
              <p>And whats wrong with arguing for a humane approach to society? Aren't you human? Placing profits above human concerns, which is what "free trade" does (in trying to maximise profits) is probably a most paralysing social concept.</p>

              <p>Yes, I can see you point.</p>
              <p>I think the topic of what kind of industry that we want to develop (ie protect) as the country's core competency is something worth discussing.</p>

              <p>My point is not to qualify the worth of protectionism. It is simply what its called; a policy that protects the citizens of a country, in today's context, from capitalism gone wild. "Free trade" just means opening up a Third World/developing economy to corporations that only exist to make money. When rich corporations, with powerful political leverage of the WTO/WB/IMF infiltrate into those countries, a gangbang of immense proportions take place. Human and environmental concerns go down the drain as long as they can continue raking in the billions.</p>
              <p>A case in point, when Ecuador opened its gates to Chevron, it paved the way for environmental damage 18 times worse than the Exxon Valdex incident. 30,000 indigeous people brought Chevron to court in 1993. But unfortunately, with the corporate muscle of Big Oil, Chevron has not been held accountable till today.</p>

              <p>In all Economic books, they always advocate Free Trade based on
              the theory of Comparative Advantage.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/comparative_advantage_1.png"><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/comparative_advantage_1.png" alt="image" width="288" height="244"></a><br> <br> In such a situation, it's beneficial to engage in Free Trade as the
              quantities produced for computers and apples, will far exceed what
              both countries would produce if they had decided to produce at
              their own combination of both products. This is irregardless of the
              country's efficiency in production, whether you are efficient or
              inefficient, you tend to gain from Free Trade.</p>

              <p>when i read that in someone else's economics text book my first thought was what kind of bullshit is that? its only logical in the textbook but once it's applied to people it won't work. no one wants to be the one to be sacrificed.</p>

              <p>To help the common masses understand better the evils of
                      protectionism, here goes:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Country Korvenia is self sufficient in rice cultivation and
                      production. It costs only $1 for a 5kg packet of rice to be
                      produced, but is sold at $5 for a 5kg packet to Korvenians, making
                      those in the rice industry rich with the 'marked up', leading to
                      excesses and complacency in productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Country Bruviapore is equally self sufficient, but productive,
                      and has excess rice to sell at $3kg per 5kg packet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It attempts to sell to Korvenia, but korvenian rice lobby groups
                      blocks such sales with import taxes, etc, thru their government,
                      resulting in Bruviapore rice being sold at $8 per 5kg packet, with
                      $5 each packet being paid to Korvenian govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Korvenian consumers are thus the losers, stuck with buying rice
                      at $5/ 5kg packet from their own producers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, in its simplest form, protectionism kills productivity,
                      enterprise and creativity in the industrial and biz process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It only protects those who benefits from the 'marked -up' - the
                      CEOs, suppliers, distributors, Union and hedg fund operators, NOT
                      the farmers or consumers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the latest Apec decision to remove 'protectionism, it means
                      lesser import taxes and tarrifs, or none at all. In this climate,
                      people everywhere are not spending anyway, benefiting not even the
                      protectionist groups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, with trade barriers removed, productive and cheaper
                      manufactured goods will be acceptable to attract consumers to
                      spend, circulating money and promoting growth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a significant and important developement, which will
                      directly help our export industry greatly as well as attract
                      investors to set up production on our shores.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will provide jobs for us all and increase our treasury
                      for social spending. With our nation holding the Apec chair next
                      year, may we push hard to remove this unneccessary evil call
                      protectionism in our planet and help save the world.</p>

              <p>What a load of rubbish.</p>
              <p>They teach this in primary school issit ?</p>
              <p>Overly simplistic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Real life economy is more dynamic than this childish primany level case studies.</p>
              <p>Protectionism is about making sure the jobs STAYS in the country. And your Kervonia case study only tells of the GREEDY government.</p>
              <p>So what if you remove the trade barrier... the farmers in Kervonia got no job.. even if the rice is 80cents.. they will not be able to afford it.</p>
              <p>In the end.. the rich gets cheaper goods.. and the workers starve to death... Please think more deeper next time... OK ? Good.</p>
