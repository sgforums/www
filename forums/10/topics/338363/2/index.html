              <p>To help the common masses understand better the evils of
              protectionism, here goes:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Country Korvenia is self sufficient in rice cultivation and
              production. It costs only $1 for a 5kg packet of rice to be
              produced, but is sold at $5 for a 5kg packet to Korvenians, making
              those in the rice industry rich with the 'marked up', leading to
              excesses and complacency in productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Country Bruviapore is equally self sufficient, but productive,
              and has excess rice to sell at $3kg per 5kg packet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It attempts to sell to Korvenia, but korvenian rice lobby groups
              blocks such sales with import taxes, etc, thru their government,
              resulting in Bruviapore rice being sold at $8 per 5kg packet, with
              $5 each packet being paid to Korvenian govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Korvenian consumers are thus the losers, stuck with buying rice
              at $5/ 5kg packet from their own producers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, in its simplest form, protectionism kills productivity,
              enterprise and creativity in the industrial and biz process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It only protects those who benefits from the 'marked -up' - the
              CEOs, suppliers, distributors, Union and hedg fund operators, NOT
              the farmers or consumers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the latest Apec decision to remove 'protectionism, it means
              lesser import taxes and tarrifs, or none at all. In this climate,
              people everywhere are not spending anyway, benefiting not even the
              protectionist groups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, with trade barriers removed, productive and cheaper
              manufactured goods will be acceptable to attract consumers to
              spend, circulating money and promoting growth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a significant and important developement, which will
              directly help our export industry greatly as well as attract
              investors to set up production on our shores.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will provide jobs for us all and increase our treasury
              for social spending. With our nation holding the Apec chair next
              year, may we push hard to remove this unneccessary evil call
              protectionism in our planet and help save the world.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">...IMF medicine almost always includes demands to privatize state industries, to
              slash public spending even on health and education, devalue the national
              currency against the dollar, and open the country to free flow of
              international capital-both in and, especially, out. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">First the IMF demands the government in question sign a secret Memorandum of
              Understanding with the IMF, in which it agrees to a list of
              "conditionalities", the pre-condition for getting any penny of IMF aid. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Under
              today's globalized free capital markets, banks do not invest in a country that
              does not have the IMF seal of approval. So the IMF role is far more than
              giving some emergency loan. It determines if a country gets any money from any
              source at all-World Bank, private banks and other. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The conditions of an IMF deal are always the same. Privatization of state
              industries is top on the list. The effect of privatization with a cheap Peso
              or Rouble currency is that foreign dollar investors are able to buy up the
              prime assets of a country dirt cheap. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Often the politicians involved in the
              country get corrupted by the lure of under-the-table deals in privatizing
              their national assets. Foreign multinationals can grab profitable mining, oil,
              or other national treasures with their dollars. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The case of the Yeltsin government in Russia is classic, with dollar
              billionaires emerging overnight on the looting of national assets via
              IMF-dictated privatization. The Clinton Administration backed the process
              fully. They knew it turned Russia into a dollar zone, and that was the intent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The second demand of the IMF is that a country liberalize, that is open, its
              financial and banking markets to foreign investors. This allows high-profile
              speculators like George Soros or Citibank or Credit Suisse to come into a
              country, run up asset prices in a speculation, take huge profits, as in
              Thailand in the mid-1990s, and quickly sell, then exit with huge gains, as
              the local economy collapses behind them. Then Western multinationals can come
              in after, and take prime assets at very low cost. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">This is what happened to Asia in the 1990s. The IMF and US Treasury, which
              actually determines US IMF policy, began strong pressure on the fast-growing
              East Asia "Tiger" economies in 1993, to remove national controls on capital
              flows. They argued it would help Asia get large sums of money to invest. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">What
              it did was give US pension funds and big banks a huge new market for
              speculation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;"> Too much money flowed in, and an unhealthy real estate bubble
              grew. It burst when Soros and other US speculators deliberately pulled the
              plug in 1997, triggering the Asia crisis. The end result was that for the
              first time, Asian economies were forced to turn to the IMF to be rescued. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">But the IMF did not "rescue" any Asian economy in 1998. It rescued
              international banks and hedge fund speculators. In Indonesia, the IMF demanded
              the government raise interest rates to 80%, on the argument that would keep
              foreign investors from leaving, and stabilize the situation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In fact, as
              critics like Joseph Stiglitz charged at the time, the IMF interest rate
              demands guaranteed a full-blown collapse of the Indonesian and other Asian
              banking systems. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Once the IMF got control of South Korea, one of the strongest industrial
              economies in the world, it demanded breakup of large industry conglomerates,
              charging "corruption" and "crony capitalism." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In fact, Washington hoped to
              weaken a growing competitor and open the door for US companies like GM or Ford
              to take over. In part it worked, until Korea and other regional economies were
              strong enough to re-impose national controls. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Malaysia openly defied the IMF
              demands and imposed currency controls during the crisis. The damage to
              Malaysia was minimal as a result, a great embarrassment to the IMF... </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">...IMF medicine almost always includes demands to privatize state industries, to slash public spending even on health and education, devalue the national currency against the dollar, and open the country to free flow of international capital-both in and, especially, out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">First the IMF demands the government in question sign a secret Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF, in which it agrees to a list of "conditionalities", the pre-condition for getting any penny of IMF aid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Under today's globalized free capital markets, banks do not invest in a country that does not have the IMF seal of approval. So the IMF role is far more than giving some emergency loan. It determines if a country gets any money from any source at all-World Bank, private banks and other.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The conditions of an IMF deal are always the same. Privatization of state industries is top on the list. The effect of privatization with a cheap Peso or Rouble currency is that foreign dollar investors are able to buy up the prime assets of a country dirt cheap.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Often the politicians involved in the country get corrupted by the lure of under-the-table deals in privatizing their national assets. Foreign multinationals can grab profitable mining, oil, or other national treasures with their dollars.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The case of the Yeltsin government in Russia is classic, with dollar billionaires emerging overnight on the looting of national assets via IMF-dictated privatization. The Clinton Administration backed the process fully. They knew it turned Russia into a dollar zone, and that was the intent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The second demand of the IMF is that a country liberalize, that is open, its financial and banking markets to foreign investors. This allows high-profile speculators like George Soros or Citibank or Credit Suisse to come into a country, run up asset prices in a speculation, take huge profits, as in Thailand in the mid-1990s, and quickly sell, then exit with huge gains, as the local economy collapses behind them. Then Western multinationals can come in after, and take prime assets at very low cost.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">This is what happened to Asia in the 1990s. The IMF and US Treasury, which actually determines US IMF policy, began strong pressure on the fast-growing East Asia "Tiger" economies in 1993, to remove national controls on capital flows. They argued it would help Asia get large sums of money to invest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">What it did was give US pension funds and big banks a huge new market for speculation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Too much money flowed in, and an unhealthy real estate bubble grew. It burst when Soros and other US speculators deliberately pulled the plug in 1997, triggering the Asia crisis. The end result was that for the first time, Asian economies were forced to turn to the IMF to be rescued.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">But the IMF did not "rescue" any Asian economy in 1998. It rescued international banks and hedge fund speculators. In Indonesia, the IMF demanded the government raise interest rates to 80%, on the argument that would keep foreign investors from leaving, and stabilize the situation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In fact, as critics like Joseph Stiglitz charged at the time, the IMF interest rate demands guaranteed a full-blown collapse of the Indonesian and other Asian banking systems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Once the IMF got control of South Korea, one of the strongest industrial economies in the world, it demanded breakup of large industry conglomerates, charging "corruption" and "crony capitalism."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In fact, Washington hoped to weaken a growing competitor and open the door for US companies like GM or Ford to take over. In part it worked, until Korea and other regional economies were strong enough to re-impose national controls.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Malaysia openly defied the IMF demands and imposed currency controls during the crisis. The damage to Malaysia was minimal as a result, a great embarrassment to the IMF...</span></p>

              <p>...<span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In October 1979, a dramatic shock occurred for the debtor countries. Overnight
              their cheap dollar loans cost them 300% more interest charge. Paul Volcker of
              the Federal Reserve Bank in the US, unilaterally changed US interest policy to
              force the dollar higher against other currencies. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The effect was to raise US
              interest rates 300% and rates in the London bank market by even more. The bank
              loans to Argentina and other countries had been made in "floating" rate
              agreements. If the key international rate in the London bank market, LIBOR,
              was low, Argentina would pay a low rate on its dollar loans. But when it
              suddenly rose 300% in 1979-1980, many countries suddenly faced a payments
              crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">It took until 1982 for the crisis to reach default level. At that point,
              Washington demanded the IMF be brought in to police a debt collection process
              on developing debtor nations. This came to be called the Third World Debt
              Crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The impression was created that countries like Argentina were guilty
              for mismanagement.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In reality, whatever political corruption may have existed
              in the debtor countries, the corruption of the IMF system and the petrodollar
              recycling was far greater. </strong></span>The Volcker interest rate shock completed the
              package of destruction of living standards on behalf of dollar debts...</span></p>

              <p>You have not presented anything except theoretical scenarios, which is the rice producing country etc (which I've obviously read). It works great in the textbook, but when it comes down to the real world, things are horribly different. I do not believe I've engaged in any personal attacks, merely trying to get you to look at the evidence I presented. Look at Ecuador, just one of the many examples (but it doesnt seem like you even looked at- otherwise, you would have responded to it). <strong>During the 1970s, Africa was almost self-sufficient in food. Now, they're about 70% reliant on foreign imports. When fuel prices spike, like during the first half of 2008, people cant get food to eat. And the riots break out. Why? Because Big Agri (western corporations) barge in there and destroy domestic capacity so that they can earn more profits. </strong>As I've said, when corporations place profits/power above human concerns, its merely makes society more inhumane. <em>Economics is just a pile of deceptive words like "economic efficiency" and "pareto optimality" that doesn't not address the human dimension.</em></p>
              <p><strong>It is because "free trade" breaks down barriers to corporations that they are able to infiltrate Third World countries and ruin peoples' lives. Malawi was thriving in the 1960/70s (I think), and they sustained themselves by growing their own food. Because the Malawi government provided free fertiliser, the country could export food. But the WTO and its western cronies didnt like that at all, because it meant lesser profits because of Malawi food independence. So the WB/IMF got the Malawi government to curtail fertiliser give-outs and that resulted in food productivity plunging so that Monsato/Cargil could jump in, destroy domestic production and get the Malawi people to become corporate dependencies.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Look, more real-world evidence for protectionism. Protection from western corporations looking to make more money off human suffering. During the Cold War, Latin American countries like Guatemala, Chile and Panama, even Iran, were messed up by the CIA because their leader implemented <em>humanitarian reforms</em> such as distributing land to the peasants. Of course, the western corporations like United Fruit in Guatemala, for instance, didnt like that. They brought in the CIA and propped up dictators that oppressed the people.</strong></p>
              <p>"Free trade" is just semantic deception for western corporations to exploit the native people and to make even more profits. Now, compared to the theoretical increase in wealth (besides in the age of globalisation, the income gap is increasing) that the theory of comparative advantage offers, I believe my evidence is more than enough to tear it to shreads. Why cling on to non-real theories and perpetrate misery when you can recognise the sufferning that "free trade" causes in the name of profits?<em><strong> Is this not "logical"? I'm beginning to think that your defence of textbook economics serves to fuel the egoistic academia inside you, disregarding all other real-world evidence.</strong></em></p>
              <p>I could have gone deeper, but not before you recognise how inapplicable such economic theory is in the corporate-dominated real world. Ponder on this, (war criminal) Henry Kissinger said, <strong>"Control oil, and you control nations. Control food, and you control people."</strong> (thats why my examples are so pertinent to food)</p>

              <p><strong>...Noam Chomsky:</strong> The <em>New York Times</em> had an article by its
              economic correspondent in its magazine section a couple weeks ago about
              Obama's economic programs.</p>
              <p>He talked about Reagan as the model of
              passionate commitment to free markets and reduction of the role of the
              state, and so on … <em>Where are these people?</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reagan was the most
              protectionist president in post-war American history.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In fact, more
              protectionist than all others combined.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He virtually doubled protective
              barriers.</strong></span> He brought in the Pentagon to develop the "factory of the
              future" to teach backward American management how to catch up on the
              Japanese lead in production. SEMATECH ("Semiconductor Manufacturing
              Technology") was formed.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> If it weren't for Reagan's protectionism and
              calling in of state power, we would not have a steel industry, or an
              automobile industry, or a semi-conductor industry or whatever they
              protected. They reindustrialized America by protectionism and state
              intervention.</strong></span></p>
              <p>All of this is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> washed away by propaganda</strong></span> as though it
              never happened.</p>
              <p>It is very interesting to look at a place like
              MIT, which was right at the center of these developments. My department
              -- you're teaching a course in the Military Industrial Complex -- my
              department is an example of it.</p>
              <p>I came here in the mid-50's. I don't
              know the difference between a radio and a tape recorder, but I was in
              the electronics lab. I was perhaps the one person who refused to get
              clearance on principle. Not that it made any difference; everything was
              open anyway.</p>
              <p>The electronics lab, along with the closely
              connected Lincoln labs, was just developing the basis of the modern
              high- tech economy. In those days, the computer was the size of this
              set of offices.</p>
              <p>By the time they finally got computers down to
              the size of a marketable main frame, some of the directors of the
              project pulled out and formed DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation), the
              first main frame producer.</p>
              <p>IBM was in there, at the government's
              expense, learning how to move from punch cards to electronic computers.
              By the early l960's IBM was capable of producing its own computers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but
              no one could buy them. They were too expensive. So they were bought by
              the National Security Agency.</strong></span> Bell Labs did develop transistors.</p>
              <p>That
              is about the only example you can think of a significant part of the
              high-tech system which came out of private enterprise. But that is a
              joke too! They worked on technology. Their transistor producer was
              Western Electric, who could not sell them on the market; they were too
              expensive.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> So the government bought about 100 percent of advanced
              transistors.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Finally, of course, all of this gets to the point where
              you can market them privately.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It was not until the 1980's after 30
              years of development essentially in the state sector that these things
              became marketable commodities and Bill Gates could get rich.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The
              Internet was the same thing. I was here when they were starting to work
              on the Internet. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It was not until 1995 that it was privatized, after 30
              years. If you look at the funding at MIT, in the 1950s and 1960's it
              was almost entirely Pentagon.</strong></span></p>
              <p>For a very simple reason, the cutting
              edge of the economy was electronics based. A good cover for developing
              an electronics-based economy was the Pentagon. You sort of frighten
              people into thinking the Russians are coming, so they pay their taxes
              and their children and grandchildren have computers.</p>
              <p>Through the
              70's and 80's funding has been shifting to NIH (National Institutes of
              Health). Why? Because the cutting edge of the economy is becoming
              biology-based. So, therefore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the state sector is shifting its
              priorities to developing biology-based industries. </strong></span>All of this is going
              on with accolades to the Free Market. You don't know whether to laugh
              or cry...</p>

              <p><strong>The US Role in Haiti’s Food Riots</strong></p>
              <p>...The problem really is, is that the United States and the
              International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, all of which we, the
              United States, dominate, have for the last twenty-five, thirty years
              have insisted that in order to get the loans, which Haiti and these
              other countries, agricultural countries, need, in order to get those
              loans, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Haiti had to change their economic system so that their country
              was open to competition from other countries on agriculture, trade, a
              number of other things. </strong></span></p>
              <p>It’s so clear in the case of rice. As you said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>thirty years
              ago, Haiti imported almost no rice, was an exporter of sugar and other
              things.</strong></span> Today, Haiti <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>imports nearly all of its rice. It even imports
              sugar, even though it was the sugar-growing capital of the Caribbean.</strong></span> And the reason is, is that the powers that be said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>in order to get
              these loans, which they need desperately to be able to survive, that
              they had to open up their markets to competition. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Well, it turns out that the competition doesn’t do the same
              thing. And the main competition is the United States. So at this point,
              the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>United States exports over 200 million metric tons of rice every
              year to Haiti.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And they’re actually like our third biggest customer.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And the reason is that our rice is cheaper than the rice that they
              could grow there themselves, because our rice is so heavily subsidized.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A billion dollars a year of taxpayer money goes to rice farmers in the
              United States, plus we have a tariff. We have three different
              subsidies, three different programs that do that, plus <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we have a tariff
              that adds between three and 24 percent protection for our rice farmers.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And as a result, the rich and powerful country of the United States,
              along with other rich and powerful countries in the world, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>have just
              really bullied these small countries into accepting our rice.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And as
              the rice from the United States came in—they even called it “Miami
              rice” and some call it the invasion of Miami rice—<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that the rice flooded
              in at low or below cost—free or below cost and destroyed the ability of
              farmers in Haiti to be able to grow rice.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And as a consequence, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the
              country now depends totally on imported rice.</strong></span> Cost of import—<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of
              rice around the world has gone up over 100 percent since January...</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: black;"><br> </span><strong><span style="color: black;">How the
                Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to
                Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">There is currently great pressure on developing countries to
                adopt a set of “good policies” and “good institutions” – such as
                liberalisation of trade and investment and strong patent law – to foster
                their economic development. When some developing countries show reluctance in
                adopting them, the proponents of this recipe often find it difficult to
                understand these countries’ stupidity in not accepting such a tried and
                tested recipe for development. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">After all, they argue, these are the policies
                and the institutions that the developed countries had used in the past in
                order to become rich. Their belief in their own recommendation is so absolute
                that in their view it has to be imposed on the developing countries through
                strong bilateral and multilateral external pressures, even when these
                countries don’t want them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Naturally, there have been heated debates on whether these
                recommended policies and institutions are appropriate for developing countries.
                However, curiously, even many of those who are sceptical of the applicability
                of these policies and institutions to the developing countries take it for
                granted that these were the policies and the institutions that were used by
                the developed countries when they themselves were developing countries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> historical fact is that
                the rich countries did not develop on the basis of the policies and the
                institutions that they now recommend</strong></span> to, and often force upon, the developing
                countries. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unfortunately, this fact is little known these days because the
                “official historians” of capitalism have been very successful in re-writing
                its history...</strong></span></span></p>
