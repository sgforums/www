              <p>Ok.</p>
              <p>Here's the picture as I know.</p>
              <p>What happens if protectionism is in place?</p>
              <p>You retain your local supermarket. You retain your local culture, taste etc.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>Protectionism keeps prices higher than what could be gotten with regards to items that could be made outside more efficiently.</p>
              <p>So.</p>
              <p>Protect or not?</p>
              <p>It's hard to strike a balance.</p>
              <p>What if your supermarket uncle goes out of job? Would it justify the lower prices Wal-mart offers?</p>
              <p>Here lies one of the painful medicine needed and yet seldom done or not to a large enough extent. Training.</p>
              <p>As simple as it sounds, this supply-side policy is the best way out of this, but it is time-consuming and needs injects from the govt to get it going. Politically-unpopular, and time-consuming, and because the much-needed funds are not there often, countries usually opt for the easy way of protectionism.</p>
              <p>Edit to TS: It is naive to think that markets are infallible. Compare China and Russia now. One used gradual opening of markets to open up, and the other "shock-therapy". The latter was recommended by the "richest country" you mentioned. And look what happens to USA now placing too much faith in the market by excessive deregulation and privatisation.</p>

              <p>I somewhat agree with freedomclub as long as he is refering to TNCs (trans-national corporations). </p>
              <p>TNCs have great mobility that they can shift production from one country to another cheaper country as long as they can justify the profits.  And because they are Trans national in nature, there is little individual government's can do to ensure they stay within their control.  Hence TNCs are able to come in, exploit and get out if they want to due to their trans-national nature.</p>
              <p>One theory on the problem was that economic globalization is running ahead of political globalization.   There is little formation of international or supranational organizations (eg.EU) with consolidated power of various states to check such corporations.  </p>

              <p>The debate of protectionism being evil or good is very subjective. I think after reading through most of the replies from this thread we can see both side of the coin. However I just want to point out that at this point, given the global financial situation we are in, the temptation of the Governments leaning toward protectionism is strong (that's why it is being brought up by big organisation around the world).</p>
              <p>Think about it, we should not see it from the light where the market is doing well and government is trying to eliminate competitions to the take the whole pie for themselves. It is just one of the consideration and "solutions" that the government can think of to prevent big cooperations from falling and preventing further unemployment.</p>

              <p>On the contrary, the formation of the EU, NAFTA (soon-to-be North American Union) and other supranational organisations, have all been spear-headed by the same corporate-political elite. The WB/IMF/WTO are merely tools of western corporations that use them as a 'trojan horse' into Third World nations. The SAP that the WB/IMF uses are too coincidental a blessing to western corporations that seek to infiltrate and monopolise Third World countries. Thats where the term "economic hitmen" arose. If you dont want to waste so much money invading, then conquer with the Dollar.</p>

              <p>Protectionism isn't all that bad, it can help salvage the local industry and save jobs too. But protectionism cannot persist indefinitely, it could be use as a measure to protect the local industry, giving them time to reorganise their structure, gain technology to improve on their products.</p>
              <p>Tariffs could be applied to the cheaper imports, which can go into subsidising the local industry, this saves job in the local industry.</p>
              <p>If local producers produce at $10 while foreign country produces at $5, the local government could always levy tariffs from the foreign country at $2.50 per unit. The $2.50 goes into subsidising and sustaining the local industry. Both products will sell at $7.50 in the local market. Yes, you could get it for $5 in another foreign country, but by buying at $7.50, you save the jobs of the local market. Everybody pays abit more, but everybody has a job. Protectionism isn't any different from the Kereitsu's (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">ç³»åˆ—)</span>  of the Japanese, where they will use Japanese firms products though these products are priced higher than other competitors.</p>
              <p>If local industries are not protected, the country could face a situation where it is totally dependant on another country which could turn enemy for supply. Such is the case with USA, which is a fervent supporter of free trade and also a transgressor of free trade by protecting it's own steel industry, when other countries could produce steel much cheaper than USA. If USA loses it's ability to produce steel, their ability to wage war in the future could also be threatened.</p>

              <p>Well, its no secret that corporate powers are heavily entrenched in the US Government. Among the organisations that spearheaded the NAFTA and the SPP (2005) are the Council of the Americas and the North American Business Council, both of whom are filled with people that comprise the revolving door between business and government.</p>
