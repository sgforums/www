My immortality was given to a someone who told me my maker was someone called Xcuedor Nohotash Schone from Europe. I was told that I will find my company from those who hail through this great name. I was marked a Troy as I once fought during the Roman times. That is why I am Troy437.<br>As a Neo Nazis group killed my apprentice in New England about 39 year ago by chance with an unknown religious war relic, I did my studies and wipe them out as they too cross my path. That was my project then.<br>It is by chance I came across a minority of them on this small island called Singapore, as I came here to look for my breed in a wine bar called Molly Mohana along a harbour called Boat Quay. News travelled to me I would find my same there. But I had no success so far. But these skinhead rats once prove their menace again as they crawled around...</div>
