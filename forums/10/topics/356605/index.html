              <p>given the so called intelligence of the singaporean leaders, the truth is that they have just manage to scrap the test of achieving the best for singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the good point is. they have scored 5 marks which is better than some countries who scored 2 marks or 1 mark. the bad news is leaders have merely passed the test barely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope this thread can be a wake up call for those leaders... they are still to uncreative, and ignorant about certain truths of life and how to lead the country well, that is why singapore, is still can not so good really to live in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the opposition parties, and the internet critics also, have not been able to really argue well against the government. They themselves, are also lost, if they rule Singapore, i believe singapore will be worse. The critics and opposition are just not orgnaized and intelligent enough themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed that the types of people who should form a team to rule singapore should be extremely creative , daring and firm people with superb reasoning and liberal viewpoints..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sinaporean leaders are just too conservatives already.. many things just change so gradually and slowly...  Seriously, the govt should have more than enough resources to solve certain important issues in singapore like good education, safety and poverty and zero crime rate and providing assistance net to disadvantage and problem family...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its results in these areas are just above average but still not good. In education, the singapore way is too CMI already. Out of focus is the keyword.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The really intelligent ones has to somehow overhaul singapore system and revolutionise our current governmental style. Our system, if MM lee has to say, is good, but that is if you only compared to other countries...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Compared to ideal country, Singapore is only 5/10. Period. Its time for a paradigm shfit. Although saying so much against current govt, If an election comes, i will still vote PAP, becos it is still the best, for now in the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One day, PAP will become better because its PAP members changes this current system. If this does not happen within PAP, then another party who is really strong will win over PAP. If no strong and correct people come out, then singapore will forever be KNS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my sincere opinions.</p>

              <p>I think the oppostion and some trouble makers are stupid to say that our leaders are corrupt though... its just so conspiracy theories ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and those things about LEE family being power vampires are just so childish.. many current intellectuals who organised society to challenge the govt more maturely like TOC is still better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the truth is. they are still not really acheiving anything IMO. Just theory talking and no long term action. If TOC and related society are really good, I dare them to win people hearts, form their party and run the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The is so much they can do only by anaylsing the govt movement , criticising and telling the govt that they should do this instead and try to feedback the govt. Such way of group cannot achieve any real change to the country. If 20 years down the road, TOC is still only a analysing party what is wrong and what is right but have no power in their hands at all, then they have really wasted their 2 decades of talking.</p>

              <h1><em>singapore leaders has failed singapore.</em></h1>
              <p>What you say is true.</p>
              <p>The country is really in a mess now due to PAP regime's poor leadership.</p>
              <h1>Singapore is a first world country that can’t produce and nurture talents</h1>
              <p><strong>Statement by Mr Ng Teck Siong, Chairman of the Reform Party<br> 10 March 2009</strong></p>
              <p>On 14 August 2008, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said: “They (the young
              generation) say, oh, let’s have multi-party politics. Let’s have
              different parties change and be in charge of the government … … Is it
              that simple? You vote in a Division Three government, not a Division
              One government, and the whole economy will just subside within three,
              four years. Finished!” (TODAY newspaper, “MM Lee questions younger
              Singaporeans’ desire for multi-party politics”, 14 August 2008)</p>
              <p>On 05 March 2009 in the Straits Times, when asked why the CEO post
              in Temasek had been handed over to an expatriate American Charles
              Goodyear, Mr Lee said that there was nobody inside Temasek equal to the
              job, that Mr Goodyear has “a proven record, and we feel <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he was a better
              man than what we had within the system</strong></span>”. Mr Lee also said that Mr
              Goodyear was also “somebody exposed to world markets”.</p>
              <p>The irony of the two comments within a period of six months shows how contradictory Mr Lee can be.</p>
              <p>But what is most significant is that he can say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his so-called
              PAP Division One Government cannot produce a talent within its own
              system fit enough to take over the CEO post in Temasek</strong></span>, the role of
              managing our country’s own reserves.</p>
              <p>So what sort of Division One Government is the PAP?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Under its rule
              of 50 years, the system has failed disastrously to nurture and grow
              talents in Singapore. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This great dependency on foreign talents <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>must
              awake Singaporeans from their slumber of over-reliance on this
              so-called Division One Government of the PAP.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Singapore leaders have failed, no lar, citizens have been barking up the wrong tree lor, let them rule lar - but next time around vote the opposition in - READ THIS - not to have them rule but have checks n balances . Otherwise, simply we are going round the same merry go round. give them the guns lar (the present government lar) but give the bullets to the opposition. Then wait and see, the intelligent and wise would know and if they did not - it would improve and if not end the endless charade. Can one shoot without bullets?</p>
