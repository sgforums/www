            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Robberies on the rise this year</strong><br><br>BEFORE the sun had risen, two robbery attacks - each carried out by more than one person - had taken place early on Wednesday.<br><br>In an earlier incident on Tuesday evening, two men robbed another man as the sun was starting to set that day.<br><br>Occurring within a span of 12 hours, the three incidents add to the statistics pointing to what seems like a rise in such crimes this year.<br><br>There were 744 robberies in the first nine months of this year, up from 705 for the same period last year, according to the police.<br><br>In about four out of every 10 cases in the first nine months of this year, the robbers hurt their victims.<br><br>Two of the three recent cases involved hurt as well, while the third incident involved four robbers, two of whom carried penknives.<br><br>In all, the victims in the three attacks were robbed of some $3,600 in cash, valuables and other items.<br><br>On Wednesday, at about 2.45am, two men followed a teenager into a lift in Block 606, Jurong West Street 65.<br><br>They attacked and robbed him of a cellphone worth $250 and a wallet containing $5.<br><br>The duo fled when the lift doors opened on one of the upper floors of the block where the victim, a sales assistant, lived.<br><br>The victim, who suffered facial injuries, was later taken to the National University Hospital for outpatient treatment.<br><br>The second robbery that morning took place at around 4am - about 90 minutes later - in an open carpark near the Bukit Timah Shopping Centre.<br><br>A motorist was getting out of his car there when four men approached him. Two threatened him with penknives and demanded his valuables.<br><br>The victim, an odd-job worker in his 30s, handed over some $400, after which all four robbers fled in different directions.<br><br>In Tuesday's incident, a self-employed man in his late 40s was approached by two men as he was walking along Jelapang Road at around 6pm.<br><br>They attacked him and snatched a gold necklace with a pendant, worth about $3,000, from him before they fled. He suffered a slight cut on his elbow in the struggle.<br><br>Police are appealing to anyone with information on these three cases to contact them on 1800-255-0000.<br><br>Robbers who hurt their victims can be jailed between five and 20 years and caned at least 12 times.<br><br>People can protect themselves by not having a lot of cash and valuables on them.<br><br>If they are walking alone late at night or in secluded areas, they should get a friend or relative to accompany them.<br><br>They should also be aware of their surroundings at all times, said police spokesman Lim Tung Li.<br><br></div>
