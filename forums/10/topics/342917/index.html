              <p><br><em>like what littlespeck said, for Singaporeans who think theirs is the best in Asia outside Japan, think again.</em></p>
              <p>http://www.theedgesingapore.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1254%3Awhy-taipeis-mrt-trumps-singapores&amp;catid=979%3Asunita-sue-leng&amp;Itemid=54&amp;showall=1<br><br>    Why Taipei’s MRT trumps Singapore’s<br>    Written by Sunita Sue Leng<br>    Dec 30, 2008</p>
              <p>TAIPEI’S CITY Hall is so proud of its mass rapid transit (MRT) system that it runs a competition every year, asking people to send in poems about the MRT. I can see why.<br><br>    The MRT is clean and comfortable (in addition to chewing gum, the nasty habit of betel chewing nut has been banned).<br><br>    People queue up in a civilised fashion before boarding trains. And, when the doors open, they don’t barge in before passengers can exit.<br><br>    Signs and announcements are in Chinese and English and all carriages have electronic displays showing which station is coming up next.<br><br>    Every carriage has special seats for old folks, pregnant women or people with disabilities. I’ve never seen fit, young people pretending to be asleep in these seats.<br><br>    However, the best part about Taipei’s MRT is its frequency.<br><br>    According to Taipei Rapid Transit Corp (TRTC), the company that runs the system, trains arrive at two to four-minute intervals at peak hours. Off-peak, it is four to seven minutes.<br><br>    In reality, it is much more frequent. I know because I’ve timed it. At peak hours, trains come as often as every minute.<br><br>    As for off-peak hours? Well, I’ve never had to wait more than three or four minutes. As a result, even during the morning rush hour, the trains are never as packed as they are in Singapore.<br><br>    TRTC has won praise not just locally but internationally. It has been ranked No 1 for reliability for four straight years (2004 to 2007), according to the Nova/CoMET International Railway Benchmarking Group (of which Singapore’s SMRT Corp is also part).<br><br>    All this got me wondering just how TRTC is able to deliver such a world-class MRT service.<br><br>    Perhaps, it doesn’t have to transport as many people as in the crowded Lion City? Perhaps, it’s government-owned and isn’t under pressure to make as much money as possible and can run more trains?<br><br>    So, I pulled up some numbers (see table below). And the broad conclusion is that Taipei proves it is possible to offer a high-quality, high-frequency and affordable MRT service without losing money.<br><br>    Tracking the MRTs<br><br>    Singapore population: 4.6m<br>    Length of MRT: 109.4km<br>    No. of MRT stations: 66<br>    No of MRT lines: five<br>    Average daily ridership: 1.56m<br>    Average ticket price: S$1.00<br>    Average trip distance: 11.2km<br>    Total passenger-trip distance<br>    (passengers times km traveled) annually: 5,714.5km<br>    Average daily train runs: Just over 1,000<br><br>    Taipei population: 5.5m<br>    Length of MRT: 74.7km<br>    No. of MRT stations: 69<br>    No of MRT lines: eight<br>    Average daily ridership: 1.14m<br>    Average ticket price: NT21.9 (S$1.00)<br>    Average trip distance: 7.9km<br>    Total passenger-trip distance<br>    (passengers times km traveled) annually: 3,298.9km<br>    Average daily train runs: 2,171<br><br>    It also suggests that certain services, such as public transport, tend to function optimally as natural monopolies and ought not to be owned by companies that seek to maximise profits.<br><br>    Let’s look first at the one common element between the two: the cost of taking a train.<br><br>    Average ticket prices in Singapore and Taipei are about $1. This is pretty low by international<br>    standards, as anyone who has had the misfortune to take the London Underground knows.<br><br>    Singapore and Taipei are also pretty dense cities, but the latter packs more folks (5.5m of them) into a smaller area (272 sq km). In comparison, Singapore is home to 4.6m residents spread over some 692 sq km.<br><br>    As such, in terms of coverage, Singapore’s network of five MRT lines is more extensive, totalling 109.4km, versus TRTC’s 74.4km network.<br><br>    However, TRTC has more stations on its smaller network, which means less distance between stations and greater convenience for commuters.<br><br>    More trains in Taipei<br><br>    Just how many people take the MRT each day? In 2007, Singapore’s MRT moved an average of 1.56 million people a day. That’s just over a third more than what TRTC transported last year. So yes, TRTC’s network is smaller and it moves fewer people, which is one reason it feels les crowded.<br><br>    However, what is illuminating is the difference in frequency. Last year, TRTC made an average of 2,171 train runs a day.<br><br>    SMRT clocked in at just over 1,000 a day for its fiscal year ended March 2008. This is not strictly an apples-with-apples comparison.<br><br>    SMRT’s system is older, has heavier loads and travels further than TRTC’s — factors which play role in how often trains can be run.<br><br>    The comparison also doesn’t include data from SBS Transit, which runs the North- East Line. But, as SMRT accounts for more than four fifths of total MRT ridership, it is fairly representative of the whole picture.<br><br>    Since February this year, SMRT has added about 900 extra train trips each week.<br><br>    According to the company, on average, its train frequency during peak hours is between two and five minutes.<br><br>    During off-peak hours, it is now between 3.5 and seven minutes. Given the existing signalling system and infrastructure, its average peak-hour frequency puts it among the top 20% of the world’s major metro operators, SMRT adds.<br><br>    SMRT more profitable<br><br>    Still, it’s safe to assume that its bumped-up frequency continues to lag TRTC’s. And this, to an extent, is reflected in SMRT’s bottom-line, which is much heftier than TRTC’s.<br><br>    In FY2008, SMRT’s rail operations saw revenue of $436.9m. Earnings before interest and tax was $129.3m.<br><br>    In comparison, TRTC saw approximately $415 million in fare revenue in 2007 and just $41.3m in pre-tax profit.<br><br>    TRTC is 73.75% owned by the Taipei City Government. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications owns a further 17.14% while the Taipei County Government owns 8.75%.<br><br>    Clearly, public-listed SMRT’s returns on its rail operations are far better for its shareholders than TRTC’s.<br><br>    However, TRTC — which has been profitable every year except its first two — is better for its<br>    commuters, who have been inspired to pen a poem or two in praise of their well-regarded metro.<br><br>    (Sunita Sue Leng, previously an associate editor at The Edge Singapore, is now based in Taipei and writes on Greater China issues).</p>

              <p>yes.. taipei MRT in indeed good</p>
              <p>but the human congestion in singapore is due to expensive cars.. when i mean expensive is REALLY expensive</p>
              <p>in taiwan an average cost of SGD 392 dollars is needed for a month including oil, insurace instalment</p>
              <p>in singapore u need at least 700-800dollars for a month without including oil!</p>
              <p>(including instalment)</p>
              <p>singaporeans all si bei kiasi..</p>

                  i think it is more because frequency is too not enough. If it is at 2 min interval there would be no need to push and rush. And why is the frequency so long? It basically boils down to the fact that MRT is a private company which definitely will try to maximize profits.

              <p>The govt companies in Singapore are known as Pte Ltd just for wayang only.   Basically nothing changes, it exists to serve the purpose of the PAP before the people.    I was in a govt company with Pte Ltd in the name but it functions exactly like the government sector.  Worst, charity in this organisation is forced, not voluntary ==&gt; staff force to get donation card to collection donation for President's Challenge every year.    The HR rold me over and over again that they are good citizens so follow whatever the govt do.</p>

              <p>You have to go there and travel and see la. Interstate travelling in trains in India is one of the best experiences you can have. Of course you don't travel on top of those trains. Your idea of travelling on top is seriously flawed mate. Thats more like stereotyping. I have travelled more then any of you on trains in India probably. Journeys lasting almost 62 hours and more.</p>
              <p>I have yet to come across people who travel on the top :) Yes I have seen those pictures and yes they do happen but not for people like us. Those are extremely poor class. You go there and spend about 30SGD and u can travel in superb comfort with meals inclusive, power for your laptop and now even internet in the trains. Yep.. I am talking about long journeys here by the way.</p>
              <p>For ladies, they have ladies only compartment for the extremely low class tickets and try getting into it and I am sure you will be beaten into pulp by the ladies themselves :p</p>
              <p>I am going back for holidays to India next week and one of my prime attraction is my train travel :p Its the best and most memorable. Nothing like travelling in the mrt here which is overridden with kiasu people who only know how to rush into the trains and don't give seats up to more needy people. Always an unpleasent experience.</p>
