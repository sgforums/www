            <div class='col-md body'>if anyone does recall the scenery of that stretch of road, there was more than one angsana tree there. I have a feeling that the tree that is now left standing was supposed to be chopped as well.. somehow, someone (and I am suspecting NParks) had a last minute change of mind and wanted to preserve the tree.<br><br>for the last few years motorists had to meander their way around that tree. Those who are familiar with the road scheme, will expect what's in stall for them, more often then not, those who came close to accidents are those who are not familiar with the road and the speed limits in place. The split caused them to have to decide left or right.. so you put all that together.. that's the accident or the near misses..<br><br>The tree should have been gone in the first place. But consider the following:<br><br>1. If LTA had chosen to cut the tree. Against the wishes of the green groups and those for preserving the tree.. The costs would have been saved. But what price does it have for our respect for greenery and how are we to price such trees and the greenery when we are branded as a garden city? Bearing in mind, there are going to be more road widening works and all.. to cater to 6.5m people and the increased traffic. For those who drive, take a look at how close the trees are to the roads and expressways.. If we don't try hard enough to save trees, we would gradually erode our status as a garden city.<br><br>2. So, LTA chose to protect the tree. And in so doing, spent money.<br><br>3. Going forward, if someone really dies due to an accident and indirectly as a result of that tree and the traffic scheme in place, how much will his/her life cost with respect the 400,000 spent? Imaging what will be the topic for discussion on this forum if such a case really hit the news.. a lot of people will be crying out .. oh.. should have cut the tree yadda yadda..<br><br>So.. did LTA regret? Nope.. I dun think so.. why should they be?<br><br>Its never an easy black and white case. the intention set out to keep the tree was a good one.. but people dun follow rules despite the signs that have been put in place. If you ask me, i have to tell you that the motorists who dun follow the rules are the ones who is now causing the govt to spend the additional amount to cut the tree. if anyone who has to regret, should be those motorists who actually dared to complain about the tree being a hazard. They should have obeyed the traffic signs in place first.<br><br>For those who are suggesting to transplant.. please think again and very hard.. the tree might be in danger and if it fails, are you going to say "on, they shouldn't have spent the money to transplant"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We should not restrict ourselves from the onset to think of this as an either or situation.  This is not an either or situation.  It is not whether we should protect the tree and endanger motorists or protect the motorists and sacrifice the tree.<br><br>We can keep the tree and yet still keep the road safe for motorists.  LTA said that the problem was due to the inability of motorists to slow down when approaching the tree.  The public has written in to suggest a simple solution of using the speed camera that has proven to work well wherever it is placed.<br><br>Then there are other measures like strips or humps on the road to slow vehicles down.<br><br>Then there is also the possibility of extending the well that the tree currently sits in so that it tappers gradually for say 1km.  If you follow a gradual curve for 1km leading to the tree, you can't possibly hit the tree.</div>
