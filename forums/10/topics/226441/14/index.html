            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Dear Lupin Tan,<br><br>You have asked very interesting questions.<br><br>1) How do you define better? Admittedly, back in 1997 General Elections when PAP started to use HDB upgrading as a carrot and stick to lure voters to vote for them, I have decided back then that I should not allow my future generations to be poisoned by such political ploy. I happened to be a Cheng San voter back then. I have planned to emigrate once I have enough resources to do so.It is only in 2001 GE when I met Hougang MP Mr. Low TK, I am convinced that we could change the environment for the better. For me, it is an easy choice. It is either I do something to change the "bad" political environment so to justify my stay in Singapore or I just have to walk out, for my children sake. It is never about "greener pasture" in terms of how much I could earn. It is about the environment I want my child to grow up in.<br><br>2. You are right, I am in fact speculating why PM Lee cried when he mentioned 1968 NDP. I am not in his shoes or the worm in his stomach, I couldn't possibly know what's in his mind.<br><br>3. I have not spoken to PM Lee yet and I will ask him if I have the chance to. On what basis? From the words he mentioned. He said that nobody in that NDP turn away or ran away from the show even when there was a heavy downpour. The next natural extension is, how many of us will run away from Singapore when there is bad trouble in Singapore? To me, this is the best analogy or metaphor to his sentence.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</blockquote></div>

And I wonder, what could be the reasons Singaporeans emigrate? In a spur of the moment, I did think of emigrating when I felt the government's upgrading policy was divisive. If wanting a government that listens to the people and not implementing a policy that is divisive, makes me a spoilt brat like KTM said, then so be it. However, the deeper question is why do we think of emigration? The answer is actually very simple: Because we can.<br><br>With the technological advances of recent times, travelling to other countries have been made easier and affordable. In 24 hours, you practically can reach any major country of your choice. This makes physcially uprooting to another place possible and plausible now. Being able to converse in English also makes moving to another English speaking country convenient. This is greatly thanks to Singapore's education system where English language is the emphasis. If you are able to converse in Chinese, your choices would have widened further.<br><br>Globalisation has also made the world seemed a lot smaller. Look around us, we are surrounded by Starbucks, McDonalds, KFC, Zara, Mango, Gucci, Channel, Agnes. b, Louis Vuitton, Apple, HP etc. Many other countries we go to now, we can find the above same brands, which helps to make the foreign land seemed a little less foreign. Living in an urban city like Singapore, make us quite capable of adapting to other foreign cities. With the advent of Internet, it makes connecting back home through e-mails, instant messaging, video chatting, VoIP a cinch. The communication channels available now is mind-boggling. Even before Internet, with the proliferation of movies and tv shows, many of us can already recognise Tokyo tower, Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Empire State builing, New York's yellow cabs etc even if we've not physically been there. And similarly, with Internet, finding more information before moving to a foreign land is now at your finger-tips.<br><br>With globalisation, comes opportunities too. Many are able to get better paying jobs in overseas postings and placements. This may be opportunities available because you went to look for it yourself or your MNC company offered. With globalisation, comes competitions too. During the last economic downturn, many factories reloated to countries like China where labour is cheaper. If your employer offers you a choice of retrenchment or continued employment but in another country, what would be your choice?<br><br>The growing affluence of Singapore has contributed much to the emigration phenomenon too. During long weekends or school holidays, you would see a packed airport, full-flights etc. Singaporeans are a well-travelled lot. That is only the short-term group. These group did not emigrate but these escapades have opened their eyes to the foreign cultures and world which definitely have left an indelible mark in their minds.<br><br>With growing affluence, many families have also been able to send their children overseas for studies. The children may be sent to study in foreign coutries because they can't get a seat in the limited placings of local tertiary institutions or the parents believe that their children can get better tertiary education in America or Australia. When you have our children studying and living in a foreign land for years and maybe spending the best time of their lives while being there, where do you think they may hope to emigrate in future?<br><br>To address the brain-drain problem, Singapore has sought to attract and welcome foreign talents. While working here, they may find someone they love, get married and even starting a family here. Of course, the government would hope that these family nucleus would choose to stay rooted locally, but one partner being a non-Singaporean, there is an equal chance that the non-Singaporean spouse would want to return to their homeland, bringing their whole family with them. Importing foreign talents is not a zero-sum game.<br><br>I believe it is also very common for people to move from one place to another in modern times. In bigger countries, the only difference is that, they move from one state to another. Singapore is only an island, if we move, we drop into the sea already!<br><br>I agree with KTM. If the people chooses to emigrate, instead of labelling them as quitters, the government should be gracious about it and wish the people all the best, sincerely. Do not forget, our forefathers "quitted" China to come to Singapore. There can be many reasons why anyone chooses to emigrate. There is no right or wrong. It just is. This is greatly due to the world getting smaller and closer thus making more choices and opportunities available. The global population is emigrating more than ever as a whole. This phenomenon is not uniquely Singapore. How does it help when the government labels Singaporeans who emigrated as quitters? Does that make them change their mind of emigrating? No. Does that make them want to come back to Singapore more? No. On the contrary, it may even push these people further away. So what for? There is no point in calling them quitters.<br><br>This actually reminds me of the many Chinese serials where the father will yell at the son,"Ã„Ã£Ã“Ã�ÂµÂ¨Ã�Â¿Ã—ÃŸÂ³Ã¶Ã•Ã¢Â¸Ã¶ÃƒÃ…Â£Â¬ Ã“Ã€Ã”Â¶Â²Â»Ã’ÂªÃ”Ã™Â»Ã˜Ã€Â´ (Don't you ever come back, if you dare walk out of this door)!"<br><br>Do you ever see the son walk back? No, right? The son will instead become more determined and walk out of the door.<br><br>The government would be too myopic to think that by labelling the emigrated people as quitters would solve the brain-drain problem. Do you think consumers would simply buy a product because you shouted,"You are a quitter if you don't buy my product!"? Instead, you get more people buying your product when it is better, has more features and provide great pre-post sales service.<br><br>To retain the people, make Singapore a more attractive place to live in. This can be achieved by providing better opportunities to our own people than what other foreign countries can provide. Be tolerant of a more diverse culture and opinions. Let the citizens be real stakeholders. Let our views be heard and seriously considered. I don't think the government wants its citizens who are only attracted to stay because of HDB upgrading and progress package. I don't think this is the Singapore the government wants. Many of us blog, some passionately, some vehemently. Be tolerant of alternative views and opinions of dissent.<br><br>We blog, because we care. Happy 41st birthday, Singapore!</blockquote></div>

Water extraction and consumption<br><br>There are water intakes using surface, ground- and sea water (figure 3.10) (Reviews...). Surface water is extracted for water supply of Tallinn and Narva. Tallinn water supply system includes Pirita and JÃ¤gala river basins and small part of PÃ¤rnu river basin. Small extent of surface water is used also for fish rearing. The largest fish farm in PÃ¤rispea is using sea water. Its constant annual use was ca 70 million m3. In 1999 the farm did not operate (table 3.1).<br><br>Figure 3.10. Annual water extraction in million cubic meters per year, except cooling water of power stations, mining water and sea water.<br><br>Very large amount of surface water is used as cooling water in power stations of Narva (figure 3.11). Water extraction has decreased due to the decrease of electricity production and saving of water (influence of the charge for special use of water). Narva River has relatively much water compared to consumption (figure 3.12).<br>Water is also used for hydro-transport of ash. As precipitation exceed evaporation, discharges of excess water from ash fields had to be done for many years, depending on water amount of the year. Alkalinity of water from the fields is extremely high. Several efforts have been made to reduce the amount of water and its alkalinity. In 1999 treatment plant was built for the changing of reaction of excess water discharged from the Baltic Power Station to Narva Reservoir.<br><br>Figure 3.11. Water extraction by power plants (cooling water).<br>Figure 3.12. Comparison of the extracted cooling water with the runoff of Narva River.<br><br>Groundwater extraction for consumption has decreased due to saving of water and economical decline (figure 3.13, where groundwater consumption does not include water extracted from private wells. Mining water includes only the water of oil shale mines of East-Viru County). High price of water service has essentially influenced to use less water. Its result is the increase of water level of best protected and therefore most valuable Cambrian-Vendian aquifer in the regions of most intensive use - Tallinn, Kohtla-JÃ¤rve, JÃµhvi etc. Rise of the groundwater level has been noticed also in other aquifers (Groundwater..., 1999).<br><br>Figure 3.13. Groundwater extraction, million cubic meters per year.<br><br>Large amount of groundwater is pumped out for drainage of mines and quarries. Nearly 96% of the whole mining water is pumped in Northeast Estonia from Ordovician aquifer. In mining region the pumping of mining water has caused many inconveniences for local people. The amount of mining water depends on the precipitation and the extent of mining area. As several mines have been closed in recent years, some decrease of mining water can be expected.<br><br>Groundwater is pumped from Quaternary (Q), Devonian (D), Silurian (S), Ordovician (O), Ordovician-Cambrian (O-Cm) and Cambrian-Vendian (Cm-V) aquifers. Mining water is originating mainly from Ordovician aquifer (figure 3.14).<br><br>Only 5.9 mill. m3 or 2.6% of mining water in East-Viru County was used in 1999.<br><br>Figure 3.14. Groundwater extraction from aquifers in 1999:<br>A Groundwater extraction except mining water, B Mining water extraction.<br><br>Water consumption started to decrease in the beginning of 1990s, when many industries stopped in new economic conditions (table 3.1 and figure 3.15). Restrictions and orders in water protection were replaced with economic interest: companies are interested in reduction of expenses on water supply and apply saving of water, change technology towards less water consumption. People reacted to sharp increase of the water price with reduction of the use of water. In last 6-7 years many water meters have been installed in apartments, which gives sense to the saving of water at home. To save water, aged sanitary equipment and pipes inside the buildings are replaced. In agricultural regions the number of farms and inhabitants of multi-storey houses has decreased. Until the beginning of 1990s the use of water by inhabitants of rural settlements was also considered agricultural use of water. Later it was separated into domestic use.</span></strong></blockquote></div>

Load in the catchment of Lake Peipsi has essentially decreased in recent years due to the completion of Tartu wastewater treatment plant (figure 3.22).<br><br>Larger towns, which discharge their wastewater directly into the Gulf of Finland, are Kohtla-JÃ¤rve and Tallinn (figure 3.23). The population of Kohtla-JÃ¤rve is smaller than that of Tallinn, but its pollution has much greater impact. Renovation of treatment plant is in progress there. Wastewater treatment plant of Tallinn has achieved excellent results. Towns with lower pollution load in the catchment of the Gulf of Finland are Paldiski, Loksa and SillamÃ¤e. The greatest pollution source of the Gulf of Riga is PÃ¤rnu, which treatment plant has been renovated during several years. Haapsalu, KÃ¤rdla, Kuressaare etc. discharge their wastewater directly into the Belt Sea.<br><br>Figure 3.22. Pollution load from point sources according to BOD7 by catchments in 1999.<br>Figure 3.23. Pollution load according to BOD7 directly into the sea in 1999.<br><br>Figure 3.24 shows the treatment level of water needing treatment. The amount of wastewater has decreased throughout the years due to the decrease of water consumption. Very high percentage of mechanical treatment is caused by mining water, which is treated in large sedimentation basins. High value of biological-chemical treatment in 1992 is formed by water treated in the wastewater treatment plant of Tallinn, where coagulant was used, but no aeration tanks. In 1993-1995 aeration tanks were constructed and later improved. Therefore the efficiency of treatment has increased. At the same time there are several biological treatment plants, which efficiency is low and which need renovation. Also the total number of biological treatment plants is constantly decreasing. When 10 years ago ca 1080 treatment plants operated, then after the splitting of large collective farms into small units the number of cattle decreased as well as number of people in central settlements and several small treatment plants in rural regions were stopped.<br><br>Figure 3.24. Wastewater treatment, million m3 /year.<br><br>Decrease of pollution load from larger towns is caused by their better possibilities to construct and renew their treatment plants (figure 3.25). Kohtla-JÃ¤rve treatment plant was planned as regional, i.e. also wastewater of KiviÃµli, PÃ¼ssi and from the middle of 1999 also JÃµhvi wastewater is led there. But renovation of the treatment plant is not finished. The II stage of wastewater treatment plant of Tallinn was completed in 1997. Saku, Tabasalu, Saue etc. have joined the sewerage of Tallinn. Completion of Tartu wastewater treatment plant and enlargement of sewerage in 1998 have given good results. Narva treatment plant is gradually renewed.<br><br>Figure 3.25. Pollution load of larger towns, BOD7 , t/y<br><br>Also several smaller towns have achieved good results on wastewater treatment (Haapsalu, Tapa, PÃ¤rnu, Paide, PÃµlva, TÃ¼ri etc.). At the same time, in smaller settlements financing of the construction of treatment plants from their own budget is rather difficult due to small number of population (figure 3.26).<br><br>Figure 3.26.

Those problems will be discussed at the conference by Mr. Ain LÃ¤Ã¤ne of the Estonian Water Association and Mr. Enn Lenk of the Estonian Water Enterprises Association<br><br>Ms. Eva Kraav, Adviser on Environmental Economics of the Ministry of the Environment, will make a presentation concerning the price of water in Estonia as compared with the other European Union candidate states and the possibilities for future developments regarding this issue.<br><br>According to Ms. Kraav, the price of water in Estonia is among the highest of all EU candidate countries. "In 2000, the price of drinking water and sewage in Estonia was 14.7 Estonian kroon (equivalent to nearly 1 EUR). This was only exceeded by the corresponding number of Hungary where the price of water in 2000 was 16.4. Water price will undoubtedly continue increase in the future. In the developed European countries, the price of water in 1990 exceeded the Estonian number at least threefold. Water price in Estonia will continue changing towards such values," said Ms. Kraav.<br><br>For meeting the requirements specified by the water directives of the European Union, Estonia will need to spend 9200 Estonian kroon per inhabitant. Lithuania plans to meet those requirements by spending 2300 kroon per inhabitant, Poland - by 4400 and Hungary by 8300 kroon, Latvia estimates the need at up to 13,000 kroon per inhabitant.<br><br>Issues to be discussed at the conference will also include the role and possibilities of local governments at the development of water management in Estonia, the modern drinking water purification technologies, and the preservation of habitats of threatened fish species in the flowing water bodies.<br><br>The winner of the Oras Water Saving Prize of 2003, for marking achievements in the area of saving and rational use of water, will be announced at the Water Day Conference.<br><br>At the Water Day, companies active in the area of water management will also introduce themselves.<br><br>The conference "Estonian Water Day 2003" will be dedicated to the Global Freshwater Year.

It is about the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined. Estonia has a long, shallow coastline (1,393 kilometers) along the Baltic Sea, with 1,520 islands dotting the shore. The two largest islands are Saaremaa (literally, island land), at 2,673 square kilometers, and Hiiumaa, at 989 square kilometers. The two islands are favorite Estonian vacation spots. The country's highest point, Suur MunamÃ¤gi (Egg Mountain), is in the hilly southeast and reaches 318 meters above sea level. Estonia is covered by about 18000 kmÂ² of forest. Arable land amounts to about 9260 kmÂ². Meadows cover about 2520 kmÂ², and pastureland covers about 1810 kmÂ². There are more than 1,400 natural and artificial lakes in Estonia. The largest of them, Lake Peipsi (3,555 kmÂ²), forms much of the border between Estonia and Russia. Located in central Estonia, VÃµrtsjÃ¤rv is the second-largest lake (270 kmÂ²). The Narva and EmajÃµgi are among the most important of the country's many rivers.<br><br>Estonia has a temperate climate, with four seasons of near-equal length. Average temperatures range from 16.3 Â°C on the Baltic islands to 17.1 Â°C inland in July, the warmest month, and from -3.5 Â°C on the Baltic islands to -7.6 Â°C inland in February, the coldest month. Precipitation averages 568 millimeters per year and is heaviest in late summer.<br><br>Estonia's land border with Latvia runs 267 kilometers; the Russian border runs 290 kilometers. From 1920 to 1945, Estonia's border with Russia, set by the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty, extended beyond the Narva River in the northeast and beyond the town of Pechory (Petseri) in the southeast. This territory, amounting to some 2,300 square kilometers, was incorporated into Russia by Stalin at the end of World War II. Estonia is now disputing that territorial loss.<br><br>Environmental issues<br>One of the most burdensome legacies of the Soviet era is widespread environmental pollution. The worst offender in this regard was the Soviet army. Across military installations covering more than 800 kmÂ² of Estonian territory, the army dumped hundreds of thousands of tons of jet fuel into the ground, improperly disposed of toxic chemicals, and discarded outdated explosives and weapons in coastal and inland waters. In the 1990s, during the army's withdrawal from Estonia, extensive damage was done to discarded buildings and equipment. In October 1993, the Estonian Ministry of Environment issued a preliminary report summing up part of the degradation it had surveyed thus far. The report described the worst damage as having been done to Estonia's topsoil and underground water supply by the systematic dumping of jet fuel at six Soviet army air bases. At the air base near Tapa, site of the worst damage, officials estimated that six square kilometers of land were covered by a layer of fuel; 11 square kilometers of underground water were said to be contaminated. The water in the surrounding area was undrinkable. With Danish help, Estonian crews began cleaning up the site, although they estimated the likely cost to be as much as EKR4 million. The Ministry of Environment assigned a monetary cost of more than EKR10 billion to the damage to the country's topsoil and water supply. However, the ministry was able to allocate only EKR5 million in 1993 for cleanup operations.<br><br>In a 1992 government report to the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, Estonia detailed other major environmental concerns. For instance, for several consecutive years Estonia had led the world in the production of sulfur dioxide per capita. Nearly 75 % of Estonia's air pollution was reported to come from two oil shale-based thermal power stations operating near Narva. The mining of oil shale in northeastern Estonia also left gigantic mounds of limestone dotting the region. Near the town of SillamÃ¤e, site of a former uranium enrichment plant, about 1,200 tons of uranium and about 750 tons of thorium had been dumped into the Gulf of Finland. This was said to have caused severe health problems among area residents. In the coastal town of Paldiski, the removal of waste left by Soviet army nuclear reactors was also a major concern. The combined cost of environmental cleanup at both towns was put at more than EKR3.5 billion.<br><br>Natural hazards: flooding occurs frequently in the spring<br><br>Environment - current issues: air heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide from oil-shale burning power plants in northeast; contamination of soil and groundwater with petroleum products, chemicals at former Soviet military bases; Estonia has more than 1,400 natural and artificial lakes, the smaller of which in agricultural areas are heavily affected by organic waste; coastal sea water is polluted in many locations. The HBV hydrology transport model has been used to analyze water pollution issues in Estonia's rivers and in the Baltic Sea<br><br>Environment - international agreements:<br>party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ship Pollution, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands<br>signed, but not ratified: Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol</span></strong></div>

Therefore, a very strong effort is needed to change the governing fossil dominated situation in the energy sector, switching from oil shale to renewables as primary energy source. There are several choices available for this conversion but recently hydropower has proved to be one of the most successful options on commercial basis.<br>Hydropower has been a forgotten thing in Estonia for almost 30 years, starting from the 60's and up to the regaining of national independence in the beginning of 90's. In the 60's, the bulk of small hydropower stations that had survived the destructive powers of the Second World War, were closed as not corresponding to the central energy supply doctrine of a totalitarian regime. Only the 2 Â–3 smallest were left to supply local space heat. After the economic upheaval of the early 90's, some enthusiasts started to refurbish small existing hydropower stations that were neglected for a long time and in a deep disrepair.<br>A New Start for Small Hydro<br>Today, the situation is radically changed due to the following circumstances which have launched a genuine boom in commercial hydropower application in Estonia:<br>a) The new Energy Law, which was passed in the Parliament in 1997, opened new opportunities for the use of renewable energy. It obliges the big energy monopoly Eesti Energia, covering practically all the electricity production and distribution in Estonia, to buy electric energy from small renewable energy based electricity producers at the cost of 90% of the electricity price for household consumers.<br>b) The oil shale based electricity price has increased steadily during the recent years, equalling at the moment to 0.06 EUR/kWh and in April 2002, it will increase to 0.07 EUR/kWh. The renewable energy plants receive 90% of this price for power sold to the grid.<br>c) Eesti Energia has launched a Green Energy Programme in co-operation with Estonian Fund for Nature, attracting various firms to promote renewable energy applications through buying the renewables based energy at a higher price with the bulk of the profit going to the Estonian Fund for Nature to support environmental projects.<br><br>Many Small Sites<br>The number of rivers and creeks in Estonia is large, more than 700, but the bulk of these are short and with a scanty volume of water flow. As Estonia is rather flat, the tilt of rivers is small and therefore the head for waterpower is usually 2 Â– 6 m. The technical potential of hydropower does not exceed 30 MW in Estonia. The number of existing hydropower stations in disrepair but considered to pay off the refurbishing, is about 25, with the total rated output power of some 6 MW. The number of old watermills in ruins is big as well, being around 700 with more than 500 turbines installed. About 200 of these are more or less suitable for refurbishing. In addition, there are  100 water dams that can be provided with turbines. The number of potential brand new hydropower stations is about 20. The refurbishing of old hydropower stations would make the restoration of the dammed waterbodies for their esthetical and recreational values economically viable as well.<br><br>Successful Projects<br>A small stock company Generaator Ltd was the first to start refurbishing old hydropower stations, having by now under its belt already stations in Saesaare (180 kW), Leevaku (60 kW) and Kotka (150 kW).<br>In 1997, Estonian Water Power Ltd in co-operation with Nordic Investment Bank and specialists from the company DriveTech International AB made an inventory list of 20 old hydropower stations that can be refurbished on commercial bases with the bank loan pay back period within 5 Â– 8 years. The evaluation for finding the most suitable turbines for the refurbished power stations gave the preference to the fully automated remote controlled propeller type compact turbines from the Finnish company Waterpumps WP OY. The peculiarity of these turbines is that the turbine and the generator are mounted on the same shaft with no need for a gearbox, closed into an underwater hermetic capsule and lowered into the water channel. This results in environmentally improved installation, reduced investment cost and improved efficiency, avoiding the need for a large building for the station.<br><br>The first pilot project for using contemporary high technology while refurbishing hydropower stations, was Kamari station (water head H = 5.1 m, water flow Q = 5 m3/sec, output power of 200 kW) in 1999. The output voltage of the generator is 400 V and the generator is linked to the 15 kV grid through a transformer. The undertaking was initiated and conducted by Estonian Water Power Ltd with co-operation of Nordic Investment Bank and Finnish Ministry of Environment. The annual energy production of this station is going to be within the range of 1.5 Â– 1.7 GWh and the profit level for the year 2000 was 64 000 EUR. The construction work took one year plus one year for preparatory works. The overall refurbishing cost of Kamari was 204 500 EUR and the bank loan from the Nordic Investment Bank was 179 000 EUR at the interest of 8% and with 8 years payback-period. The annual maintenance cost of the station would be about 3200 EUR. The photos on this page show the Kamari power station in full operation.<br><br>Following Kamari, the next refurbished hydropower stations have been Tudulinna (150 kW) and Joaveski (300 kW). The refurbishing process is under way for Koseveski (40 kW), Torva (80 kW) and Linnamae (1.1 MW) hydropower stations with the latter belonging to Eesti Energia. The current situation is the refurbishing process is characterised by 4 power stations with restored hydro aggregates and 3 power stations with a new fully automated remote controlled equipment from the company Waterpumps WO OY. The average cost of hydropower aggregates has been in the range of 900 - 1300 EUR/kW.<br><br>Smallest Sites Needs Pilot Project<br>Concerning watermills, the situation is more complicated as the cost of control system is too high compared with the turbine - generator system and therefore it is needed to either work out simplified control systems or organise a serial production of turbines, bearing in mind the high number of micropower stations. A pilot project in this power range would be Torva project with two turbines, both having 40 kW output power.<br><br>Viable and Profitable<br>The practical experience shows that the refurbishing of existing hydropower stations in Estonia is viable and profitable. The pay back period remains within the limits of 5 Â– 8 years. Often the refurbishing requires to raise the water level of dammed water bodies and therefore it is needed to carry out environment impact evaluation prior to the project start up. Very important is to provide all the refurbished power station with the fish ladders. An important asset of the refurbishing process of existing hydropower stations in Estonia is that it contributes at the same time to the restoration of the beautiful Estonian agricultural landscape, broadens the recreational area and serves to make the environment more healthy and picturesque.<br>Within the next five years all old hydropower stations in disrepair but viable concerning refurbishing could be refurbished.<br><br>Name and type of project Hydropower in Estonia, the Case of Kamari Small Hydropower Station<br>Starting year 1999<br>Overall costs of the project 204,500 EUR, 1023 EUR/kW for the 200 kW installed capacity<br>Energy amount saved 1,600,000 kWh/year<br>New local jobs 1<br>Number of similar projects 5 more realised in Estonia, many more in preparation</div>

Professor Chutney Chua, Lecturer of Sociology at the national University of Singapore comments.<br><br>"What we have here is a situation unique to Singapore," says Prof. Chua. <strong>"It shows that Singaporeans do not mind living in their country - as long as they are considered foreign migrants rather than part of the local populace."</strong><br>When asked what could have caused such a phenomenon, Prof. Chua says that it is a complex and multi-faceted issue, but suggests several main factors that revolve around foreigners automatically achieving "talented" status (rather than having to sit for GEP selection or Streaming Exams) which automatically grants them a priviledged position with regards to jobs, service, the right to protest, sex, and blonde hair.<br><br>While documented accounts of such endeavours are rare, Prof. Chua says that the efforts are most probably futile, as authentic Singaporeans are readily identified by certain traits which has been thought to result from either genetics, or the water supply at KK hospital.<br><br>"However, since I only achieved my post as lecturer after I re-migrated to Singapore from China, having migrated there from Singapore, I can see where they're coming from," Prof. Chua concludes</blockquote></div>
