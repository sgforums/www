The needs of all Australians have to be met in this area".<br><br>Researcher Professor Gary Slade said the report's results were hard proof fluoridation improved teeth for life.<br><br>"These results provide the first evidence within the Australian population that drinking fluoridated water during childhood translates into significantly better dental health in adulthood," Prof Slade said.</blockquote><img src="http://mud.mm-a6.yimg.com/image/3438124735"></div>

There are laws protecting the rights of speech balanced with the rights of all as equals.<br><br>At least they dare state that they are one openly in Australia , just like Pauline Hanson . Bad politically but good in a way because I know that I don't want to be voting for her.<br><br>Racism exists everywhere ,even in Singapore. The views are more hidden through jokes, like the poor taste of a video about asking for pork , and degradatory remarks. It is almost underground by standards .<br><br>With the openess in Australia , they are well aware of the problems that float upwards in the open .  The federal government and state government policies get criticised openly in every way. Things are improved or may just stay stagnant but people have the right of speech . Australia has the same concept with the american version of freedom of speech - don't let it go underground . Once underground, you cannot see the problems that it brings.<br><br>Hence they have policies against openly stated issues of potential racism which state that there can be no discrimination against you in employment , they cannot demand that you must be chinese/caucasian/indian/malay etc only to procure a job unless the reason ( and it must be a damn good one)  is cleared with Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner .<br><br></div>
