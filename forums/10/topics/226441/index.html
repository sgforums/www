            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.<br><br>First thing, I've got the education departments of all Australian states except NSW as my clients.  I do have job satisfaction data on schools across these states, and my data shows that while teachers in some schools do report low satisfaction, it's due to factors in specific schools, not the education system overall.<br><br>Also, I do know quite a few teachers who have gone overseas to teach.  Most often, they've ended up in the Middle East, where private schools offer them five times their government salary.  I dare say that if a Singaporean government employee was offered $300,000 to do his $60,000 job, he'd take off too.<br><br>Second, the tax article in the Australian refers to a figure that's nearly doubled from 4.8%, referring to 9.6% of the Australian population - hardly a majority by any measure.  Also, you may not know this, but over the years the tax brackets have actually gotten wider, which means that you have to earn more to move into the next bracket.<br><br>What does this add up to?  There are now more and more people getting into that top tax bracket, which itself is higher than it used to be.  Is that really bad news?<br><br>What's it mean in real terms?  In the past week I've spent coming to four grand on Christmas presents, with more to come over the next few days, but I'm not feeling any pinch whatsoever.  Hell, about half that amount was paid by the Tax Office when I got my tax returns.</div>

Why you care?<br><br>All government departments have to justify their spending to the Department of Finance and Administration. Defence is an essential item for the country - why not? If I am not wrong, all departments have to go through justification of spending cash and more than 100k , there is the Murray Motion which lets senators from opposition parties question their spending. Most spending is out on open books except for classified information like Defence.<br><br>At least one thing for sure - their pay is also regulated and has to go through Parliament. They can't give themselves a 1 million dollar salary per year . They get voted out pronto.</div>

One who was keen to go back and one who was not.<br><br>The keen Singaporean said that Singapore is where her family is , and she doesn't really fancy australian lifestyle . She did point out the bad things about Australia i.e. the drugs , the porno shops etc. However she did appreciate the good things about Australia and acknowledge there were alot of opportunities present.<br><br>Now the Singaporean who was not keen to go back , tried applying for Permanent residency because she was rattling about how bad Singapore was. She failed to obtain it. She had to pack up and leave by the expiry date on her visa. So suddenly, Australia became damn bad ....got the drugs ...got the porno ....got racism ...got this got that. Why? Because she just couldn't open the door in. So she went around telling every new Singaporean student she got to know in university how bad it was.<br><br>The TS reminds me of the second Singaporean.

I can say something and be listened to because I lived in the 3 main cities of Australia and one being the CAPITAL. I know Australia is not perfect. Illicit drugs pertain mostly to Marijuana . Even Bill Clinton tried it when he was young. I never touch the stuff but I know alot of my colleagues did in their younger days. They were just being young and experimenting with things they don't understand but they came out as responsible adults with families.<br><br>You may think as with all rednecks that your opinion is correct . Yes I nearly got burgled but I had neighbours looking out for me. A snatch thief came and tried to grab my handback and a few guys went after him to catch him . I nearly got mugged but the homeless guy helped me by scaring the kids away. Crime happens everywhere . No country can be free of crime but at least I know if I am in trouble, there is always someone to help me even tho they might not be the police.<br><br>Don't talk so much . How about the poor china woman in Singapore who got stabbed a few times by a crazed man. Her stabbing was filmed with a phone while the person filming it was just standing by and doing nothing or even using that same phone to call the police. And better still - that person uploaded it to YouTube.
