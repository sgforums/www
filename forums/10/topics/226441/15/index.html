Let us rationally analyse the "quitter" problem from the perspectives of different age groups.Our educational curriculum deprives us of a proper childhood from a tender age.<br>Judging from the proportion of students wearing spectacles here, it is not difficult to tell they have been overexposed to textbooks. Parents who cannot bear to see their kids live with the need for regimental "mugging" may consider migration.<br><br>On the next level, a hopeful graduate, fresh from his victory in the educational system, may be in for a rude shock when he discovers that the job market Â— with its plentiful supply of foreign talent Â— is not prepared to pay him enough for a decent lifestyle.<br><br>It may be worth mentioning that our definition of the words "foreign talent" has changed from its initial meaning of highly-paid expatriates and cheaper IT staff to include the foreign worker who clears the dustbin. Although these foreigners may be needed to reduce the overall costs of operations in Singapore, have we gone too far in welcoming them by being reluctant to control their impact on local rice bowls?<br><br>When setting up a family, most couples will learn that the house they buy will probably cost them a lifelong mortgage.When a Singaporean reaches 40 years old, he should realise that his shelf life in the workforce is only about 10 years, upon discovering that he is considered "obsolete" at that age Â— even after having acquired a Masters' degree at 30.The middle-aged professionals, when they are retrenched, will have to decide whether to "upgrade" themselves Â— taking up menial jobs despite their immense experience in white-collared posts Â— or to throw their savings into entrepreneurship, for which the chances of success are slim.Unemployment fell to a low of 2.5 per cent last quarter.<br><br>However, wages have yet to recover to the level they were at in the previous cycle. In other words, jobs were created but at lower value added as a whole.The private sector has been asked not to discriminate based on age when hiring, yet public organisations continue to recruit based on age limits.Older folks in their "golden years" are also not spared. They are expected to slog for their livelihoods to a ripe old age, while their peers elsewhere happily rely on welfare and healthcare provided free of charge by their governments.<br><br>The biggest issue may be the refusal to acknowledge that the problems exist Â— let alone working on solving them. Given such an environment, is it any wonder that some Singaporeans choose to migrate? As I hear someone saying in a coffeeshop say: "Stayers are people who do not have the means to quit!"IN AUSTRALIA, citizens and Permanent Residents are given priority over foreigners where employment is concerned. Someone wanting to hire a foreigner has to prove that such talent is not available locally.<br><br>It is the foreigner's special skill, and not the prospect of paying him a low wage, that determines whether or not he gets the job.If Singaporeans feel that they are not given priority over foreign talent because they are more expensive, would it not be natural for them to seek greener pastures elsewhere? Many qualified Singaporeans have given up good jobs here and moved to countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States in their families because they think these countries can offer a better quality of life.<br><br>If a poor uneducated cleaner or security guard has the financial means and the qualifications, would he also not look for better opportunities in other countries? In the 1940s and '50s, our forebears left their homes and came here to seek a better life. Likewise, Singaporeans may choose to emigrate to escape the ratrace and tough competition for jobs.</span> </strong></a></div>

Other destinations mentioned included the United States (8 per cent), Malaysia (7 per cent), China (6 per cent), and Canada (4 per cent).<br><br>The ACNielsen survey reflects other local polls showing about one in five Singaporeans has considered emigrating, citing factors such as high living costs and a stressful education system for their children.<br><br>The surveys were taken before Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong provoked a rare public outcry in Singapore with a National Day speech describing people who leave the country when the chips are down as "quitters".<br><br>Although the tiny republic shot from being a tropical backwater to one of Asia's wealthiest economies in three decades, it has not won undying loyalty from the younger generation.<br><br>Instead, economic success has produced a crop of "fair weather Singaporeans" who are not willing to fight for their country, Mr Goh said.<br><br>"Fair weather Singaporeans will run away whenever the country runs into stormy weather. I call them quitters."<br><br>Among a slew of letters to local newspapers, Lim Wee Liang wrote that Singaporeans who find the Government "does not listen to feedback, may seek a place where they will be heard - in another country".<br><br>AFP </a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And of course, if I should post more relevantly:<br><br>Since lionnoisy says his mission is to inform the potential migrants on the dangers of Australia, I believe the real question is not the downsides of Down Under but rather the downsides of the Little Red Dot.<br><br>The truth and the fact is, as things are, Singaporeans still, and are leaving our nation for Australia, and despite all of Australia's problems they are more then willing to go there no matter how many posts lionnoisy posts warning them to save water and how Singapore has water.<br><br>In here is the fatal flaw of lionnioisy's crusade: he thinks people leave Singapore because Australia is some dreamland- in fact the majority of the migrant Singaporean- the well-informed, educated person is more then aware of the problems of Austrlia, and certainly understand the media they read more then some guy who claims he CMI in PSLE English (refer to Military Nuts Body Armour thread).<br><br>The fact is, we are losing people to Australia not because Australia has become this mythical land of dreams that has tricked and beguilled Singaporeans, but simply because it provides, despite it's problems, many of the things that our system simply does not provide now.<br><br>Things that our system has considered not "bread and butter" but that apparently many are more then willing to take very pratical steps to change their lives to attain.<br><br>What are those things? Just ask the person who has decided to migrate (and it's not just to Australia). They are willing to face the problems of another nation, and live the non-sheltered life of the Singaporean.<br><br>The question is why.<br><br>If it was because they saw Australia (in this case) as a land of their only hope (as lionnioisy claims) then they would be sorely dissapointed. But this has not only not happened, we do not even hear of it from the Singaporeans who have gone there. Instead they talk about missing things about Singapore, but rarely do you (if at all) hear them bleed negativity about their life in their new home.<br><br>So apparently all the drugs-in-churches, drought and what have you not, no matter how scary lionnioisy tries to make them... simply do not affect the majority of Singaporeans living there. It is as ridiculus about some Yank on the other side of the world starting a whole thread about we having caning and how it makes Singapore unlivable and then keeps harping on it when by all respects we live with it more or less.<br><br>At the end of the day, the purpose of this "downsides of Down Under", as lionniosy has claimed fails to justify its own existence. He said he was a thread to inform those to the dangers of Australia as if it was some truth nobody knows when the average migrant Singaporean has already long put it into his equations when deciding if to move or not.<br><br>The real question is: what makes them move and what will keep them here if we don't want them to move.<br><br>Downsides of Down Under won't help, it makes sense to lionnoisy because in his this system he cannot comprehend of any other system other then ours and indeed is so disturbed that some might leave it that he thinks that they have to be making some mistake based on a lack of information. You can see this mindset in his other threads when he simply can't comprehend anything other then the way Singapore run things.<br><br>Hence he thinks that the greatest deterrance to migration (and hence challanging his beloved system of perfection) is to highlight the downsides of Australia (the greatest threat of all) which are the things that terrify him, but he has forgotten that our forefathers, the people who built his beloved Singapore and made the system he beloved so much and cannot live without are prehaps the least like him (a person who will sit back and try to think the system is perfect) and the most like the people he is trying to make "think again".<br><br>The migrant Singaporean thinks totally differently from him, and indeed I think if Singapore needs to survive lionnoisy is exactly the kind of person Singaporeans cannot be like. The person who looks to the outside to blame and attack for his own problems while refusing to self-introspect or change to ensure his own improvement and survival. The forefathers who built Singapore were nothing like lionnoisy.<br><br>So if lionnoisy were truly interested in trying to reverse the brain brain caused by migration (and not only to Australia), the real productive, and rational thing to do is to look to the root of the issue- and that is not that Australia has managed to sell itself as a dreamland but that some factors within Singapore is making us lose our own population to another country that has more problems (in some areas) then us.<br><br>Thinking that he can "scare" or "warn" people into not seeing Australia as an option not only fails to work, it misses entirely to root of the problem, trys to assume an unreality that the migrants are giving up Singapore because they are stupid, and allows the wound that is affecting us to fester while blaming others for it.<br><br>Not to mention he even runs the risk of offending other nations and sedition and what have you not for it.<br><br>If we want to be fit to pick the Downsides of Down Under, we must first discover and understand what makes Singaporeans want to leave... before we do that we have no right to call those who leave deluded white-suckups or what have you not, not any more then some of the more fanatical people who have left seek the chance to put Singapore down at every turn, even at the expense of its people.</div>

In the past two years alone, at least 8 of my friends and about 11 acquaintances have initiated some form of leaving. In the past, it began with the acquisition of PR papers. Nowadays, young couples give birth abroad usually when on student pass or employment permit, wait 12 years and they're ready. Others rely on work and the employment permit to take the next big step.<br><br>I believe that in the 80s, the dominant demographic that left Singapore were the retirees or the well established in career types. Those who took their CPF, sold their HDB flats and moved mostly to Australia. When they left, they usually took their families, which means their children, with them. Then, the cost of leaving was probably higher, the family unit had to move together. Then, physical distance was a reality, the costs of communication was high, to leave meant an actual leaving. A severance.<br><br>Nowadays, the demographic is slowly but surely changing. Increasingly, people leave at the prime of their lives or when they are at the cusp of their prime. when this demographic leaves, the profile is different. They usually do not move their entire family, in this case, their parents, or loved ones, at least in the initial phases. When this younger demographic leave, the context, in all senses of the word, is more dynamic. There is an underlying uncertainty, no doubt sparked by the dominant association in Singapore that leaving is bad. Why do you want to leave Heaven? But even as this younger demographic leaves, they leave with greater connections back with Singapore. Communication across distance is cheap and instantaneous, getting news is a breeze, air travel is relatively much cheaper.<br><br>In a strictly practical sense then, the cost of leaving in Singapore is lower.<br><br>"For the Singapore youth, from school to professional, there is a rite of passage. First Zouk, than Velvet. Its fairly routine lor. But I was in NYC once. I stopped at 14th St Union Square station and saw this two guys setting up a DJ deck right in the station walkway. Then they started to spin and sell their CDs. The music booming in underground, youngsters starting to groove spontaneously. It was awesome. When I came back, Velvet not so shiok anymore. Dunno why leh. Just drink."<br><br>There has to be a pre-step. A cognitive step. An emotional taking of leave before someone leaves physically; like tired love-making before the break-up. How this mental state is triggered is manifold. It could be worry for a child's future. It could be a quest for a more peaceful existence. It could be a desire for space in all the layers of the word. It could be an experiential epiphany in another country or your own country. It could be a found love. Whatever the reason, it is because there is something unfulfilled, something that Singapore cannot offer somehow.<br><br>And when the cost of leaving is low, the younger set will choose to leave. Perhaps more and more so. That is a fact and it cannot be altered in today's world. And so, what is the worry then? What is the point in this entry?<br><br>What about those who have left in their minds in some way or another, but are physically still rooted in Singapore, to Singapore? Existing in uneasy comfort with reality. Uneasy comfort with realities.<br><br>I will let you down<br>I will make you hurt<br>If I could start again<br>A million miles away<br>I would keep myself<br>I would find a way<br><br>While the world is getting warmer, Singapore gets cooler.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ssssh! lionnoisy, you should be glad that your thread is finally being used for something productive.<br><br>As you said, the main purpose of the thread is to expose people to the realities of migrating to Australia (and as you said, hopefully dissuade them), and indeed, it so turns out a large part of that reality starts right here in Singapore.<br><br>The fact of the matter is this: despite all its shortcomings, we are still losing our citizens to Australia, hence the main reason for people migrating obviously goes beyond the issues that Australia faces. The sheer Downsides of Down Under are simply not a big hinderance to the typical Singaporean migrant at all, you hear of migrant Singaporeans saying they miss some aspects of Singapore life, but rarely, if ever that they regret the decision to migrate.<br><br>So what at the basis of this issue? Is it the Downsides of Down Under or the Downsides of the Little Red Dot? It is obviously the former.<br><br>Since you keep insisting that your thread isn't a meaingless and insensitive attack on Australia and was made to adress the issue of Singaporeans who might want to migrate there- fine, let's cut to the root of the issue and find out what REALLY makes Singaporeans leave. Is it mainly the attraction of Australia or the push factors making people leave.<br><br>It is only by adressing the root and true issue that this thread can be taken seriously, if not, expect people to simply ignore your posts and use this thread for fun, as we are more then willing to do.</div>

Thiru: As a Tamil I could draw parallels when the concerns of this article come to the population sisze and why our own talents are important. We SL Tamils &amp; the diaspora are a small-sized population and our problems are numerous. So the unity in purpose is very important. We must be inclusive of all tamils to arrive to a secure position as a nation of people. Even our Tamils born and growing up in foregin lands too must be included without being disloyal to their new countries, so that they too can contribute. </span><br><br>PROFESSOR Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, has enunciated the concepts of 'soft power' and 'hard power'. America's invasion of Iraq was an example of hard power. Winning the hearts and minds of the people is soft power.<br><br>In classical Chinese thought, the equivalent distinction would be 'wen' and 'wu', the pen and the sword, or the scholar and the warrior. The Chinese ideal is a combination of the scholar and the warrior in the same individual.<br><br>The difference between hard and soft can also be applied to knowledge, distinguishing between 'hard knowledge' and 'soft knowledge'. Rocket science, which requires heavy investment in jet-propulsion technology, is hard knowledge. Researching demand for luxury cars in developing countries requires soft knowledge.<br><br>BEST MINDS<br><br>ALTHOUGH Singapore's best minds compare favourably with their peers in larger countries, we lack the numbers to research hard knowledge. Similarly, we do not have economies of scale of production for hard technology.<br><br>Our comparative advantage is in conceptualisation more than design, in blueprints more than production. This does not mean that we can simply conceptualise without having to design. But not having the numbers, we have to excel at the upstream conceptual and blueprint stage of knowledge.<br><br>And for us, the competition is between cities, not with countries. Singapore has to compete with London and New York, Paris and Milan, Shanghai and Beijing, Tokyo and Kyoto. At the level of cities, the competition is intensely individual.<br><br>But with a small population base of three million, how do we get the critical mass to make a difference for Singapore?<br><br>First, we have to provide space for the creative and talented to think. Our teachers at schools and universities have to learn to respond to disconcerting, even rude, questions from their pupils. Our government and political leadership have to learn to accept alternative views on public policies and resist the temptation to rule uncomfortable questions out of order.<br><br>I would say that having 'OB markers' is to put a cap on thinking, with one crucial caveat: In a multiracial, multilingual and multi-religious Singapore, there will have to be OB markers on matters of race, language and religion. Not to place OB markers on race, language and religion is to invite disaster.<br><br><strong>Beyond this caveat, there will be no creative Singapore without the freedom to think. Only a free contest of ideas can give rise to the effervescence of creativity. Without creative thinking, Singapore would have lost in the competition between cities. </strong><br><br>The competition between cities differs from competition between countries in one crucial aspect. Cities compete on ideas, and ideas spring from the minds of individuals. More than in any other society, in Singapore, the individual counts. The individual makes the difference.<br><br><strong>As Singapore globalises, more and more younger Singaporeans will seek tertiary education abroad. Because of their thorough grounding in Singapore schools, most Singaporeans graduate at or near the top of their class. Our talented young are identified by their professors and offered PhD fellowships. Others are recruited by multinational corporation (MNC) employers. </strong><br><br>Hopefully, they will meet and marry fellow Singaporean spouses. Hopefully, when they are more settled in their careers, they will return home and raise their families here.<br><br>Our best and brightest who graduate from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University are also talent-spotted by MNCs, banks, transport and logistic companies, and a whole host of specialised businesses, which the indefatigable Economic Development Board attracts to Singapore. As the world globalises, employers recruit talent not just to meet their local Singapore needs, but more for their international business. There is a global search for talent. Competition between cities is competition between the talented.<br><br>Singaporeans, with their fluency in English and hard science education, will be in demand not only at home but also abroad. The Majulah Connection has found scores of Singaporeans and foreigners who have worked in Singapore holding CEO or very high management positions in Fortune 500 companies. Though not in abundance, Singapore has world-class talent.<br><br>In the global competition for talent, we will need to appeal to the emotions, the heart more than the mind. Attracting a Singaporean to return with a top job offer is only a matter of dollars and cents. <strong>Getting him or her home to start and raise a family here is a matter of the heart. We need to try. The alternative is extinction. Quo Vadis, Singapore? </strong><br><br><strong>With a small population and a narrow talent base, we have to take care not to alienate our best and brightest. They are the most mobile in today's knowledge-based world.</strong> As a society, Singapore should never quit on anyone, and neither should Singaporeans quit on Singapore.<br><br>The writer is a former permanent secretary at the Finance Ministry.

My parents stopped at 2 after having my younger sibling.<br><br>I moved from my kampong to a HDB flat in the west-end of Singapore when the government exercised the Land Reclamation Act on my kampong to build new flats.<br><br>I schooled through PSLE, O-level, A-level, and took a 2.5 years Army conscription break before disrupting to return to NUS for a degree course.<br><br>I followed the Singapore dream: study hard, serve the country, work hard, listen to the government and have a good life.<br><br>I remember vividly an illustration from the National Education text in primary school where it depicted a happy family of four walking towards their car from a high-rise apartment.<br><br>I observed the property market riding waves after waves of increase and read the dosage of how Â“investorsÂ” harvested profits within weeks without even seeing the apartment they bought. Inspiring.<br><br>And I quietly wondered how I can afford a high-rise apartment. But I thought that the government has a plan and I went for my Reservists and IPPT.<br><br>I watched my mother fell sick, admitted for emergency treatment and ICU observation. I saw the hospitable bills piled to intimidating figures but I have one and just only one mother Â– priceless. I knew I had enough CPF savings to cover her.<br><br>I thought I knew, but the CPF Board knew better. I watched in horror as the clerk punched her calculator and calmly informed me that the combined CPF of my 3 family members could only pay for less than 15% of the $25,000 bill.<br><br>I wiped out my first few years of cash savings in one cheque. Little did I know, then, that this one cheque would go on to change my Singapore dream.<br><br>I researched the CPF and learned about the limited medical scheme, housing scheme, and the ever-rising minimum sum requirement. I found out that I canÂ’t access my money even if I have a dying mother requiring an operation for which I have no cash to pay.<br><br>I finally understood why some old people say, Â“in singapore you can die but you better donÂ’t fall sickÂ”.<br><br>And I went for my Reservists and IPPT Â– but I began hating it for its inflexibility and infringement on my personal life.<br><br>I started asking Â“whyÂ”. I questioned and discovered that no one had a satisfactory answer, (or perhaps they just didnÂ’t want to answer) Â– except for slogans like Â“More Good YearsÂ”, Â“Swiss Standard of LivingÂ”, Â“First World nationÂ”.<br><br>No one, in fact, could tell me what constitutes a Â“Rainy DayÂ” or who can decide if its going to be a rainy day. Certainly not the weatherman, I know.<br><br>I took up a job that led me away from Singapore, relocating to a few locations. Someone called me a quitter subsequently.<br><br>In Japan, I concluded that World-class transportation network is quite a bit more than just 4 lines running through the city.<br><br>In Taiwan, I realized that Singapore is really a western society that happens to speak functional Mandarin. I learned what is civic participation, media independence, and how absolute power will corrupt absolutely eventually.<br><br>I now know it is the electorateÂ’s responsibility to ensure that the government does its job Â– not the other way around.<br><br>I married and bought my own high-rise apartment (not a cent from the CPF) Â– all outside of Singapore. I found out that I donÂ’t need a car to complete the picture in order to be happy, or to support my ego.<br><br>I watched the post-911 GE and the recent Lee-junior GE. I saw Martyn SeeÂ’s documentary on CSJ. I observed the emergence of political forums and their haste relocation from singapore, the evolution of the Â“persistently non-politicalÂ” blogs, not to mention the blogsÂ’ coverage of GE-2006.<br><br>I read with interest the emergence of civic awareness that are well articulated and presented on the Internet.<br><br>I am amused at the PAPÂ’s apprehension of this new media, as well as its instinctive need to Â“fixÂ” this emerging trend. I wonder how the new fix will reconcile with the new slogan, Â“Open and Inclusive SocietyÂ”.<br><br>I continue to be amused by a shriveled 80+ years old man who persists in putting on his gauntlets and meeting his imaginary opponent in a cul-de-sac. And yet when the time comes for reckoning he backpeddles and calls out for judgement without trial.<br><br>I pay the government to do its job of providing governmental services to the country, including a fair, equitable and non-partisan method of upgrading older estates.<br><br>I didnÂ’t pay to be told what can or cannot be expressed as opinions, be it constructive, partisan or otherwise. I have my wife at home to discuss freedom of expression Â– it is not the call of a civil servant or a minister employed by my tax dollars.<br><br>I have this to tell the civil servants and ministers: create more jobs, keep prices steady and try to move singapore upwards a little more in the Happy Nation Index. And stop complaining about how you cannot cope with rising oil prices, globalization, terrorism Â– you need to think really hard and come out with solutions.<br><br>And you do really need to worry about losing confidence because you are already there: through non-performance.<br><br>I am a Singaporean, who now understand the separation of State and Government, and who knows government must be managed and can indeed be changed (as opposed to some misguided musings).<br><br>I am a Singaporean, and I want a democratic society based on justice and equality. And I believe we will slowly but surely dismantle the obstructions accumulated from years of apathy.<br><br>So say we all.<br>===<br><br>Categories: IS Opinion<br>Submitted by Dan E</blockquote></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is this: this will not deter the Singaporeans who want to migrate.<br><br>The typical Singaporean who wants to migrate is not the person who is ignorant of world events and see other countries as an escape from Singapore, but instead the rather well-educated, talented, and knowledgeable Singaporean who has very specific reasons for making his choice to migrate.<br><br>This is why our government is extremely concerned about the brain drain in here, because it is our top talents who have the means to, as well as the reasons and motivates to migrate.<br><br>Hence all this news from the drought will not deter them- in fact they probably know this much better then lionnoisy. They know full well what they are stepping into when they make the decision to shift to Australia, and they are more then willing to take the country as their home with itÂ’s problems with drought and all.<br><br>The reason they decide to migrate does not lie with Australia being attractive, but with Singapore have plenty of Â“pushÂ” factors making them want to migrate.<br><br>A worrying proportion of our youth and top talents express intentions of migrating, with Australia still being the top on the list of locations. And this is not because they are ignorant on what is happening in Australia- these are educated and talented people have already weighted all the pros can cons, and of course this is the reason why our Government is so concerned about the Brain Drain.<br><br>So highlighting AustraliaÂ’s drought problems over and over again wonÂ’t really help this issue (that is if you even intend to help it), it is as best the Â“Indonesian SolutionÂ” to internal issues, and that is to highlight the issues of some other country to draw attention away from what is really happening.<br><br>Instead if one really wants to solve the problem of Singaporeans wanting to migrate to other countries, why not look into what the person who migrate really thinks? Even if Australia becomes inviable, Singaporeans will still find other places to go to, and what are you going to do then? Set up some Downsides of XXX Country thread for everyone they choose?<br><br>Unless we deal with the real issue at hand, which lies with ourselves, the problem can never be solved. Trying to shift the attention to other nations is simply not the solution.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://cobaltpaladin.blogspot.com/2006/08/emigration.html%20url" rel="nofollow"><strong>Emigration </strong><br><br>Recently, read KTM's entry at SingaporeAngle regarding the subject matter. And I wonder, what could be the reasons Singaporeans emigrate? In a spur of the moment, I did think of emigrating when I felt the government's upgrading policy was divisive. If wanting a government that listens to the people and not implementing a policy that is divisive, makes me a spoilt brat like KTM said, then so be it. However, the deeper question is why do we think of emigration? The answer is actually very simple: Because we can.<br><br>With the technological advances of recent times, travelling to other countries have been made easier and affordable. In 24 hours, you practically can reach any major country of your choice. This makes physcially uprooting to another place possible and plausible now. Being able to converse in English also makes moving to another English speaking country convenient. This is greatly thanks to Singapore's education system where English language is the emphasis. If you are able to converse in Chinese, your choices would have widened further.<br><br>Globalisation has also made the world seemed a lot smaller. Look around us, we are surrounded by Starbucks, McDonalds, KFC, Zara, Mango, Gucci, Channel, Agnes. b, Louis Vuitton, Apple, HP etc. Many other countries we go to now, we can find the above same brands, which helps to make the foreign land seemed a little less foreign. Living in an urban city like Singapore, make us quite capable of adapting to other foreign cities. With the advent of Internet, it makes connecting back home through e-mails, instant messaging, video chatting, VoIP a cinch. The communication channels available now is mind-boggling. Even before Internet, with the proliferation of movies and tv shows, many of us can already recognise Tokyo tower, Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Empire State builing, New York's yellow cabs etc even if we've not physically been there. And similarly, with Internet, finding more information before moving to a foreign land is now at your finger-tips.<br><br>With globalisation, comes opportunities too. Many are able to get better paying jobs in overseas postings and placements. This may be opportunities available because you went to look for it yourself or your MNC company offered. With globalisation, comes competitions too. During the last economic downturn, many factories reloated to countries like China where labour is cheaper. If your employer offers you a choice of retrenchment or continued employment but in another country, what would be your choice?<br><br>The growing affluence of Singapore has contributed much to the emigration phenomenon too. During long weekends or school holidays, you would see a packed airport, full-flights etc. Singaporeans are a well-travelled lot. That is only the short-term group. These group did not emigrate but these escapades have opened their eyes to the foreign cultures and world which definitely have left an indelible mark in their minds.<br><br>With growing affluence, many families have also been able to send their children overseas for studies. The children may be sent to study in foreign coutries because they can't get a seat in the limited placings of local tertiary institutions or the parents believe that their children can get better tertiary education in America or Australia. When you have our children studying and living in a foreign land for years and maybe spending the best time of their lives while being there, where do you think they may hope to emigrate in future?<br><br>To address the brain-drain problem, Singapore has sought to attract and welcome foreign talents. While working here, they may find someone they love, get married and even starting a family here. Of course, the government would hope that these family nucleus would choose to stay rooted locally, but one partner being a non-Singaporean, there is an equal chance that the non-Singaporean spouse would want to return to their homeland, bringing their whole family with them. Importing foreign talents is not a zero-sum game.<br><br>I believe it is also very common for people to move from one place to another in modern times. In bigger countries, the only difference is that, they move from one state to another. Singapore is only an island, if we move, we drop into the sea already!<br><br>I agree with KTM. If the people chooses to emigrate, instead of labelling them as quitters, the government should be gracious about it and wish the people all the best, sincerely. Do not forget, our forefathers "quitted" China to come to Singapore. There can be many reasons why anyone chooses to emigrate. There is no right or wrong. It just is. This is greatly due to the world getting smaller and closer thus making more choices and opportunities available. The global population is emigrating more than ever as a whole. This phenomenon is not uniquely Singapore. How does it help when the government labels Singaporeans who emigrated as quitters? Does that make them change their mind of emigrating? No. Does that make them want to come back to Singapore more? No. On the contrary, it may even push these people further away. So what for? There is no point in calling them quitters.<br><br>This actually reminds me of the many Chinese serials where the father will yell at the son,"Ã„Ã£Ã“Ã�ÂµÂ¨Ã�Â¿Ã—ÃŸÂ³Ã¶Ã•Ã¢Â¸Ã¶ÃƒÃ…Â£Â¬ Ã“Ã€Ã”Â¶Â²Â»Ã’ÂªÃ”Ã™Â»Ã˜Ã€Â´ (Don't you ever come back, if you dare walk out of this door)!"<br><br>Do you ever see the son walk back? No, right? The son will instead become more determined and walk out of the door.<br><br>The government would be too myopic to think that by labelling the emigrated people as quitters would solve the brain-drain problem. Do you think consumers would simply buy a product because you shouted,"You are a quitter if you don't buy my product!"? Instead, you get more people buying your product when it is better, has more features and provide great pre-post sales service.<br><br>To retain the people, make Singapore a more attractive place to live in. This can be achieved by providing better opportunities to our own people than what other foreign countries can provide. Be tolerant of a more diverse culture and opinions. Let the citizens be real stakeholders. Let our views be heard and seriously considered. I don't think the government wants its citizens who are only attracted to stay because of HDB upgrading and progress package. I don't think this is the Singapore the government wants. Many of us blog, some passionately, some vehemently. Be tolerant of alternative views and opinions of dissent.<br><br>We blog, because we care. Happy 41st birthday, Singapore!</a><br><br></div>

This was a rise of 58,000 a year Â– six times more than at present.<br><br>Since then, the statistics had been mixed, some years better than others, but generally the trend had been downward.<br><br>The current rise of 9000 new voters a year is about the lowest in modern history.<br><br>Since 1998, the number of new voters had been growing by less than 10,000 a year, a pale comparison of the past pre-global years. The table (official statistics) shows the general decline between elections since 1968, when independent Singapore held its first election.<br><br>This figure is not new but it merely reflects a trend that dates back about 10 years, especially since AsiaÂ’s financial crisis in 1997.<br><br>It also means the growth in new voters has been dropping even as the population is rising.<br><br>The reasons? Broadly speaking, it is due to more Singaporeans migrating or moving overseas to work, study or do business, some bringing along their families. With the exception of some 800 people, they are non-voters. (Voting is compulsory, and anyone who doesnÂ’t do so has to re-register by proving they were out of the country. The lower figure could also include some people who have failed to re-register.)<br><br>At the same time, some 30,000 foreigners are taking up PR Â– permanent residency Â– a year, inflating the population but who are not eligible to vote.<br><br>The real reason, however, lies in economic globalisation and ChinaÂ’s opening up. They eliminate jobs in some countries, while creating new opportunities in others.<br><br>This has resulted in a great trans-national movement of business and talent worldwide as skilled workers move freely in search of opportunities. It has affected Singapore more because of its small size.<br><br>The exact number of Singaporeans who are living abroad is not known, but various official sources have put it at between 100,000 and 150,000.<br><br>A head count is hard to do. The future intention of many overseas Singaporeans remains uncertain.<br><br>An increasing number of better-educated citizens take up PR, but not citizenship, in their host countries. This indicates they still keep one foot at home for a possible return.<br><br>Those who emigrated in the past decade generally found Singapore too small or restrictive and have opted for a more relaxed lifestyle in larger countries like Australia, the United States, Canada and Britain.<br><br>Some may decide to settle down in their new homes, while others will eventually return when opportunities improve.<br><br>Numbering thousands every year, the exodus has long caused heartache to Singaporean leaders who have worked for decades building up the republic from a Third to a First World state.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once shed tears over the exodus of professionals, and Goh Chok Tong, the Senior Minister, called the emigrants Â“quittersÂ”.<br><br>The current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also emotionally recalled the tough qualities of older Singaporeans, who stood in the heavy rains to celebrate National Day in 1968.<br><br>Since then, however, the leadership has accepted the inevitable. As more tertiary-trained youths leave to work abroad, it encourages them to explore opportunities overseas but maintain their links with home. Singapore is likened to a capital without a country, so the current strategy is to regard the world as its hinterland. It has been investing in strategic businesses throughout the region, requiring more citizens to work overseas.<br><br>As a result, the country is undergoing vast demographic changes, as shown by the declining number of new voters.<br><br>Its own birth rates are in sharp decline. Last year only 37,600 babies were born, one of the worldÂ’s lowest. The future lies in inward immigration.<br><br>This has been stepped up drastically in the past decade, steadily pushing up the population. In fact, the influx of foreign PRs has outweighed the outflow of citizens by several times.<br><br>They are believed to be more than the number of babies born, which would lead to a long-term dilution of the local content of the population.<br><br>The population rose from 4.24 million in 2004 to 4.35 million last year, an increase of about 111,000, some 80% of which were said to be foreign immigrants. Only some 30% of PRs eventually take up citizenship.<br><br>The blueprint is for a population of six to seven million by 2020. Many locals are angry about losing jobs to foreigners but officials say the end result will be a more vibrant global city.<br><br>o Seah Chiang Nee is a veteran journalist and editor of the information website littlespeck.com </a><br><br></div>
