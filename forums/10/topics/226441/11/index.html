storage level</strong></a>--Water woes worsen, but La Nina's tears may save dams in distress,Lorna Edwards,April 16, 2007<br>--http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/water-woes-worsen-but-la-ninas-tears-may-save-dams-in-distress/2007/04/15/1176575681283.html<br><br><blockquote>MELBOURNE'S water storages are plunging towards a historic low, dropping to 31.1 per cent of capacity yesterday after another dry week.<br>......<br><br>However, in the long term water quality could be affected by an increase of sediments if dam levels continued to drop.<br><br>South Australian water expert Dennis Steffensen said reduced water levels led to stratification, which affected water quality.<br><br>When stratification occurs, the warmer surface layer does not mix with cooler levels, resulting in the release of the trace elements iron and manganese.<br><br>"The nutrients will fuel more algal growth while iron and manganese can cause problems. particularly in washing machines, causing marks on washing and that sort of thing," said Mr Steffensen, the chief executive of the Co-operative Research Centre for Water Quality and Treatment.<br><br><strong>The city's Yan Yean reservoir had to be bypassed in February after a blue-green algal bloom.</strong>(read my note below)<br><br>Low water levels also reduce the pressure in dams, resulting in the intrusion of groundwater.<br><br>"The impact depends entirely on the quality of the groundwater but in some cases the groundwater may be more saline, for example, so you get an increase in salinity," he said.<br><br>If reservoir levels continue to decline, our water may become cloudier.<br><br>But water authorities are hoping the state's dire water shortages will be relieved through the coming winter months.<br><br>The Bureau of Meteorology has cautiously predicted the drought-inducing El Nino effect might be replaced by the wetter La Nina. "There's a 50-50 chance of exceeding average rainfall," said senior forecaster Terry Ryan.</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.melbournewater.com.au/content/water/weekly_water_update/weekly_water_update_archives.asp?year=2007&amp;file=wrr070215.html" rel="nofollow">in mid Feb2007,Yan Yean reservoir was 5,331  m3 storage out  30,000m3 full capacity, and 17.8% level</a></strong>.<br><br>Will blue-green algal bloom or other problems<br>occur to other reservoirs  if water level drop lower<br>to around 20% of full capacity??<br><br>9.<strong><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/water/stories/s1873301.htm" rel="nofollow"></a></strong><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/water/stories/s1873301.htm" rel="nofollow">Planning for the year from hell,by Michael Vincent,Friday, 16 March 2007</a></strong><br><br>Yesterday the Murray Darling Basin Commission cut South Australia's water allocation down to 1,480 gigalitres, the toughest reduction in more than a century..... </blockquote>''the toughest reduction in more than a century.''may not be enough to some<br>forums here.200 years then it is serious?<br><br>10<strong><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/water/stories/s1867951.htm" rel="nofollow">Brisbane goes to level 5,by Louise Willis,Friday, 9 March 2007</a></strong><br>It is sad to see all your oudoor plants dying from no watering.<br><br><blockquote>..The state's south-east will move to level five water restrictions next month, making Brisbane the first capital city in Australia to be placed under the strict water saving regime, which includes a ban on all outdoor water use....<br><br>Toowoomba in south-east Queensland, and Goulburn in southern New South Wales are already there.( level five water restrictions)<br><br>"We would have been totally out of water if we hadn't have been on Level 5," says Goulburn Mayor Paul Stephenson.<br><br>"There's no water outside the house at all, so you can't do anything outside the house."...</blockquote>Is it a serious problem when a state capital adopting toughest water restriction??<br><img src="http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200703/r130415_431096.jpg"><br>banned--watering cans will be restricted by level 5 water restrictions due to come into effect in south east Queensland on April 10<br></div>

He told them of his experience and how it came about. He removed the cartoons from his blog after he was questioned.<br><br>When contacted by The Straits Times, Char asked that he not be identified for he fears he may lose his job, which he wants to keep before entering a local university in August.<br><br>Describing himself as a free thinker, he said he had posted a cartoon that depicted Jesus as a zombie biting a boy's head in January.<br><br>The following month, he received an online message asking him to remove the image. It came amid the global furore over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad by several newspapers.<br><br>Char did not reply to the message but chose to irk the person instead. He searched the Internet for more pictures depicting Jesus and published three of them on his blog.<br><br>Looking back, he felt he made an "unwise" move. "I never thought anyone would complain to the police because the pictures were not insidious," he said.<br><br>In its statement yesterday, the police also advised the public "that it is a serious offence for any person to distribute or reproduce any seditious publication which may cause feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore." Offenders can be jailed up to three years or fined a maximum of $5,000 or both.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also said that the Government will act against anyone who makes remarks that threaten Singapore's racial and religious harmony, whether done online or offline. Race, language and religion remain sensitive issues here, and a younger generation must grow up learning the "eternal truths" about Singapore, he had said last year when three young Singaporeans were charged under the Sedition Act.<br><br>The three youths were subsequently convicted for making inflammatory racist remarks about Muslims and Malays online.<br><br>The first offender was jailed a month while the second was jailed a day and fined $5,000. The third, a 17-year-old, was put on probation for two years and ordered to do 180 hours of community work for Malay welfare organisations.<br><br>Char said he was aware of these earlier cases, 'but they were more for racism than for something like what I did'.<br><br>He got one of the three later cartoons from a website with images of vehicle licence plates while the other two were from a site with spoofed images of movie posters and TV screenshots, he said.<br><br>Char said his desktop computer and laptop were taken as evidence after he was questioned. Three days later, he was asked to report to the Police Cantonment Complex where he was arrested and released on police bail, which was extended to four weeks to let him travel to the US.<br><br>When he reported to the police on his return in April, he was told his bail had lapsed and that he might be called for further investigation.<br><br>He subsequently contacted the police in May and last week, and was told that his case was still under investigation.

It also provides a more open and predictable business environment across a range of areas, including competition policy, government procurement, intellectual property, e-commerce, customs procedures and business travel,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“SAFTA is an affirmation of the strategic relationship between Singapore and Australia which is based on mutual trust and a commitment to work more closely together in the future.  It is a forward-looking agreement that will enhance business opportunities in both countries, stimulate greater two-way investment and create jobs.

Ibid, p90: "Sedition complements treason and martial law: while treason controls primarily the privileged, ecclesiastical opponents, priests, and Jesuits, as well as certain commoners; and martial law frightens commoners, sedition frightens intellectuals."<br><br>Australia<br>Australia's sedition laws were amended in anti-terrorism legislation passed on 06 December 2005, updating definitions and increasing penalties.<br><br>In late 2006, the Howard Government proposed plans to amend Australia's Crimes Act 1914, introducing laws that mean artists and writers may be jailed for up to seven years if their work was considered "seditious" or inspired sedition either deliberately or accidentally.[1]<br><br>Opponents of these laws have suggested that they could be used against legitimate dissent.<br><br>Over the past year, Australian attorney-general Philip Ruddock has rejected calls by two reportsÂ—from a Senate committee and the Australian Law Reform CommissionÂ—to limit the sedition provisions in the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 by requiring proof of intention to cause disaffection or violence. He has also brushed aside recommendations to curtail new clauses outlawing Â“urging conductÂ” that Â“assistsÂ” an Â“organisation or country engaged in armed hostilitiesÂ” against the Australian military. The new laws, inserted into the legislation last December, allow for the criminalization of basic expressions of political opposition, including supporting resistance to Australian military interventions, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Asia-Pacific region. [2]<br><br>Canada<br>During World War II former Mayor of MontrÃ©al Camillien Houde campaigned against conscription. On August 2, 1940, Houde publicly urged the men of Quebec to ignore the National Registration Act. Three days later, he was placed under arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on charges of sedition. After being found guilty, he was confined in internment camps in Petawawa, Ontario and Gagetown, New Brunswick until 1944. Upon his release on August 18, 1944, he was greeted by a cheering crowd of 50,000 Montrealers and won back his job as Montreal mayor in 1944's civic election.<br><br>New Zealand<br>In New Zealand's first sedition trial in decades, Tim Selwyn was convicted of sedition (section 83 of the Crimes Act 1961) on 8 June 2006. He is planning to appeal. The Law Commission is calling for a repeal of the sedition laws.[1]<br><br>In September 2006, the New Zealand Police laid a sedition charge against a Rotorua youth, Christopher Russell, 17, who was also charged with threatening to kill.[2] The Police withdrew the sedition charge when Russell agreed to plead guilty on the other charge.[3]<br><br>In March 2007, Mark Paul Deason, 32, manager of a tavern near Otago University, was charged with seditious intent,[4] although he was later granted police diversion when he pleaded guilty to publishing a document which encourages public disorder.[5] Deason ran a promotion for his Tavern that offered 1 litre of beer for 1 litre petrol. At the end of the promotion, the prize would have been a couch soaked in the petrol. It is presumed the intent was for the couch to be burned - a popular university student prank. Police have also applied for Deason's liquor license to be revoked.<br><br>United States<br>Although potentially unconstitutional under the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, there have been a number of attempts in the United States to regulate speech that has been deemed seditious. in 1798, President John Adams signed into law the Alien and Sedition Acts, the fourth of which, the Sedition Act or "An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes against the United States" set out punishments for publishing of up to two years' imprisonment for "opposing or resisting any law of the United States" or writing or publishing "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" about the President or Congress (but specifically not the Vice-President). The act was allowed to expire in 1801 after the election of Thomas Jefferson. Its constitutionality was never judged in court, though cites in later case law (including New York Times v. Sullivan) strongly suggest it would have been deemed unconstitutional.<br><br>The 1917 Espionage Act may also be considered a sedition law of sorts, as section 3 made it a crime, punishable by 20 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, to wilfully spread false news of the US military with an intent to disrupt their operations, to foment mutiny in the ranks, or obstruct recruiting. The act was amended in 1918 with the Sedition Act, which expanded the purview of the Espionage Act to any statements made criticizing the government. The act was upheld in 1919 in Schenk v. United States, but was repealed largely in 1921, leaving mostly laws forbidding espionage and allowing military censorship of sensitive material.<br><br>In 1940, the Alien Registration Act or Smith Act was passed, which made it a crime to advocate or teach the desirability of overthrowing the United States Government, or to be a member of any organization which does the same. It was often used against Communist organizations. The act was invoked in three major trials, one of the Socialist Worker's Party in Minneapolis in 1941, resulting in 23 convictions, and again in 1944 in what became known as "The Great Sedition Trial", of pro-Nazi figures which ended in a mistrial. A series of trials of 140 leaders of the Communist Party USA was also predicated upon the Smith Act beginning in 1949, and lasting until 1957. Although the Supreme Court upheld the convictions of 11 CPUSA leaders in 1951, the court reversed itself in 1957 in Yates v. New York by ruling that teaching an ideal, no matter how inimical that onlookers may view it to the United States, does not equal advocating or planning its implementation.<br><br>Although unused since at least 1961, the Smith Act remains US law.<br><br>Laura Berg, a nurse at a U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs hospital in New Mexico was investigated in September 2005 for sedition after writing a letter [6][7]to the editor of a local newspaper, criticizing the government. Ms. Berg is now being represented by the ACLU.</blockquote></div>

Singapore takes social cohesion and racial harmony in the country seriously because of its history of racial riots in the 1960s. More recent events of racial violence in neighbouring Indonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s also serve as reminders of potential inter-racial conflicts in the region.<br><br>Cases in 2005<br>In September 2005, the Sedition Act was first used on individuals when two men were charged for making seditious and inflammatory racist comments on the Internet. The two men are Nicholas Lim Yew, 25, and Benjamin Koh Song Huat, 27. They made their remarks on Internet forums in response to a letter printed in The Straits Times.<br><br>On July 14, The Straits Times published a letter from a Muslim woman asking if cab companies allowed uncaged pets to be transported in taxis, after she saw a dog standing on a taxi seat next to its owner. She said that "dogs may drool on the seats or dirty them with their paws". Her concerns had a religious basis as according to Ustaz Ali Haji Mohamed, chairman of Khadijah mosque, who pointed out that: "There are various Islamic schools of thought which differ in views. But most Muslims in Singapore are from the Syafie school of thought. This means they are not allowed to touch dogs which are wet, which would include a dog's saliva. This is a religious requirement.".<br><br>Two days later, on an online forum for Singaporean dog lovers www.doggiesite.com, Lim posted anti-Muslim remarks that allegedly "had a seditious tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population in Singapore", according the charges. He pleaded guilty and served one day in jail and a fine of $5,000. [1]<br><br>The other man, Koh, is accused of making similar racist remarks filled with vulgarities and insulting to Malays and their religion. He also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one month imprisonment.<br><br><img src="http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200608/r98448_299534.jpg"><br><br>In passing the sentences to Koh and Lim on October 7, 2005, Senior District Judge Richard Magnus said the two had crossed the red line by wantonly breaching the basic ground rules. He said passing a deterrent sentence was necessary so that such offending acts are tackled early and contained, adding that callous and reckless remarks on racial or religious subjects had the potential to cause social disorder, regardless of which medium or forum they are expressed.<br><br>On September 16, a third person, a 17 year old youth, was also charged with the Sedition Act for making racist remarks on his blog site. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 months supervised probation that includes counselling sessions and community service in the Malay community. [1]<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong later commented that such remarks will not be tolerated, even if posted on the Internet. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said that the Sedition Act was under review to see if it should be strengthened or renewed.<br><br>Event in 2006<br>In June 2006, it was reported that a 21-year-old blogger was under police investigation for posting mocking caricutures of Jesus Christ on the Internet. [2] He was later let off with a stern warning from the police. [3]<br><br>See also</blockquote></strong></div>

He told them of his experience and how it came about. He removed the cartoons from his blog after he was questioned.<br><br>When contacted by The Straits Times, Char asked that he not be identified for he fears he may lose his job, which he wants to keep before entering a local university in August.<br><br>Describing himself as a free thinker, he said he had posted a cartoon that depicted Jesus as a zombie biting a boy's head in January.<br><br>The following month, he received an online message asking him to remove the image. It came amid the global furore over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad by several newspapers.<br><br>Char did not reply to the message but chose to irk the person instead. He searched the Internet for more pictures depicting Jesus and published three of them on his blog.<br><br>Looking back, he felt he made an "unwise" move. "I never thought anyone would complain to the police because the pictures were not insidious," he said.<br><br>In its statement yesterday, the police also advised the public "that it is a serious offence for any person to distribute or reproduce any seditious publication which may cause feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore." Offenders can be jailed up to three years or fined a maximum of $5,000 or both.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also said that the Government will act against anyone who makes remarks that threaten Singapore's racial and religious harmony, whether done online or offline. Race, language and religion remain sensitive issues here, and a younger generation must grow up learning the "eternal truths" about Singapore, he had said last year when three young Singaporeans were charged under the Sedition Act.<br><br>The three youths were subsequently convicted for making inflammatory racist remarks about Muslims and Malays online.<br><br>The first offender was jailed a month while the second was jailed a day and fined $5,000.

Three days later, he was asked to report to the Police Cantonment Complex where he was arrested and released on police bail, which was extended to four weeks to let him travel to the US.<br><br>When he reported to the police on his return in April, he was told his bail had lapsed and that he might be called for further investigation.<br><br>He subsequently contacted the police in May and last week, and was told that his case was still under investigation.
