            <div class='col-md body'>Uhh, first, we don't have a newspaper called The Edge - are you sure you have the right country? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Second, at the beginning of this thread you claimed you wanted to present facts, so let's stick to what's been reported in the article, shall we?  It's been reported that inventory and "repairable items" have been inadequately accounted for.  The most you can say is that the ADF does not cover up its LRIs as well as the SAF does. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There's no mention of corruption in the article.  Surely if a newspaper got a sniff of a corruption case, they'd make that the highlight of the article, wouldn't they?  The bank accounts were opened by the DMO (albeit without authorisation) - if money was going to be skimmed off, don't you think that they would have covered up the paper trail more thoroughly?  Please keep to your word of presenting facts instead of slipping in fallacious conclusions.<br><br>Third, gee, how do we know all about this?  Oh yes, the Auditor General's findings have been made public.  Is that such a big downside compared to not knowing where your CPF money is?  If you do want to see a banana republic, why not look at an example of where hundreds of billions of public money is not only not accounted for (is it all in offshore accounts? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ), but in fact where the people who own the money have been told that where their money is stashed is none of their business?<br><br>Between knowing that something's gone wrong and being kept in the dark, I'd just as soon be aware of what's going on.</div>

As maurizio's multiple examples already illustrate, corruption goes all the way up to ministerial level.  Mind you, with the degree to which the Singaporean government keeps secrets from the people, we're likely to have only seen the tip of the iceberg, and there's no accountability to keep things in check.  You're right that you can't entirely stop corruption, and the presence of a shadow government in Australia helps ensure that things don't stay hidden.<br><br>As for water, if the chaps up north ever decided to turn off the tap, do you think Singapore would be much better off?  At the very least you'd have a war on your hands.<br><br>That said, the Australian government does have to get off its butt and get moving on projects such as desalination plants and rerouting water channels.  As for the penalties for people who repeatedly flout water restrictions, I'm all for it - it's ridiculous that someone should see fit to hose down his bloody driveway when he could just as easily sweep it.</div>

Two underworld bosses departed the scene Â– one using a fake passport and the other in a coffin. A nobody named John Mark Karr became an instant global celebrity for falsely confessing to the murder of a Colorado beauty pageant queen. Two former judges found themselves on the wrong side of the law. Victoria PoliceÂ’s squeaky clean image lost its squeak, with half a dozen corrupt officers sent to jail. WA authorities finally admitted they had the wrong man and released Andrew Mallard after keeping him locked up for 12 years for a murder he didnÂ’t commit. A conwoman ran rings around police in three states. And the image of cruise ship holidays was forever changed.</strong><br><br>HereÂ’s how Gotcha chronicled the year.<br><br>In MelbourneÂ’s turbulent underworld, Italian Mafia figure Mario Condello was gunned down outside his home on the eve of his trial on conspiracy to murder charges in February. His killer or killers have not been caught and we revealed earlier this month that Victoria Police is now trying to force the key informer in the trial out of witness protection.<br><br>A less permanent departure from the underworld was that of Antonios Â“Fat TonyÂ” Mokbel, who disappeared in March in the closing stages of his trial on cocaine trafficking charges. It was later revealed that police had also connected him to two underworld murders. <strong><br>Mokbel managed to escape with $20 million in drug profits and was rumoured to have initially fled to Lebannon using a fake identity</strong><br>. Since then police have been slowly winding up Â“Mokbel IncÂ”, seizing millions of dollars in assets, including luxury cars, cash and jewellery. Also out of pocket is Fat TonyÂ’s sister-in-law, Renate, who was ordered to forfeit the $1 million bail surety she put up for him.<br><br>Meanwhile another underworld identity, Mick Gatto Â– the man who shot and killed gangland hitman Andrew Â“BenjiÂ” Veniamin in self defence - was revelling in his new-found fame and proclaiming that he was just any ordinary bloke trying to make an honest living.<br><br>It was a bad year for NSW judges Marcus Einfeld and Jeffrey Shaw. Einfeld was caught out trying to escape a speeding fine by saying an overseas visitor had been driving his car at the time. The only problem was the woman he named as the driver had died three years earlier. Police are still trying to get to the bottom of the matter.<br><br>And just this month the NSW Police Integrity Commission recommended that former judge Jeffrey Shaw be charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice after a blood sample taken after he was involved in a 2004 crash disappeared before police could test it. The police sample ended up in the possession of Shaw, although how it got there is still the subject of disagreement between the judge and the PIC.<br><br>In August John Mark Karr was extradited from Thailand to Colorado after confessing to the unsolved murder of JonBenet Ramsey almost 10 years earlier. DNA tests quickly cleared him, although not before his name and photograph got to all four corners of the globe. He was later cleared of child pornography charges Â– police had lost the evidence Â– and we last heard of him doing the rounds of celebrity television chat shows.<br><br>The award for most brazen criminal of the year must surely go to elusive Â“Catch Me If You CanÂ” conwoman Jodie Harris, who taunted police across three states during an identity fraud crime spree. She was eventually caught in Sydney in July after her boyfriend, a Victorian policeman, tipped off his NSW colleagues.  She was jailed in September for a minimum of three and a half years and ordered to pay $175,000 in compensation to victims.<br><br>The Â“ItÂ’s About TimeÂ” award for the year must go to Andrew Mallard, who was freed in Perth after spending almost 12 years behind bars for a murder he didnÂ’t commit. His appeals had been rejected by a succession of WA courts before the High Court finally quashed it because key evidence that would have benefited his case was withheld by police from his lawyers.

WAÂ’s Corruption and Crime Commission is still investigating who was to blame.<br><br>In Victoria the cell doors slammed shut on six corrupt police officers, including Detective Senior-Sergeant Wayne Geoffrey Strawhorn. The forceÂ’s once untainted image took a further knock when the stateÂ’s corruption watchdog targeted the Armed Offenders Squad, with public hearings into allegations members had assaulted suspects. The squad was disbanded, but thanks to some muscle-flexing by the police union was quickly reborn as the Armed Offenders Taskforce.<br><br>Perhaps the saddest episode of the year was inquest into the death of Dianne Brimble from an overdose of the date rape drug GHB during a cruise on P&amp;OÂ’s Pacific Sky in 2002. The evidence showed how callously and brutally she had been treated by the men she was with on the night she died. But as we reported, a failure by the shipÂ’s crew to properly quarantine the crime scene made any possibility of laying charges unlikely. The inquest, which helped highlight the dangers of cruising the high seas, is due to resume in February.<br><br>We also looked at inadequate sentences, plea bargaining, the plight of sexual assault victims, juries, bad driving, why we are losing the war on drugs, serial killers and domestic violence, the name but a few.<br><br>IÂ’d be interested in hearing what you thought were the most important crime and corruption issues of the year. </blockquote>sorry i cant link all the links in this essay,<br>you can know more of Auusie corruptions and gangsters from these links.</div>
