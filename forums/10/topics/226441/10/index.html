People try to warn him to stop playing because he tio mark already, and he still carry on own time own target... well, it's your funeral.<br><br>Do you think in Singapore EVERYBODY has a favourable view of Newater? What is commendable is at least the aussies have the power to do something to advance their own point of view while we more or less have to tank each and every change, good or bad, that is made for us.<br><br>If anything what you highlighted is a GOOD point about the aussies, that indeed they have the FIRST WORLD MINDSET to have the freedom of speech and actions to determine what they want.<br><br><span style="color: red;">FIRST WORLD MINDSETS are judged on things like freedom of speech, respecting self-determination and democracy... not questioning if they have the guts to use recycled water. At which it is an issue that is their CHOICE and certainly not for you to question if they have a FIRST WORLD MINDSET on this. </span><br><br>For example, going by your logic, if North Korea is having the guts to use recycled water while the Aussies do not then it shows that the North Koreans have a FIRST WORLD MINDSET. I must present an alternative conclusion, and that is you are of a ONE TRACK MINDSET that seeks to turn each and every single thing you can potentially dig out into your posts, even at the extent of contradicting yourself.<br><br>Please spare us your posts, and save yourself some trouble when you find yourself suddenly in some real problems from what you did in here (of which you already are).<br><br>So yes, the answer to your question is what you just posted shows that the Aussies have a very healthy and working FIRST WORLD MINDSET, which more then I can say for us.</div>

A result of retrenching older experienced technicians for younger inexperienced technicians who are likely to be foreigners?<br><br>How did SIA engineering get to this stage of incompetency? SIA also dropped from rank no. 1 to 7.   So what is happening to SIA after they retrenched  their local workers in favor of cheap foreign talents and local inexperienced technicians ? Alot of negatives there...BS about telling older Singaporeans to upgrade .....those older Singaporeans who got retrenched probably had alot more  valuable experience.<br><br>I also read the propanganda machine aka Channel News Asia . They did not mention anything about those "interesting problems " while Australian news went into some detail into those servicing problems.<br><br>I hope Qantas will never move to overseas operations  because right now I don't trust SIA enough to fly SIA long haul  . Qantas - I am still ok with since it is the only airline without major incidents.  Worse come to worse, I will take emirates since some of the old SIA techs and pilots are employed there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And since when did the LA people directly drink recycled water?

Would you rather be a cog in a perfect machine or a member of a team that values you as an individual, even if the team is inperfect.<br><br>It is indeed ironic that in his attempt to highlight the downsides of Australia, he's actually highlighting the upsides of it and making it more attractive to many.

The fact that everybody else understands that these warnings were for your own good to avoid trouble with the officials seem to be quite clear to everyone but you.<br><br>The only reason you seem to think that anybody might break the law to take care of you seems to come only from your own arrogrance, and inability to understand some basic english. Why break the law to take care of you when by many measures you are already taking care of yourself by doing it for us with your posts?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Now u say police (SG or Aussie?)want to talk to me.<br>Good,it wil save me 45 cents to police Div HQ!!</blockquote>Are you making this statement to make yourself feel more brave?

It's okay, we understand, don't be ashamed.<br><br><blockquote>3.Aussie grew up in Aussie will not mad with me.<br>Only the would--be --Aussie Sporean mad with me.</blockquote>Erm, try asking an true blue Aussie in here what they think of you, and somehow you seem lost on the fact that some have answered you in some of your previous posts that they aren't too happy with your conduct.<br><br>And yes, Aussie Sporean is enough to indict you liao leh.<br><br><blockquote>3.<strong>Attn All Mods</strong><br>PM me if u find me too radical and faking stories here.<br><br>My agenda is open here''DOWN SIDES OF DOWN UNDER''<br><br>Whats wrong to say somethinhs down sides----<br>all already reported in Aussie main stream medias.</blockquote>What's wrong? Try telling that to the judge.<br><br>I'm afraid that kind of argument you just gave is pretty much the same "defence" many who have been taken to task for their actions gave... and it didn't help them.<br><br>What's wrong? Try being insensitive to international relations, to the nationalistic sentiments of others, inciting unrest and the many other things of which you have been doing a lot of.<br><br>You may like to think of this as just a simple "fact showing" mission, but unfortunately the judge, and just about everybody else is not going to see it this way.<br><br>Can you imagine the number of witness accounts that will be given against you.<br><br>There are proper fact finding threads, but yours lack all of the hallmarks of that.<br><br>And do you seriously think the mods care about what happens to you? Let alone bother to warn you? Here's a clue... if we don't, it's not likely they do as well...<br><br>In fact you should really be thinking hard as to why they are so quiet on what you post. And why some people are starting to warn you liao... it should be the signs for you to stop some nonsense, but apparently you are the sort who stands around and asks questions as to why you need to take cover when people warn you to while the bullets start flying... I'm not too surprised that you are going to get hit soon.<br><br><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/" rel="nofollow">DOWN SIDES OF LITTLE RED DOT</a></strong>---HIDDEN AGENDA[/b]</blockquote>Erm, you mean to say they have not been "fixed" enough? Have you read the news on the owners of that website recently?<br><br>Which begs another question... they have what it takes to face up to their actions, and a cause they believe that is worthy to fight for. You on the other hand, I seriously doubt have any sort of a cause except to vent some steam at the Aussies and disguise it as a "fact finding" mission, a mission that a lot of Singaporeans and Australians down on the ground there have not only denounced, but found extremely offensive.<br><br>Seriously ah, it is my personal opinion (and I'm sure it's shared) that you are going to kenna sai really soon if you keep on your merry way. If I were you I would shut up and give this thread and topic a wide berth liao, but apparently you still seem insistent on testing how much weight it needs to set off a landmine.<br><br>Believe me when it blows, nothing you do can keep a lid on it. At that time you regret too late liao... dun say we never warn you hor.</div>
