Without heavy rain, it will reach its "dead water" level in just 12 weeks Â— not next year as Melbourne Water claims.<br><br>Worse, equipment needed to pump the dead water from the dam is not ready, meaning Melbourne could face a water crisis in quality and quantity Â— with an immediate step up from stage 4 restrictions (set for next month) to stage 5. Meanwhile, nearly half the water coming out of the dam every day washes down the Thomson River to satisfy irrigation contracts.<br><br>The claims are made by former Melbourne Water hydrologist Geoff Crapper and engineer Ron Sutherland. Their latest predictions follow their forecasts about the Thomson dam last year, which contradicted Melbourne Water's projections but were later proven true.<br><br>"The Government is taking a punt on the weather to solve the crisis Â… while an outrageous amount of water is being wasted every day," Mr Crapper said.</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/thomson-dam-will-be-bone-dry-in-a-year/2007/03/17/1174080223564.html" rel="nofollow">Thomson Dam will be 'bone dry in a year'</a></strong>John Elder<br>March 18, 2007<br><blockquote><br><br>MELBOURNE's main source of drinking water, the Thomson Dam, could be bone dry in a year. And with the dam's capacity decreasing about 1 per cent a fortnight, it will reach a "dead water" level in 12 weeks, not at the start of next year as Melbourne Water claims.<br><br>The multimillion-dollar equipment needed to pump dead water from the dam is not yet in place, meaning Melburnians could have delivery and quality problems, and an immediate move from stage 4 restrictions<strong> (set to come in next month) to an unprecedented stage 5.</strong><br><br>..."You don't have to be a rocket scientist. The arithmetic is simple. The Thomson was at 42.6 per cent this time last year. At the moment it's 19.4 per cent (as of yesterday). If the weather pattern stays the same, or only slightly improves, the dam that was meant to drought-proof the city will be empty in 12 months' time. This is a worse-case scenario, but it doesn't appear to be in the Government's reckoning," Mr Crapper said.<br><br>His claim that the dam will soon hit dead water, or minimum operating level at 13 per cent capacity, is even more compelling: in the past week the average loss rate from the dam has been 734 megalitres a day as storage went from 20 per cent to 19.5 per cent. If this loss rate continues, the dam will be at dead water by late June.<br><br>"Even if the loss rate from Thomson Dam is reduced by 200 megalitres per day by cutting back on the gross wastage of flow releases, an average loss rate of 534 megalitres per day would still see pumping from Thomson Dam required before the end of July," he said.<br><br>Last week in State Parliament, shadow water minister Louise Asher asked Water Minister John Thwaites if pumps were in place at the Thomson. Mr Thwaites did not answer, but accused Ms Asher of running a scare campaign....</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21396523-2702,00.html" rel="nofollow">Historic station drained of life,    * Stuart Rintoul,    * March 17, 2007<br><br></a></strong><br><blockquote>..."As of today, after a long hot summer and worsening drought, what's left of the creek is a blot on the landcape; rotting fish and water rats for as far as the nose can smell and 70 kilometres of a denuded watercourse," he says...The company has also had to spend $6 million in new infrastructure, including 100km of fencing, where previously the creek provided a natural barrier, and 300km of PVC pipe to pump water from Billabong Creek to tanks and troughs....</blockquote>The biggest threat to Aussie is not terrorists,but water shortage.<br><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k84/puzzylion2/melwater10y.jpg"><br><strong><a href="http://www.melbournewater.com.au/content/water/weekly_water_update/weekly_water_update.asp" rel="nofollow"><br>15 March 2007<br>Melbourne's water storages have dropped a</a></strong> further 0.6% (10,686 million litres) this week to <strong>33.0% </strong>(584,435 million litres) full today.
