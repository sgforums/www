What I am asking here is a very simply and direct question. How much of the 4 grand that you spend goes into tax. I didnt ask you do you feel the pain in spending 4 grand in australia. </div></blockquote>Why would you say I'm getting defensive?  After all, didn't I say that if you can spend ten grand in Singapore, it's a good thing?<br><br>Don't get so hung up on the minutae.  This, after all, is Speaker's Corner and in that political context, the larger issue is, as the politicians would have it, knowing how much bread and milk costs rather than how many percent of what tax and funding goes where.<br><br>The point I'm getting here is that one person can say that tax is twice as much in Australia, while another would say that houses are half the price and cars a quarter.  Then it'll be another round of figures back and forth.  At this time of year, that's just Yawnsville - I'd rather be shopping, which is what I'm going to do right after I post a response to miserable.
