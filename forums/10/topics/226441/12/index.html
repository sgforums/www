He told them of his experience and how it came about. He removed the cartoons from his blog after he was questioned.<br><br>When contacted by The Straits Times, Char asked that he not be identified for he fears he may lose his job, which he wants to keep before entering a local university in August.<br><br>Describing himself as a free thinker, he said he had posted a cartoon that depicted Jesus as a zombie biting a boy's head in January.<br><br>The following month, he received an online message asking him to remove the image. It came amid the global furore over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad by several newspapers.<br><br>Char did not reply to the message but chose to irk the person instead. He searched the Internet for more pictures depicting Jesus and published three of them on his blog.<br><br>Looking back, he felt he made an "unwise" move. "I never thought anyone would complain to the police because the pictures were not insidious," he said.<br><br>In its statement yesterday, the police also advised the public "that it is a serious offence for any person to distribute or reproduce any seditious publication which may cause feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore." Offenders can be jailed up to three years or fined a maximum of $5,000 or both.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also said that the Government will act against anyone who makes remarks that threaten Singapore's racial and religious harmony, whether done online or offline. Race, language and religion remain sensitive issues here, and a younger generation must grow up learning the "eternal truths" about Singapore, he had said last year when three young Singaporeans were charged under the Sedition Act.<br><br>The three youths were subsequently convicted for making inflammatory racist remarks about Muslims and Malays online.<br><br>The first offender was jailed a month while the second was jailed a day and fined $5,000. The third, a 17-year-old, was put on probation for two years and ordered to do 180 hours of community work for Malay welfare organisations.<br><br>Char said he was aware of these earlier cases, 'but they were more for racism than for something like what I did'.<br><br>He got one of the three later cartoons from a website with images of vehicle licence plates while the other two were from a site with spoofed images of movie posters and TV screenshots, he said.<br><br>Char said his desktop computer and laptop were taken as evidence after he was questioned. Three days later, he was asked to report to the Police Cantonment Complex where he was arrested and released on police bail, which was extended to four weeks to let him travel to the US.<br><br>When he reported to the police on his return in April, he was told his bail had lapsed and that he might be called for further investigation.<br><br>He subsequently contacted the police in May and last week, and was told that his case was still under investigation. "I just wonder how long it's going to take," he said.</blockquote></div>

Singapore takes social cohesion and racial harmony in the country seriously because of its history of racial riots in the 1960s. More recent events of racial violence in neighbouring Indonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s also serve as reminders of potential inter-racial conflicts in the region.<br><br>Cases in 2005<br>In September 2005, the Sedition Act was first used on individuals when two men were charged for making seditious and inflammatory racist comments on the Internet. The two men are Nicholas Lim Yew, 25, and Benjamin Koh Song Huat, 27. They made their remarks on Internet forums in response to a letter printed in The Straits Times.<br><br>On July 14, The Straits Times published a letter from a Muslim woman asking if cab companies allowed uncaged pets to be transported in taxis, after she saw a dog standing on a taxi seat next to its owner. She said that "dogs may drool on the seats or dirty them with their paws". Her concerns had a religious basis as according to Ustaz Ali Haji Mohamed, chairman of Khadijah mosque, who pointed out that: "There are various Islamic schools of thought which differ in views. But most Muslims in Singapore are from the Syafie school of thought. This means they are not allowed to touch dogs which are wet, which would include a dog's saliva. This is a religious requirement.".<br><br>Two days later, on an online forum for Singaporean dog lovers www.doggiesite.com, Lim posted anti-Muslim remarks that allegedly "had a seditious tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population in Singapore", according the charges. He pleaded guilty and served one day in jail and a fine of $5,000. [1]<br><br>The other man, Koh, is accused of making similar racist remarks filled with vulgarities and insulting to Malays and their religion. He also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one month imprisonment.<br><br><img src="http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200608/r98448_299534.jpg"><br><br>In passing the sentences to Koh and Lim on October 7, 2005, Senior District Judge Richard Magnus said the two had crossed the red line by wantonly breaching the basic ground rules. He said passing a deterrent sentence was necessary so that such offending acts are tackled early and contained, adding that callous and reckless remarks on racial or religious subjects had the potential to cause social disorder, regardless of which medium or forum they are expressed.<br><br>On September 16, a third person, a 17 year old youth, was also charged with the Sedition Act for making racist remarks on his blog site. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 months supervised probation that includes counselling sessions and community service in the Malay community. [1]<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong later commented that such remarks will not be tolerated, even if posted on the Internet. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said that the Sedition Act was under review to see if it should be strengthened or renewed.<br><br>Event in 2006<br>In June 2006, it was reported that a 21-year-old blogger was under police investigation for posting mocking caricutures of Jesus Christ on the Internet. [2] He was later let off with a stern warning from the police. [3]<br><br>See also</blockquote></strong></div>

The troll posts a message, often in response to an honest question, that is intended to upset, disrupt or simply insult the group.<br><br>Usually, it will fail, as the troll rarely bothers to match the tone or style of the group, <span style="color: red;">and usually its ignorance shows.</span><br><br>Why do trolls do it?<br><span style="color: darkred;">I believe that most trolls are sad people, living their lonely lives vicariously through those they see as strong and successful.</span><br><br>Disrupting a stable newsgroup gives the illusion of power, just as for a few, stalking a strong person allows them to think they are strong, too.<br><br>For trolls, any response is 'recognition'; they are unable to distinguish between irritation and admiration; their ego grows directly in proportion to the response, regardless of the form or content of that response.<br><br>Trolls, rather surprisingly, dispute this, claiming that it's a game or joke; this merely confirms the diagnosis; how sad do you have to be to find such mind-numbingly trivial timewasting to be funny?<br><br>Remember that trolls are cowards; they'll usually post just enough to get an argument going, then sit back and count the responses (Yes, that's what they do!).<br><br>How can troll posts be recognised?<br>No Imagination - Most are frighteningly obvious; sexist comments on nurses' groups, blasphemy on religious groups .. I kid you not.<br>Pedantic in the Extreme - Many trolls' preparation is so thorough, that while they waste time, they appear so ludicrous from the start that they elicit sympathetic mail - the danger is that once the group takes sides, the damage is done.<br>False Identity - Because they are cowards, trolls virtually never write over their own name, and often reveal their trolliness (and lack of imagination) in the chosen ID. As so many folk these days use false ID, this is not a strong indicator on its own!<br>Crossposting - Any post that is crossposted to several groups should be viewed as suspicious, particularly if unrelated or of opposing perspective. Why would someone do that?<br>Off-topic posting - Often genuine errors, but, if from an 'outsider' they deserve matter-of-fact response; if genuine, a brief apposite response is simply netiquette; if it's a troll post, you have denied it its reward.<br>Repetition of a question or statement is either a troll - or a pedant; either way, treatment as a troll is effective.<br>Missing The Point - Trolls rarely answer a direct question - they cannot, if asked to justify their twaddle - so they develop a fine line in missing the point.<br>Thick or Sad - Trolls are usually sad, lonely folk, with few social skills; they rarely make what most people would consider intelligent conversation. However, they frequently have an obsession with their IQ and feel the need to tell everyone. This is so frequent, that it is diagnostic! Somewhere on the web there must be an Intelligence Test for Trolls - rigged to always say "above 150"<br><br>Who is at risk?<br>Any newsgroup, bulletin board, forum or chatroom can attract trolls, but they don't have the brains to attack nuclear physicists, and they are drawn to the quick response where sex, religion and race are found; so politics is easy prey.<br><br>One troll famously tried to infiltrate a mensa group; the results read like 100 trolls and one regular, it didn't have a chance - but it was stupid enough to persist until removed.<br><br>When Should You Be Concerned?<br>Usually, no, though fractured funny bones and occasional waves of nausea have been reported.<br><br>When a troll become persistent and personal, you may need to consider the possibility that it has fermented into an Internet Stalker - equally pathetic, if not more so - but sometimes requiring weedkiller. Find Out More<br><br>Trolls - if they had brains, they just might be dangerous!  </blockquote></strong></div>

This means that if they so choose, they can actually sue you for what you said and implied, and the only reason why that hasn't happened is because we haven't reported you, out of pity for what will happen to you.<br><br>So who cares if you are for aus gov or sg gov? They don't care, as long as your clumsly actions stir the boat, no matter what you allegiance you are going to pay for it.<br><br>Anybody who can read the act will realize you are in trouble.<br><br>The sedition act is for sedition against Sg gov, however you might not realize that your actions are indirectly (or directly) trying to cause tension between the Singaporeans and Australians.... which would affect Singapore, which in the end puts you will and truly under the act.<br><br>You do not seriously think the sedition act only applies to those who work against Sg do you? Just try messing around outside the American embassy about their war in Iraq and see how quickly you get carted away.<br><br>Sigh, you are in trouble and you don't even seem to know it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Truly, his latest post was pure entertainment, the story of the horrified kid telling you about the tragic story of drug abuse in the "safe room of the church" reads like an extract from some soap opera written by someone with very poor control of the language trying but failing miserably to invoke any serious emotion at his prose except pure laughter at the sheer clumsiness of his attempt.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lol, he's totally gone over the end right now... so now his next target are the churches in Australia?<br><br>Hmm... I don't think the christians here will take kindly to him slandering their Australian siblings, sedition anyone?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think if you read the entire history of his thread, if lionnoisy has tried to wake anybody up from their "rosy" views of australia, he has failed miserably. Has a single rational person spoken in support of his cause?<br><br>Hmm...<br><br>Nope.<br><br>In fact I think think he knows his own cause is hopless, however he still carries on the save face, only suceeding in making himself look sillier with each post.<br><br></div>
