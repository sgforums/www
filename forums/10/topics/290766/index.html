            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Turning the WP into a faster machine</strong><br>by Andrew Loh<br><br>Critics of The WorkersÂ’ Party have one main grouse. And this is that the party is not being vocal enough. The WPÂ’s secretary general Mr Low Thia Khiang responded to such criticism by challenging the critics to step forward, join the WP and help Â“make it fasterÂ”.<br><br>I see the criticisms as very healthy and welcome them, for I believe that it is through such critiques that any organization can progress and improve itself. Thus, instead of seeing the criticisms as being negative, which the WP doesnÂ’t I am sure, I see it as a timely reminder to the WP, almost 2 years after the GE.<br><br>I also see such criticisms directed at the WP as indication of approval of the WP, in fact. It shows me that Singaporeans have placed hopes on the party to represent them in a more concrete way. These same Singaporeans feel that the party can do more and should do more. It is a sign of confidence in the party, if you think about it.<br><br>The confidence is borne out of how the party conducted itself during the last General Elections in May, and also with the credible people that it has in its ranks, especially Mr Low and Ms Sylvia Lim, both of whom have shown that they are quite different from opposition members of the past.<br><br>They do not adopt Â“thunder and lightningÂ” methods of confrontational politics. Instead, they prefer sensible, careful and diligent study of each issue before they speak on it Â– whether in Parliament or outside of Parliament.<br><br>It is a calculated, mature and responsible approach.<br><br>This is why I would say that the criticsÂ’ accusations that the WP has been rather silent on issues are not completely accurate. Indeed, if one were to recall all the issues the party has brought up since the elections, one would see that the range is quite comprehensive.<br><br>The impression which the critics have about the WP being silent is perhaps because of exactly the method which the party leaders have deliberately adopted Â– a non-confrontational, non-sensational approach.<br><br>Bluntly put, it will be easier for the party to raise their fists, as it were, call to the heavens, beat their collective chests and summon the gods of confrontation Â– if the partyÂ’s main prerogative was to get attention.<br><br>It is to the leadershipÂ’s credit that this is not their aim. As Mr Low said in the Straits Times interview, Â“The WorkersÂ’ Party is a responsible party and I do not believe in just making statements, just making comments for the sake of making noise.Â”<br><br>Instead, anyone who knows Mr Low will know that his main concern is always the good of Singapore and Singaporeans. Â“Does a policy benefit Singaporeans?Â”, looking at it objectively without the partisan politics. And if it is good for Singapore, the WP does not shy away from saying so and credit the government.<br><br>This is perhaps why some are puzzled with Mr Low giving the PAP a Â“passing gradeÂ” so far, as reported in the media. I would confidently say that any neutral observer would agree with Mr Low Â– that the PAP govt has a passing grade thus far.<br><br>Of course this does not mean that the govt is perfect and has nothing further to improve on. Indeed, it does Â– in many areas. Besides, a Â“passing gradeÂ” does not mean a distinction grade.<br><br>Now, going back to the question of the WP not being vocal enough, the ultimate solution lies with Singaporeans - if they indeed feel the party is not doing enough.<br><br>An organization is only as good, as strong, as competent, as the people in it.<br><br>Thus, I echo Mr LowÂ’s challenge: Those who feel that the party is not doing enough should consider Â– seriously Â– coming forward and joining the party. Your expertise, knowledge, effort, skills will help the party do better.<br><br>What will help you shed the fear of joining the WP and or any opposition party? Are you still haunted by phantom ghosts of persecution, destruction and fear? Would you want to pass on such fears to your next generation of Singaporeans?<br><br>The truth is that no amount of deliberations, discussions or encouragement will help you overcome this fear. The only thing which will help you do that is to just do it. It is only when you join the party that you will overcome the fear of joining the party. ItÂ’s paradoxical but it is also true. This was my own experience when I first joined the WP in 2006, a few months before the elections.<br><br>But the most important question is: How much do you feel and care for Singapore and your fellow Singaporeans? Is that enough to make you take the next step?<br><br>Joining the WP is not a personal ego trip Â– as any party member will tell you. It is a collective effort by ordinary Singaporeans who care enough to do something for their country. A collective effort which party members and volunteers carry in the belief that the country needs an alternative Â– a responsible, credible, smart, intelligent and mature party which is determined to move the country forward, even if it is one inch at a time.<br><br>An effort which only reward is knowing that we are doing our best Â– and have done our best - and will continue to do our best.<br><br>To sum up, I urge the critics of the party to come forward and chip in, put your shoulders to the wheel with us.<br><br>It is then Â– and only then Â– that the party will, in the words of Mr Low Â– be able to meet societyÂ’s expectations.<br><br>PS: For those who are, for one reason or another, unable to be party members, they can also be volunteers with the party.
