              <p>Minister Mentor rebuts human rights groups' criticism of Singapore </p>
              <p>Sue-ann Chia</p>
              <p>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew last night dismissed human rights organisations' criticisms of Singapore's style of governance, saying that they were trying to 'do us in'.</p>
              <p>In a robust rebuttal of these groups' assertions that Singapore is not a liberal democracy, he said that they had never run a country and did not know what was needed to make Singapore tick.</p>
              <p>'There is a conspiracy to do us in. Why?... They see us as a threat,' said Mr Lee at an hour-long dialogue during the Economic Society of Singapore's annual dinner.</p>
              <p>Explaining why these groups regarded Singapore as a threat, he said it was because they saw that the Russians and Chinese have been coming and studying Singapore's success story and picking up pointers.</p>
              <p>The leaders of these countries ask 'how does this little country with so little talent keep its ruling party in place and run a tight ship, honest, and effective, and make progress?'</p>
              <p>'Can they (the Russians and Chinese) do it? I don't know. But they are picking up points here and there.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was responding to a question on whether Singapore needed a Western-style liberal democracy to succeed.</p>
              <p>He said groups which advocate the need for liberal democracies were prescribing universal rules for the whole world.</p>
              <p>But he threw down this gauntlet:</p>
              <p>'My question is to them, have you ever run Singapore? Do you know how we got here? What were we? What we are now? And how we can become better?</p>
              <p>'We are not stupid people. They give us all these advice... Who are they? Have they ever run a country, created jobs for community and given them a life? We have and we know what it requires.</p>
              <p>'Nobody (who) advocates this has any idea what they will do to a society if you implement these rules.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lee believes each country will have to decide which political system suits it best.</p>
              <p>'Different people have different cultures and forge different consensus and seek different solutions to their problems,' he said.</p>
              <p>But he was also quick to acknowledge that the People's Action Party (PAP) will not always have the answers:</p>
              <p>'I'm not saying the PAP government will always be supreme, will always be honest, will always be A-plus.</p>
              <p>'The day it is no longer honest, it should be out. And another party should come in, with equally honest people.'</p>
              <p>Turning to the opposition, Mr Lee said:</p>
              <p>'We are not trying to block them. We are trying to force them to collect a group of people equal in competence...When we fail, they have a team that can take over.</p>
              <p>'But unfortunately, they can't do it. Because the people with ability, drive, ambition and energy don't want to come into politics. If they wanted to, they will join us (the PAP).'</p>
              <p>For Singapore to continue to succeed, it needs to find the next generation of top notch leaders.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said the present generation of leaders could last at least two terms.</p>
              <p>But if they did not find talented people with the drive and energy and integrity to match the demands of the job during this time, 'then I say, the future is in doubt'.</p>
              <p>'The system is there, but it cannot run with mediocre men. You need top men.'</p>
              <p>The PAP has managed to recruit good people and its leaders had, in turn, won the trust of Singaporeans through their integrity and honesty - values which the PAP still holds true today.</p>
              <p>He said the task of finding new leaders is no longer his:</p>
              <p>'I've done my job. I've passed it on to the next generation. Chok Tong has passed to the next generation.</p>
              <p>'If you have a competent team on board, honest and dedicated, it will last. If you have bums, then even with best of institutions, it will fail.'</p>

              <p>Sat, Jul 12, 2008 - AsiaOne</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S Law Society has replied to criticism from the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute that it does not speak out enough on law reform issues here.</p>
              <p>It does, said the society, on issues the government refers to it. It has been consulted in at least 30 instances in the last three years. Examples it cited included proposed amendments to the Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act in 2006, and the proposed amendments to the Penal Code in 2007.</p>
              <p>The Law Society issued its statement after its executive council, headed by Senior Counsel Michael Hwang, met yesterday.</p>
              <p>In essence, the society said the Human Rights Institute's comments, made in a report issued on Wednesday, were based on 'an incomplete appreciation of the position of the society and its relationship with the Government'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A self-regulatory body for the 3,500 practising lawyers in Singapore, the society's powers are governed by the Legal Profession Act, in particular Section 38(1)(c).</p>
              <p>The latter is 'commonly interpreted to mean it does not have the statutory right to comment on matters not submitted to it,' said the society. The current shape of Section 38 dates back to 1986, after the government curbed the society's powers to comment on legislation by limiting them to 'legislation submitted to it'.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">----------------------------</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Conspiracy?   I believe the response from the law society </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">is a conspiracy orchestrated by LKY :  -

              <p>LKY says that the Russian n Mainland Chinese are learning from him.Honestly speaking,i believe he think too much.Russians has just liberated from dictatorial communist rule,they know god damn well how horrible it is to be ruled under a one-party domination situation.Like all the rest of democratic countries who been through a dictatorial ruling,the Russians will not go back to one party rules situation.</p>
              <p>As for mainland China,well,they have never experienced a democratic political system throughout his 5000 yrs history.Plus,they only open up their market n interact freely with the rest of the world in 1970's n 80's.So naturally,China will be abit slow towards the road of democracy,so what does LKY expect?</p>
              <p>But even so,China didnt copy all LKY doings.At least,they didnt copy LKY "Father pass ruling power to Son" method.Even Taiwan late President Jiang Kai Shek did pass his seat to his son Jiang Jing Guo,but he n Jiang Jing Guo also didnt pass so many titles n power to all their sons,daughters,and relatives like what Lee Kuan Yew is doing right now.</p>
              <p>So if u ask me whether LKY is imagining things,my answer is yes,he think too much,LOL.</p>

              <p>Let's keep PAP out of this discussion here, the topic is on LKY's comments, which I should say, is highly uncalled for.</p>
              <p>Conspiracy? Against a country? Normally LKY's words makes at least some sense, but this is just going too far. I've read the article, and non of our MM's words make any much sense. Human rights activists gain nothing, absolutely nothing by working against our government. MM claims our system is mimicked by Russia and China, 2 notorious states that treats human rights like crap, so we are taking the flak for their outrages.</p>
              <p>Granted, I can't say our law is completely fair (take the Internal Security Act, for example), but we've got a pretty solid judiciary. Not much abuses as far as I know. Compare that against China and Russia and you'll see why these so called conspirators (that the spelling?) have bigger priorities elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Until our MM gets it into his head that he's dreaming too much, maybe he should take a long break, like 5 years or so, off of politics.</p>
