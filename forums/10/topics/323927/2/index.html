              <p>LKY says that the Russian n Mainland Chinese are learning from him.Honestly speaking,i believe he think too much.Russians has just liberated from dictatorial communist rule,they know god damn well how horrible it is to be ruled under a one-party domination situation.Like all the rest of democratic countries who been through a dictatorial ruling,the Russians will not go back to one party rules situation.</p>
              <p>As for mainland China,well,they have never experienced a democratic political system throughout his 5000 yrs history.Plus,they only open up their market n interact freely with the rest of the world in 1970's n 80's.So naturally,China will be abit slow towards the road of democracy,so what does LKY expect?</p>
              <p>But even so,China didnt copy all LKY doings.At least,they didnt copy LKY "Father pass ruling power to Son" method.Even Taiwan late President Jiang Kai Shek did pass his seat to his son Jiang Jing Guo,but he n Jiang Jing Guo also didnt pass so many titles n power to all their sons,daughters,and relatives like what Lee Kuan Yew is doing right now.</p>
              <p>So if u ask me whether LKY is imagining things,my answer is yes,he think too much,LOL.</p>

              <p>Unlike LKY and his party, the govt of China bothers to take care of the old by giving them pension.   Whenever there is disaster in China,  Wen Jia Bo is there in the venue to show care for the people, you think LKY will do the same.    </p>
              <p>He is shameless to grade his party A plus.    Self praise is international disgrace.   We are the ones who is giving them rating, he should not be rating his own party.   He knows no shame, his skin is super thick.     He is silly, he is showing Singapore and the world how foolish he has become.   I would appreciate it if he spends his time wisely to help the people of Singapore cope with the inflation.</p>

              <p>Minister Mentor rebuts human rights groups' criticism of Singapore </p>
              <p>Sue-ann Chia</p>
              <p>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew last night dismissed human rights organisations' criticisms of Singapore's style of governance, saying that they were trying to 'do us in'.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there a conspiracy to do "us" in - as in - a conspiracy to do Singapore in ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or is it an admission that the "Dirty Fascist Politics" of the Singapore Ruling Political Party has received World Class Attention ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not his usual style that when he has met his match, he will cry "wolf" that will justify his own means at using all instruments at his disposal when cornered ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In a robust rebuttal of these groups' assertions that Singapore is not a liberal democracy, he said that they had never run a country and did not know what was needed to make Singapore tick.</p>
              <p>'There is a conspiracy to do us in. Why?... They see us as a threat,' said Mr Lee at an hour-long dialogue during the Economic Society of Singapore's annual dinner.</p>
              <p>Explaining why these groups regarded Singapore as a threat, he said it was because they saw that the Russians and Chinese have been coming and studying Singapore's success story and picking up pointers.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it very unusual for MM LKY to speak that "they see us as a threat" as the Russians and Chinese have been coming and studying Singapore's success story and picking up pointers ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should Singapore's success story become a threat when the success story can only benefit the Russians and the Chinese ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has MM LKY intentionally avoid mentioning the unthinkable in his vocabulary ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The leaders of these countries ask 'how does this little country with so little talent keep its ruling party in place and run a tight ship, honest, and effective, and make progress?'</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is typical LKY's arrogance in treating Singaporeans as untalented digits as his statement reveals - "<em>how this little country with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so little talent keeps its ruling party</span> in place and run a tight ship</em>".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is he rubbing salt into the wounds that he has inflicted on us by insulting Singaporeans for having so little talent to challenge his fascist manipulation of the laws - that keep Singaporeans disenfranchised of our Political Rights, de-politicised generations of Singaporeans, so as to perpetuate his own political clout as well as that of his PAP ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>'Can they (the Russians and Chinese) do it? I don't know. But they are picking up points here and there.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was responding to a question on whether Singapore needed a Western-style liberal democracy to succeed.</p>
              <p>He said groups which advocate the need for liberal democracies were prescribing universal rules for the whole world.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is he elevating his own status with this statement that Russia and China has thrown out Marxism and Communism, and are now studying "<em>LeeKuanYew-ism</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will he be vague about the Universal Rules that he is accusing others for advocating ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why does he not claim that it is simply Basic Human Rights as identified by the International Bar Association - which had diligently written a brilliant report of the not so talented ways that the Singapore Politicians attempt to hide their political sins ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It had to take an international law group to unravel and expose the dirty political works of the Singapore Government formed by the PAP, when it should have been done by the local Law Society of Singapore - which unfortunately had cowed under the pressure of MM LKY.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Shame on the untalented legal minds in the Singapore Law Society.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But he threw down this gauntlet:</p>
              <p>'My question is to them, have you ever run Singapore? Do you know how we got here? What were we? What we are now? And how we can become better?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has LKY run a country when he first step into politics during the Colonial Days in the 1950s ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If MM LKY had allowed himself the liberties and politcal space to clamor what he had no experienced for - during the Colonial Days in the 1950s, why should he deny the same honor to the new generations, who are faced with the same autocratic rule after 43 years of independence ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is MM LKY suggesting that Human Rights has no place in governance of a country, and governments do not need to respect the individual rights of the citizens ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is a far cry from his speeches made in 1955 in the Singapore Legislative Assembly and in 1964 in the Malaysian Federal Parliament - in which both clamoured for Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly, Freedom from oppressive rules of government, and basically calling for a level playing field ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>'We are not stupid people. They give us all these advice... Who are they? Have they ever run a country, created jobs for community and given them a life? We have and we know what it requires.</p>
              <p>'Nobody (who) advocates this has any idea what they will do to a society if you implement these rules.'</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nobody has any idea of the consequences does not mean that it should not be tried ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How often have we seen the bad policies of MM LKY's administration in the 1960s through Goh Chok Tong's administration - that we have seen policies retracted too late, as the effects of bad policies have already been set in motion ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has it not been also a trial and error on the part of the PAP with its policy decisions ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should MM LKY be so negatively defensive in the usual ways when alternative views are offered by anyone else ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has been so infectious that even local forumers have adopted the same lines.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Mr Lee believes each country will have to decide which political system suits it best.</p>
              <p>'Different people have different cultures and forge different consensus and seek different solutions to their problems,' he said.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If MM LKY "believe that different people, different cultures, and forge different consensus and seek different solutions to their problems." - why will he decide to adopt Confuscianism into Singapore, which has four different ehtnic group ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why did he decide to allow pop and western cultures to enter Singapore and undermine the Singapore Youths ? </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But he was also quick to acknowledge that the People's Action Party (PAP) will not always have the answers:</p>
              <p>'I'm not saying the PAP government will always be supreme, will always be honest, will always be A-plus.</p>
              <p>'The day it is no longer honest, it should be out. And another party should come in, with equally honest people.'</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">MM LKY surely has alot to learn, if he is not aware that the rot has already set in.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Turning to the opposition, Mr Lee said:</p>
              <p>'We are not trying to block them. We are trying to force them to collect a group of people equal in competence...When we fail, they have a team that can take over.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Does he need to try so hard to convince a foreign audience that the Ruling Party is not trying to block the Alternative Political Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If MM LKY is not trying to block the activities of the Alternative Political Parties - it is due to the fact that he is "not trying" but is actually doing it.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>'But unfortunately, they can't do it. Because the people with ability, drive, ambition and energy don't want to come into politics. If they wanted to, they will join us (the PAP).'</p>
              <p>For Singapore to continue to succeed, it needs to find the next generation of top notch leaders.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is MM LKY attempting to con the foreign audience who do not have any first hand knowledge of the MM LKY's style of politics ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not a fact that those Singaporeans with the ability, drive, ambition and energy will rather stay out of politics and not join the PAP - until they are "persuaded" by the million dollar wages that MM LKY depend on as a crutch to attract his talents, and prevent corruption amongst his talented recruits ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it has to take money to attract talents, and also to prevent corruption in the Ministerial ranks - does it not speak volumes about the Singapore character, and the questionable patriotism of those few persons whom MM LKY see as the talented ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Mr Lee said the present generation of leaders could last at least two terms.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has his capabilities extend into the realm of predicting the future, by gazing deep to  looking into a large crystal ball ?</span> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But if they did not find talented people with the drive and energy and integrity to match the demands of the job during this time, 'then I say, the future is in doubt'.</p>
              <p>'The system is there, but it cannot run with mediocre men. You need top men.'</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> As matters stand, his conceited vanity prevents him from admitting that his son is incapable of strong leadership </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The PAP has managed to recruit good people and its leaders had, in turn, won the trust of Singaporeans through their integrity and honesty - values which the PAP still holds true today.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Won the trust of the people, or winning elections by manipulating the rules and shifitng the election boundaries of the constituencies to the advantage of the Ruling Party - that do not reflect political honesty ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Winning a general election that leaves Two-thirds of the electorate sitting at home, winning the total vote count that reflects the vote from approximately 28% of the qualfied population.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>He said the task of finding new leaders is no longer his:</p>
              <p>'I've done my job. I've passed it on to the next generation. Chok Tong has passed to the next generation.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why is MM LKY interfering, and continue to stick his finger in the pie ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He claimed that even when he is dead, he will rise up from the grave if anything goes wrong in Singapore - has he died and returned, or has something gone wrong that needed his continued tenure in Government ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>'If you have a competent team on board, honest and dedicated, it will last. If you have bums, then even with best of institutions, it will fail.'</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has he not already proven that when bums are smart enough to dismantle the institutions left behind by the Colonial Government, it will preserve the bums in power at the expense of the populace ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">To prevent failure to the new system and new institutions created by the bums in power, they have to resort to tighter and tighter controls and as the years go by, the rules becoming even more unrelentingly tight.</span></p>

              <h1 class="firstHeading">Asshole</h1>
              <h3 id="siteSub">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
              <p><strong>Asshole</strong> (or <strong>arsehole</strong> in <a title="British English" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">British English</a>) is <a title="Slang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang">slang</a> for the <a title="Anus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus">anus</a> and can be used to describe an unpleasant person. It is formed from <em>arse</em>, which according to the <a title="Oxford English Dictionary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> has been used since the 11th century to refer to the rump of an animal
              and since the 14th century to refer to a person's buttocks. The
              combined form <em>arsehole</em> is first attested from 1500 in its
              literal use to refer to the anus. The metaphorical use of the word to
              refer to the worst place in a region (e.g., "the arsehole of the
              world") is first attested in print in 1865; the use to refer to a
              contemptible person is first attested in 1933.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asshole#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> But as with other vulgarities, these uses of the word may have been
              common in oral speech for some time before their first print
              appearances.</p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Semantics</span></h2>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The word is mainly used as a <a title="Profanity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity">profanity</a> towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful,
              self-centered, or particularly abrasive. </strong></span>Usually, the term is directed
              at a male (in female anatomy, the focus is deflected to the <a title="Vagina" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina">nearby genitals</a>; see <a title="Cunt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt">cunt</a>). It may also sometimes be used to describe people who are viewed as stupid or useless or even meaningless, similar to <a title="Wanker" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanker">wanker</a>.</p>
              <p>This word or its literal translation is found in colloquial speech in a number of <a title="Culture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">cultures</a> (in both <a title="English language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> and other <a title="Language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">languages</a>). This is because it describes an <a title="Organ (anatomy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_%28anatomy%29">organ</a> of <a title="Defecation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation">elimination</a> that is considered a <a title="Taboo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo">taboo</a> region (since it belongs to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Intimate parts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_parts">intimate parts</a>) of the body in many <a title="Society" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society">societies</a>.</p>
              <p>The English word <em>ass</em> (meaning <a title="Donkey" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey">donkey</a>, a cognate of its zoological name <em>Equus <strong>asinus</strong></em>) may also be used as a term of contempt, referring to a silly or stupid person. In <a title="North America" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a>, the words <em>arse</em> and <em>ass</em> have become synonymous; however, in the rest of the English-speaking world, <em>ass</em> still only refers to the donkey, rather than the <em>arse</em> (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Buttock" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttock">buttocks</a>). It is worth noting that speakers of some varieties of English <a title="Rhotic and non-rhotic accents" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">“drop their Rs”</a> before consonants, leading to a pronunciation of <em>arse</em> that is quite similar to <em>ass</em>.</p>
              <p>Until the early 1990s, the word was considered one of a number of
              words that could not be uttered on commercial television in the United
              States. Comedian <a title="Andrew Dice Clay" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dice_Clay">Andrew Dice Clay</a> caused a major shock when he uttered the word during a televised awards
              show in the 1980s. However, there were PG-13 and R rated films in the
              1980s that featured use of the word, such as "The Terminator" (1984)
              and the PG-13 "National Lampoon Christmas Vacation" (1989) and "Back to
              The Future II" (1989). By 1994, however, the word was considered less
              vulgar and was featured in dialog on the long-running television series
              <em><a title="NYPD Blue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYPD_Blue">NYPD Blue</a></em>, though it has yet to become anything close to commonplace on network TV. It is important to note that while the word <em>arse</em> has found a place on broadcast television, <em>arsehole</em> is not used, probably due to its more vulgar connotation. In some broadcast edits (such as the syndication airings of <em><a title="South Park" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park">South Park</a></em>), the word is partially bleeped out—ironically, as "arseh---", with the profane half of the word intact.</p>

              <p>CSJ is a public figure it would hurt the Lees bad if something would happen to him. Not that he couldn't do anyhting to CSJ.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian authority tried to bring down Anwar Ibrahim's career in politics for good especially with the sodomy charges. They did more damage to the BN than to Anwar Ibrahim.</p>
              <p>Why me? Because I'm nobody and because they could and because they wanted it.</p>
              <p>Though I would really like to sue the NUH for forgering a false diagnosis. I have no money to hire lawyer though. Any idealist lawyer want to help me? I would pay with the money I win in the court. Every Singaporeans are afraid of the Lees and the court proceeding would not be a fair trial. after all If I were not insane it opens up other possibility of what actually happened to me.</p>
              <p>Because they are a 10 billion worth of money assholes.</p>
              <p>I tried to reason to on why but I've realised it wasn't my fault it was their problem.</p>
