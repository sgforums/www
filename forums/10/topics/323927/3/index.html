              <p>I agree.    As said in Chinese "fan lai zhang kou".   He is a good for nothing.  AT least the evil papa contributed in the past.  This arsehole contributes misery, hardship to the people.    He is one who is not capable, not wise but loves to talk as if he is something.    NO respect for him - tell him respect is earned not deserved.   He has earned no respect from us.   Someone prophesized that Singapore will be worse than before when LHl takes over.   This is so true.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Devan Nair's position in 1976 is a far cry from his position during his term as the President of Singapore - some thirty years later after LKY unceremoniously dumped Devan Nair despite their long years of association when LKY even recognised Devan Nair as  one of LKY's stout supporters during their joint co-operation to fight those whom LKY claimed to be communist sympathisers</span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Therefore, in common usage, the term paranoid addresses a range of mental conditions, assumed by the use of the term to be of psychiatric origin, in which the subject is seen to generalise or project fears and anxieties onto the external world, particularly in the form of organised behaviour focused on them. The syndrome is applied equally to powerful people like executives obsessed with takeover bids or political leaders convinced of plots against them, and to common people who believe for instance that shadowy agencies are operating against them.</p>

Willcutt &amp; Pennington (2000) from University of Colorado reported that children and adolescents with reading disability exhibited significantly higher rates of all internalizing and externalizing disorders than individuals without reading disabilities.</p>

              <p>But Dyslexia is not purely a visual problem, and the answer to the riddle has yet to be solved. One thing researchers do know it that stress, anxiety, and other factors can increase the impairment of this disorder <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">(5)</span></span></a>. Men and women, along with children cannot have their dyslexia cured, but they can learn to live with it. Unfortunately, dyslexia does not display many physical symptoms; so diagnosing the disorder can be difficult, unless one knows quite a bit about it. As a result, many children are not diagnosed until later, and still have to deal with the stresses of being thought of as an underachiever or having a lower IQ by other fellow students and even teachers. When dyslexia is combined with ADHD or bipolar disorder, the levels of stress and anxiety on an individual skyrocket, making all of the conditions worse, and forcing the student to have an even harder time with school and everyday life.</p>
              <p><strong>The possible link between dyslexia and bipolar disorder has not been nearly as extensively investigated as the two disorders in isolation. But a link may exist. If about majority of cases of bipolar disorder also involve ADHD and about half of all ADHD cases involve dyslexia and/or another learning disability, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it may be possible that a direct link between bipolar disorder and dyslexia may exist.</span> At the moment though, there is no research ongoing directly connecting the two.</strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There is a conspiracy to do us in,
              says MM Lee</span></p>
              <p>Minister Mentor rebuts human rights groups' criticism of
              Singapore </p>
              <p>Sue-ann Chia</p>
              <p>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew last night dismissed human rights
              organisations' criticisms of Singapore's style of governance,
              saying that they were trying to 'do us in'.</p>
              <p>In a robust rebuttal of these groups' assertions that Singapore
              is not a liberal democracy, he said that they had never run a
              country and did not know what was needed to make Singapore
              tick.</p>
              <p>'There is a conspiracy to do us in. Why?... They see us as a
              threat,' said Mr Lee at an hour-long dialogue during the Economic
              Society of Singapore's annual dinner.</p>
              <p>Explaining why these groups regarded Singapore as a threat, he
              said it was because they saw that the Russians and Chinese have
              been coming and studying Singapore's success story and picking up
              pointers.</p>
              <p>The leaders of these countries ask 'how does this little country
              with so little talent keep its ruling party in place and run a
              tight ship, honest, and effective, and make progress?'</p>
              <p>'Can they (the Russians and Chinese) do it? I don't know. But
              they are picking up points here and there.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was responding to a question on whether Singapore needed
              a Western-style liberal democracy to succeed.</p>
              <p>He said groups which advocate the need for liberal democracies
              were prescribing universal rules for the whole world.</p>
              <p>But he threw down this gauntlet:</p>
              <p>'My question is to them, have you ever run Singapore? Do you
              know how we got here? What were we? What we are now? And how we can
              become better?</p>
              <p>'We are not stupid people. They give us all these advice... Who
              are they? Have they ever run a country, created jobs for community
              and given them a life? We have and we know what it requires.</p>
              <p>'Nobody (who) advocates this has any idea what they will do to a
              society if you implement these rules.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lee believes each country will have to decide which political
              system suits it best.</p>
              <p>'Different people have different cultures and forge different
              consensus and seek different solutions to their problems,' he
              said.</p>
              <p>But he was also quick to acknowledge that the People's Action
              Party (PAP) will not always have the answers:</p>
              <p>'I'm not saying the PAP government will always be supreme, will
              always be honest, will always be A-plus.</p>
              <p>'The day it is no longer honest, it should be out. And another
              party should come in, with equally honest people.'</p>
              <p>Turning to the opposition, Mr Lee said:</p>
              <p>'We are not trying to block them. We are trying to force them to
              collect a group of people equal in competence...When we fail, they
              have a team that can take over.</p>
              <p>'But unfortunately, they can't do it. Because the people with
              ability, drive, ambition and energy don't want to come into
              politics. If they wanted to, they will join us (the PAP).'</p>
              <p>For Singapore to continue to succeed, it needs to find the next
              generation of top notch leaders.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said the present generation of leaders could last at
              least two terms.</p>
              <p>But if they did not find talented people with the drive and
              energy and integrity to match the demands of the job during this
              time, 'then I say, the future is in doubt'.</p>
              <p>'The system is there, but it cannot run with mediocre men. You
              need top men.'</p>
              <p>The PAP has managed to recruit good people and its leaders had,
              in turn, won the trust of Singaporeans through their integrity and
              honesty - values which the PAP still holds true today.</p>
              <p>He said the task of finding new leaders is no longer his:</p>
              <p>'I've done my job. I've passed it on to the next generation.
              Chok Tong has passed to the next generation.</p>
              <p>'If you have a competent team on board, honest and dedicated, it
              will last. If you have bums, then even with best of institutions,
              it will fail.'</p>

              <p>This senile old man just keep thinking too highly of himself, he loves overrating himself.    If he is so capable he would have recruited capable ministers who can come out with good effective solutions rather than always use money to "solve" problems.</p>
              <p>\His senility is getting from worse to worst, more to come.   Let us sit back and watch the movie, starring Lee Kuan Yew.   He is in the stage of hallucinating, getting more frustrated as days go by.    These are signs of people who are very near death.</p>
