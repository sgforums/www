            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think we need to go the the extent of discussing if THE ol' man think he is above the law in singapore. we all know he thinks he can get away with things. no need for any proof of it. he has displayed it ample times and how else can one person `influenced' sia to retrofit a first class section of a plane at a moments notice? the numerous times he chided others who do not see his point of views are also numerous. obviously, his gift of the gab, being trained legally and i am sure, after countless toastmasters session in his early days, meant that few can `take him on' publicly and come up on top.<br><br>you could also argue that he is displaying this trait from the position of strengths:<br>1. i am bloody ri &amp; cambridge liao - what are u made of?<br>2. i handbuilt singapore to what it is today - what have u done in your lifetime?<br>3. i manage complex issues all my life - what's your greatest tragedy? broke up wif your bf?<br><br>in reality, few ppl can hold a candle to what he's done. been there, done that.<br><br>of cos, for all the experience he accumulated, he should not display tt kind of c*ckiness arrogance. more so to local press. he inherited this syndrome where people sometimes are nicer to outsiders than to their own family members. they let their guards down when dealing with closed ones becos we have a closed mentality of knowing the person well, and hence is less tolerant of their weaknesses. therefore, they must be righted. but this is wrong!<br><br>come to think of think, singaporean is going thru' that phase now. you guys are now getting the short end of the stick in many things concerning public well being. FTs are living the good life here....while u r still stuck in hawker centre food complaining how chee cheong fun's price has increased 33% (i did!). on the other end of the spectrum, you have the low life of the so-called FTs coming over and opening up vices everywhere, taking up social problems amongst families to a higher level.<br><br>a more cultured society? austria my a**. how about a more `cultured' city like shenzhen?</div>

No doubt alot of that is due to "the old guard".<br><br>Sad to say that is history..... and whilst Singapore should be grateful, it does not change the fact that having no freedom of speech and little transparency is wrong. They may have their reasons for doing it but the people have the right to know. And a "1 party Singapore" is also wrong.<br><br>I do hope you don't mean that cause of what they have done in the past it doesn't matter what they do now does it?</div>
