You seem like the kind of person who nitpicks at one sentence and ignores the context-- I simply cannot let you go ahead and misinterpret what I've written.<br><br>Firstly, I wrote what the "real issue of this debate" was. This was a conclusion I drew out based on thread responses-- everyone here seems to have chosen either side, Thrash MM Lee's Contributions and Decisions alongside Need for Free Press or Defend MM Lee. <strong>As a personal opinion, I have asked that we respect what the old man has done for us, and to see his reasoning behind the assumed stifling the press.</strong> I never stated that it was right or wrong, I merely pointed out that you're missing the positive side to it in your valiant fight for what will come with its own troubles.<br><br>And honestly, about you insisting that he denies the stifling, what do you want him to do on national tv? Go on stage and state proudly "Yes, we deny free press", then get a whole slew of new criticisms worldwide? Which would probably wind up in media dissent in Singapore? Politics isn't just what you do; it's how you put it across.<br><br>Also, your choice of the word "Transparency". Please forgive me, Singapore is rated #4 worldwide on Transparency International's Least Corrupt Public Sectors. What do you think sparked off the $3million minister fee hoo-ha? Oh no, it can't be transparency.<br><br>Which brings me back to my original point-- <strong>whatever level of press freedom Singapore's media is enjoying now seems to have been effective, whatever is to come will come as we gear together for it as a nation, not groups with segmented opinions.</strong> So cut the MM some slack, he has his own beliefs and ideas for the good of Singapore, just as we trust in other measures. I can already see people flaming this statement-- before you do, look at the life you live and then begin whining.<br><br>Maybe I should just write short, concise statements from now on and spare myself the agony of having to explain my intentions :/</div>
