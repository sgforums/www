If there is no LKY, arguably GKS will do just as well. Leaders will come forward/emerged when the callin is there.</div></blockquote>Agreed! Our forefathers go way beyond MM Lee. I do respect them very much, for building up our country. Yes. We have to give LKY some respect. But he also has to respect us. Us Singaporeans, we do the labour but return home with middle-class wages...We do not (dare to) grumble. The foreigners. They do not do NS, they have good jobs, high-paid. Live the lap of luxury...We as humans all deserve some respect... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
