Their attitude is exactly the same to the original thread authors, except who has the problem in their eyes is not Australia, it is Asia.

Both depend on stereotypical images.<br><br>As I read in here a warning not to go to Australia or your children may become drug users, the same mentality in Australians who don't want Asians to come here because they may lead our children to being drug pushers.<br><br>Another reason why I detest the death penalty, it brings out the worst in a country and lets it rise to the surface for all to see.

A drug forced down the throat of many Australians in the past on duty free shopping trips to Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>Well fark me, I've never realised how Singapore was the only source of alcohol for Aussie school kids!!! Why any Australian (or indeed any foreigner) would willingly consume our vaunted Tiger Piss is frankly beyond me, but I suppose we must accept this as the gospel truth, since you say so.<br><br>Nor did I know that we force Aussie tourists to consume alcohol in Singapore!!! Judging by the quantites I've seen most Australians chug down, the revenues our country earns from alcohol must be spectacular!!! And here I was thinking that those guys were doing a good and proper job stoning themselves down at Boat Quay without our government's interference. Guess I was wrong. Could you provide more info on the compulsory drinking of Singaporean alcohol forced  onto visiting Australians? Something called 'evidence' could greatly help in a process known as 'substantiation', which could help greatly improve the credibility of this statement. It could really really help!!!

Too often while in Sydney I have seen groups of tipsy Aboriginal men wandering in the streets, engaging in loud and raunchy banter with passers-by and parked cars. Curiously enough, did you know that the Abos did not know about the delightful stuff until some two hundred years ago? :!<br><br>Surprise Surprise!!! Alcohol coincidentially showed up in Australia at the exact same time that Europeans settled the continent!!!

That Asians brought drugs came to Australia? Nothing new there mate. Europeans brought alchohol, tobacco, small pox, and lots of other pleasant surprises.

            <div class='col-md body'>Babs,<br><br>I fully agree illegal drugs is a serious problem in Asia, especially South East Asia, your immediate neighbors. We are aware and have to resort to using death penalty as the ultimate deterrence. Mandatory is necessary so that nobody should attempt to bribe the judges or the police.<br><br>Australia is now very cosmopolitan with ppl from all over the world migrating there for a better life, they bring along with them the goods the bad and the ugly.<br>But when outsiders look at Australia, we do not differentiate the whites, the Asians or the African. Even among the Asians there are Chinese from china, HKÂ… Vietnamese, Korean and even Japanese, same like whites from eastern and southern Europe. Its diff for us to tell the diff.  When we send our kids to Australia, we cannot tell them to mix around only with the Singaporean immigrants, the whites Â….. If drugs abuse is a problem in Australia, it is the Australian problem. Those who want to study there ought to be warned.<br><br>Our views on drugs abuses are very diff. Asians drugs abusers are usually schools dropouts, and no so well educated, but in Australia, drugs is an acceptable stress relief for even the well educated. DonÂ’t measure the problem using the same yardsticks.<br><br>Nobody likes death penalty, but if there is a strong medicine for a grave illness, we take it if we have to, even it does not show well about our countries. DP is by itself a tool, it wonÂ’t harm nobody by itself.<br><br>If we both agree that drug abuses, trafficking are problems, then we should be talking about how we can help each other in solving or reducing the problem, and respect our respective ways. have compassion on those addicted and punish the pushers, there should be no diff in the skin color or the nationalities.<br></div>
