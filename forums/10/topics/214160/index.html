            <div class='col-md body'>I remember this guy I've met during my NS days. Typical rich kid from a wealthy family. Often drove his dad's benz to camp. Could only count him as an acquaintance. After my NS, we stopped contact. Imagine my surprise when one day I've received his phone call. Topic: Lend him $5,000 to turn over for his share buying. I refused. Got a hunch he lost money and didn't let his parents know. He was studying at a private institution then. Totally sponsored by parents again of course.<br><br>I really wonder how people can blatantly borrow money from just an acquaintance. Shouldn't he realise that the average person cannot afford to lend that kind of money anyway. He should not have wanted to make easy money that way. That was when I realised I've forgotten he belonged to that special class. The flaunty rich type that probably think everything in life is a piece of cake.<br><br>I have a friend whose dad made him work his way from the ground up. I think "rich parents" should learn from his example. Too often in Singapore, I feel that there are too many rich parents that just simply incalculate wrong values by their very actions. The end result often seems to be materialistic, overly-ambitious sons/daughters that are too detached from everyday reality and who lack a moral compass. Is it prehaps simply a matter of "face". Who knows.<br><br>Naturally, that person never did call me again of course. I guess I was of little value to him and probably not within his class status to talk to anymore. What if people like him were to end up holding influential positions that can influence the economy or the lives of the average Singaporeans? I can only pray that people like him make up a small part of Singapore's future.<br></div>

They are down to earth and don't separate 'class' between friends. They certainly don't drive E200s or BMW Z4s around the place and most actually bother to pay back their tuition fees, especially if their parents sponsored their education.<br><br>That's responsibility, and it cannot be bought.</div>
