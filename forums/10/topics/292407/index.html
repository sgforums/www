            <div class='col-md body'>Hi formmers (this includes PRs and citizens  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ),<br><br>for purpose of discussion,<br><br>hypothetically, lets say population is 500.<br>assume unemployment rate is actually, oh...such a sensitive word...hmm...lets use a nice round number say 5%  AND!!!!!!!!!!!! this STATISTICS is purely based on   unEMPLOYED CITIZENS / TOTAL ADULT CITIZENS less disabled and sick and students. This means 25 unemployed citizens.    (where    25/500    *    100  =   5%)<br><br>That is a clear 5% who is unemployed right?<br><br>Now, Assuming I tweak this equation using my sub-O-Lever mathematics to:<br><br><strong>unEmployed RESIDENTS / TOTAL Adult RESIDENTS </strong>...<br><br>....where  RESIDENT = PR  + citizen.<br><br>What will be the new unemployment rate ?   &lt;&lt;------ !!<br><br>Assuming , now we add 500 PRs into the Population,<br><br>the equation becomes :<br><br>25 / (500+500)  *  100  = ???<br><br>The answer is  2.5%  unEmployment rate.<br><br>The mudder of all question today for you intellectuals is :<br><br><strong>1. How is the unEmployment rate actually measured?<br>2. Will unemployment rate drop when citizen unemployment rate increase but at the same time PRs increase even more?</strong><br>Can you pass my sub O-Lever mathematics quiz???<br><br>Answer me , if you are able.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

PRCs that come on MOE scholarships have a 6 year bond. So do many other scholarships that get students from India, China, and etc. But some of these scholars that I know do like it here and planned on staying here to start a family.

He die die does not want to buy a car. He says its insane to pay so much for a car when he can get for cheap for the same. Much like he can get a BWM for a normal saloon car here.  He finds it ridiculus to own a car here.<br><br>But he also always try to remind people that he can afford a car but does chose not to.<br><br>He keeps telling colleagues who are also FTs that there is no need for him to drop his precious malaysian citizenship given that, I quote him say, sg is very small and future can be anything. Work can be very tough for citizens. If he keep Malaysia passport, he still can go back if things turn bad here. His wife is 100% sg'lian.  His sisters are also like him. PRs but enjoying the benefits they can get out of PR ship. By keeping his MY citizen and using his PR ship, he is enjoying the BEST of both worlds.  Unfortunately, Sg'lians do not have this advantage. In addition to their having to spend 2 or 2.5 years (older batch) while competing with these hundreds of thousands of PRs just like him.<br>This is a fact. While same age youths of Malaysia come in to Sg to study, our boys are serving. These Malaysians are ahead by 2 to 2.5 years already.  They stand to gain in terms of currency exchange when they work . While our boys keep getting recalled , these PRs continue to gain salary without  disruption.  This continues until many many years. By then, the My counterparts have already gotten married while you are just starting out.
