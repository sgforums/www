Be it aircraft guns or lead-spitting CIWS on board ships or tactical AA guns(SP of course), I feel that a gun/missile mix would be the most ideal situation.<br><br>I feel that the removal of guns from ships CIWS or the RAF's decision to remove the guns from the Typhoon is a mistake. The last time designers tried to remove guns from aircraft in the 60s, USAF/VPAF pilots were left with nothing more lethal than their helmets to throw at each other once they were out of missiles(which happended quite often). Missile technology might have improved by leaps and bounds since then, but I just feel that a gun should be there as an added assurance. Besides, it'd be perfect when a ground based target of opportunity shows up...<br><br>And gun CIWS on ships? HMS Sheffield would have been saved had the RoyalNavy added a CIWS of any sort on her in 1982.<br><br></div>

Furthermore, it can be operating autonomously from the main weapon control system on board. Sheffield wouldn't have been sunk if their computers that controlled the radars and weapons did not shut down unexpectedly just prior to engage the deadly Exocet.  Had Sheffield have CIWS onboard that could operate autonomously, then the Exocet wouldn't have hit it.  Right after the Falkland war, Royal Navy armed all their ships with Phalanx and the newly built one with Goalkeepers.<br><br>As for the stealth expect of it, look at Taiwan's La Fayattes. They are also armed with Phalanx. Look at USN DDG-51, they also each have a pair onboard. There is no compromising when it comes to the ship defence, stealth or no stealth. There are also no completely invisible ships including La Fayattes and Visbys. The stealth features they have only help to reduce their detection range and hopefully this give the stealth ships the advance of firing their SSM first.<br><br>Lastly, the radar reflection of the Phalanx CIWS is not that bad. It will compromise RSN La Fayattes stealth features.</div>

A guy on AFM commented that if the RAF bought 231 cannon-armed Typhoons instead of the 232 w/o cannons they intend to, they could save more money.

(to wrangle more concessions out of Dassault or Boeing??). read the last sentence of the article, get the hint anyone? *wink*<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some info I dug out from US DOD site:<br>--------------<br>Block 1A incorporated a new High Order Language Computer (HOLC) to provide more processing power over the obsolete general purpose digital computer, improved fire control algorithms to counter maneuvering targets, search multiple weapons coordination to better manage engagements, and an end-to-end testing function to better determine system functionality.<br><br>Block 1B  Phalanx Surface Mode (PSUM) incorporates a side mounted Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) which enables CIWS to engage low slow or hovering aircraft and surface craft. Additionally, the FLIR assists the radar in engaging some ASCMÂ’s bringing a greater chance of ship survivability.  Block 1B uses a thermal imager Automatic Acquisition<br>Video Tracker (AAVT) and stablilization system that provide surface mode and electro-optic (EO) angle track. These Block 1B enhancements will allow day/night detection capability and enable the CIWS to engage small surface targets, slow-moving air targets, and helicopters.<br><br>LSD 41-class ships, a typical SSDS engagement suite includes RAM, the PHALANX Close-In Weapon System Block 1A, and the decoy launch system. SSDS further integrates the AN/SPS-49(V)1 radar with the medium PRF upgrade, the AN/SPS-67 surface search radar, the AN/SLQ-32(V) sensor, and the CIWS search radar.<br>--------------<br><br>It seems that USN continue to retain Phalanx even when they have RAM installed on their ships.  I would think that RSN La Fayatte would be better off having the Phalanx rather than RAM since they will come with Aster 15 or some other SAM.  RAM is good, but by purchasing another SAM, RSN will have 4 different SAMs to maintain... going to be a logistic nightmare....<br><br>BTW, the 3 other SAM systems are:<br>1. IAI Barak<br>2. Mistral<br>3. the new SAM to be installed for La Fayattes.</div>

And maybe you might have noticed at the past few AAs when the Rafale came, they did take off at some pretty odd hours AFTER the flying display has ended. No prizes for guessing who might be on board.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The RSAF was not invited to test fly the Typhoon till late 2000, and as for AA, the real thing hasn't even been here yet. Points to a totally bo-chup attitude as far as marketing the plane to Singapore.<br><br>I think the main problem the Rafale has of selling to the english speaking world is that most of us read English magazines, a lot of which are written by Brits. Though not all are like that, when one reads comparisons about the Rafale/Typhoon in magazines like Air International or Air Forces Monthly, one does detect some kind of bias.<br><br>Like I said before, the weapons integration reason is a sorry excuse, the French have already stated that the Rafale is already currently integrated with US A/A A/G weapons.<br><br>But I do feel sorry for the RoKAF, politics are again taking precedence over national defence interests...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">Here are some info I dug out from US DOD site:<br>--------------<br>Block 1A incorporated a new High Order Language Computer (HOLC) to provide more processing power over the obsolete general purpose digital computer, improved fire control algorithms to counter maneuvering targets, search multiple weapons coordination to better manage engagements, and an end-to-end testing function to better determine system functionality.<br><br>Block 1B  Phalanx Surface Mode (PSUM) incorporates a side mounted Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) which enables CIWS to engage low slow or hovering aircraft and surface craft. Additionally, the FLIR assists the radar in engaging some ASCMÂ’s bringing a greater chance of ship survivability.  Block 1B uses a thermal imager Automatic Acquisition<br>Video Tracker (AAVT) and stablilization system that provide surface mode and electro-optic (EO) angle track. These Block 1B enhancements will allow day/night detection capability and enable the CIWS to engage small surface targets, slow-moving air targets, and helicopters.<br><br>LSD 41-class ships, a typical SSDS engagement suite includes RAM, the PHALANX Close-In Weapon System Block 1A, and the decoy launch system. SSDS further integrates the AN/SPS-49(V)1 radar with the medium PRF upgrade, the AN/SPS-67 surface search radar, the AN/SLQ-32(V) sensor, and the CIWS search radar.<br>--------------<br><br>It seems that USN continue to retain Phalanx even when they have RAM installed on their ships.  I would think that RSN La Fayatte would be better off having the Phalanx rather than RAM since they will come with Aster 15 or some other SAM.  RAM is good, but by purchasing another SAM, RSN will have 4 different SAMs to maintain... going to be a logistic nightmare....<br><br>BTW, the 3 other SAM systems are:<br>1. IAI Barak<br>2. Mistral<br>3. the new SAM to be installed for La Fayattes.</div></blockquote>It seems you got a little confused. SeaRAM is NOT the same as RAM. SeaRAM is an upgraded version which would incorporate all the sensors of Phalanx Block 1B, just except the RAM missile is fired instead. SeaRAM is the one intended to replace<br>the Phalanx. RAM is currently, as you have shown, a complement, handling the outer ring of the terminal engagement, with Phalanx handling the inner ring.<br></div>

And maybe you might have noticed at the past few AAs when the Rafale came, they did take off at some pretty odd hours AFTER the flying display has ended. No prizes for guessing who might be on board.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The RSAF was not invited to test fly the Typhoon till late 2000, and as for AA, the real thing hasn't even been here yet. Points to a totally bo-chup attitude as far as marketing the plane to Singapore.<br><br>I think the main problem the Rafale has of selling to the english speaking world is that most of us read English magazines, a lot of which are written by Brits. Though not all are like that, when one reads comparisons about the Rafale/Typhoon in magazines like Air International or Air Forces Monthly, one does detect some kind of bias.<br><br>Like I said before, the weapons integration reason is a sorry excuse, the French have already stated that the Rafale is already currently integrated with US A/A A/G weapons.<br><br>But I do feel sorry for the RoKAF, politics are again taking precedence over national defence interests...</div></blockquote>Its not just politics in this farce. The money which Korea initially set aside for this acquisition has been severely devalued due to the fall in Korea's currency against the US dollar. And the F-15K isn't that bad if you consider the whole package US is offering.<br></div>

Are they equal or different?  The Rafale is the older plane among the 2, would it have room for more developements?

            <div class='col-md body'>Training wise, yes we could work something out with the Brits or Krauts, but logistics wise, it could be a additional strain seeing that we have so many permanent aircraft detachments overseas(US France Australia Brunei Thailand RoC). Since we already have detachments in France and US, it would make more sense to expand the current programs in these countries for the new fighters rather than start up and support a whole new one.<br><br>As far as technology transfer, I'm sure we can wrangle something out of Dassault. The reson why there are no buyers for the Rafale is not an indictment of its capabilities. Its because France, the developing country is not buying much, which in turn puts other customers off. But the reason why the French aren't buying is because they sank too much money into buying Mirage 2000-9s(not bad, but far from the best) and building that floating white elephant aka Charles de Gaulle and starved them of any funds for the Rafale(other than a small number of Bs and some Ms to equip the said white elephants air wing). Dassault are desparate to sell, especially to a high profile customer like Singapore, and might be more willing to give concessions.<br><br>It might be older, but by what, 5 years at most? And thats because the Typhoon was delayed again and again by development problems. And older might not be a bad thing, just compare the CFT programs for the 2. Rafale has already flight tested its CFTs and displayed it at Paris 2001(even giving a flying demo with CFTs), while they're still trying to determine the shape of the Typhoons CFT.<br><br>As for prices, I've read from a comparison sometime back that the unit price for Typhoon and Rafale are about US$60 million, though the Typhoon's might have been reduced due to econmies of scale as there are already several hundreds on order with the development countries...<br><br></div>
