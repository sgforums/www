The fighter contract is still at the RFI(Request for Information) stage. A RFI(believed to cover abt 2 dozen aircraft) was recently issued to the companies for 6 aircraft: Su-35, F-15E derivative, F-16, Rafale, Typhoon and Super Hornet. SOP would see that 3 of the aircraft will be eliminated after evaluating the Information supplied. A RFP(Request for Proposals) will then be issed to the remaining 3 manufacturers, requesting a contract to be drafted and handed to the RSAF stating costs, weapons packages and training packages, maint support etc. The winner will then be picked.<br><br>2. The helo is now at the RFP stage. 4 of the contenders (Super Lynx - too short legged, Super Seasprite - also too short legged, and IMO too old base tech, and EH101 - too big) have been eliminated. RFPs have been issued for 3 aircraft: Seahawk, AS532 Cougar and NH90. It is believed that the RFP includes a clause for supply of land-based utility helos for future UH-1 replacement, and the naval requirement is actually 9-12 aircraft.<br><br>Source: AFM Feb 2002<br><br>I might be wrong here, but I believe AA2002 is too soon to announce the winner of either contract.<br><br>PS. What the f*** is it with the Eurofighter people? 2 AAs running they'll be sending that damn plywood scale model instead of one of the 7 flying prototypes. Are they even interested in the contract, or is the shit ptogram so far behind schedule and in such deep shit that they can't spare 3 weeks to demonstrate the real aircraft to a potential customer. and its not just us, it was the same deal with the Koreans, every aircraft fighting for the RoKAF contract sent flying examples to the Korean airshow, except, yup you guessed it, the Typhoon.

These 2 contracts are indeed very interesting.  As for the Helo contract, I read from Flight International that the NH90 is probably the preferred choice.<br><br>As for which next gen fighters, seriously, I think the modified Vipers and Super bugs will have the biggest choice. F-15E is not going to make it since they failed to get RKoAF to sign on the dotted line....  Personally, I like the Rafales, but then again weapon and system integration will eventually prove too expensive unless Dassault is willing to foot the bill.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>PS.

In this sense, I think the Typhoon Tranche 3 or at least, Trance 2 will do the job.<br>However, your second point is IMHO, less of a concern. Come on, the F-16 has been in service for how long, almost 30 years? All conceivable flight problems have been ironed out, during flight testing and operational flight, including war time maneuvers. The Block 60, while it cannot handle the SU-30 threat, will be able to do deep-strike pretty well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>according to Jane's, the helo contract would prob be signed this AA, with the fighter one in the next...but i read it some time back so i don't know if there might be any changes...<br><br>the F-16 would prob not be the choice, cause if you look at how they replaced the MGBs with frigates, they seems to like replacing there stuff with platforms that are far superior to what they currently have in the inventory...<br><br>the plane would prob be optimised for the air role, cause the F-16s would take over the strike role from the A4s plus the RSAF would prob be getting the F-35 in the future...so that prob rules out the F-18s...my choice would be the Typhoons...it is more capable than the Raphale, and also more stealthy and newer than the F-15 and the Su35...but the Su35's maneuverability would be hard to beat, what with its thrust vectoring and canards...</div>

However, its not that far fetched. In 1999/2000 a worldwide grounding order for ALL Chinooks(from basic A model to the US SpecOps MH-47E - which were new builds) took place, and lasted at least a few weeks. In terms of service the Chinook has lasted even longer than the F-16, and it arguably utilises even lower tech than the F-16. The Chinook ground was ok, heavylift capability will be affected that few weeks, little harm don.

Although baseline systems do differ, in the near future most of the major systems on board this 2 types would be similar. Radar, weapons will all be standardised. There are those who doubt Rafales capability, but to be honest, in terms of A/G especially but also in overall terms, I have even graver doubts on the Typhoon. Its obvious even to the biggest Typhoon fan that the program is WAAAAAYYYY behind schedule. That coupled with the fact that production for the launch nations will take precedence over any exports, means that the cows might come home before we get any Typhoons. That seems to be the consortiums marketing attitude also, judging from the way they've been giving potential customers the short shrift when it comes to trying to market their product. Perhaps they feel that they've sold enough aircraft, and the South Koreans and we should feel pretty pissed off with their attitude.<br><br>Oh, BTW, I've debated the merits of Rafale and Typhoon with others on this board before, and have agreed to disagree on this issue previously and really have no intention to start again. Suffice to say, my choice was(and still is by quite a big margin)Rafale. However in light of recent events my 2nd choice has now shifted away from the Typhoon to the F-15E derivative, if and only if the US clears the SLAM-ER for export to Singapore. And who would bet against that?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 31 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting views on the F-15E.  However, most aviation scientists and pilots have agreed that the F-15 may not survive in a knife fight vs a flanker.  The F-15E is really not much more maneuverable than the C/D, so I guess, it too will not be able to handle the Flanker's maneuverability.<br><br>Yes in a Standoff BVR engagement, western avionics may be the cutting edge of the Strike Eagles.  But remember, M'sian flankers may not be using pure Russian Avionics.  And when the distance closes, HMS and advanced dogfight missile counts.  And the aircraft's maneuverability will determin who gets the first shot and who can dodge bullets better.<br><br>The Typhoon, though unproven, boasts super maneuverability due to its "unstable" flight design.  And with the ECR-90 + the BAe Meteor, it will supposedly have the edge in both BVR and WVR fights.  The biggest problem is that it has not proven its abilities in combat, whereas the strike eagle has already earned its spurs since 1991.<br><br>True, the Europeans made some pretty screwed up planes, eg. Tornado ADV/GR.  But they have daringly stepped into new flight designs which may yield some fruitful results.<br><br>Personally, I'd rather take the Rafael over the F-15E.  Although Typhoons would be the best.</div>

Another part was that they could not decide who was responsible for the Advanced Short Range AAM (ASRAAM). Raytheon/Hughes had issues with BAe, so was the US govt and the British. In the end, the US decided to pursue development of AMRAAM to replace the Sparrow which was deemed as more important, and left the development of ASRAAM to the British. They eventually pulled out the joint program altogether after having some sort of issues.   They were basically left with Mike-winders for a while until all of a sudden, the Russians were doing fantastic maneuvers at air shows and their latest WVR were reported to have 45/60 degree off bore sight. That got the Americans worried and thus started the JHMS and X-winders development. The rest is history...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

There was 2 articles from foreign newspapers, that Singapore ordered Exocets for the frigates. However, nobody can verify whether the info is accurate or not, though. This piece of info surprised quite a few people from another biard, me included. Why get Exocets when you can get Harpoons, and already got Harpoons? Performance wise, I place my bet on the Harpoon. Only reasons I can think of for having the Exocet is:<br>1. Integration costs for installing and making the Harpoon combat system compatible to a French design, which would most probably have to be paid for ourselves, or the integration done ourselves.<br>2. The French are willing to sell them cheap when they come in a package with the La Fayettes.<br>3. A diversity of ASMs, perhaps?<br><br>1 more thing: do you think they will be fitted with a last ditch defense system, like the Goalkeeper or Phalanx? If so, I hope they go for SeaRAM- a good, multipurpose missile.<br><br>[This message has been edited by YourFather (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The phalanx, okay though small, will still reflect radar waves.  Our frigates are like supposed stealthy right?  Maybe it the phalanx will just pop up from the hull when needed. *shrugs his shoulders*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope nope. the SeaRAM is different from the RAM. The RAM is currently used as the 'outer ring' of terminal defence, with Phalanx constituting the 'inner ring'. However, the Phalanx's limitation is slowly becoming apparent in the USN's transformation to a littoral navy, and SeaRAM would replace the Phalanx and RAM combination by combining the sensors of the Phalanx with the RAM missiles.<br>1 more thing. RAMs with the HAS upgrade (just a software upgrade) will also have the capability to engage low flying aircraft as well as surface craft. Nice feature, eh?</div>
