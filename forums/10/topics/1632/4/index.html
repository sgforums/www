Play "Who blinks first" with the Americans? Are you nuts? If watching Operation Enduring Freedom on TV taught me anything, its don't mess with the Americans. We need them much much more than they need us. Full stop.<br><br>As for securing AMRAAMS and Meteors first before crossing their paths, thats not very useful either. Unless we secure licence production rights(an I seriously doubt that) denial of the missiles, spares and other tech stuff woild really hurt. However don't forget, the Meteor is also slated to equip the Rafale, so I really don't understand why I keep hearing that one of the Typhoons advantage is the Meteor.<br><br></div>

Its unlikely British aviation writers would vote for the Rafale would they? If you go to AFM's website forum, the pro-Typhoon anti-Rafale bias is as strong as the "J-10 is the world's best fighter" stance on the Chinese forums. By reading the link posted here on a couple of days back, the Korean pilots(ie the people who'll actually use the planes) prefer the Rafale. Says quite a lot actually...<br><br>BTW the 18 Brimstones config is just a theoretical loadout. I'd like to see that loadout in a real mission, will probably have the combat radius to fly from Tengah to Mersing and back   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

While they basically have very little to lose if we deny them base access, we lose lots more in terms of our own security. They take action on arms transfers, we lose they don't lose. We hit back by denying basing rights, they lose a bit, we lose lots.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>News guys:<br><br>PAUL LEWIS / WASHINGTON DC - Flight International -25th Jan 2002<br><br>A new turbofan platform is preferred although Hawkeye 2000 update is an option<br><br>The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) has begun a new airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) system to replace its Northrop Grumman E-2C Hawkeyes. The emerging need is seen as a follow-on to the RSAF's purchase of new fighters.<br><br>Singapore's four E-2Cs are 15 years old and facing systems obsolescence. The aircraft were built to Group 0 standard, equipped with APS-138 radar, which puts them three configurations behind the US Navy's latest Hawkeye 2000 version. The upgrade of Egyptian and Japanese Group 0 aircraft will leave Singapore two standards behind any other operator by next year.<br><br>The country has the choice of upgrading its aircraft with the Hawkeye 2000's APS-145 radar, improved IFF identification system, new mission computer and tactical displays, or acquiring a new system. The indications are that the RSAF's leadership favours the latter option, and a jet-powered platform rather than another turboprop.<br>Singapore has been briefed on a number of systems. These include the Northrop Grumman MESA-radar equipped Boeing 737 ordered by Australia, a proposed AEW&amp;C version of Fairchild Dornier's 728 regional jet equipped with either a Hawkeye radar or a new electronically steerable array or Raytheon's latest Airbus A321-based offering fitted with the Elta Phalcon.<br><br>Israel Aircraft Industries is also understood to have discussed with Singapore a radar equipped Gulfstream V business jet, as well as possibly a signals intelligence version of that platform. Some in Singapore advocate making the jump to a distributed network employing long endurance/high flying unmanned air vehicles, though the RSAF first choice remains a manned platform.<br><br>For now, Singapore is gathering information and any replacement decision will likely have to await Singapore's selection of a next generation fighter, suggest sources.<br><br>Looks like the Wedgetail may really come true, but I'd rather go for the  Phalcon.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's more, courtesy of Business Times:<br><br>Development of LALEE drone started 3 years ago, says Mindef's chief scientist<br><br>SINGAPORE Technologies Engineering's involvement in a study to conceptualise<br>and develop a long-endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was revealed yesterday by Lui Pao Chuen, chief defence scientist at the Ministry of Defence (Mindef).<br><br>Details of the study to develop a surveillance drone were unveiled for the first time at the Republic of Singapore Navy's Naval Platform Technology Seminar by Professor Lui.<br><br>"We have just completed a three-year-long study of LALEE which is an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system, designed to provide continuous temporal coverage over a very large area," he said.<br><br>"Providing a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air with this class of UAV will be considerably cheaper than operating current generation of surveillance and communications<br>platforms."<br><br>Prof Lui told BT that the UAV's name is an acronym which stands for "low altitude, long-enduring endurance". He explained that endurance refers to the drone's ability to stay aloft for long periods to scan the skies and the earth's surface continuously, while "enduring endurance" means a long service life.<br><br>The LALEE UAV is a twin-boom, single-span pilotless aircraft which carries its sensor payload slung between a central pod. No details on the LALEE's dimensions or performance were released, but Prof Lui did drop hints on the size of the drone.<br><br>"You don't realise how big it is because in the picture, there is no scale," he said.<br>"The radar is about eight metres long<br>by one-and-a-half metres deep. Can you imagine this sort of size hung underneath? And you can replace it with a smaller pod when you're carrying other types of sensors."<br><br>Prof Lui added that engineers from Mindef, theDefence Science and<br>Technology Agency and ST Engg are now finishing the UAV's preliminary design in partnership with its designer, Burt Rutan.<br><br>The US-based aircraft designer won worldwide<br>acclaim for creating Voyager, a revolutionary plane which made a record non-stop, un-refuelled round-the-world flight in 1986.<br><br>"He's a very prolific designer," Prof Lui said. "In the past 30 years he has designed one to two new aeroplanes every year. So the next step would be for us to take the design and build a proof-of-concept prototype aircraft, and at the same time prepare for full-scale development. This is a major<br>project in line with our belief that information is critical and therefore we're willing to put our resources to acquire the<br>information necessary for our war-fighting operations."<br><br>The local industry will be developing the aircraft in Singapore, he added, noting that Singapore's defence engineers have participated in aircraft developments before.<br><br>"The first one was the EC-120 (light helicopter), then there have also been upgrades of our aircraft like the A-4 and F-5," he said. "Our engineers have experience in integrating systems on board aircraft. The jump will be more of taking the total responsibility for this new aircraft. This is a serious study in order that you have an option to make a decision some time<br>in the future."<br><br>Prof Lui reflected that although the LALEE drone has drawn interest from several countries, demand for such a UAV was weak<br>several years ago. He said: "When we started our studies on LALEE three years ago, no one in the West was interested in it."<br><br>He noted that France, Sweden and the US have since expressed interest in the study. "They are talking to us because we invested three years of study," he said. "Any questions they have asked us, we've already looked at the questions and got some answers. And therefore we are a very good partner for potential<br>collaboration.<br><br>"We put ourselves in that position because we dared to take a step forward. We dare to dream, to do and not sit back and wait for other people to do and then follow them."<br><br></div>

The Phalcon, under my impression, is a direct competitor to the Sentry, as it offers much higher performance than the Sentry. Besides, are you sure the Phalcons AESA radar is "encapsulated within a Hawkeye type rotating disc"? I remember a published photo of a plane with the Phalcon system not having any of the 'disc' as seen on the Sentry or Hawkeye.</div>

Also makes good sense, I'm sure one of the roles it would eventually play is over the horizon targetting of SSMs/ASMs. In this way basically it takes over part of the duties of the Fokker MPAs and Hawkeyes. At no risk to pilots.<br><br></div>

Little has been revealed about its capabilities, it may say low but low compared to what? Low compared to  AEW systems, low compared to a Tornado? We don't know till we learn more.</div>
