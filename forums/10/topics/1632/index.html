Puzzled me atfirst, but probably they made it very cheap and offered tech transfer as well, otherwise Singapore would have gone for the Harpoon, IMHO.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. The Aster 30 is actually an Aster 15 with a rocket booster stage added. It has a much longer range (range of 80+km) than the Aster 15.<br>One country, forgot which but should be Britain i guess,which originally considered buying a mix of 15s and 30s, decided not to buy Aster 15s, as the Aster 15's cost was almost the same as the Aster 30.(sorry, but i read this some time ago, and i dont remember where i got it from)<br>Anyway, more on the Aster30 : it is an inertially guided missile with a datalink capability, and an active seeker for terminal guidance. With a max speed of Mach 4, it has the capability to pull off a pretty amazing 62Gs, through the use of side-thrusters. All-in-all, the Aster 30 is a missile which is definitely comparable in performance to the US Standard missile series, and most probably even exceeding the capabilities of the Standard missiles.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>well, that depends on what aspect of the Standard we are talking about...i believe it is still the only missile capable, as was demonstrated last week, of intersception out of the atmosphere, using an SM3 LEAP...but within normal parameters, sure...but we must keep in mind that the Standard has been around for some time, which means it is more thouroughly tested, but also that the base technology is older...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True, true, but if I am not wrong, they are developing an Aster 45 version for TMD too. But anyway, we wont have to contend with a ballistic missile threat in the forseeable future, thankfully..... do you think that the Aster 30 or the SM-2 Block IIIB could do an intercept of a typical MLRS system rocket?

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not impossible for SA Radar to track rockets.  And if the fire control radar can lock on to it, it should be able to hit without a problem.<br><br>However, MLRS's are usually used in saturation.  So I guess, a lot of SAMs would be needed to shoot down rockets.  The longer-ranged version of the Astros II, (forgot designation) has only 4 tubes.  Which means 4 long range rockets, so it will depend on the number of Astros II's Malaysia is getting.  If they have 10 of them, and if they are used at long range all at once, there will be 40 rockets in the air.  SAMs will then have to contend with more missiles and possibly more errors.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, yes, by the time they fired their rockets, it'll probably be too late, and all we could do is too do damage reduction by shooting off some of the rockets. Well, that then leaves us with finding them and killing them B4 they shoot. how we gonna do that?tsk tsk.... really problematic.... even if we had ASTOR or J-STARS, we won't be able to pinpoint them... counter-artillery radars would only pinpoint their positions AFTER they have fired.... aiyaiyaiyaiyai...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 more thing I forgot - is Singapore going to announce its decision on the fighter-replacement for the A-4SUs this March in Asian Aerospace 2002? I heard so from another board, only thing is, I thought it would be announced in 2008. Also, what about the 6 helis for the frigates and the utility helicopters?</div>
