            <div class='col-md body'>Forumer is only as powerful as the people who care to give their fair comments and opinions honestly as they feel about them.<br><br>As the newspapers are completely under the control of the government so it is unlikely that forums' leading comments on major issues and problems will be published by them.<br><br>So the only truths people could find will be published in forums.<br><br>The following has been posted in this forum on many millions lost by civil servants as reported by the AG. (Copies sent to Straits Times and Today but it is doubted it will be published.)<br><br>Dear Editor,<br><br>Most businesses are today still managed in an ad hoc manner. This is the root cause of many problems confronting management of businesses and government services.<br><br>In such an ad hoc management, the top manager or CEO is seldom concerned with implementation. A decision or policy will be made and it will often be left to the staff below conveniently called middle management to cope with it.<br><br>Such ad hoc management relies on intangible concepts like decisions or policies which give rise to complexities and uncertainties resulting in idling, delays, inefficiencies, losses, or malpractices.<br><br>Ask the CEOs this question: Are you able to implement decisions and policies made in an effective hands-on manner with due processes, measurements, and corrective actions taken as part of the staffÂ’s daily work routines or are you relying on staffÂ’s own reporting or year-end post-mortem financial reporting or Management Audit to determine the cause or causes of problems.<br><br>Ask your top management or CEO : Are you taking preemptive or corrective or advance actions to solve problems in advance or are you leaving issues and problems to financial or management audit before taking actions.<br><br>While Management Audit seeks to discover problems, OSP Process Management is aimed at preventing problems and solving them in advance before their occurrence.<br><br>(1) Establish tasks in Follow-through component work processes.<br><br>(2) Objective supervision, Clear definitions of roles, duties and quality-time-cost control.<br><br>(3) Coordination and knowledge application.<br><br>(4) Effective Communication and feedbacks.<br><br>(5) Logical work processes, measurement of performance, corrections.<br><br>(6) Objectivity, accountability and transparency.<br><br>(7) Clearly defined Filing, retrieving of records.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Motivation of workers in knowledge application.<br><br>(9) Effective Departmentalisation and delegation.<br><br>As the saying goes, it is easy to find faults as anyone can make mistakes. There is yet another common Chinese saying: there is no lack of vision among men but often it is the lack of implementation ability which causes problems.<br><br>The key principle in OSP (Objective-Steps Processing Management System published by the undersigned) is to guide the whole organization to work with coordination, teamwork and knowledge application at every level.<br><br>Will management auditor ever realize that it will not be most effective in finding faults or recommend solutions through finding faults.<br><br>Instead it should set up tasks such that all tasks could be accomplished in cause-effect lego-like component work processes with management being able to take actions for proactive result-oriented performance, where work processes are set up enabling staff to take hands-on control, comparison, processing and corrections to attain organizational efficiency and productivity.<br><br>Will management audit leads to tasks being set up in cause-effect component work processes to empower staff to achieve higher level of efficiency through coordination, teamwork and knowledge application by all staff?<br><br>Therefore, there is no end to finding faults as after finding out faults. What is more important is not to find faults whether of technical or routine as there will always be faults but whether top management or CEO has the capability to take hands-on actions to implement all the major policies and decisions.<br><br>Such major decisions should include carrying out tasks with efficiency, accountable good corporate governance and results.<br><br>If the solutions are proposed after the events or faults are discovered then there is not much credit to be given as any one could understand problems better in hind sight.<br><br>Do the auditor or the auditing profession understand such fault finding is not sufficient for he himself probably may be unaware or unable to prevent its occurrence in the first place in most situations.<br><br>If government must spend millions on conducting post-event management audits just to find fault, it might as well spend a small fraction on preventing problems from occurring in the first place and become more efficient or creative think again to meet so many globalization challenges ahead which depend largely on such management skills.<br><br>In OSP government will be able to foresee and prevent problems by carrying out all its tasks in objectively planned component work processes and process them through the call centre so that everyone will be able to work with coordination and teamwork and knowledge application to upgrade your efficiency and productivity to achieve higher results.<br><br></div>
