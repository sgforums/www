              <p><em>This article first appeared in <a href="http://hammersphere.sg/2009/08/the-necessary-privileges-of-citizenship/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hammersphere</span></span></a>.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Employment: The unlevel playing field</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The current system makes it cheaper to hire foreigners or PRs, compared to Singaporeans.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Employers do not have to make employer CPF contributions for expatriate employees. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The employer CPF contribution rate for new PRs is much lower (4% for the first year and 9% in the second) than for Singaporeans. So effectively, foreigners are up to 14.5% cheaper to hire than Singaporeans.</span></strong> This is especially so for Employment Pass holders, where there is no foreign worker levy applied to them.</p>
              <p>In addition, foreigners do not have to make the mandatory 20% employee CPF contribution, so their asking salaries can be lower. Singaporean men have to be given up to 40 days of leave per year for reservist training. This all adds to the cost of hiring Singaporeans and makes us uncompetitive through no fault of our own.</p>
              <p><strong>Suggestion: Apply the same employer CPF across the board</strong></p>
              <p>For foreigners, the 14.5% employer CPF contribution should be paid by their employers. It could go into a fund that would be deposited into the employee’s CPF account when he takes up PR or citizenship, or go to the Skills Development Fund if he decides to leave the country. This serves a dual purpose of levelling the playing field and helping to fund skills upgrading for Singaporean workers.</p>
              <p>It was argued during the show that it is unfair to take away foreign employees’ hard-earned money. But the fact is that currently, employers are not obliged to pay any of this 14.5%.</p>
              <p>For PRs, employers should be required to make the full 14.5% employer CPF contribution the moment an employee becomes a PR, instead of the current graduated increments starting at just 4% for the first year.</p>
              <p><strong>Tertiary fees: Taxpayers subsidising foreigners</strong></p>
              <p>It is puzzling why the Ministry of Education chooses to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>subsidize foreigners’ education</strong></span> in our local polytechnics and universities <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">so excessively</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>In the National University of Singapore (NUS) for engineering courses, Singaporeans pay $6,360, PRs pay $7,000 and foreigners $9,540. This includes a tuition grant from the Ministry of Education (MOE) to the tune of $26,400 each, which is available to all students, local or foreign.</p>
              <p>This means that over a 4-year stint as an undergraduate, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">a foreign student enjoys $105,600 in subsidies from the government. This is a huge bill for taxpayers</span></strong>!</p>
              <p>In contrast, in the University of California, residents pay US$8,700 per year in tuition, while foreigners pay US$30,721. That’s more than three-and-a-half times higher fees that foreigners have to fork out. International students are not eligible for any government-funded tuition grants.</p>
              <p>Even in our polytechnics, all foreign students are given a $14,231 per year tuition grant by MOE, which is the same as the grant given to Singaporeans. As with NUS, the only condition is that they must agree to work in Singapore for 3 years after graduating.</p>
              <p>In most other developed countries, foreign students fund the fees of local students. In Singapore, taxpayers fund the fees of foreign students. This doesn’t seem right.</p>
              <p><strong>Suggestion: Remove foreigners’ tuition grant to benefit Singaporeans</strong></p>
              <p>The tuition grant should be gradually removed for foreigners, with the extra funds used to provide grants to all students from lower and middle income Singaporean families</p>
              <p>Education is not welfare. It is a very worthwhile investment in our future generations and our future workers. I appreciate that our universities claim that no student will be denied an education because of financial difficulty, but I feel that more can be done to help low and middle income families pay for tertiary education. This will help tremendously with social mobility.</p>
              <p>While I support the government’s goal to make Singapore an education hub, we should do this by improving the quality of education here, not paying for foreigners’ education with taxpayer money.</p>
              <p><strong>Are Singaporeans anti-foreigner?</strong></p>
              <p>Generally I don’t think Singaporeans have anything personal against foreigners. I certainly can’t claim that notoriety since a large proportion of my close friends and colleagues are non-Singaporeans. But many of us disagree with the government’s overly liberal immigration policy.</p>
              <p>We cannot talk about benefits to Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners in isolation from the large proportion of non-Singaporeans living in Singapore.<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> In Singapore, 35% of residents are foreigners. Singapore citizens (including naturalised citizens) make up only 65% of the population.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Our proportion of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>immigrants is 50% higher than that of Australia, twice that of Canada, and three times that of the US, but we have so much less space and resources. We are already the second densest populated country in the world.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In other developed countries, PRs generally get the same benefits as citizens. But foreigners don’t make up such a high percentage of the population and are not increasing as such a high rate.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that that many Singaporeans are uncomfortable with the huge influx of foreigners. All these plans to increase Singapore’s population to 6.5 million or more makes Singaporeans very uneasy.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I emphasised on the show that I agree that foreigners are necessary for our economy, particularly since Singaporeans are not replacing themselves by having enough children. However, this does not mean that we should open the floodgates to let in so many foreigners. A little more balance and common sense is needed.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Citizens’ rights and privileges</strong></p>
              <p>It was argued during the show that foreigners and PRs should get the same subsidies and privileges as Singaporeans, because they pay the same taxes. This is not the right way of thinking. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">You cannot measure privileges received based on the individual’s economic contribution to the country.</span></strong> If that’s the case, then poor Singaporeans should be thrown out of their HDB flats, because they usually don’t need to pay income tax.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Instead we should recognize that there are both obligations (e.g., NS) and privileges that come with citizenship.</strong></span> Singaporeans have made a commitment to this country – a commitment that no PR can claim to have made until he takes up citizenship and renounces all foreign citizenships.</p>
              <p>As such, higher subsidies and more privileges compared to foreigners and PRs are rights of all Singapore citizens.</p>

              <p>When they thought up of past policies like the CPF scheme years back, the planners did not anticipate that in the future (present moment), singapore would choose to open the floodgates to foreigners at such a massive rate in such a short time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the government now, they are in a no win situation - all in the name of making a few more bucks.  It's like opening Pandora's Box - CPF, low wages, housing, NS, PRs, foreigners, jobs, social welfare, education all coagulating into one massive social, economic, political problem directly from this open door policy. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How to balance all these?  Nope, they did not think about it when they relaxed the immigration rules - they were justing thinking about where the next dollar would come from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore definitely needs foreign workers and foreign talent.  But the situation now is getting too ridiculous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <div id="content">
              <div id="contentleft">
              <div class="postarea">

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <strong>The Current Affairs Desk</strong></div>
              <p>In his inaugural speech, Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Mr Viswa Sadasivan said, “It has often been said that Singapore does not have an ideology – that pragmatism is our mantra and modus operandi. But if we examine our National Pledge closely, it is our national ideology – a set of inalienable values, precepts that demand adherence in the face of the lure of pragmatism.”</p>
              <p>This challenge to pragmatism, even by our National Pledge, was something that was deemed so unacceptable that Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who heard about it from the newspapers, while “doing physiotherapy”, had to <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Transcripts/Minister+Mentor/Dangerous+to+let+highfalutin+ideas+go+undemolished+MM.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">intervene in the debate</span></span></a> to “bring the House back to earth”, by calling the NMP’s arguments “false and flawed (and) completely untrue”.  The NMP certainly did touch a raw nerve, when he suggested in Parliament that pragmatism is but a lure, especially for the ruling party.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) concept of good government is actually a version of communitarian democracy.</span></strong>  Communitarian ideology emphasizes the need to balance individual rights and interests with that of the community as a whole, but its focus on social cohesion raises similarities with various forms of authoritarianism.</p>
              <p><strong>Social Control</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Upon independence in 1965, a massive cultural transformation of the population was necessary for Singapore to develop economically</strong></span>. This was when <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the ideology of ‘survival of the nation’ was conceptualised.</strong></span> This ideology of survival has <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>now become the basic concept for rationalisation which extends beyond pure economics to almost all spheres of a Singaporean’s life.  If social control can be shown to contribute to economic growth, it is considered necessary for ’survival’ and hence ‘pragmatic’.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But are “pragmatic” policies or “pragmatism” always good?</p>
              <p>It is but pragmatism which made Members of Parliament (MP) responsible for their estates. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Town councils</strong></span> were introduced only in 1989 but 20 years on, its aim has not been achieved as <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/06/20-years-of-town-councils-yet-no-stake-in-governance-for-residents"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong admitted</span></span></a> in June this year. Its aim? <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>To “give them (residents) a stake in the process of governance”. SM Goh explained.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>How do you foster such a thing when in Singapore MPs do not run estates anyway</strong>, for all intent and purposes.<strong> Instead, the towns are run by professional town managers, employed by the town councils.  So, why pretend that they are?</strong></span> As it is, many of our MPs and ministers are overburdened with multiple duties. Take Mr. Teo Ser Luck, for example. He is now Mayor, MP, Parliamentary Secretary and heads the Youth Olympic committee, along with other commitments. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for the other MPs, they have multiple directorships in private and government-linked companies, heads various committees such as Government Parliamentary Committees (GPC), on top of their personal careers.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>MPs</strong></span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>being so well paid, should focus exclusively on national policies. This can only benefit Singapore and Singaporeans.</strong></span>  We face challenging times in this globalised world, as the government has so often reminded us.  More heads dedicated to these issues would be the logical thing to do and MPs should therefore be focused on more important national issues rather than be drained by municipal issues. We ought to have non-political grassroots organisations and leaders to take care of these things.</p>
              <p><strong>Grassroots</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The Grass-Roots Organizations (GROs) are there to serve a purpose –</strong> they are <strong>PAP’s mouthpiece, to explain and convince people of the various government policies, and to be the eyes and ears for the PAP.</strong></span> The citizens who are somewhat supportive of the opposition are not allowed to climb the ranks of the grassroots. Moreover, the opposition MPs, do not get to be advisors for GROs, which are all under the purview of the People’s Association, which is a statutory board chaired by the Prime Minister. The advisors to the GROs (even in opposition held constituencies) invariably turn out to be PAP men or supporters.</p>
              <p>This is the ‘pragmatism’ of the PAP – resulting in a system which is inherently communitarian.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The ruling PAP’s policies are two-fold.</strong></span> And this has been so for the last 43 years. It is simply this:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Keep the ordinary Singaporeans anxious and worried about their immediate surroundings their daily lives.</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Leave the “bigger” things to the government.</strong></span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>If looked upon closely, this has been the underlying principle in all PAP policies. With this underlying principle, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>it is hardly surprising that the PAP now talks of devolvement of responsibilities through the town councils and the constant encouragement to “upgrade skills”.  Politics in Singapore is reserved for the handpicked ‘elite’, which results in the almost total absence of politics from the general populace.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Just as the GROs are not natural but created to serve ‘pragmatism’, so is trade unionism. They are created exclusively to serve the PAP and its brand of ‘pragmatism’.</p>
              <p>This is manifested through <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the appointment of top union leaders who are pro-PAP. These unions thus become para-political, which defeats the purpose of setting up unions in the first place.</strong></span> In the 50s, unions in Singapore were not para-political but truly fought for the rights of the workers. This should be the purpose of unions.</p>
              <p><strong>A Constitution only in form</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Under the PAP’s pragmatic approach it governs through law rather than by law, making amendments to the Constitution as it pleases. This has led some to quip that Singapore does not have a Constitution at all. </strong></span>The PAP takes up more than two-thirds of the seats in parliament, and through the party-whip, PAP MPs are not allowed to vote against the party. Hence, constitutional changes are undertaken with speed as the absolute majority supports it, an aspect praised as a “Singapore advantage” by the government. The executive body is thus infused with the ethos of pragmatism; as such it is an instrument of social control, tailored to the ever changing needs of Parliament, the sole authority of law making.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The PAP’s pragmatic approach has inculcated a sense of apathy among the citizenry. Their constant re-emphasizing of the need for economic growth in a competitive environment has led to a generation growing up to be individualistic and ‘kiasu’.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pragmatism has also made the ‘paper chase’ the sole priority of any student, so much so that many have forgotten the importance of being politically aware and in speaking up.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The effects of the pragmatic ruling party on the de-politicised students were beginning to show as early as in the 1970s</strong></span>; merely 10 years after the ruling party came to power. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Mr Goh Keng Swee</strong></span> (the chief architect of modern Singapore’s economy) in <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>pleading with university graduates in 1971 to take a personal interest in the affairs of their country and make an effort to understand issues and provide leadership in forming public opinion,</strong></span> said, “Too many people regard political ideas not as serious matters affecting their lives but as topics for idle discussion. Nor do they ask of themselves, what is the relevance of these notions to the situation of Singapore today, tomorrow and in the next decade.”</p>
              <p><strong>Dare to dream?</strong></p>
              <p>Communitarian democracy as practiced by the PAP is one of constant vigilance, where it sees itself as the guardian of collective interest. Phrases such as, ‘harming the social fabric’ or ‘ for the good of the society’ are often verbalised by the PAP when introducing controversial legislations or policies. Yet, beneath this postulation of a shift in ‘ideology’, pragmatism is still undertaken by the PAP as the sole driving force. And so the negative impact prevails.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The PAP’s brand of politics in choosing and championing pragmatism, has trumped and rendered obsolete all ideologies.  But what good are the competencies and expertise of pragmatism, if it is not tempered with ideology?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Ideology is not a bad word.  Ideology is but the core fundamental beliefs and political principles which exist independent of considerations for competencies and expertise.  For how can we assess  political leaders based solely on technocratic effectiveness and expertise in crafting policies, which pragmatism prescribes, without regard to ideology?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Just as it is possible to become too rigid and unyielding in upholding ideological beliefs by adhering excessively to principles without regard to consequences, it is equally possible to become so pragmatic that one operates without any core principles.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The ruling PAP in engendering an overcompensating desire to rid ourselves of ideology in the name of pragmatism; have robbed Singaporeans and even most of our political leaders currently in Parliament from forming inalienable values and precepts, which are critical in the forging of a true nation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>In the end, an over-emphasis on pragmatism limits the possibilities which we might otherwise dare to imagine and aspire to.</strong></span></p>

              <div><strong>The Singapore Story – A failure of
              pragmatism</strong></div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>The Current Affairs Desk</strong></div>
              <p>In his inaugural speech, Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Mr
              Viswa Sadasivan said, “It has often been said that Singapore does
              not have an ideology – that pragmatism is our mantra and modus
              operandi. But if we examine our National Pledge closely, it is our
              national ideology – a set of inalienable values, precepts that
              demand adherence in the face of the lure of pragmatism.”</p>
              <p>This challenge to pragmatism, even by our National Pledge, was
              something that was deemed so unacceptable that Minister Mentor Lee
              Kuan Yew, who heard about it from the newspapers, while “doing
              physiotherapy”, had to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Transcripts/Minister+Mentor/Dangerous+to+let+highfalutin+ideas+go+undemolished+MM.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">intervene in the debate</span></span></a> to
              “bring the House back to earth”, by calling the NMP’s arguments
              “false and flawed (and) completely untrue”.  The NMP certainly
              did touch a raw nerve, when he suggested in Parliament that
              pragmatism is but a lure, especially for the ruling party.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The ruling People’s Action
              Party’s (PAP) concept of good government is actually a version of
              communitarian democracy.</span></strong>  Communitarian
              ideology emphasizes the need to balance individual rights and
              interests with that of the community as a whole, but its focus on
              social cohesion raises similarities with various forms of
              authoritarianism.</p>
              <p><strong>Social Control</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Upon independence in 1965,
              a massive cultural transformation of the population was necessary
              for Singapore to develop economically</strong></span>. This was
              when <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the ideology of
              ‘survival of the nation’ was conceptualised.</strong></span> This
              ideology of survival has <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>now
              become the basic concept for rationalisation which extends beyond
              pure economics to almost all spheres of a Singaporean’s life. 
              If social control can be shown to contribute to economic growth, it
              is considered necessary for ’survival’ and hence
              ‘pragmatic’.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But are “pragmatic” policies or “pragmatism” always good?</p>
              <p>It is but pragmatism which made Members of Parliament (MP)
              responsible for their estates. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Town councils</strong></span> were
              introduced only in 1989 but 20 years on, its aim has not been
              achieved as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/06/20-years-of-town-councils-yet-no-stake-in-governance-for-residents"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Senior
              Minister Goh Chok Tong admitted</span></span></a> in June this
              year. Its aim? <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>To “give them
              (residents) a stake in the process of governance”. SM Goh
              explained.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>How do you foster such a
              thing when in Singapore MPs do not run estates anyway</strong>, for
              all intent and purposes. <strong>Instead, the towns are run by
              professional town managers, employed by the town councils. 
              So, why pretend that they are?</strong></span> As it is, many of
              our MPs and ministers are overburdened with multiple duties. Take
              Mr. Teo Ser Luck, for example. He is now Mayor, MP, Parliamentary
              Secretary and heads the Youth Olympic committee, along with other
              commitments. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for the other
              MPs, they have multiple directorships in private and
              government-linked companies, heads various committees such as
              Government Parliamentary Committees (GPC), on top of their personal
              careers.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>MPs</strong></span>,
              <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>being so well paid, should
              focus exclusively on national policies. This can only benefit
              Singapore and Singaporeans.</strong></span>  We face
              challenging times in this globalised world, as the government has
              so often reminded us.  More heads dedicated to these issues
              would be the logical thing to do and MPs should therefore be
              focused on more important national issues rather than be drained by
              municipal issues. We ought to have non-political grassroots
              organisations and leaders to take care of these things.</p>
              <p><strong>Grassroots</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The Grass-Roots
              Organizations (GROs) are there to serve a purpose –</strong> they
              are <strong>PAP’s mouthpiece, to explain and convince people of the
              various government policies, and to be the eyes and ears for the
              PAP.</strong></span> The citizens who are somewhat supportive of
              the opposition are not allowed to climb the ranks of the
              grassroots. Moreover, the opposition MPs, do not get to be advisors
              for GROs, which are all under the purview of the People’s
              Association, which is a statutory board chaired by the Prime
              Minister. The advisors to the GROs (even in opposition held
              constituencies) invariably turn out to be PAP men or
              supporters.</p>
              <p>This is the ‘pragmatism’ of the PAP – resulting in a system
              which is inherently communitarian.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The ruling PAP’s policies
              are two-fold.</strong></span> And this has been so for the last 43
              years. It is simply this:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Keep the ordinary
              Singaporeans anxious and worried about their immediate surroundings
              their daily lives.</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Leave the “bigger” things
              to the government.</strong></span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>If looked upon closely, this has been the underlying principle
              in all PAP policies. With this underlying principle, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>it is hardly surprising that the PAP now
              talks of devolvement of responsibilities through the town councils
              and the constant encouragement to “upgrade skills”.  Politics
              in Singapore is reserved for the handpicked ‘elite’, which results
              in the almost total absence of politics from the general
              populace.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Just as the GROs are not natural but created to serve
              ‘pragmatism’, so is trade unionism. They are created exclusively to
              serve the PAP and its brand of ‘pragmatism’.</p>
              <p>This is manifested through <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the appointment of top union leaders who
              are pro-PAP. These unions thus become para-political, which defeats
              the purpose of setting up unions in the first
              place.</strong></span> In the 50s, unions in Singapore were not
              para-political but truly fought for the rights of the workers. This
              should be the purpose of unions.</p>
              <p><strong>A Constitution only in form</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Under the PAP’s pragmatic
              approach it governs through law rather than by law, making
              amendments to the Constitution as it pleases. This has led some to
              quip that Singapore does not have a Constitution at
              all.</strong></span> The PAP takes up more than two-thirds of the
              seats in parliament, and through the party-whip, PAP MPs are not
              allowed to vote against the party. Hence, constitutional changes
              are undertaken with speed as the absolute majority supports it, an
              aspect praised as a “Singapore advantage” by the government. The
              executive body is thus infused with the ethos of pragmatism; as
              such it is an instrument of social control, tailored to the ever
              changing needs of Parliament, the sole authority of law making.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The PAP’s pragmatic
              approach has inculcated a sense of apathy among the citizenry.
              Their constant re-emphasizing of the need for economic growth in a
              competitive environment has led to a generation growing up to be
              individualistic and ‘kiasu’.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pragmatism has also made the ‘paper chase’ the sole priority of
              any student, so much so that many have forgotten the importance of
              being politically aware and in speaking up.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The effects of the
              pragmatic ruling party on the de-politicised students were
              beginning to show as early as in the 1970s</strong></span>; merely
              10 years after the ruling party came to power. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Mr Goh Keng Swee</strong></span> (the
              chief architect of modern Singapore’s economy) in <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>pleading with university graduates in
              1971 to take a personal interest in the affairs of their country
              and make an effort to understand issues and provide leadership in
              forming public opinion,</strong></span> said, “Too many people
              regard political ideas not as serious matters affecting their lives
              but as topics for idle discussion. Nor do they ask of themselves,
              what is the relevance of these notions to the situation of
              Singapore today, tomorrow and in the next decade.”</p>
              <p><strong>Dare to dream?</strong></p>
              <p>Communitarian democracy as practiced by the PAP is one of
              constant vigilance, where it sees itself as the guardian of
              collective interest. Phrases such as, ‘harming the social fabric’
              or ‘ for the good of the society’ are often verbalised by the PAP
              when introducing controversial legislations or policies. Yet,
              beneath this postulation of a shift in ‘ideology’, pragmatism is
              still undertaken by the PAP as the sole driving force. And so the
              negative impact prevails.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The PAP’s brand of
              politics in choosing and championing pragmatism, has trumped and
              rendered obsolete all ideologies.  But what good are the
              competencies and expertise of pragmatism, if it is not tempered
              with ideology?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Ideology is not a bad word.  Ideology is but the core
              fundamental beliefs and political principles which exist
              independent of considerations for competencies and expertise. 
              For how can we assess  political leaders based solely on
              technocratic effectiveness and expertise in crafting policies,
              which pragmatism prescribes, without regard to ideology?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Just as it is possible to
              become too rigid and unyielding in upholding ideological beliefs by
              adhering excessively to principles without regard to consequences,
              it is equally possible to become so pragmatic that one operates
              without any core principles.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The ruling PAP in engendering an overcompensating desire to rid
              ourselves of ideology in the name of pragmatism; have robbed
              Singaporeans and even most of our political leaders currently in
              Parliament from forming inalienable values and precepts, which are
              critical in the forging of a true nation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>In the end, an
              over-emphasis on pragmatism limits the possibilities which we might
              otherwise dare to imagine and aspire to.</strong></span></p>

              <p>It's not an issue of pragmatism being bad per say. It's how do we apply pragmatism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The use of the word pragmatism is so generic that almost everything can be considered as pragamatic.</p>
              <p>Making laws that essentially crippled the opposition ability to gain more seats? That's pragamatic from the ruling government's perspective.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Creating laws that make it easy for almost any political party to rise to power, no matter how crazy they really are? That's pragamtic if you want to have everyone in the parliment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unwillingly to abolish certain controversial laws because of the conservatives living down here? That's certainly pragamtic, if you want to retain your seats in parliment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allowing slavery to be legal just because you fear a portion of your nation would rebel against you? Ah, that's certainly pragmatic if your only concern is to have an easy political victory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The real question we should ask if ourselves is whether a so called pragmatic solution really pragmatic for the overall interest of our nation, or is it just a way to chicken out and run away from making unpopular decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take for example, taxation. Should we increase taxation if we need more money for our social services? It is a practical solution, but to a ruling party, it might not be viewed a practical because they cannot make the general public at large agree with the idea that taxes will be increased.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, to say ideaology is somehow good without even defining what kind of ideaology you are talking about is a extremely stupid thing. Are we talking about conservatism? That's an ideaology? Liberalism? That's an ideaology as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What we have to ask is, identify what kind of ideas is the most sensible, most beneficial, and from time to time, is it the most practical solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, in regards to the de-politicisation of schools, what I have to say is this. People not being interested in politics isn't the only worrying issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another worryinging issues is how Singaporean who are active in politics viewed politics. Many people who are being active are nothing more than a partisan hack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hell, many people on this very forum is doing nothing more than viewing politics in a black and white manner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So all policies make by the PAP are somehow bad, just because PAP is the one making all the decisions? While opinions make by the members of opposition party are somehow idealised, just because they disagree with the PAP?</p>

                  controversial legislations or policies. Yet, beneath this postulation of a
