This encourages plea-bargaining which makes the justice less transparent as the exercise of prosecutorial desration cannot be reviewed or appealed against.</blockquote>somehow.. i dun quite buy this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Just probably the majority of them.<br><br>Similarly, people can also vote for the WP if they feel that the majority of their proposals are useful for the well being of Singaporeans.<br><br>Let's be totally honest here.  The PAP will still dominate the political scene for now and maybe for the next few years.  The issue here is that there is a need for opposition checks and balances to ensure that the PAP's policies are there for the people and Singapore.<br><br>In recent years, there is this perception that Singaporeans seem to be getting the shorter end of the stick.  Recently already, one minister was quoted as saying that they will only help the poor only when there is a budget surplus.<br><br>But the irony of it all is that people from this class need the most assistance when times are bad, when they have lost their jobs, or have to take pay cuts.  And then there is the question of reserves.  What purpose do the reserves serve if the bulk of it is used to invest overseas but not for the betterment of the lives of Singaporeans?  I will agree that Singapore needs a reasonable amount of reserves to protect the country from external factors.  Shouldn't the way to run Singapore be: accumulate reserves during good times. Use (some) of the reserves to help the less fortunate in bad times.<br><br>On a side note, I vaguely recall a law passed in parliament a year ago which allowed GLCs (or the GICs, I can't remember) to bypass the President when they require the use of Singapore reserves.  Can anybody refresh my memory on this or direct me to an article / website on this?  Correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>This new law was apparently not given as much reporting as it should since it concerns the reserves.  If that's the case,  then the role of the EP is put into doubt since it is does not have the final word on how the reserves can be used.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

I think u ppl have comw up with a well thought-up manifesto, although - as a student - I would still argue for a less economic focus in the section on education. The students should not merely be seen as the future workers or in terms of the economic benefit, current or potential, they can provide to the nation; That, I believe, was the PAP's mistake.</div>
