The Office of Elected President should be abolished and the Presidency should be reverted to its former ceremonial position.<br><span style="color: darkred;">A president shouldn't be elected by parliment</span><br><br>2. Parliamentary elections should be organized by an independent election commission, not by the Prime Minister's Office.<br><span style="color: darkred;">I do agree on this over this point</span><br><br>3. Group Representation Constituencies should be abolished.<br><span style="color: darkred;">Why? If everything goes back to fully SMC, then for this case, chinese canidate should be capped at 63 out of 84 seats if based on the quota to ensure minority are represented</span><br><br>4. Internal Security Act should be abolished.<br><span style="color: darkred;">Abolish it? Then how are terror suspects going to be treated?</span><br><br>5. Peaceful demonstrations should be allowed.<br><span style="color: darkred;">Any peaceful demostration can turn into a violent one</span> </div></blockquote>Your views are neither right nor wrong. But I disagree with most of them<br><br>Re 5, the solution is simple. Let the police do crowd control and help prevent trouble makers from stuirring up trouble. The presence of cops will help make it easier to collect evidence or witness testimony when trouble does crop up. And make arrests when it turns violent.<br><br>4. The terror <strong>suspects</strong> should be treated in accordance with the principles of the Rule of Law: That is, at least, he should be assumed innocent until proven otherwise, and he should not be detained indefinitely w/o charges being brought against him. Imagine being locked up and not being told why you have been locked up. The potential for abuse here is also enormous since there is so much secrecy here. You could disappear and no one would know why.<br><br>3. I do not agree. If no minotiry candidate can gather enough support on his own, why should be be in parliament? Minority representation can be secured in other ways. Eg set up a Racial Equality Commission or somesort to influence and help steer govt policy.<br><br>1. Actually, I dun see why we even need a president. At least, I dun see why we need a president who performs the same fuction as the one we have now. Abolish the office, or give the president concrete powers. And make the elections of the president 'whiter than white'.<br></div>

If need be, the riot police should be out B4 problems really spark off. In any case, the fact of the matter is, the vast majority of protests remain peaceful.  Police presence will further lower the chanvce of violence. Remember, how many political rallies have there been? Were there wanton violence invovled? No.<br><br>I dun really care if the west have those powers. If they do, I disagree with them. The problem is that they are not learning the lessons of their past. Take the UK. Northern Ireland should have taught them that detaining a person w/o trial is open to abuse and serves to ferment violence. Luckily, they have the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights to stop them when they decided to take things too far.<br><br>Why is it 'dangerous'? The best man should be in parliament. I want the best man or woman to represent me. I do not want someone who is there only because of the colour of his/her skin. I do not believe in discrimination, with one exception. Discrimination on grounds of ability is a MUST. Else, we are on the path to mediocrity and our future can only be bleak. Now, maybe we could have a 2nd chamber, akin to the UK's House of Lords. This chamber could consist of such people as supreme court judges, captains of industry and representatives from the various religions and minority groups. Of couse, because this chamber is not elected, they should not have a power of veto. But they should, at least, be able to delay legislation.<br><br></div>
