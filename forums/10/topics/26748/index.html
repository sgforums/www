            <div class='col-md body'>Should we ever shift some of our Star-Light training bases to Hainan, which means maintaining SAF training bases on both sides of the Taiwan Straits,there may be serious implications for us!<br>I have read on a website about the possible Taiwanese reaction to such an action by SAF. According to the website, the Taiwanese government officials will not allow any more SAF personnel to continue training in Taiwan for fear of our soldiers leaking their secrets to the Chinese military when we train in Hainan.<br>Secondly, its the cost of maintaining so many training facilities overseas. As expected the cost will be huge considering the numerous other training detachments in other parts of the world.<br>Thirdly, we may lose an 'ally'. The Taiwanese may not want to cooperate with Singapore anymore.Our action may seem to them as a betrayal.Our soldiers there go for  R n R ,thus contributing to their economy. The people affected may press the government for actions therefore creating political problems.<br>These are my own personal opinions on why Singapore can't have training facilities on Hainan and Taiwan at the same time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I doubt having training bases in both China and Taiwan would be a problem to Singapore-US-PRC-ROC ties.  First, to NOT do so, would actually negatively affect one or the other, given Asian thinkings.  Remember, we have TRAINING conducted there, we do not have military operations bases there.  So to speak, having trainings conducted in both Taiwan and China would put us into a perfectly neutral position where, we favor both.  The US won't say much to this, and in a sense, we are adhering to a ONE China policy.<br><br>And if tense situations arise, its a matter of going back to "fence sitting" and quip them once in a while by saying, "zhong guo ren da zhong guo ren, rang yang gui zi xiao."
