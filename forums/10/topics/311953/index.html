              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Michael Hwang, President Law Society, continues to live in denial</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The President of Singapore’s Law Society,
              the official body of legal practitioners, which is controlled by Lee
              Kuan Yew and his government; just as every other official organization
              in the island is; has told the similarly controlled newspaper "The
              Straits Times" in the article of <em>March 18, 2008</em>, titled <em>"The Law Society President says lawyers apathetic about public law"</em> the following.<br><br>The
              Law Society President says “lawyers are apathetic about public law"and
              that Singapore lawyers are apathetic when it comes to human rights.<br><br>Among
              other things, he says Singapore lawyers should be more aware of
              international treaties such as the International Declaration on Human
              Rights and how it applies to Singapore, and laments the fact that
              Singapore lawyers have so far not challenged the government when it
              unfairly treats them. He contrasts the Singapore situation where no
              lawyer dares challenge the government to the recent Hong Kong case,
              where the Equal Opportunities Commission there successfully sued the
              Hong Kong government over preferential treatment for boys over girls in
              high school admission.<br><br>Congratulations Mr. Hwang in finally
              realizing that there is a human rights problem in Singapore and that
              lawyers are not doing anything about it! But my question to Mr. Hwang
              is this. Where was he the last 30 years or so?<br><br>Was he practicing
              law in Mars! Why has he just realized this now? What took him so long?
              Is he saying that all this time, he never knew that Lee Kuan Yew denies
              Singaporeans as well as him any human rights? We should ask this
              President of the Law Society of Singapore whether he feels safe in
              Singapore, and if so; is it because he has human rights or is it
              because he has the patronage and support of his benefactor, Mr. Lee
              Kuan Yew?<br><br>I will try to put it as civilly as possible. This man
              is not being entirely honest in this sudden realization. He has been
              living and practicing law in Singapore for over 20 or 30 years in a
              government linked law firm Allen and Gledhill. Only recently has he set
              out on his own.<br><br>In all these years, he stood idly by, as he
              managed his lucrative business law practice; servicing his clients, the
              Lee Kuan Yew establishment; making sure that he never went within a
              mile of any case where Lee routinely misused the law to polish off his
              opponents. The law was being broken, bent and abused to suit Lee Kuan
              Yew and family and his benefactors; while Mr. Hwang, a lawyer, stood by
              doing nothing.<br><br>You know Lee Kuan Yew’s victims in Lee Kuan Yew’s
              law courts. Is he saying that the law was not bent, broken and abused
              to unjustly punish JB Jeyaretnam, the famous opposition politician? Is
              he saying that the law was properly applied in the crippling damage
              awards and then to bankrupt him and remove him from office. Was this
              not a human rights violation, a violation of the right to free speech
              and expression? Why did he not do anything to help all those years? At
              least, why did he not, at least say something?<br><br>Is he not aware
              that over the last 2 decades, Dr. Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore
              Democratic Party has been sued bankrupted and imprisoned for doing
              nothing more than exercise his rights enshrined in the Universal
              Declaration of Human Rights, the very rights which he refers to now?<br><br>Is
              he denying that the series of politically motivated actions by Lee Kuan
              Yew and his family against JB Jeyaretanm and Dr. Chee Soon Juan are
              blatant violations of human rights; the right of free speech and
              expression, the right of peaceful assembly and the right of equal
              protection?<br><br>Mr. Michael Hwang is making a fool of himself by
              publicly saying now that Singapore lawyers should engage in issues such
              as human rights and administrative justice when he clearly knows that
              it is not possible for Singapore lawyers to engage in any of it; for
              the simple reason that they fear Lee Kuan Yew, his son and their entire
              family; just as Mr. Hwang fears them, as his actions during the past 30
              years have shown.<br><br>Let me set out the reality to Mr. Hwang. He is in blinkers and it is about time, he took them off, and began to look about him.<br><br>There
              are only 3,400 lawyers practicing in Singapore. It was the same number
              10 years ago despite the fact that the population had increased during
              the same time from 3 to 4.5 million, and despite the fact that
              Singapore during that time had increased it's banking and commercial
              sector 10 fold!<br><br>There is a chronic shortage of lawyers and it is
              going to drop even further because almost half of the profession is
              above 50 years old, most of whom are giving up practice for good.<br><br>Recently
              the government has come up with all sorts of incentives for lawyers to
              stay such as more money, doing work from home, 4 days week and so on
              and so forth. One law firm had even gone to the extraordinary length of
              chasing away lawyers who remained in their offices after office hours.
              It was not because they wanted to save electricity; but because of the
              hope, the lawyers would appreciate the gesture of their employers and
              not resign as they had threatened to do!<br><br>What desperation!<br><br>Look
              here Mr. Hwang. The legal profession in Singapore is dead. There are no
              takers. And the reason for this problem is people like you and Lee Kuan
              Yew. Your appointment by the government to head the Law Society is
              ample evidence that Singapore law is politicized. No rule of law. You
              as well as every Singapore lawyer are aware that challenging Lee Kuan
              Yew on matters of human rights is recipe for disaster and bankruptcy.<br><br>That
              is why you yourself have not dared to challenge Lee's routine abuse of
              the law during your entire career of 30 years. You have lived in fear
              and gone along with whatever human rights violations this government
              has thrown at the people; idly standing by when the people's rights
              have been repeatedly violated before your very eyes. I think, you
              should not be talking about civil liberties and human rights. Such
              things are not for you.<br><br>And although you already know this, let
              me tell you the stark reality of things. The government of Singapore is
              illegitimate. Every election is rigged to ensure that Lee wins each
              time. This being so, the laws enacted by this illegal government are
              themselves without legal foundation. So are the international treaties
              and agreements signed with the international community.<br><br>Every
              publication, every newspaper, every radio broadcast, every judge, every
              court, every police officer, every civil servant, every one in any
              position of authority is subservient to one man, Lee Kuan Yew his son
              and his family. And so are you.<br><br>And no matter how much you try
              to pretend that you are discussing human rights, discussing
              international treaties and other such high sounding positions plans and
              objectives, nothing is going to change. You, as well as the committee
              that you set up are no better than page boys; running the errands of
              the Lee family; and wasting everyone’s time by filling the pages of the
              propaganda sheets of the Straits Times.<br><br>If Lee Kuan Yew is not
              prepared to let you have any human rights; you are not going to have
              any. It is as simple as that. I know this, and I think you know this
              too. But in your case, you are quite prepared to live the compliant
              life you have lived worshipping Lee Kuan Yew, just as a poodle lives in
              the comfort of his caring master.<br><br>Mr. Hwang, you have wasted
              your time, making that press statement about important issues such as
              human rights. Such matters are for real lawyers; lawyers who insist on
              defending the rights of their fellow citizens. We all know who you are.
              We also know that you are not one of them. If you were, you will not be
              the President of the Law Society of Singapore.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

I am sure the society was totally in the pocket of the government. So if Michael Hwang wants to make his mark on the Law Society to lead it towards a more accountable and progressive profession, he first will have to make major and fundamental changes by establishing an independent professional charter which receives input from its own members and the public and not from behind by the government or the government-controlled judiciary. Its disciplinary committee must consist of non-government people. Can he do this?</p></div>

              <p>true story,</p>
              <p>got a malaysian fren in a bonafide sgp uni who did law some years back. after he graduated (2nd lower), he was never called to the bar. he was really curious and checked with the law society.</p>
              <p>soon after, he packed up to returned to malaysia. he didn't elaborate when we asked but we guessed it was probably something he did during his 4 years undergrad days here that peeved off some higher ups.</p>
              <p>he literally wasted his 4 years here.</p>
