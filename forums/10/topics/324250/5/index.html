              <p>I think the problem with people, especially many buddhists, would like to believe that monks/nuns are flawless people. This is definitely not true.</p>
              <p>In the past, to be ordained, that is to be homeless, to be unbounded by the materialistic concerns that laypeople has to face everyday.</p>
              <p>However, in the modern societal context, in Singapore, to be exact, being a monk/nun would have a much more different role as compared in the past. They have to multi-task in teaching and spreading Buddhism, give counselling, run projects for charitable causes, etc.</p>

              <p>MONK'S CONDO HOME: Ming Yi sometimes stayed at The Cornwall. His former
              aide was caught there with obscene films. -- ST PHOTO: CHEW SENG KIM</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A FOURTH man charged yesterday appeared to have nothing to do with the financial affairs of Ren Ci Hospital.</p>
              <p>Pang Leong Chuan, 27, was charged with having 138 obscene and uncertified films.</p>
              <p>He used to be the former personal assistant of monk Ming Yi,
              and was caught with most of the illegal films in an upscale apartment
              where the monk sometimes stayed.</p>
              <p>Ming Yi is one of five listed owners of the apartment in The
              Cornwall, a condominium off Holland Road. Checks showed that the other
              owners included the Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery, where Ming Yi was the
              abbot.</p>
              <p>Monastery staff were said to live in the fourth-floor unit,
              valued at about $2 million. Pang is believed to have lived there too.</p>
              <p>Commercial Affairs Department officers confiscated 95 films
              at the apartment on Feb18, and another 43 from Pang's listed address in
              Tampines.</p>
              <p> A resident said three men, including Ming Yi, lived there. Others said
              they had seen him returning at night in a car with two men.</p>
              <p>Pang, a university student, was the monk's personal executive for more than a year.</p>
              <p>No one was at his Tampines flat when The Straits Times checked
              yesterday. He is believed to have lived with his mother, though he was
              seldom home.</p>
              <p>He faces six charges - four for possessing obscene films and
              two for having films uncertified for screening - and may be fined and
              jailed if found guilty.</p>
              <p>He has engaged a lawyer.</p>

              <p>My feeling is that these religious people sometimes do not pay much attention to financial procedures, and may not realize what they are doing is wrong, not only legally/ technically, but also morally wrong.</p>
              <p>I think they do not pay much attention to it.</p>
              <p>Sometimes maybe they think it's normal and OK to transfer money from one company to another company, or use funds according to their own casual judgement.</p>
              <p>This is one type of people.</p>
              <p>There is another type of religious persons who deliberately and intentionally con and trick people's money, asking people to donate to them, and then they will use the money to lead extravagant lifestyles for themselves, as if religion is only a facade, and it is like a career or a job for them to make money. This is the worst kind of conman.</p>

              <p>You have simply misread.</p>
              <p>It is a fact that monks/nuns are not flawless. They are ordained simply because they choose to lead a different lifestyle and practice Buddhism from another vocation. Or are you trying to tell me simply having one's hair shaved would make a person flawless? Cannot be right?</p>
              <p>So I am more incline to urge people or aspired-buddhist to seek inspiration from the Buddha's teachings rather than the followers. Followers are human beings, we tend to fail too.</p>
              <p>Well, I am not perfect, but I definitely don't make profit out in the name of religion or charity, though I believe these are the two most profitable business afterall. =)</p>

              <p><br>So true, so true. My wife and I always enjoying a logical deduction and Yamizi always do it well without malice but some how others who couldn't accept his logic will blast him/her for nothing.</p>
              <p>Here, Yamizi is not questioning the religion itself but rather the integrity of the people that was using religion itself to do 'unscrupulous' things.</p>
              <p>Of course at this moment we do not know whether Ming Yi is innocent or not. Only time will tell or the law will tell. We should all know paper cannot wrapped fire as in the end water drip rocks break and everything will become clear.</p>
