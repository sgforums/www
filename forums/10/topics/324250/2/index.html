              <p>Scapegoat ? if he allow himself to be a scrape goat - then he is also guilty of the crime, for he allow it !!!  He is a well educated man - he is not as dumb to be a scapegoat ... .sometime temptation is just too much.<br><br>Just because go on TV to perform some act = he is a good person ?<br><br>A monk can be tempated by greed and other things also. No one is perfect ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You think govt people so dumb to arrest him ? They already got all evidences + already review the chances of winning is 100% - then they arrest him , if not they would not have do anything to him. <br><br>Basically for those who just because he is a monk, or seen the good side of him on tv charity show .... please also understand - there is a dark side that is now explosed !!!</p>

                  My friend told me that a one legged beggar used to beg outside her Church.  One day someone wanted to invite him to join them for lunch.  As they approached him, waving to get his attention, he suddenly jumped up and suddenly his other leg popped up and he ran away on two legs, leaving his crutches behind!  Unfortunately, there are all kinds of con artists around who are really clever and creative in thinking up ways to con us out of $.  
                  
                  
              In this case, we don't know what has happened as we have not heard the evidence nor his defense.  He could very well be innocent of all 10 charges.  I hope he is.
