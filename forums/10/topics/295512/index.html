Through 1000 facts, figures and 343 photos, it provides readers with a panorama of Singapore's success story. A fascinating story that begs to be told due to its unique intertwining between Western modernity and Eastern charm. It is also a study in how a resource-poor country beats the odds through sheer genius and its will to reach the heights of excellence.''<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.bisc.com.lb/s_pub.html" rel="nofollow">www.bisc.com.lb</a></strong><br><br>2.We have read 9999 reasons why NOT Singapore in this forum.<br>This book is just right to give alternative views.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why Singapore cannot fix job woes of educated, mature S'poreans now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Reasons?<br><br>Dec 5, 2007<br><br>I SHARE the same concern as Mr Frankie Ng Puck Nang ('Help mature qualified Singaporeans find jobs') and Mr Poh Tip Twee ('MOM too liberal about jobs for foreigners'; ST, Dec 1) that young foreigners are taking away professional, executive and clerical jobs from mature locals.<br><br>Employers prefer foreigners because they think locals demand higher salaries.This is a myth. I believe one will not turn down a job which pays $1,800 or more, especially if one has dependent children, as many Singaporeans start a family in their late 30s.<br><br>Even if money does not matter, one would still prefer to be gainfully employed because an unemployed person feels worthless, leading to family quarrels and unhappiness.<br><br>Another myth is that older locals cannot perform as well as younger foreigners.This is untrue because, being an advanced country, Singaporeans are expected to live beyond 85 years of age. This means that a 55-year-old Singaporean can be as energetic as a 35- year-old man from another country whose life expectancy is 65 years, especially in white-collar jobs. Why, then, do we neglect this group of willing workers for whom the country has spent money on their education years ago?<br><br>Jobs should be offered to foreigners only if they are not attractive to Singaporeans or if they require talents which Singaporeans lack. They should not be given to foreigners if locals are interested in them and are able to carry them out well.<br><br>At present, only the earliest baby boomers are in their late 50s. If the job problem of educated, mature Singaporeans is not addressed urgently now, it will intensify because, year by year, a larger group of educated post-war babies will join the ranks of the unemployed.<br><br>Disincentives, such as a higher S-pass levy, should be introduced to ensure that this pool of mature workers will be tapped.<br><br>Alternatively, companies should show proof that they are not able to recruit a local before they can employ a foreigner at the same pay for professional, executive or clerical jobs.<br><br>May I also suggest that Singaporeans at senior-management levels give a thought to the plight of their older countrymen in the recruitment process. If Singaporeans do not help Singaporeans, who will? Do not simply strike them off after looking at their ages on the job application forms.<br><br>Yeo Boon Eng (Mdm)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Folks, let's not sink to Loud Kitty's level here.  Whenever someone says that soemthing about another country is good, his rabid reaction will be to find something bad to say, or he'll automatically assume that someone is saying that Singapore is bad.  This is not something that intelligent people do.<br><br>Yes, there are at least 1000 good things about Singapore, and the negatives do not detract from that.  Nothing else really needs to be said.</div>
