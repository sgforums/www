            <div class='col-md body'>Calling down the 16-year-old blogger to the police station was uncalled for, an abuse of police privilege<br><br>SG police curtailing civil liberties, over stepping responsibility?<br><br>Civil liberties: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties </a><br><br>"the person identified ... is not an SMRT (employee), nor from the other agencies (Land Transport Authority and the police) that have access to the footage,"... "no charges will be pressed"<br>I think tt the police have gone overboard in this as it seems an internal issue... IMHO: it isn't a criminal offense to post such footage... as such the police investigation should only be within its own staff that none leaked the video. LTA and SMRT should conduct their own investigations amongst its staff members. As such, even calling down the 16-year-old blogger to the police station would be uncalled for, an abuse of police privilege.<br>The possible pressing of charges is prejudicial to justice and simply unthinkable in this case too... (?? Stealing intellectual rights to copyright??? Huh??- then sue for copyright lor...)<br>In this case, the police should at most ask the blogger for help, explaining that its an internal investigation if police themselves leaked the footage...., hoping that he can assist. They must explicitly advise him that he has the choice and has no obligation to cooperate.<br><br>This is what I think; correct me if I'm mistaken. SGpore gov shouldn't take on totalitarian attitudes in governance (see:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism</a> )... its just not good for the nation's progress.<br><br>=======================================<br><br>Source of MRT suicide clip footage a mystery<br>TODAYonline .Wednesday Â• April 25, 2007- Derrick A Paulo (derrick@mediacorp.com.sg )<br><br>More than two months after clips of two suicides on MRT tracks were posted on the Internet, setting Netizens abuzz, the case of the unauthorised SMRT recording has ended without any conclusive source of the leak.<br>The police had conducted a probe and submitted their findings to SMRT, but "the person identified ... is not an SMRT (employee), nor from the other agencies (Land Transport Authority and the police) that have access to the footage," said an SMRT spokesperson.<br>However, Today understands the person used to have a working link with SMRT.<br><br>Still, "no criminal offence has been disclosed" based on police investigations, a police spokesperson told Today.<br>The police, who interviewed the 16-year-old blogger who had put the clips on his website, have also told him that no charges will be pressed.<br>"They only asked me down (to the police station) because they were curious how I got the videos," wrote the teen in his blog.<br>The incidents occurred at Yishun and Admiralty stations.<br>SMRT has been looking into the police findings since the start of March, but now its investigations into the circulation of the closed-circuit television footage (CCTV) are over.<br>"We have reviewed our processes to control access to such material. This has already been completed and implemented," said the SMRT spokesperson. Now, "access to CCTV footage is only upon authorisation by one designated senior member of the company".<br>Meanwhile, there will be changes to make areas around MRT and LRT stations barrier-free over the next five years.<br>The LTA is installing road facilities for the less mobile within a 400-metre radius of all stations, following a successful trial at Simei MRT station late last year.<br>The entire project will cost $60 million and will be implemented first in mature estates such as Redhill and Commonwealth.<br>Copyright MediaCorp Press Ltd.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's something wrong with this whole case. The Police, LTA and SMRT each has a copy of the video footage when the two suicides happened.<br><br>Why is only the police involved in investigating SMRT? There hasn't been any internal checks in LTA and SPF as far as I know of.<br><br>It's an insider's job as far as the video footage leakage is concerned. However, only parts of the video footage is leaked out, showing signs that it's a hurried job.<br><br>There's also another issue. If it's done by an insider, doesn't SMRT has any sense of shame? To bring in the police and letting them tell the whole of Singapore that some idiot leaked out those info is not what a private company should do if they are really concerned. This shows that the company basically has no security safeguards for confidential files, allowing any employee, perhaps someone faking as an employee to gain access to those files.<br><br>The police are too fast and too sure. SMRT is not making any sense in their actions either. If it's ploy, good one. If it's not a ploy, it's another cover up.</div>
