Only mundane questions are asked without problem solving.<br><br>Despite all the high-powered seniors to senior-principals and from parliamentary secretary to ministers of state and all the statutory boards and committees the 20 major problems remain unsolved.<br><br>All these extra manpower can be easily scrapped in the corporate way of management without adverse negative impacts on productivity to realize huge saving of billions and billions.<br><br>Sadly there is now no one to point out such errors within the existing top echelon talents and there is no more entrepreneurs left in our red dot to make the economy competitive or social or cultural evolution vibrant.<br><br>The whole economy is paying all the elected officers from president to MPs, Parliamentary MPs, Ministers of state, Mayors, CEOs, General Managers to produce public relation or ceremonial duties and desk jobs without their performance being shown in job creations or upgrading to competitive value-adding economy to utilise citizens' hard-earned sweat-and-toil monies to good use.</div>
