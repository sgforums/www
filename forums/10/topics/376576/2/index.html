You know what, Joe Wilson might just be right abt Obama being a liar, who knows. But what happens? He is heavily criticised for that outburst. Made to apologise. And Obama wins, because he came out, accepted the apology and says that both parties must come to a point where they can have a conversation where there are no name callings and the assumption of the worst in other people's motives. Out of this episode, Obama came out the greater man while Joe Wilson will be remembered as the congressman who heckled Obama unprofessionally. And through all these, Joe Wilson may just be right but everything he tries to say is discredited because of an unprofessional and unconstructive outburst.</p></div>

              <p>i thought temasek said its investment objectives is for the long term like 30 years time frame. selling after 2 years albeit for a 2b profit is short term.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Temasek wants to invest in good companies, pls invest in brick and mortar companies such as GE, Warren Buffet's bershire hathaway or google. before investing in companies, it would be prudent for the CEO of Temasek to pay a visit and have a chat with the CEO of the company it plans to invest in. Jim Roger once said, he paid UBS CEO a visit and asked him a series of questions, one of which, is on the annual report that showed UBS is losing money. The CEO then reassured Jim that the revenue stream at UBS are good, couldnt be better in future. Jim felt that the CEO is not telling him the truth and he couldnt trust him to invest his own money in UBS. If you couldnt trust someone else with your own money, dun invest. He then took out his money from UBS and invested elsewhere. Warren Buffet also mentioned about the CEO and chairman of the company, whether they are capable and trustworthy.</p>

              <p>the CEO of Temask or GIC, you cant pick a newbie or a beaureacrat to head it. you need an experienced CEO working in the investment or wall street for decades. even though the CEO has an army of advisors, the CEO also must have insider knowledge and investment acumen. if jim rogers is the CEO of Temasek, he would have blasted all these advisors with impressive academic credentials, but not really investment acumen. all these so called advisors all combined are not even worthy for Jim Rogers insight. maybe can invite rogers to sit on the board with no executive powers, but sort of advisor's role, since he is living in Singapore now.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for the potential upside, GIC and the others can convert their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">preferred perpetual securities to Citigroup shares at a 20 per cent premium to a reference price</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">yet to be determined</span>, but reckoned to be around the average of the next few days’ trading prices) any time they want.</span></em></p>
