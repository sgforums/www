              <p>of cos of cos. that is the assumption they lost more than they earned. I am not about to search internet for proof of how much they earned vs how much they lost. Temasek says since their inception, they have made gains on their portfolio of around 15%. I dun know how true is that, could be media propaganda again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. As I said from a business point of view, if this year I made a loss, it is of cos bad. But if the next year, I made a profit, even it is doesnt cover the loss in the previous year, why should there not be credit given? thats how it works in the corporate world. Why is it different here? Of cos, lets see how their performance is in 2010 before we give further credit. But for now, they have done well.</p>

              <p>of cos of cos. that is the assumption they lost more than they earned. I am not about to search internet for proof of how much they earned vs how much they lost. Temasek says since their inception, they have made gains on their portfolio of around 15%. I dun know how true is that, could be media propaganda again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. As I said from a business point of view, if this year I made a loss, it is of cos bad. But if the next year, I made a profit, even it is doesnt cover the loss in the previous year, why should there not be credit given? thats how it works in the corporate world. Why is it different here? Of cos, lets see how their performance is in 2010 before we give further credit. But for now, they have done well.</p>

              <p>I can certainly agree with your first statement, that it is all the same with every single company in this world. Everything that appears on media is a PR exercise. But whether it appears in 2 small paragraphs or one big chunk of front page, it doesnt matter. To me, it is still, bad news is bad news. Good news is good news.  But I get what you mean.</p>

              <p>Definitely. It is the same when the stress on us to be accountable to shareholders. They are similarly accountable to the citizens. Lets not make their jobs more difficult by giving them undue criticism and not giving them due recognition. I always believe in a coporate world, natural elimination always take place.

You stand up suddenly and shout "you asshole. You liar." You know what, you might just be right that he is an asshole and a liar but by standing up in front of everyone else in a corporate announcement, it shows a lack of professionalism and because of that, i can almost be sure that your credibility goes down the drain.
