              <p>Wednesday, 03 June 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Far Eastern Economic Review</em><br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/Bookcovers/constructingsingapore1.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="left"><strong>Constructing Singapore: Elitism, Ethnicity and the Nation-Building Project </strong><br>Michael Barr and Zlatko Skrbis<br> Reviewed by Chee Soon Juan<br><br>The
                  “Singapore Story”—the title of the first volume of founding Prime
                  Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s autobiography—is that a mandarinate elite built
                  a bastion of political and economic success on twin pillars of good
                  governance: meritocracy and multiracialism. “Chimeras,” say Michael
                  Barr and Zlatko Skrbis, professors at The Flinders University of South
                  Australia and The University of Queensland, Australia, respectively.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The authors tear apart the Lee mythology with commendable academic
                  rigor and gusto, arguing that such propaganda serves only to
                  “facilitate and legitimize rule by a self-appointed elite dominated by
                  middle-class Chinese in general, and by the Lee family in particular.” </strong></span></p>
              <p><br>This
                  issue is examined not just through the lens of Singapore’s political
                  system. Messrs. Barr and Skrbis delve at length into the education
                  system, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>documenting in extraordinary detail how from an early age
                  students are molded into the People’s Action Party’s image of the ideal
                  Singaporean. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The PAP Community Foundation, which runs over half of the
                  preschools in Singapore, puts five- and six-year-olds through a
                  demanding kindergarten regime.</strong></span> Over the next 10 years, children are
                  pushed to participate in a bewildering number of programs through which
                  the “best” are identified and scooped up to join the elite.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These
                  schemes are designed to support and enhance a political infrastructure
                  where power is concentrated in a select few. </strong></span>If all this seems like
                  social engineering at work, that’s because it is. Mr. Lee has never
                  been shy about his intentions to rear future generations of elites.<br><br>A
                  more in-depth examination of the programs and considerable resources
                  used to implement Mr. Lee’s eugenics agenda would provide the reader
                  with a better understanding of the extent to which the Party went to
                  ensuring that the elite reproduced and that the “lumpen masses” (to use
                  Mr. Lee’s term) did not.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the 1980s, the PAP sought to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> increase
                  fertility among university-educated women through financial incentives
                  and dating services</span>, while<span style="color: #ff0000;"> providing major subsidies for the voluntary
                  sterilization of poor and uneducated parents.</span></strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span><br>How public policy
                  impacts ethnic groups in Singapore is also keenly examined. Ethnic
                  discrimination is carried out at the highest level of government. One
                  prominent indicator is Singapore’s government-sponsored overseas
                  university scholarships to students.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Citing statistics from 1966-2007,
                  the authors note that of the 228 President’s Scholarships awarded only
                  14 (about 6.1%) went to minority ethnic students. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The percentage
                  dropped to 3.5% in the years between 1981 and 2007, even though
                  minority ethnic groups make up more than 20% of Singapore’s population.
                  The number of scholarships given by the Singapore Armed Forces to
                  minorities is even more telling: only 2.2% of the awards given between
                  1971 and 2007 went to non-Chinese recruits. Messrs. Barr and Skrbis
                  point out that it is not so much a question of whether, but rather of
                  how consciously, these selection panels base their decisions on the
                  wishes of Mr. Lee.<br><br>Both Mr. Lee and his son, Prime Minister Lee
                  Hsien Loong, have openly stated that Singapore is not ready for a
                  non-Chinese head of government. But in an irony that only autocratic
                  systems can sustain, Mr. Lee has outlawed public discussions of race
                  relations in Singapore. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Using The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act,
                  the government could interpret any discussion of religious issues as
                  stoking racial sentiment, and could potentially detain without trial
                  persons found doing so, putting any honest discussion of the subject in
                  a deep freeze.</strong></span><br><br>The system is so successful in inculcating the
                  PAP’s values, Messrs. Barr and Skrbis note, that even “cynics and
                  opponents have<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> trouble thinking outside the parameters of imagination
                  set by the ruling elite.” </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Such intellectual and psychological hegemony
                  has exacted a price, however. The imposition of a narrow political
                  culture has left a society which lacks the passion and conviction
                  necessary to weave the fabric of nationhood: “It has oppressed the
                  imagination without uplifting the spirit, leaving the regime in a
                  position that is outwardly secure, but is relying upon emotional roots
                  that are shallow and brittle,” they write.</strong></span></span><br><br>Messrs. Barr and
                  Skrbis cite an ACNielsen survey of 1,000 Singaporeans, which found that
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>21% indicated a “desire to leave the country permanently.” </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The authors
                  missed out on a couple more statistics: In a survey of 800 younger
                  Singaporeans (ages 15 to 29) carried out by Singapore Polytechnic and
                  reported in January 2007, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>37% of the respondents said they are not
                  patriotic and more than 50% said they would migrate overseas if given
                  the chance. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Mr. Lee admitted in 2008 that the brain drain presented a
                  “pretty serious” problem. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About 1,000 of Singapore’s most talented
                  people are giving up their citizenship each year—and the numbers are
                  growing.</strong></span></span><br><br>Despite these figures, the authors assert that the
                  system works: “There is enough talent in the dynasty and enough truth
                  in the myths of meritocracy, elite governance and pragmatism to ensure
                  that the city-state is stable and profitable.” This begs the question:
                  For whom does the system work? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Can a national system that results in
                  one of every three of its younger citizens feeling no loyalty to the
                  country be considered successful? This dissonance is left unaddressed
                  by the authors.</strong></span></span><br><br>It is also curious that Messrs. Barr and Skrbis
                  choose to measure the success of a political system in terms of
                  profitability. The authors are evidently impressed by the economic
                  growth that Singapore has experienced over the past few decades. But
                  again that success story needs significant qualification. The income
                  disparity in Singapore has widened in the last decade. Between 1998 and
                  2003, the average household monthly income of the poorest 20% of the
                  population decreased by nearly 15%, while that of the richest quintile
                  surged by 11.7%.<br><br>It would be foolish to argue that Singapore’s
                  overall economic situation has not improved over the years. But to
                  attribute this growth to the PAP system is equally foolhardy. As nobel
                  laureate and economist Paul Krugman aptly noted: “When Asian economies
                  delivered nothing but good news … it is easy to assume that so-called
                  planners knew what they were doing. It is easy for government policy
                  makers to look competent in a prosperous economy. But they may not have
                  a clue!” Mr. Krugman’s statement (made in 1998) is noteworthy because
                  10 years hence, with the global economy unable to continue producing
                  the kind of capital that has been flowing into Asia and Singapore, the
                  pap leaders are now quite bereft of the star qualities they had been
                  attributing to themselves during the boom years.<br><br><em>Constructing Singapore</em> is worthy of the attention of analysts and policy makers. It is
                  unfortunate, however, that the book already appears dated, as the
                  economic upheaval has created vastly different circumstances. It would
                  be interesting to see how, if at all, these changes will impact the
                  elite-model in Singapore. A revised edition tracking and analyzing such
                  developments would command even greater attention.<br><br><em>Chee Soon Juan is the secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party.  <br><br><a href="http://www.feer.com/reviews/2009/may/constructing-singapore-elitism-ethnicity-and-the-nation-building-project">http://www.feer.com/reviews/2009/may/constructing-singapore-elitism-ethnicity-and-the-nation-building-project</a></em><em><br></em></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reality of Singapore has been drowned by the humdrum of daily activities by the <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; "><span style="font-style: italic;">“lumpen masses”</span> </span>kept under tight control with the imposed necessity of keeping their employment safe and not to rock the status quo.</p>
              <p>This in turn has benefitted the political stability for the Ruling Elites, who has the total freedom to impose at will all the self-serving politics that perpetuate their own relevance to Singapore's success that would have otherwise come naturally.</p>
              <p>Since the founding of Singapore, this island had been a jewel in the Far East and "managed" with a light hand by the East India Company - to be followed by the British Colonial Government.</p>
              <p>The success of Singapore from 1819 through the early 1950s, was without the PAP in government, and Singapore thrived and excelled itself within Southeast Asia and the entire Far East.</p>
              <p>Prior to the PAP's existence, Singapore had competed with Hong Kong since the 19th Century, and continue to do so even to this day.</p>
              <p>After 52 years of PAP continuous monopolistic rule - why is Singapore so desperately hung up in a continuous search for political talent to the extent of government interference in the development of entrepreneurship and creative human talent - all with the purpose of ensuring Singapore's continued success ?</p>
              <p>Have they mishandled the limited human resources for 52 years that led to the present situation where Singapore face a "<span style="font-style: italic;">crisis of Human Talent</span>" ?</p>
              <p>Without any similar PAP type of controls in Hong Kong, and without the Central Planning interference from China's Communist Party - why has Hong Kong not have similar difficulties in finding political talents and entrepreneurship from amongst their own society to lead Hong Kong into the future ?</p>
              <p>The purposeful continuation of a siege mentality - that stems from a perpetuated sense of political and economic vulnerability - has been carefully crafted by the PAP political leadership to ensure their own political relevance to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>This sense of political and economic vulnerability has been the hallmark of Singapore since being evicted from Malaysia, with Singaporeans being made to carry the burden of MM LKY's mistake in his willful ambition to lead Singapore into a merger that was opposed by many who knew and have a better grasp of the mentality of the Malayan Malay politicians and the intricacies of politics with the Malayan Royalties.</p>
              <p>The present day Singapore is totally different from the bustling and <span style="font-style: italic;">'laissez faire' </span>spirit that was a hallmark of Singapore since 1819.</p>
              <p>This spirit was lost when PAP stepped into political power in 1957 - with its fanatical drive to plan the development of Singapore according to "master plans" for every political, social, communal, and economic activities that exist in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The spirit of free enterprise was lost in Singapore since 1957 but remains as a central feature of Hong Kong's image of continued success and prosperity - both in spirit and character.</p>
              <p>Singapore's development contrast that of Hong Kong - like a distorted mirror image - where the people in Hong Kong has the ability to influence public policies, their voices heard and seriously considered, their political rights are jealously protected, while Singaporeans will generally submit and surrender themselves to the whims of the Ruling Elites that manipulates legislations that further disenfranchise Singaporeans of all political, social, and economic rights.</p>
              <p>Regardless of CSJ's political methods, he continue to expose the truth of the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Real Singapore</span>". </p>

              </p><p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">A nation of politically naive citizens can threaten Singapore’s survival. It is time the Government teaches politics and independent thinking to its people.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">THE interested observer of the Singapore political scene cannot but notice the emergence of a new model of People’s Action Party governance. After 40 years of PAP rule, through the leadership of two prime ministers and in the first year of the third, the emerging model carries the strong endorsement of the past prime ministers and is shaping into a blueprint for future governance.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">It is actually an updated version of the old model, to fit in with the changing climate of the times. Basically, it has kept intact the substance of the old model but dispensed with the style.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">It continues to affirm the philosophy of PAP founding father Lee Kuan Yew, which can be distilled into a few hard-headed principles:</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">- The incorruptibility, dedication and self discipline of the elected leaders;</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">- The primacy of the economic imperative for a tiny, resource-poor island state in a ruthlessly competitive world;</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">- The absolute necessity of trust in the government-people relationship.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">But it has abandoned the style that Mr Lee had deemed necessary to go with the stern principles - that is, an authoritarian, no-nonsense manner which has little use for sentiment - and actually opted for the exact opposite: an all-out effort to win the people’s hearts through a friendly, patient, consultative approach.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The change started with the Goh Chok Tong administration, which declared its goal of creating a kinder, gentler society. But it was left to new Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong - once perceived by the people to be aloof and arrogant - to reinforce, consolidate and complete the process.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">In his constantly proclaimed aim to develop a caring, inclusive society in which no one would be forgotten, PM Lee is easing into an affable, witty and engaging style that has come as a surprise to many Singaporeans. In the short time he has been in office, he has established a pleasing camaraderie with young Singaporeans whom he has singled out for special attention and nurturing.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The new model seeks to achieve a fine balance between the famed, awesome PAP efficiency and a still-developing PAP amiability, between the old habit of top-down decisions and the new practice of seeking and welcoming bottom-up feedback, between hard pragmatism and gentle empathy, between, in short, the constantly competing claims of head and heart.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The recent Casino Debate is a good illustration of this striving for balance. The new Prime Minister took great pains, after making a decision in favour of the tough economic realities of today’s world, to reassure critics that he would balance the decision with the necessary measures to check, correct and prevent the social and moral ills they had warned him about.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The handling of the Casino Issue is likely to be the modus operandi for all future major issues: The Government will, in all sincerity and goodwill, invite free and frank views from everyone (but firmly turn down all suggestions of anything as raucous and messy as a referendum or street demonstrations), consider the views carefully, make its own decision, explain it with greatest care and patience, and then make a rallying call for all to close ranks and move on in a display, once more, of national unity.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">There are two ways of looking at the new model of governance.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The first, that of the sceptics, says: Nothing has changed. The PAP Government merely goes through the motions of consultation and dialogue. It will never budge from the old tough Lee Kuan Yew stance: Leave us to do our job, and do not make any trouble.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The second, that of the optimists, says: Everything has changed. Never before has a Singapore leader so earnestly articulated the need for a caring, inclusive society and reached out to so many people with such warmth, sincerity and good humour.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The high visibility of the current Government-people amity should not obscure the fact that the new model has a serious omission. It has left out, rather conspicuously, something which one would have thought vital to the proclaimed national goal of inclusiveness, which ensures that that no one, even if he or she is in the minority, is left out.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">This missing element in the model is the need for a political opening up, which should lead to a situation where political freedom enables Singaporeans, at last, to enjoy the basic rights taken for granted in other societies in the free world - such as the right of free expression, assembly and demonstration.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The fact that only a minority of Singaporeans - those with a tendency to be more vocal and contrarian - has agitated for these rights, does not detract from their importance in an inclusive model.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">More than anything, these Singaporeans want to speak with their own distinctive individual voices, without fear of reprisal. They want to convince the Government that, far from being a disruptive force in society, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>political freedom will eventually lead to the development of a distinct Singaporean identity and culture</strong></span>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">For at some stage, beyond the unavoidable cacophony and messiness of diverse voices raised in vehement argument and debate, there will emerge a new collective confidence that cannot but revitalise and embolden the other domains of national life, in particular the arts.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The arts often take their cue from their sister domain of political expression. A government crackdown on dissident voices will result, for instance, in self-censorship and a new cautiousness in theatre or drama, whereas government relaxation of political controls will see an enthusiastic exploration of hitherto taboo subjects.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hence there is a close link between political freedom and the arts, and by extension, between both and culture. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Implicit in any discussion of whether there is a Singaporean identity or a Singaporean culture</span> (an angst-filled question in the frequent bouts of collective soul-searching by Singaporeans) <span style="color: #ff0000;">there is the understanding, therefore, of this role of political freedom</span>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Implicit also is the understanding that if Singapore culture is to be distinctive and unique, it must have the freedom to develop spontaneously, in its own time, on its own terms, like the super-organism which anthropologists say every culture really is</span>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hence, it is not the ersatz culture copied from the West, nor the rojak culture cobbled from an arbitrary selection of cultural products such as char kway teow, Singlish, the Merlion or the Durian.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Identity, culture, national pride, a sense of national belonging, the meaning of being Singaporean - it would be extremely difficult to define any of these ideals without at some point or other bringing up the part played by political freedom</span>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">In view of the importance of this opening up of society, loosening of present strictures and removal of the infamous out-of-bounds markers, it is surprising that the matter has so little place in the new model of governance.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>At no time in the articulation of his goals for achieving the society he desires for Singaporeans, has Prime Minister Lee made any significant mention of a systematic development of this arguably all-important political identity without which there can be no true national identity and no true culture</strong>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The reason for the reluctance may lie in a certain mindset resulting from an adherence to one of the inviolable principles laid down in the Lee Kuan Yew philosophy - namely, an unshakable bond of trust between the Government and the people.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>Mr Lee Kuan Yew crushed his critics because he saw all criticism</strong> - whether from Singaporeans or foreigners, from individuals or from organisations - <strong>as undermining the people’s trust in the Government’s integrity and hence making it more difficult for the leaders to do their job.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>It is a distinctive PAP policy of pre-emption and nipping-in-the-bud that has proved very effective</strong>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">It may be said that <strong>Mr Lee Kuan Yew has left a legacy of almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">pathological dislike</span> of the flamboyant theatrics, histrionics and fraudulence that the Government has come to associate with those critics, especially those in the Opposition, who have dared to challenge it openly.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">This stance was maintained through the Goh Chok Tong administration, and is likely to continue in the present administration of PM Lee, since allowing political freedom, especially in the present times when the young have become bolder and more vocal, could open the floodgates of a long, pent-up need and unleash a torrent of criticism that would prove unmanageable.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Between his adherence to traditional PAP practice, and his new avowal to reach out to everyone in society, PM Lee cannot be in too comfortable a position. His response so far has been to play down the issue, tolerate it, or isolate it if possible. At the worst, the Government could simply wait it out, politely listening and explaining, but doing nothing.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The overall result of this response is that while the winds of change are allowed to sweep through the corridors of business, education, the arts, entertainment, etc, they bypass the political domain, which continues to be in the doldrums.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">But, ironically, the biggest wind of change, that is, the Prime Minister’s whole-hearted effort to touch people by breaking down all barriers of communication, may be the very thing to embolden some rebels to protest against the greatest barrier of all - that of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">political suppression</span></strong>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">It would appear that having agitated for political change for so long, they are not about to stop now. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A new, younger, sophisticated, more exposed electorate that likes to see itself as cosmopolitan, is making clear that this desired change should be much more than the concessions made so far, such as the setting up of the system of Nominated Members of Parliament to allow for more dissenting voices in Parliament.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">And of course the change should be much, much more than the patently ineffectual Speakers’ Corner, the derisory Bohemians’ Corner and the laughable bar-top dancing. After these experiments, it is very unlikely that the Government will in the future offer anything that can be even remotely construed as a token, a sop or a joke.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The issue continues to be the most intractable problem on the political scene, and may be the worse for not having the clear-cut, unambiguous lines it had in the former Lee Kuan Yew regime.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">While political dissent then was squashed unceremoniously, the new dispensation, in keeping with its image, has opted for a softer approach. But it is a necessarily ambivalent one which appears to satisfy no one.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">The approach boils down to one of three standard responses, depending on which is most appropriate to the occasion:</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">- There already is freedom, as evident from the presence of a whole range of channels through which people can freely express their views, for instance, the feedback units, the forum pages of major newspapers, the meet-the-people sessions with MPs, etc.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">- For a small, vulnerable country like Singapore, the political process must evolve slowly, if it is not to be a disruptive or even catastrophic force, as can be seen in so many countries today; and</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">- The issue of political freedom is really the concern of the minority only, as the majority are more taken up with bread-and-butter issues such as jobs.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Beyond the official responses, given almost perfunctorily, as if to waste no more time in getting to more important matters, there has been no indication that the Government even regards the call for political freedom as an issue, much less a problem worthy of careful diagnosis, prognosis and cure.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">At most, it is regarded as a nuisance, to be tactfully handled but quietly monitored to prevent it from getting out of hand. As long as it remains at the level of mere verbal disgruntlement, the Government seems willing and able to live with it.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">But it refuses to go away. With alarming regularity, over many years, it has cropped up at almost every public forum, debate or discussion. And dismayingly, the official response each time is the same.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">By now, the form and wording of these Government-people exchanges, especially those between ministers and young people in public chat sessions, are beginning to take on a tedious predictability, as are the polite silences following the official responses (which silences, however, could later turn up on the Internet dressed in colourful and scurrilous verbiage).</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Surreal feeling</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">HENCE, in the purportedly frank, friendly and no-holds barred sessions, the interlocutors seem locked in an uneasy ritual of spoken and unspoken responses, a pattern that will be repeated in similar future sessions, in a numbing cycle.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">One gets the surreal feeling that everyone seems trapped in a Samuel Beckett-like circularity that nobody knows how to break out of:</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Comment: There’s still fear in Singapore society.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 100%; vertical-align: baseline; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Government response: What fear? Singaporeans are freely expressing their views and criticisms, and the Government is not putting them in jail for it.</p>

              <p>Are there so <em>"many ways to argue against the government without getting yourself into any troubles...."</em> ?</p>
              <p>One sure way of avoiding any troubles is to be less persistent with your arguments, and not be a nuisance to the government - when they have no wish to listen to you.</p>
              <p>What does that make you ?</p>
              <p>Why do you even bother to insult the other countries about their corruption, when those countries practice corruption openly and do not need to disguise it in some legalistic ways to con their citizens ?</p>
              <p>At least the citizens know that their Government practice corruption, and that is the way for everyone to go to get things done.</p>
              <p>It now seems that in Singapore, Money is King - it gets you out of jail faster with an unusual lighter sentence, if the Law must be seen to be fair.</p>

              <p><strong> Constructing Singapore: "pragmatism" and personalised power  </strong></p>

Barr &amp; Zlatko Skrbis</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The legitimating myth of the primacy of innovative, problem-solving
              'talent', unearthed through 'meritocracy' and the quest for ever-higher
              levels of organisational efficiency in all aspects of society, business
              and government operates in tandem with another legitimating myth: that
              the government operates in a purely rational, scientific,
              problem-solving manner, free of ideological considerations.  The mantra
              for this plank of legitimation is the purest distillation of
              technocratic ideology: 'pragmatism'.  Talk to Singaporeans and they
              will assure you that the government is 'pragmatic', that Singaporeans
              are 'pragmatic', and that even if there are problems and faults in
              outcomes, the Singapore system of meritocracy and 'pragmatic
              government' is only 'logical'. This is one of the main features that
              give Singaporeans a perception of their special place in the world. 
              Singapore is tiny, but while most of the world is bound by 'ideology'
              and 'politics', Singaporeans punch above their weight because they
              operate as a 'pragmatic' and inherently logical meritocracy.<br> <br> Of course, the argument is specious. Far from being the distillation of
              impartial rationality, the Singapore system of governance is
              systemically pervaded with ideological, social, ethnic and class
              biases.  Yet the denial of the operation of ideology, or even politics,
              in the practice of government has a direct and profound effect on
              politics. <br>  <br> It restricts the space for legitimate social and political discourse,
              de-legitimizing the interrogation of aspects of the Singapore system
              that lie beyond the restrictive parameters of efficiency and
              effectiveness.<br> <br> ...Days after taking up the premiership Lee Hsien Loong revealed that
              he had been closely involved in bringing them ( Mr Khaw Boon Wan and Mr
              Tharman Shanmugaratnam) into Cabinet while he was still Deputy Prime
              Minister.<br> <br> These three men are the epitome of the Singapore technocrat, but their
              collective story -- and particularly the story of Lee Hsien Loong --
              demonstrates a central feature of the Singapore system of governance
              that is not celebrated by the regime.  We refer to the highly
              personalized nature of power, a feature that seriously diminishes the
              transparency of the system and disrupts its predictability.  Patronage
              or sponsorship is a vitally important element in the rise of anyone in
              the Singapore political and administrative elite.<br> <br> ...The oil that lubricates the Singapore system is the exercise of
              personal power.  The personal character of power is demonstrated
              without much effort in the person of Lee Kuan Yew, who remains in
              Cabinet 15 years and two prime ministers after his retirement from the
              premiership, with the creative title of "Minister Mentor". He was
              previously "Senior Minister" for the duration of Goh Chok Tong's
              premiership, but now Goh holds that title. <br>  <br> His presence in Cabinet must be most uncomfortable for Lee Hsien
              Loong.  Not only does he have to work in the shadow of the founding
              father of modern Singapore, as did his predecessor, but in his case the
              man in question is his father.  Even if Hsien Loong is really his "own
              man", who is going to believe it?  Hsien Loong did not even get to
              announce this Cabinet line-up.  It was Lee Senior who announced that he
              would continue in Cabinet for as long as he was fit and able to serve,
              and it was Lee Senior who announced the new hierarchy (for protocol
              purposes) within the Prime Minister's Office, whereby he would be third
              in line behind Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh
              Chok Tong.  An anonymous "government official" was left to confirm Lee
              Senior's announcement six days later.       <br> <br> Why does Lee Hsien Loong not simply remove him from Cabinet, as is his
              constitutional right?  Why did not Goh Chok Tong do so when he was
              Prime Minister?  Regardless of the power they notionally possess or
              possessed by virtue of their institutional positions, they both
              understand that in or out of Cabinet, Lee Kuan Yew retains his personal
              networks and his personal power. <br>  <br> He needs a seat in Cabinet only so that he can legally have open access
              to Cabinet and other official papers and legally retain his privileged
              links to the Internal Security Department.  On balance Lee Hsien Loong
              may not even want to see him gone yet because his own power networks
              are still underpinned by his father.  In the case of Goh Chok Tong, his
              efforts as Prime Minister to build a personal and independent power
              base were thwarted by both Lees -- father as Senior Minister and son as
              Deputy Prime Minister. <br>  <br> In the end, after being outflanked by father and son during a property
              scandal involving the Lee family in 1996, Goh gave up trying to
              exercise real power and handed the reins of domestic government over to
              Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. <br>  <br> In any case, Goh's efforts were never going to be very complete because
              he had no relatives in government.  It was probably this characteristic
              more than any other that made him an ideal stop gap between father and
              son.</p>

              <p>Are there so <em>"many ways to argue against the government without getting yourself into any troubles...."</em> ?</p>
              <p>One sure way of avoiding any troubles is to be less persistent with your arguments, and not be a nuisance to the government - when they have no wish to listen to you.</p>
              <p>What does that make you ?</p>
              <p>Why do you even bother to insult the other countries about their corruption, when those countries practice corruption openly and do not need to disguise it in some legalistic ways to con their citizens ?</p>
              <p>At least the citizens know that their Government practice corruption, and that is the way for everyone to go to get things done.</p>
