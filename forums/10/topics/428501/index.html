              <p>Landing a job with international production company Lucasfilm in 
              Singapore was an opportunity Li Feng just couldn’t pass up.  “I have 
              lived in ten cities in China; I moved so many times just following job 
              opportunities,” the 29-year-old looks back. Now employed with one of the
               best computer graphics companies in the world, Li Feng is thriving on 
              the challenge of working on big-budget television productions. He is a 
              Rigger, which entails making objects and characters move.</p>
              <p>Describing himself as an artist, Li Feng is passionate about creating
               art. “I’m getting paid for doing the things I love to do!” he laughs.</p>
              <p>Indeed, his own time is spent as creatively as in his work. He has 
              been around Singapore taking photographs as references for his personal 
              projects - short films and home animation.  He hones his artistic 
              ability further at Figure Drawing classes offered by Lucasfilm, 
              something he looks very much forward to every week.</p>
              <p>Li Feng is appreciative of the opportunities he’s found here. “I’m 
              learning a lot of new technology tools and processes, and the artists 
              and programmers I work with are amazing problem solvers,” he says.  He’s
               more than competent himself - during one of the regular reviews with 
              their US counterparts, a colleague called one of his rigs “awesome”.</p>
              <p>Relaxing at the movies, Li Feng especially enjoys those which ILM 
              Singapore has worked on, and will definitely be watching the credits. He
               comments, “It’s an amazing experience, seeing your name on the big 
              screen.”</p>
              <p>Adjusting to life in Singapore has not been hard, apart from the 
              initial acclimatisation shock (“When I left Beijing it was snowing 
              heavily, and it was so sunny when I arrived in Singapore”). It was even 
              surprisingly easy given that he’s still trying to improve his English 
              language skills. Li Feng puts it down to people here being exceptionally
               friendly. He is very amused when he recalls how his new Singaporean 
              friends would smoothly insert English and even Malay phrases into their 
              speech, even though they were trying to speak to him in Mandarin; a very
               typical local habit which still trips him up. In the same manner, his 
              Chinese colloquialisms also often confuse his friends. Still, 
              communication has not hampered his getting along with the 44 different 
              nationalities working in the studio. “It’s a very interesting 
              environment, and you get to see how different cultures work together,” 
              he says.</p>
              <p>The bachelor, who is about to get married, lives by himself, a 
              convenient distance from work. Getting to the office means a 15-minute 
              bus ride and a 20-minute walk, which he dismisses as nothing compared to
               the three-hour commute he used to make in his previous jobs back home.</p>
              <p>While he misses his family and fiancée, he’s happy here and keeps in 
              touch via telephone, webcam and email. Otherwise, his projects, and 
              late-night jogs with friends keep him occupied in his new home away from
               home</p>

              <p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/Library/1/Pages/777/mdmzhang.jpg" alt=""> <strong>Chongqing, China<br> Teacher, Pei Chun Public School<br> Been in Singapore since March 2006<br> Currently a Singapore Permanent Resident<br> </strong></p>
              <p>She used to watch Singapore television serials as a teen - now Zhong 
              Qing is living with her family in the garden city she admired.</p>
              <p>Having taught in China for eleven years, Zhong Qing arrived in 2006 
              through a collaboration between Singapore’s Ministry of Education and 
              China’s Hanban or the Office of Chinese Language Council International 
              (å›½å®¶æ±‰åŠž).  Recommended by the Chinese district education department, she 
              had applied for the posting on her own initiative.</p>
              <p>As a teacher, Zhong Qing had her first opportunity to visit her 
              family back in China after a few months of teaching during the local 
              school vacation period.  When she received her Permanent Residency in 
              2007, her husband and 11-year-old daughter joined her here.  They too 
              have become Permanent Residents and reside in a cosy apartment in Toa 
              Payoh, which is a five-minute walk away from the school where she 
              teaches.</p>
              <h2>A typical day</h2>
              <p>She likes Pei Chun Public School, where she teaches Primary 3 and 6.</p>
              <p>Work starts at 7 a.m. at the school, and Zhong Qing usually stays 
              till about 4p.m. to teach the Higher Chinese class or to mark 
              assignment.  She is also the teacher-in-charge of the Chinese Dance 
              co-curricular activity.  Zhong Qing’s daughter, who studies in the same 
              school, waits in the library for her before they go home together.  Her 
              husband, who also works at Pei Chun – he plans and organizes Chinese 
              cultural activities – is there from 7.30 to 4.30 p.m.</p>
              <p>Zhong Qing spends the rest of the day supervising her daughter’s 
              homework, taking care of household chores, or researching on the 
              internet.  The family often jogs together at the nearby MacRitchie 
              Reservoir, or swims at the public swimming complex.  “Here in Singapore,
               we have time to relax together as a family.  Public facilities are also
               accessible and well-designed,” Zhong Qing comments.  She appreciates 
              the school system which allows her daughter to develop in other areas 
              apart from focusing on homework.  Whilst she is often busy, her husband 
              and daughter have managed to explore “the whole island” and its 
              attractions.  Other diversions comprise the occasional karaoke sessions,
               and attending Chinese Orchestral concerts at the Esplanade.</p>
              <p>Her favourite Singapore dish interestingly is porridge - “I really 
              like the pork porridge, and fish porridge, too!” Zhong Qing enthuses, 
              “Also satay, and the famous chicken rice, of course.”  She has also 
              picked up a taste for Malay and Indian food.   There is no need to miss 
              food from home as Singapore has several restaurants serving the 
              “Chongqing hotpot” that her home town is famous for.  At home, her 
              husband does most of the cooking “since he claims to be the better 
              cook”, she laughs.</p>
              <p>Three years on, Zhong Qing still has a high regard for Singapore’s 
              governance, cleanliness, and efficiency.  She also loves the weather 
              here.  “The best thing about Singapore is how warm and friendly the 
              people are,” Zhong Qing says.  She recalls how when she first came, she 
              would get lost, and locals would not only give directions but also 
              accompany her to her destination.</p>
              <h2>Of dreams &amp; aspirations</h2>
              <p>Career-wise, Zhong Qing finds the local system very fair, with ample opportunities for teachers to up-skill.</p>
              <p>Among her hopes are to contribute more to the learning of Chinese in 
              Singapore, both as a teacher and as a mentor to the local beginning 
              teachers.  She believes she has much to share with her abilities and 
              experience with the Chinese language.</p>
              <p>So far her only challenge here has been with language, but she tries 
              to pick up English phrases whenever she can.  It helps that she works in
               a predominantly Chinese-speaking environment and her Singaporean 
              colleagues have actively introduced her to many local terms apart from 
              English ones.</p>
              <p>While her parents are unfortunately unable to visit due to poor 
              health, they are happy that she has settled in Singapore, and keep in 
              touch over the telephone and internet.  Zhong Qing would like to become a
               citizen one day, and sees her family integrating well in Singapore.  “I
               hope my daughter will gain admission to a local university, and 
              continue working and living in Singapore,” she says with a smile.</p>

              <hr>
              <p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/Library/1/Pages/1333/Nagaraj_35P1265.jpg" alt="Nagaraj Prasadh"> <strong>Chennai, India<br> Director HR – APAC, Polaris Software Lab<br> Been in Singapore since January 2008<br> Currently a Singapore Permanent Resident<br> </strong></p>
              <p>It took Nagaraj hardly a moment to say ‘yes’ to Singapore and barely two weeks to move here from Chennai, India.</p>
              <p>“It was a dream come true when my Global Head of HR gave me this role,” he recounted. “I just grabbed it.”</p>
              <p>He first visited Singapore at the age of ten and the diversity of 
              cultures and vibrancy of the city has resonated with him ever since.  
              The more he discovered about Singapore on his business trips over the 
              years, the more he fell in love with the city.  “This city has a lot to 
              offer, not just shopping,“ he said, alluding to Singapore’s reputation 
              as a shopper’s paradise. “Career wise, this is a place that motivates 
              talent.”</p>
              <p>The greatest assurance that he had made the right choice came when 
              his application for a dependent’s pass for his 81-year-old mother to 
              live in Singapore was approved without a hassle.</p>
              <p>“It says a lot about the forward thinking mindset at the Ministry of 
              Manpower,” he said. “It would have been too complicated a process 
              anywhere else in the world.”</p>
              <p>The talent-friendly immigration policy has been advantageous for 
              Nagaraj at work too.  He heads the human resource operations in the Asia
               Pacific headquarters of Polaris Software Lab, a leading financial 
              technology solutions provider for many of the top global banks and 
              insurance companies. He has been able to hire internationally and more 
              than fifty percent of the 350-strong team that is based in Singapore is 
              expatriate.  He also fully appreciates the experience of working in such
               a uniquely multinational and multicultural environment.</p>
              <p>The global mix adds buzz to the city’s after hours scene. Nagaraj has
               been to the Singapore Grand Prix, the Universal Studios theme park, and
               attended two National Day Parades, which he described as ‘electrifying 
              experiences’. He also loves exploring the local night markets, called 
              pasar malams, and the no-frills neighbourhood malls in the public 
              housing estates where the majority of the population lives.   And, being
               avid readers, Singapore’s National Library has become a favourite spot 
              for Nagaraj and his family.  He likes that Singapore has retained its 
              Asian identity and down-to-earth practicality.</p>
              <p>“Singapore offers the comforts of the west and the security of the 
              east,” he noted. “It has the public infrastructure that takes care of 
              the smaller details of life.”</p>
              <p>He remembers with admiration the smooth transition that his wife and 
              mother made to living in Singapore–they arrived on the morning flight 
              and was cooking lunch in their apartment by noon.  And before Nagaraj 
              could decide on getting a car for their convenience, he realised that 
              they were already exploring their new city via public transport with no 
              help from him. Back in Chennai, it was unthinkable to let his elderly 
              mother go out on her own using public transport.</p>
              <p>Another ‘unthinkable’ personal change for Nagaraj is the active 
              lifestyle he now leads. In the past, his wife used to tease that his 
              only exercise was to ‘walk to the car’. These days, after a full day at 
              work and some dinner at home, Nagaraj heads out for a late night run 
              that sometimes finishes around midnight.</p>
              <p>“I have never had the chance to do this anywhere else that I have 
              lived,” he explained. “Now I live just five minutes walk from a public 
              park connector that is well-lit, well-used and feels very safe at 
              night.”</p>
              <p>That brings him to the work life balance he has found in Singapore.  
              “It is a fast-paced and very competitive environment but I have found 
              myself to be more productive here,” he said.</p>
              <p>When asked what particular convenience of life he appreciates the 
              most, he jokes that it is being able to drink water straight from the 
              tap.</p>
              <p>“That says it all about the convenience of living in Singapore,” he chuckled.</p>

              <h1 id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_h1PageTitle"><span class="cufon cufon-canvas" style="width: 21px; height: 30px;"></span></h1>
              <hr>
              <p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/Library/1/Pages/777/li_yi.jpg" alt=""> <strong>Shanghai,  China<br> Channel Sales Manager, Resorts World Sentosa <br> Been in Singapore for 11 years<br> Currently a Singapore Permanent Resident<br> </strong></p>
              <p>Li Yi arrived on a scholarship from Singapore’s Ministry of 
              Education, 11 years ago.  Now the 29-year-old PR has embarked on fresh 
              adventures, working at the new Integrated Resort on Sentosa island, and 
              getting married to his high-school sweetheart recently.</p>
              <p>Li Yi’s attraction to Singapore began with its reputation as a Garden
               City and one of Asia’s “Four Small Dragons”.  Up to now, his enthusiasm
               for a life in Singapore hasn’t waned.</p>
              <p>“I feel great about how my career is going.  It’s exciting to be 
              part of something so new and big in Singapore,” he says.  With the 
              resort opening in just a few months, Li Yi’s pre-opening team is working
               extra hard, but he relishes the challenges ahead.  “Just imagine,” he 
              laughs, “I’ve worked with the Scorpion King and Marilyn Monroe, and 
              travelled with Shrek and Princess Fiona.  But my favourite aspect of 
              this job is that the work itself is ever-changing; it trains me to think
               and act fast and efficiently.”</p>
              <p>He recalls arriving in Singapore for the first time, in 30-degree 
              heat, coming from Beijing where it was -30 deg C.  “There was some 
              problem adjusting to the always-hot weather,” he admits, “along with 
              some language difficulties.”  In multi-cultural Singapore, it was a 
              challenge to understand the slang and many different dialects  spoken.  
              He shares a tip - “Mrbrown.com (a satirical site on current affairs) is a
               good webcast from which to learn Hokkien!”</p>
              <p>Despite this, Li Yi says there was no real issue communicating in 
              Singapore, and that it was fun interacting with Singaporeans.  He still 
              considers the people here the best part of his stay.  “This is a very 
              diverse society,” he says.  “I get the chance to meet people from all 
              walks of life, and to work with some of the most talented and 
              experienced people in the industry.  They come from all over – the US, 
              Australia, China, England, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, 
              Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam,  you name it...  
              yes!  Even Bulgaria.”</p>
              <p>Some highlights of his time spent here were when he organised a few 
              cultural and sports events for Chinese students at the National 
              University of Singapore.  “I also got to see Jackie Chan here, twice!”
              Li Yi finds time to indulge his passion for sports.  Besides a daily jog
               along Sentosa’s scenic coast every evening, he also teaches body combat
               and kickboxing at the California Fitness gym at Raffles Place.  
              Singapore has afforded him the opportunity to try a lot of sports, and 
              he’s all set to go flowboarding at Sentosa’s new Wave House soon.  The 
              keen singer is also a regular at various karaoke hubs around the island.</p>
              <p>Li Yi and his wife, who is also working here, have just bought an 
              apartment.  “Singapore feels ‘homey’ and safe,” he says.  “Singapore is 
              definitely part of our long-term plans.”</p>

              <p>QM himself needed little persuasion after his father, a hospital 
              head, returned with good reviews following a work-related visit here. 
              Three years on, QM is still glad he came. “I like the clean and green 
              environment, and the people are so friendly,” he says. Indeed, Nick 
              treasures the friends he has made over the years, especially through his
               sports activities.</p>
              <p>The fervent  footballer plays a few times a week. “My soccer mates 
              are Singaporean, Cambodian, Indian, Malaysian, Thai... some of us are 
              working and some are students, but we’re all passionate about football 
              and we play great as a team. There’s nothing like sport to bring people 
              together.” QM also jogs, swims, and plays basketball, sometimes with the
               students he meets through work. He’s especially appreciative of the 
              range and convenience of sports facilities around him. “The public gyms 
              in Singapore are so cheap!” he exclaims.</p>
              <p>All that exercise means QM needs to refuel often, not that he wants 
              another reason for eating - the variety of foods here are exciting 
              enough. “Bak kut teh, curry, seafood...” QM counts off his favourites. 
              “Vietnamese food, hotpots... I’m somewhat of an anomaly for a Southern 
              Chinese - I love spicy food!  That makes being in Singapore a plus.”</p>
              <p>QM is equally enthusiastic about his work. As a business development 
              manager he needs to travel regionally and around the island to meet 
              clients. “I like being able to meet and interact with different people,”
               he says. Good governance is not only a big help - “Doing business is 
              simple in Singapore, there is very little red tape involved” - but is 
              also a selling point he uses when telling potential students and clients
               about the benefits of coming to Singapore.</p>
              <p>He also doubles as an assistant teacher twice a week, helping new 
              students pick up the basics of the English language. He comments, “Their
               skills may be a bit shaky now, but Singapore is a very forgiving place 
              for learning the language - they know they can still get by in this 
              multi-cultural society.”</p>
              <p>As for keeping in touch with his family, QM takes advantage of 
              affordable telecommunications here and has made calling home daily a 
              tradition. “Sometimes I call while my mother is cooking and she’ll be 
              frustrated, but I know she’s always pleased to hear from me!” he says 
              with a laugh.</p>

              <hr>
              <p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;" src="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/Library/1/Pages/1287/CS3_Advocate_Avinash_Shot03-%28thumbnail%29.jpg" alt="Avinash Ravindranathan"> <strong>Kerala, India<br> Sr. Staff IC Design Engineer, Broadcom<br> Been in Singapore since October 2007<br> Currently a Singapore Permanent Resident<br> </strong></p>
              <p>As head of a young family, a good work–life balance is of top 
              priority to Avinash. The 34–year–old design engineer emphasises this 
              when talking about his work in Digital Video Technology for Broadcom, a 
              leading communication chip designer headquartered in California.</p>
              <p>“I’m very happy to work here,” Avinash states. “There may not be a 
              big design industry in Singapore, but my job offers a good deal of 
              flexibility in the working hours, as long as I deliver.”</p>
              <p>The doting father of a two–year–old boy relishes his position, which 
              allows him to work from home often. “Most weeks I don’t even spend five 
              days in the office,”
              he says. Part of this is due to the need to teleconference with other 
              parts of the world at odd hours, as the company has offices throughout 
              the United States, Europe, and Asia. There are also tight timelines 
              where the work has to be done as soon as any input is received, whatever
               the time of day or night. Some days involve difficult hours, but the 
              flexibility also means Avinash can find time for his family and himself.</p>
              <p>“I spend most of my free time with my son,” he shares. “I also read 
              when I can, and play tennis twice a week with my uncle and two friends 
              at the condominium’s facility.”</p>
              <p>The family enjoys a busy social life. They meet their friends 
              regularly at one another’s homes; large gatherings are organised every 
              few months. It was one of these friends, an ex–colleague, who enticed 
              him to make the move to Singapore three years ago.</p>
              <p>“It is easy to live here,” Avinash admits. He left his home in Kerala
               on the south–western Indian coast for work in Indianapolis in the U.S. 
              years ago, spent 2.5 years working in Penang from 2002, and 3 years in 
              Bangalore in 2007. “I’m comfortable working anywhere, with different 
              people, in different cultures. Still, it’s good to be in Asia.”</p>
              <p>In his current Physical Design department , Avinash works alongside 
              three Malaysians, a Burmese, a Chinese, and a Singaporean. We meet on a 
              regular basis and have meals together everyday. Only some folks utilise 
              the flexibility. Most of the team is in the office on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>Before moving here, the young professional had visited Singapore 
              several times to see his friends and relatives. Then a swinging 
              bachelor, Avinash initially found Singapore “too ordered”. Now, however,
               he has an appreciation for how “things fall into place – processes are 
              simple, infrastructure is reliable”.</p>
              <p>Avinash relates how his wife, who is in the finance sector, found it a
               breeze coming to work in Singapore. “The immigration process in 
              Singapore is a piece of cake!” Avinash considers it a big plus. “I took 
              two weeks for Singapore, and could get it done online.”</p>
              <p>The couple have just bought an HDB condominium in Admiralty, just 2km down the road from Avinash’s office. HDB, or <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/">Housing and Development Board</a>,
               is the government agency in charge of public housing.
              Avinash’s wife does most of the cooking at home. Avinash comments, “It’s
               easy to come by Indian food in Singapore. There is also a large variety
               of restaurants here, ranging from high-end restaurants to casual 
              eateries. And I love going out with my Chinese and Malay friends to try 
              different foods!”</p>
              <p>Avinash drives a Nissan, even though he feels it’s not very necessary
               in Singapore, as public transport is convenient. “Considering how close
               to work I live, plus I drive away from the city, I’m the last person to
               complain about traffic here!” he laughs. His wife takes a company bus 
              to her workplace.</p>
              <p>A family friend from Kerala takes care of their son while the couple 
              are at work, though Avinash notes he has the option of using childcare 
              centres, which he feels belongs to a system that is “more organised” 
              than in many other countries.</p>
              <p>When it comes to his son’s future education, the young father likes 
              having a choice of paths: between one of the many International schools 
              that Singapore hosts (including the Global Indian International School, 
              which has three campuses in Singapore) or local schools.</p>
              <p>“I like that we’re living in a First World city, close to home. We’ve
               been away from our parents too long,” says Avinash. The Ravindranathans
               return to India once or twice a year, and their parents in turn visit 
              them in Singapore. The island’s status as a travel hub means they get 
              many visitors, like old school mates, who often drop by on transit 
              during their journeys. Indeed, the region beckons, and they have been to
               Bali, Phuket, Malaysia. Avinash declares, “Lots of opportunity to 
              travel!”</p>
              <p>On weekends, the family enjoys visiting the many parks around 
              Singapore. Avinash reels off a list of favourites: Lower Seletar 
              Reservoir, Upper Pierce Reservoir, Hort Park, the Tree-top Walk... 
              “Parks are always nice, accessible, and have lots of space for my son to
               run around in,” he smiles. They also visit cultural and tourist sites.</p>
              <p>“In Singapore there are many opportunities to get acquainted with 
              different art forms. We like Chinese puppet shows, for example, and my 
              wife and I used to attend these and other cultural performances often, 
              until our son came along,” he muses.</p>
              <p>He is closely involved in the Mudra Cultural Society, which showcases
               traditional Indian art forms. Kathakali, a dance-drama based on Indian 
              mythology, was introduced to Singapore with a show in July and Avinash 
              was in charge of the event’s magazine. 10 performers were brought in 
              from premier institutes in India, drawing about 800 spectators in all.</p>
              <p>Avinash believes more diversity can only improve the country. He 
              says, “In Singapore, any activities you want to do, you can do.”</p>

              <p>How many of these jobs can be done by our jobless PMETs and fresh grads? We have to ask ourselves that.</p>
              <p>The PAP is spending our taxpayers' money to recruit foreigners to replace us. How ironical. The GDP is pushed very high as a result of the huge influx of foreigners coming to our shores, riding on the ripples of their spending on good and services.</p>
              <p>And they peg their bonuses to the GDP, paying themselves monetary incentives while bringing foreigners to replace us.</p>

              <p>Just met a filipino HR executive the other day. Singapore PR for the past 4 years. Her husband also filipino but Sg PR for the past 10 years.  I truly hesitated on speaking further to her despite her being a nice person. The sense of animosity thinking of how this job could have been done by a singaporean had overtaken my inkling to be friendly.</p>
              <p>These so called FTs are watching this elections closely. They know that local sgporeans dislike them and honestly, I hope opposition takes power and revoke the PR status of those whose jobs can be filled by singaporeans.</p>
