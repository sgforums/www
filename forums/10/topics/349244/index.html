              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/Lees/lhlglasses.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats<br><br></em>For
                  a government as myopic as this one, PM Lee Hsien Loong should be the
                  last to give anyone advice on the kind of spectacles to wear (see
                  report below). <br><br>The two organisations that handle the nation's
                  reserves -- one run by his father, the other his wife -- were so
                  short-sighted in their investments in Western banks that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we have lost
                  more than $100 billion to-date.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>The Minister Mentor and Madam Ho
                  have yet to explain what led them to take the decisions to inject our
                  funds into ailing and corrupt financial institutions. <br><br>Did
                  these banks invite us to invest in them like what Citigroup did to the
                  GIC? Who signed the cheques? What due diligence did the GIC and Temasek
                  perform? <br><br>Most crucially, whose glasses were Temasek and GIC wearing then? <br><br>Now when things go <em>ka-boom!</em> the Prime Minister calls on us not to see matters through Western glasses. Good grief.<br><br>Mr Lee says the media "should just present the facts". Okay.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>GIC
                  invested US$6.9 billion in Citigroup. Stocks in the bank plunged so
                  much that there is much talk that it might be nationalised.</li>
              <li>GIC
                  invested US$10 billion into UBS who stocks plummeted to historic lows
                  today. The Swiss bank has admitted to defrauding the US Government in
                  helping tax cheats and will pay hefty fines.</li>
              <li>Temasek invested
                  US$5 billion in Merrill Lynch saying that it had "great confidence" in
                  Merril. The bank went bust and its leaders are now the subject of
                  investigations by US authorities.</li>
              <li>Temasek invested $4.5 billion in Barclays. That same year the bank announced a write-down of almost that amount. </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>The
                  picture through any lens -- Western or Asia -- looks astonishingly
                  negligent. But what Mr Lee really meant was not Asian spectacles, but
                  rather the ones put in front of us by the Singapore Press Holdings. <br><br>If
                  it were indeed Asian glasses (think Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong,
                  Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc) that we are supposed to be
                  looking through, Mr Lee and company would have had to apologise to the
                  people for the financial debacle and there would be calls for the
                  leadership to step down. <br><br>At the very least parliamentary
                  opposition would be asking tough questions and calling the Government
                  to account and to take responsibility.<br><br>But with SPH glasses, the vision would continue to be blur and we will still be unable to see what is coming up ahead.</p>

                  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said there is a need for news media to
                  present objective reports and not to wear "western spectacles", local
                  media reported on Monday.<br><br>In an interview with TV broadcaster
                  Channelnewsasia, which is to celebrate its tenth anniversary on-air,
                  Lee said the challenge that news media is facing is to be able to boil
                  down information and present news neutrally out of Singapore.<br><br>"We
                  felt there was scope for perspective from Asian eyes. Not to put over
                  an ideology or a doctrine, but just present the facts, less the western
                  spectacles," Lee said.<br><br>Lee also told the broadcaster that the
                  government is building up capabilities to engage and leverage on the
                  new media at the next General Election in 2012, but he added there is
                  still a place for traditional media to be the trusted information
