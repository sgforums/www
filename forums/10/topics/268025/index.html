As a matter of fact, this regime practices a brand of tyranny which allows for one's citizenship to be rescinded (even for natural-born citizens, which would be unconstitutional and a gross violation of human rights had such legislations been in force in the free world) so long as you stay away from this regime for a period of 10 consecutive years.<br><br>It's no secret the abovementioned has been used against threats - be they real, imagined or potential - to this regime when their subjects are first exiled and then have their citizenship withdrawn.</div>
