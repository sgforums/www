            <div class='col-md body'>I think one has to look back to history to understand why the protesters actually attempted to submit their petition to the UK High Commission. If my memory doesn't fail me, I believe that there was an instance during the time where the Alliance was trying to negotiate with Britain for greater self-govt and eventually independence. I believe initially the document specified that all races would be equal. However on the insistence of the Alliance led by UMNO, the whole special privileges thing was incepted, hence serving as the basis for the eventual bumiputra policy.<br><br></div>

Our dear Dr M was one, but wasn't it the whole bumiputra thing tat eroded the support for him from his base which eventually led to his eventual demise from politics?</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">On the contrary, the Bumiputra Policy actually consolidated Dr M's autocratic grip over UMNO Malay with a culture that is heavily based on <span style="font-style: italic;">''politics of patronage''</span>.<br><br>Unfortunately, his Malay community turned on him when he publicly chastised and humiliated them - at an annual UMNO Congress - for the lack of economic and social progress within the community, inspite of the arbitrary Bumi Program, and for the lamentable state of affairs of the Malays continued lack of motivation to excel over the other Malaysian ethnic groups {races}.<br><br>The sacking of popular Anwar Ibrahim cemented the opinion of Dr M being a autocrat, one who wields extensive political powers and prepared to exercise the power to the fullest.<br><br>This divisive issue was one in a series that came after the disastrous gamble in which Dr M lost, when the Supreme Court ruled against him to dissolve UMNO as a legal entity after an internal division between Dr M being challenged by Tunku Razaleigh.<br><br>Subsequent to these events, the Lord President of the Malaysian Judiciary was removed from office, together with the Chief Justice of Sabah and Sarawak, and several other Supreme Court Justices on the side of the Lord President.<br><br>Dr M's politics of promoting his own ethnic community - at the expense of the other communities - has resulted in louder demands from within his own community, while the Chinese community remain self-sufficient from their historical and traditional past in commerce, the Indian community had remained largely as laborers working in plantations.<br><br>It is regrettable that the political leadership from the Malaysian Indian ethnic group - headed by Samy Vellu - indulges more in his own political and social standing and that of his cronies, then that of his own community.<br><br>At the age of 70 plus, he clings on to his position with no successor planned to provide political leadership, nor any long term vision for his Malaysian Indian community that is equal to that of that promoted by the Malaysian Chinese Association {MCA}.<br><br>If anyone is to be blamed, it is certainly not the British, but the politics of the bargain along ethnic lines - during the birth of Malaysia - started by Tunku Abdul Rahman, and subsequently refined by the various successive Malay political leadership.<br><br>It is more then forty-five years since Britain has granted independence to Malaysia, is it realistic for the Malaysian HINDRAF group to blame the British ?<br><br>It is plain stupidity if they believe that they will succeed in their <a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Monday/National/2093820/Article/index_html" rel="nofollow">petition to the Queen of England</a>.<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed the Malaysian Indians dragged the British in order to gain more international attention.<br><br>Obviously they cannot believe that Britain will help, right? Britishhave their own British Indians problems to settle too as racial divide does exist in Britain too (White vs Black vs South Asians(Indians, Pakistani) vs East Asian).<br><br>Back to the topic, I always believe the Bumpi policy is flawed. Use the national resource to help the Malays only, how about the other Malaysian ethnic groups? Aren't they Malaysians citizens?<br><br>However, due to this discriminative Bumpi policy, many talented Malaysians Chinese and Indians have moved overseas to nations like Singapore. Hence we can say we actually benefit from it.<br><br>Anyway the Malaysia Malay-led government is inept.</div>
