Britishhave their own British Indians problems to settle too as racial divide does exist in Britain too (White vs Black vs South Asians(Indians, Pakistani) vs East Asian).<br><br>Back to the topic, I always believe the Bumpi policy is flawed. Use the national resource to help the Malays only, how about the other Malaysian ethnic groups? Aren't they Malaysians citizens?<br><br>However, due to this discriminative Bumpi policy, many talented Malaysians Chinese and Indians have moved overseas to nations like Singapore. Hence we can say we actually benefit from it.<br><br>Anyway the Malaysia Malay-led government is inept.</div></blockquote>I certainly believe the ethnic Indians do not intend or hope to see any of the trillions of ringgit in compensation. Bringing up the matter to the British High Commission in KL was a way of having the matter in a higher profile. The Indian leadership in the MIC is known to be engrossed in its own prosperity and longevity. What happened to Samy Vellu? Such a good BullS******, who chooses to disappear at the right moment. It is said, he takes orders from the Malay masters, instead of fighting for the welfare of his race. Right or wrong?<br>The coalition of the three major races political parties are a farce. We know who's running the show.<br><br>The bumiputera affirmative policy was supposed to help malays as well as indigenous people to get a foothold in the economic race. It ended up spoonfeeding the malays, making them dependend on handout from the government. After years of the NEP, there are still certain quarters whom did not benefit from the policy. Who did? Those seated at the right places. And why would these people want the abolishment of the NEP when they can continue enjoying the free benefits given to them? The NEP has run its course at the expense of the other races. The country lags behind while it waits for the malays to catch up. While the other races are disadvantaged, they will find their way to carry on with life. Brain drain for malaysia, is another country's benefit.<br><br>The lyrics by the malaysian rapper using malaysia's national anthem does hold some truth afterall.</div>
