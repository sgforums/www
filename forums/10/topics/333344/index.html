              <p>At the end of the day,what do we accomplish by discussing politics here? The PAP sure as hell isn't listening to us. Most Singaporeans of the post-86 generation (my generation) are apathetic and couldn't care less about political and social issues until it hits them and their families.</p>
              <p>Most Singaporean will consistently vote for the PAP in elections. After all, when they control the media its not difficult to make them think that the opposition politicians are idiots.</p>
              <p>If you vote for opposition-your ward doesn't get upgraded and even then they'll just redraw the electoral district.</p>
              <p>Those who can afford it are emigrating Singapore to set up their homes elsewhere. I've served NS and I'm a patriot(at least I might have used to be...). The only reason for me to return are my family and friends present in Singapore. And the food. Thats about it. There's no tug at my heart strings or anything like that to me.</p>
              <p>No sense of belonging and no point with all this talk of changing the government when the people you fight for are apathetic about it. No point when the threat of defamation and bankruptcy hangs over you.</p>
              <p>I used to want to enter politics in Singapore when I returned from Australia. I actually used to be a moderate and respected the PAP at times but after so long I've lost any semblance of respect I had for them or their leadership.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for weakening the country and destroying us socially Mr Lee.I salute you with both my middle fingers. Until the old motherfucker Mr Lee dies,there's no pooint in any of this talk or me participating.</p>

              <p>Before the bear hibernate in winter, it has its fill of different kinds of food to allow its body to continue through the harsh winter period.</p>
              <p>Even the smaller animals like the squirrels will gather sufficient nuts into its nests before autumn sets in to be followed by three months of winter without food of any kind.</p>
              <p>The spider will find a new nest and appear again when spring appears.</p>
              <p>Can the human spirit and mind return to any active state after being starved of information and fed constantly with a flow of "specially formulated food" for the brain that will train it to respond to some specific impulse only ?</p>
              <p>When the human muscle is starved of nourishment, it will enter into a state of atrophy.</p>
              <p>What do you think will happen to the Human Mind when it is left in a constant state of stress, and its creative application is merely to find the means for the physical survival of Human existence ?</p>
              <p>It is sad that after our 51 years of independence, this PAP Government has kept us all in a constant state of struggle, making everyone of us to be dependent on a system created by them that will demand that Singaporeans tow the line, or pay the price if we step out of their system.</p>
              <p>Instead of withdrawing into deep hibernation without any preparation, it maybe better to either top up your tank with the fuel for your intellect, or support the likes of CSJ - {now that JBJ has gone ahead} - in his bid to breakout of the system that the PAP had created to keep Singaporeans under bondage.</p>
