            <div class='col-md body'>The digging of the Kra canal would not be a problem for us at all.<br><br>The reason is simple -- the traffic through the Malacca Straits is much higher than the Kra canal can possibly handle. The canal would only take a small amount of business from us. The Suez and Panama canals are mostly economic failures because the capacity of a canal is not very high, unless you spend terabucks to dig a really wide one. Add to this the enormous cost of running a canal and it is not even clear that Thailand would even benefit from it.<br><br>This is the real reason why no one has actually dug this canal -- there is a significant danger that it will be a money loser. The only reason why they are making noises about it now is that the digging of the canal would instantly create a few hundred thousand jobs, which would be a real boost for the ruling coalition now that unemployment in Thailand is so high. They are also trying to justify the immediate and continuing expense of the canal by saying that they will set up an export processing free trade zone around the canal, which will hopefully turn into an industrial powerhouse. This is nice in theory, but Thailand is lacking in the other factors that would cause such a zone to grow (skilled cheap labor, political stability, infrastructure, etc)<br><br>As it is, Singapore does not handle ALL of the traffic through the Malacca Straits and we never did. For example, we are unable to handle the largest class of oil tankers, so they just all sail right past us and dock at ports that can (such as Klang if I am not wrong). This traffic is a big pie and there is more than enough for everyone to get a piece. As long as we are competitive, we will still attract business.<br><br>About the moves of a few companies to PTP -- it's bad but not as bad as most people think. As it is, we are pushed to beyond maximum capacity, so even after they left, we did not lose that much money. Truth be told, PSA is so popular that we can afford to turn some people away. And Evergreen is already shifting some of its traffic back because it is beginning to realize PTP is cheap -- in every sense of the word  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

That has got nothing to do with the fact that PTP cannot handle that 10%, as it is PTP is still operating way below capacity. The retention of its Singapore services by Evergreen is called hedging its bets both ways, and its nothing any smart business people won't do.<br><br>As for the idea that "we can afford to let Evergreen and MSC f--- off because we have enough business anyway"...when will some ever learn? Thank goodness PSA woke up before these individuals did.<br><br>dkhoo, for your assertion that Suez and Panama Canals are failure, I really would like to see figures to backup that claim. As far as I know these projects were monumental successes, and provide the lifeblood of the shipping companies successes as they provide the only viable means of crossing from Asia to and from Europe(Suez) and to and from the PAcific and Atlantic(Panama)<br><br>For example, please provide figures to show shipping traffic through Suez vis-a-vis that for traffic round the Cape of Good Hope, which are the only shipping routes from Asia through the Indian Ocean and through to the Atlantic/Europe, with the Cape being the much much longer route.<br><br>As for the Panama Canal, how pray tell do ships cross from the Atlantic to Pacific, make their way round the antarctic from the south of Argentina?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, it is probably unfair to say that the Suez and Panama Canals are failures (the Suez was a success and the Panama Canal eventually became a borderline success, though it bankrupted the original builders).

While it is true that the premium product usually suffers most in a recession, that does not mean that our strategy is invalid. If anything, we should try for both ends of the market. For example, PSA should buy into PTP if given the chance (as it has done with ports all over the world). In addition, PSA should allow shipping lines a little more autonomy in SIngapore -- which was one of the reasons Evergreen left.</div>

But the distance saved is Only part of the equation. Most of this small extra distance is through the Straits of Singapore and Straits of Malacca, narrow congested waterways clogged with small islands and heavy traffic. Ships cannot do anywhere near a their maximum speed as they traverse these waterways. Add this to the fact that ships often have to wait to enter the Straits of Singapore, and then wait to enter the Straits of Malacca(or vice versa, depending on where they come from/go to) and you begin to see the likely feasibility for this project. The real time savings for using any proposed Kra Canal may be small, 1 to 2 days, but then one has to remember the saying, "Time is money". Now lets say the Kra Canal doesnt take all of SG port business away, lets say its only a "paltry" 20-30% of business. But whats the knock-on effect on Singapore as a whole? PTP eats away 10%, the Kra Canal eats another 20%. What are we left with?<br><br>MSC Evergreen left SG for 2 main reasons: High shipping charges and the fact PTP allows co-ownership. Your claim of "Singapore's high price is not just for fun -- it is because we give faster service and better connectivity" sounds like the crap excuse PSA gave at that time, and is reflected in the following 2 articles after MSC and Evergreen left<br><br>:<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020410re.htm" rel="nofollow">Singapore port says won't get into price war</a><br><br>but then in 6/02<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020603au.htm" rel="nofollow">Asian rivalry turns into a ship fight</a><br><br>Of interest in the second article is the passage: "Last week, it announced big discounts on port charges, and invited foreign shippers to invest in what was once a jealously guarded ``Singaporeans only'' strategic asset."<br><br>Compare this with their claims in the first article dated 4/02, which among other things, stated: "PSA would not respond to competition by slashing rates, as this could result in an escalating price war,"<br><br>Which<br><br>1) Makes the 2nd statement ring *REALLY* hollow, and<br><br>2) Makes them look like fools, or worse, liars.<br><br>Which then raises the questions:<br><br>1) Is the price the shippers originally paid really the lowest premium price for premium quality, but more importantly<br><br>2) Why did it need such a hard kick in the teeth for them to wake up?<br><br>The bosses of Evergreen and MSC did not wake up one morning and said 'I know, we'll move our Singapore operations to PTP!'. It was a long considered move, and the result of unsuccessful attempts to get the docking charges in SG reduced and to have a stake in the port. Which was, as expected, rebuffed with "You're paying the lowest price possible for SG's port quality"(which as it turned out, wasn't the case). And before anyone wonders why not let bygones be bygones, this issue contains lessons for all sectors of our economy and for all Singaporeans who assert that they're Numero Uno and will always be.<br><br>Someone has pointed out in another forum sometime back, all PSA lost from this fiasco is some money, it will survive. But remember, every container that we lose does not affect only PSA. It also affects a whole host of other Singaporeans, from the driver who drives the prime-mover carrying the container to those whos job is linked to the contents of the container. And maybe, just maybe, more than money will be lost by these people. Chew on that<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, those articles are interesting -- good find. I do admit that PSA can be rather arrogant at times. The humility of the old guard is slowly getting lost with the fresh blood entering the company. It is true that PSA needs an attitude adjustment and I am sure that this minor insult will work out in the long run.<br><br>About the Malacca Straits -- your point about the straits being overcrowded is exactly the reason why the canal will not be a problem. The straits are already over-capacity -- which implies that there is more traffic that wants to use it but can't. Even if the canal were dug, all it would mean is that more goods would decide to sail via the straits / canal rather than take some other route or not sail at all. The pie would get bigger and again everyone would get a piece. I am a strong disbeliever in zero sum games.<br><br>While I agree that PSA's typical GLC uncompetitiveness is a real problem, particularly in this depressed world economy, I cannot agree that the Kra canal would be a big problem even if it were built. Again, the canal has the smell of a political move rather than a strategic decision. I will believe it when I see it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dkhoo,<br><br>glad you enjoyed the article, amazing what the Straits Times misses out isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Agree with your analogy that the Straits of Malacca is overcrowded and the Kra Canal will ease the overcrowding, but my point remains, lets take a very basic example:<br><br>Randomly select a hundred ships that pass by Straits of Malacca today. Say, 70 call into Singapore, 30 sail on by.<br><br>Then factor in the Kra Canal, assume it relieves Straits of Malacca of 50% of traffic, or 50 ships. Best case scenario, the 30 that sail on by Singapore use the Kra, along with 20 ships that would have otherwise come to Singapore, use the Kra. That leaves PSA with 50 ships. Worse case(unlikely), it'll see only 20 of the 70 calling into Singapore.<br><br>Now<br>50/70 = 71% or 29% reduction<br>20/70 = 28% or 72% reduction<br><br>The real case will likely be somewhere near the best case, but even so, if you look at www.psa.com.sg, Singapore handled 15.52 million TEU last year. A 29% drop in traffic would roughly represent an almost 5 million TEU loss yearly. Can we afford that kind of haemohrrage? To answer that, remember that MSC had a 2 million TEU capacity in SG while Evergreen had only 1 million TEUs. As a country with no resources but a deepwater port that makes transshipment as one of its main source of revenue, I'd say we can't. Not during the best of times, and especially not in times like this. Remember the fact that each lost container doesn't just cause PSA losses?<br><br>Like I've said before, the above example is vastly simplified and makes lots of assumptions, but I think it will suffice in here.<br><br>Of course, its all hypothetical, for the Kra Canal hasn't been, or looks likely to be, built. But it gives the "We'll survive despite the Kra Canal because Singapore is always Numbah One!" camp something to think about. I hope.</div>
