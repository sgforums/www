            <div class='col-md body'>ok, I know this is a very old thread, but just wanna add something in. . .<br><br>The japanese also offered to help, financially AND technologically build the kra Canal, buit the Thais turned them down, probably pride, but we will never know. . . and yes, like what everyone else is saying, Malaysia also does not stand to gain anything at all with the building of the Canal, Thailand itself will be split, with their Muslims further south and their Buddhists north, not a very good idea to let ur people, already seperated by religion, to be seperated physically with a canal as well<br><br>my two cents, I dun expect replies, just for the sake of putting more info</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Thai government must weight the advantages and disadvantages of building the kra canal, not just simple dug the canal and money will roll. If the canal project is to go ahead, the thai government will have to sacrifice the current lucrutive South Thailand tourism industry like Phuket and Krabi in the Andaman Sea and Ko Samui/Ko Pha Ngan in the Gulf of Thailand due to environmental impact.
