              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>“Please, get out of my elite uncaring face.”</strong><br>-Wee Shu Min</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I am sure many people recognized this quote by Miss Wee. After all, the Wee Shun Min saga has been one of the most widely debated topics in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The whole issue started when <a href="http://derekwee.blogspot.com/2006/10/future-of-singapore.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Derek Wee</span></span></a> published his rejected letter to the straits times on his blog. Derek wrote in response to the “</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Straits Times article (dated 24 Sep) on PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference to </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">.” </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Basically, he pointed out the uncertainties and pressures Singaporeans are facing in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">He touched upon issues on the competitiveness in our society, ageism faced by Singaporeans in their 40s, “quitters”, the call to procreate etc. He ended off by expressing his opinion that the current PAP government is on a different platform from the people because they do not understand our insecurities. His honest letter echoed what many Singaporeans have been feeling and hence many people started pouring in comments supporting his point of view.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Miss Wee Shu Min was one of the few who responded to Derek’s post in her own blog. However, her response was curt and insulting. She not only lambasted Derek’s post into pieces, she personally insulted him by calling him “</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">wretched,” “idiot,” a “leech” among many other degrading words.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore, she labeled him as “the other class” and stated that </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> is </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">“a tyranny of the capable and the clever, and the only other class is the complement.” She then stated how her future is not certain but “brighter than most people’s.” The worst part was she ended her diatribe with “get out of my elite uncaring face.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Derek is an average Singaporean while Miss Wee is RJC Student, Humanities Scholar and daughter of PAP MP <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/AboutUs/Org-MP-MP-Prof-WeeSiewKim.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mr Wee Siew Kim</span></span></a>. People interpreted her post using this context and came to conclusion that Miss Wee was being elitist. They then started chiding her post. As a result, she closed down her blog after a few days. (Her blog link was “<a href="http://www.suchvividnothing.blogspot.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.suchvividnothing.blogspot.com/</span></span></a>“</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Caught in a wildfire</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Little did she know, her post was replicated in the <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=sammyboymod&amp;msg=121090.1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sammyboy forum</span></span></a> and was spreading in cyberspace. It was scrutinized, analyzed and debated by all who came across it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">By her post, Miss Wee has broken many Singaporeans out of their “false consciousness,” thereby making them realize the great class divide in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">. Thus this is where the story begins. The story of how the “divide just grew larger.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Note: Below is my analysis with regards to this saga which was posted in <a href="http://charissaishere.blogspot.com/2006/10/and-divide-just-grew-larger.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">my blog a few weeks ago</span></span></a>. In it, I analyzed the truth of her remarks, and how this saga intertwined with other events and our current government. Through all these, I would illustrate how the social divide in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> grew larger. Lastly, I reflected upon some questions we might want to ask ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br><strong>Analysis</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em><strong>Point1: The daughter of a PAP MP</strong></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So, it is true… her father is <a href="http://www.voucher.com.sg/jalankayu/MP.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">PAP MP Wee Siew Kim</span></span></a> (of Jalan Kayu division in Ang Mo Kio GRC). I think the only reason why this saga has taken the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> cyberspace by storm is because her father is a Member of Parliament. He was voted in by Singaporeans and thus suppose to serve us Singaporeans. Thus, linking Miss Wee ideas to her background would in turn lead to her family upbringing. Singaporeans naturally infer that ideas reflect her father’s teachings. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Being an PAP MP, he is expected by Singaporeans to have good ideals. Singaporeans hoped that he embodies their version of good ideals. Sadly, after this episode, many find their whiter than white impression of PAP MPs tarnished. Many fail to realise that perhaps most PAP MPs ideals are quite different from what the common men desires his leader to have.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">From Miss Wee’s post, Singaporeans were offered a glimpse of the ideals of a PAP MP’s daughter. Most who read it would likely conclude that her ideals were uncompromising, uncaring and selfish. Hers was one of class divide and survival of the fittest. There was no room for discourse, discussion and airing of plights. Whether or not one tries to think otherwise, it is difficult to deny that her ideals are reflected partly in her upbringing. Although these ideals were not blatantly conveyed by a PAP MP, Miss Wee is somewhat seen to be a representative. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">These were not the ideals which most Singaporeans hoped their MPs to have. In the past, many have chosen to ignore this, but the truth has surfaced again. How many people would remember and try to make this party change? How many people would choose to bury this memory?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br><em><strong>Point 2: The elite</strong><br></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, when one is a scholar, he/she is automatically labeled as elite. If one goes to top schools like </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">RGS</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">RI</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, Chinese High, RJC, Hwa Chong JC, ACS, ACJC etc., he/she would be labeled as elite.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If one’s parents were doctors, lawyers, directors in companies etc, he/she would be labeled as elite.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If one’s family is well-to-do, he/she would be labeled as elite.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If they continue to be successful in life as a result of all these supporting factors, he/she would be labeled as elite.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">These criteria are not exhaustive. However, to be labeled as true blue Singaporean elites, it is sufficient for individual posses all these criteria mentioned.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Here, “elites” is a “dirty” word. The country can be said to be build up by “elites”, but yet most Singaporeans have a distaste for “elites” and especially against those that call themselves such. Miss Wee posses the 1st four criteras; she is a RJC Humanities Scholar, she went to RGS and RJC, her father is an MP, <a href="http://www.stengg.com/AR2003/1_snr_profile.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">President of Defense Business of ST Engg</span></span></a> and her family is well-to-do. Therefore, most would label her as an “elite”. Miss Wee herself blatently declared she is “elite” anyway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Since it is already obvious to people reading her blog that she is an “elite”, she could have made people madder by telling people that she is one. What perhaps made it worse is the context in which she used this word. She told her readers/Derek Wee to “get out of my elite uncaring face.” That final sentence summarized where she is coming from and how uncaring she is to anyone else that is not part of her class.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Normal Singaporeans who are not as “rich” and “smart” like her would thus take offence. By her background and her wanton use of the word “elite”, she effectively pit herself against the “other class”, the non-elites, the commoners. Not exactly the smartest move.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Before the newspapers revealed that she is a scholar, people already had grievances against her being elitist. Now, some are starting to question why they are funding the education of “this type” of scholars. After all, scholarships are paid by the taxpayers, who are the “other class.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Why should the “other class” pay for such a scholar to belittle them and possibly give them more chance to advance further in life than them? Why give her a greater possibility of “ruling” over the “other class” in the future? As a result of this, more Singaporeans would come to realise something is not right and ask, “Why, Why, Why?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br><strong><em>Point3a: Her beliefs</em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">From her blog, it can be inferred that some of her beliefs are;<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a) </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> is “a tyranny of the capable and the clever, and the only other class is the complement”<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">b) A society which is “far too survival of fittest” is ok.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">c) The PAP government is not to be blamed for “making” such a society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br>For part a), in the context of the using words used (”tyranny”, “other class” and “complement”), it is difficult to dispute that she is not speaking what she truly felt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">“Tyranny” is equivalent to “ruthlessly ruling” over someone/something.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">By using the phrase, “other class,” she effectively divided the society into half; rulers and those being ruled</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The word “complement” could imply that those being ruled are supporting the rulers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Therefore, most people would feel that this ideal implied that the “clever” and “capable” rules over the common people who merely exist to serve them. Thus Miss Wee has reduced the commoners to servants to the rulers. She forgets that the only reason she is able to be in such a position and privilege class is because the “other class” allows her to do so. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If the “other class” do not accept their position in society and go against Miss Wee’s class, then she would most likely be reduced to a commoner like them. Thus there is some truth to her words; the “other class” is in this sense complementary to the “elite” class she belongs to.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For b) and c), I think she meant that since the world is in a perpetual rat race and there is no escaping it, one can only accept it and find ways to cope with this (ie. get better qualifications, upgrading skills etc). Due to the same reason, the government should not be blamed for the bad things that happen to people. She seems to imply that the only person to be blamed is oneself. This is a chilling echo of PAP’s ideology. How many times have we heard them repeating this idea but in different forms? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The thing is, Derek was not lamenting about these facts. I felt that he was merely voicing out his concern that the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> society could be more humane and the government should try to understand us better. In fact, judging from the comments in his blog, many Singaporeans do relate to what he said. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">What then is wrong for calling for a more compassionate society? Can our government not help to relieve the stress? Can our government not do better in understanding us and thus formulate policies to help us cope better? Is that too much to ask for? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Not everyone is calling for a total welfare state. There are those that just want the existing help avenues to become truly open, the stigma of being labeled “unsuccessful” reduced, want more protection for older workers who are being retrenched due to ageism, etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ms Wee argues that the government is not to be blamed. I will only buy such an argument if only governments are not governing people. Which is ridiculous. By the very status of being a government, they are the ones molding the society which we live in. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I can name so many instances by the back of my hand; they create the rules of the game, foster racial harmony, provide affordable education for everyone, formulate laws, help foster economic growth, ensure Singapore continue to be attractive to foreign investors, relocated people from slums to HDB flats in the past, stipulate compulsory savings via CPF, adjust GST, adjust ERP, provide disincentives and now incentives for people to have more than 2 babies etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">These instances are just a few which demonstrates that the government is meddling in all aspects of our lives. Thus, whether we want it or not, they do affect us direcly or indirectly. The successful policies that manifest themselves in society are often highlighted as their clever doing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Yet, when policies go wrong and directly/indirectly adversely affect Singaporeans lives, they tell us not to blame them and blame only ourselves. They are known to be too quick to claim successes and deny failures. The government has to learn that they are partly to blame for manifestations of their policies in society that have gone wrong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br>The extent governments are affecting our life can be found in their wide ranging legislation. You can check it out <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/html/homepage.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">in this website</span></span></a>. It ranges from the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?actno=REVED-91&amp;doctitle=EMPLOYMENT+ACT%0A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">broadcasting act to</span></span></a></span><span> </span>Singapore employment act to Road safety act etc. Basically, there is an act for every possible thing imaginable. They are required for the rule of law to prevail in <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> anyway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br>Through legislation, the government policies affect our lives. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">My whole point is the government does play a part in shaping our society and hence they do have to shoulder part of the blame. Although it might not be blatant, they do have the power to affect our lives and make it better; they can formulate more citizen-friendly policies. In the context of Derek’s letter, perhaps a clearer legislation against wrongful dismissal of Singaporeans in their 40s would help, for example.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br><strong><em>Point3b: An apology of sorts</em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Noticed that her father only apologised for her “insensitive language” but “he stood by his daughter’s ‘basic point.’” He claims that her basic point is that Derek “should not be bemoaning about the Government and get on with the challenges in life.” Right, somehow, he forgot to comment on her other points which rile Singaporeans more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Her basic points (as put forth in point 3a) have been illustrated above. Since he never commented on these basic points, I shudder to think that he could be harboring such views (refer to point 1).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Mr Wee then pointed out that his daughter’s “privacy has been violated.” Right, judging from the way our PAP government persecutes racist bloggers and want to “manage” the internet chatter, it seems that they do not hold privacy rights in high regard. Anyway, most people know that the internet is not private.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The ideas highlighted by Miss Wee and her positions as an “elite,” have set off the alarms bells for Singaporeans again. Their suspicion that many of the “elites” (who might possibly become future leaders of </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">) are disconnected with the rest of society has been reinforced again. The suspicion that this “elite” class think they are superior, do not understand the plight of an average Singaporean. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Most average Singaporeans harbor a dislike for them. This hooha “nicely” coincided with the news of a poor <a href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2006/10/suicide-at-chinese-garden-mrt.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">40 year old man</span></span></a> who committed suicide at Chinese Garden MRT station. He was a poor men with S$39 K worth of debts. More was dug out and people concluded that he had fallen out of </span><a href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2006/10/inconvenient-truth.html"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2006/10/inconvenient-truth.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">’s tiny net</span></span></a>. As a result, many began to link both problems together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hence the class divide jus grew larger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br>Many Singaporeans are now questioning if this is the society that we want to live in? Whether the government policies of extreme meritocracy are really that good? Whether our political leaders who come from the “elite” class understand average Singaporeans and thus are able to tailor policies suited for us? Whether the ideology of system of government should change?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br>On a happier note, Mr Wee is of opinion that “new media of the Internet is such that if you don’t like what she has said, you have the right of rebuttal.” I think most people would be glad that he realises this point. This perhaps signals that the PAP government realizes </span>that political &amp; social discussions online is self-regulatory to a large extent. This episode shows the extent Singaporeans would go to rebuke or refute claims by other individuals.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I feel that this is the gist of this episode. We Singaporeans must hold our government accountable to us. After all the government exists to serve us.</span></p>

              <div>July 10, 2008 by <a title="Posts by admin" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?author=1"><span style="color: #2255aa;">admin</span></a><br>Filed under: <a title="View all posts in Voices of the People" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?cat=7"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Voices of the People</span></a> </div>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive03/sylvester.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Singapore Democrats writeup on activist Sylvester Lim<br>09 July 2008</strong></span></p>
              <p>Not one looking for prestige and position Sylvester Lim keeps a low profile, preferring to go about helping the <strong><em>Tak Boleh Tahan!</em></strong> campaign in his winsome and unassuming ways. Together with 17 other activists, Sylvester is charged with taking part in a protest against the rising cost of living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So what made him take the plunge?</p>
              <p>“<strong>Anger,</strong>” he says. “<strong>Anger at myself for the fear, the fear of speaking out. I have had enough of being afraid of the government. Almost everyone that we speak with are complaining about the high cost of living.</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>But they feel helpless. They know that the government is very stingy and that it is not doing much to help the masses while it enriches itself.</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>But at the same time, people feel powerless to do anything about the situation. They are almost like giving up hope and just resigning to whatever comes their way.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Seeing this and after overcoming his own fear, encouraged by the SDP’s leadership by example, Sylvester decided to take up a more prominent role.</p>
              <p>“<strong>Of course, my wife and I are still afraid of the consequences. We are human beings with feelings. But we care enough for our family and our country. If we don’t make a stand, then who will?</strong>” he says. “<strong>If everyone waits for the next guy to do something first, nothing will happen.</strong>”</p>
              <p>So how did he feel when he was first arrested and brought to the police station on 15 Mar 08?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I was very tense and afraid,</strong>” admitted the activist. “<strong>But having made up my mind and resolved to stand up against injustice, I got to experience the unfairness of our system first hand.</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>The police officers were doing their jobs with efficiency, but I suspect that they were surprised that we were not scared of them. The positive attitude of my fellow protesters helped to lighten the mood when we were in the lock-up. We even sang songs like We Shall Overcome.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Will he be afraid when he goes to court on 11 July to answer charges of conducting a procession and assembly without a permit?</p>
              <p>“<strong>No. What we are doing is not wrong and should be encouraged. The government should be afraid, as more and more people are standing up against it. We can see the rise in the support for our actions and it is this spark that will become a raging fire.</strong>”</p>
              <p>A doting husband and father, Sylvester acknowledges that he is fortunate to have his wife who is supportive of what he does. Initially, because of the fear, she did not want him to be too exposed and to be in the frontline.</p>
              <p>“<strong>But having met Dr Chee and the rest over a period of time, we are convinced that this was the right thing to do,</strong>” he says.</p>
              <p>“<strong>When the police delivered the charge letter to my residence, my wife calmly signed for it on my behalf,” he recounts. “When my son asked about it, she just told him in front of the officers that the government wanted to charge his father for protesting. The police seemed surprised that they were not intimidated and accepted the letter so readily.</strong>”</p>
              <p>In this regard, Sylvester who runs his own business, is unlike his fellow Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>“<strong>No,</strong>” he disagrees, “<strong>we are just normal Singaporeans wanting a better life for ourselves, our children, family and our country. We love our country and want our country to be a better place to live, work and retire. The only difference is that we have overcome the fear of the government.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Sylvester harbours the hope of seeing a freer society in Singapore, one whose citizens are able to speak out freely, one that is compassionate and dynamic. This comes with more opposition in parliament where policies are debated robustly.</p>
              <p>“<strong>I especially want to see our children placed under less stress and more welfare assistance for our elderly,</strong>” he adds. “<strong>When I heard my son and his friends wanting to leave Singapore for good, I feel very sad for our country. In fact, many of them have already left Singapore.</strong>”</p>
              <p>The mild-mannered defender of democracy has a simple yet profound message for his fellow Singaporeans: “<strong>Individually, we cannot do much. But as a large group supporting each other, we can change Singapore.</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>How long more are we Singaporeans going to continue to live in fear and allow the government to do anything they want without consequences?</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>If we don’t step forward, who is going to? If we don’t take action, who is going to make the change for our families?</strong>”</p>
              <p>Sylvester ended the interview with these telling words: “<strong>There is something wrong with our society and we need to have the moral courage to stand up and take action. We are just normal Singaporeans who love our country and do what we should be doing as citizens.</strong>”</p>
              <p>We urge all of you reading Sylvester’s words to take action. You don’t have to do anything earth-shattering to contribute to the cause. Just come to Sub-Court No. 23 at 9 am this Friday and say hello to those who have been charged.</p>
              <p>It will mean a lot to Singaporeans like Sylvester, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=290"><span style="color: #2255aa;">Suraya, Jufri</span></a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=283"><span style="color: #2255aa;">Jaslyn</span></a> who have heeded the call of democracy and stepped forward to hold aloft the flame of democracy.</p>

              <p><strong>More foreigners, "I know how Sinaporeans feel" - SM Goh</strong></p>
              <p><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20091107/tap-677-new-immigrants-help-sustain-enri-231650b.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/2009110...i-231650b.html</span></span></a><br><br>SINGAPORE : Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said new immigrants help sustain and enrich the quality of life of Singaporeans.<br><br>Speaking on the issue for the second time in three days, Mr Goh said without Permanent Residents (PRs) and new citizens, Singapore will soon go the way of the dinosaurs — as the population will begin to shrink in 2020.<br><br>Mr Goh said in the last 10 years, the number of people aged 65 and above has grown by about 100,000 while the number of children aged below 15 had shrunk by about 50,000.<br><br>This is an unsustainable demographic structure. Economic growth may also slow by 1 to 2 per cent.<br><br>A recent trip to his ancestral hometown in China’s Fujian province provided SM Goh a chance to reflect on the subject of immigration and identity.<br><br>"The previous 16 generations, including my father, were all born in China. I was welcomed not as a Chinese national, but as a Singaporean. It is possible for one generation, for new immigrations to become loyal to Singapore, to Singaporean values, and to contribute to Singapore society," said SM Goh.<br><br><strong>At a community event on Saturday, Mr Goh said he understood how some Singaporeans felt crowded out by new citizens and PRs, whether in housing, jobs or schools.<br><br>New immigrants were also perceived as "taking advantage" of better opportunities here, without giving back to the community or doing their share of National Service.<br><br>Mr Goh noted that the influx of new immigrants has become an emotive issue that goes into the heart of what it means to be Singaporean. And the challenge for the government is to convince the public that Singapore is better off with new immigrants.</strong><br><br>Mr Goh said the question is whether they sustain and add to the quality of life here.<br><br>And he believes they do — by supporting population and economic growth, and by enriching the cultural scene.<br><br>But the government too, needs to address what the newcomers can do to integrate, and how it can help.<br><br>Mr Goh said "We will have to face up to the problems encountered by Singaporeans on the ground. Explaining in macro terms using overall statistics is not good enough. We have to deal with real situations faced by Singaporeans.<br><br>"This immigration issue is a critical one, and we must bring Singaporeans on board to understand and support what we are doing. <strong>They must feel that they have a stake in the intake of immigrants and migrant workers, and see that these people, by bolstering our economy and demographic structure, make their lives better and not worse.</strong><br><br>"Singapore is at a threshold. If we turn away immigrants, it will have dire long—term consequences for Singapore. If we have them in the right numbers and quality, it will boost our economic vitality." </p>
