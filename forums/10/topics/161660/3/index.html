            <div class='col-md body'>this thread, like many others are stupid to start with. i served 2.5 yrs in ns many years ago. hated every moment but fully understood the need for a strong deterrent. anyone who craps about how mankind must live in peace and bla bla bla is not living in the real world. even if the military here is more hype than substance, it does give others some thoughts about invading sg. lest you forget how waking up one morning to learn that saddam had his troops simply drove into kuwait, and in less than a day it became a new iraqi territory.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay. So most of you believe that many have indeed committed suicide becuase of NS. Some of you are in to abolish NS. Many are not into it because Singapore needs the defence force, which is true.<br><br>However, the point is many of you believe that people would not volunteer for NS if it is not made compulsory. For that, how sure are you? Ask yourself if you are very sure about that with the evidence from the later generation who are about to enter NS.<br><br>Should Singapore be more transparent about the NS suitation? As some of you have said, many have indeed committed suicide because of NS.<br><br>Most of you said NS was bloddy tough for you. So why was it tough to you? Was it necessary of the officials to be tough. Was the timetable set too demanding?<br><br>Some of you are saying that because it is a must, you have no choice but to go for NS.<br><br>So overall, it's hard to say who is for NS and who is not if we just imagine that Singapore is something like the UK.<br><br>When the government cut down the Singapore NS term from 2 1/2 to 2 years, the media did street interviews. All of the people said they were pleased and that their sons supported the NS plan. But were these all true words / thoughts? Were there other negative comments but the media just did not publish them. Don't forget, the government monitors the media closely in Singapore.<br><br>So there are deaths, the government had them covered up.<br>NS is tough, but Singaporean male are made to go through them.<br>Some want NS abolish.<br>Many don't want NS to be abolish because Singapore is too vulnearable.<br>Many do not believe that Singaporeans would volunteer for NS.<br><br>What i want to say is that you guys have the power to choose, not the government. If you don't voice out your opinions, they will never take any action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my two cents' worth, most males would prefer not to serve, but most of us have no choice, as dictated to the law. You can make darn lot of noise; write to the ST about your views; request to the President that you do not want to serve; or go to the Speakers' Corner and talk the entire day if you want, you will still need to serve the two years to this country that you are living in. Even if you are the President's son you will still need to serve; only people who do not need to serve are non-Singaporeans. So since you do not have a choice, you might as well try to learn as much as possible from this period. It will be a good experience, if you try, especially with the brothers who will stand with you through the toughest times and the darkest nights.</div>

U created military vaccum in sg.<br><br>And within few hours our very "friendly" neighbours up north or down south will use some lame excuse, such as:=<br>"To protect sg from plundering into chaos"<br>and invade sg. As a goverment, will u allow urself with even 0.000000000001% chance of getting into such a shi**y mess. Just imagine, within 48 hours after the law is effect the whole of sg is now in the hands of another country.<br><br>Again, sounds abit far fetch eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Then could u provide me the evidence + proof and gurantee chop that the above won't happen if such a law comes into effect?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The age old maxim applies.You do not own what you cannot defend.<br><br>Assuming you abolish NS and you set a timeframe..it will take a long time to secure the necessary number of volunteers and recruit enough Regulars to make up for that shortfall.<br><br>There are people out there who want this nation sunk because we are a prosperous nation with ties to America.NS may not be the best solution, but in this volatile world, one extra man in uniform never hurt anyone.<br><br>Australia has passed a law allowing military deployment in their streets, France is facing chaos and even the gendarmarie are unable to cope well.This is a very unstable world and perhaps you might not have had the chance to see a larger picture during your NS days, but those of us who have, the situation out there is not for the faint-hearted.<br><br>Those nations who have ended compulsory military service have done so after decades of review and actual compensation in force recruitment and adjustment to show an overall net improvement in military capability.<br><br>Are we there yet?No.So the best solution for now is to serve and take care of yourself in the Army.Our Army is not as siong as South Korea, and I can say that if you use your minds well, there is no reason why you should be subjected to unnecessary abuse inside.Usually it is due to a reluctance to speak up and stand up for your health that gets you into trouble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Smart. Firstly, no one can be 100% sure of everything. Nothing would always turn out to be 100% our way. Humans have their own unique set of thoughts.<br><br>Firstly, i must highlight that besides our present NS force, there are still people to defend our country. They are doing it for a living. People like the police force and stuff like that. Why had they join the force? That we must look into. MR Goh Kim Swee was the one who proposed the idea of NS. It was becuase Singapore at that time greatly needed a fighting force large enough to defend Singapore for the British announced it's withdrawal plans from Singapore. So, Singapore had only less than 3 years to build it's own army. but how can we ensure a regular flow of army without incurring higher costs was National Service.<br><br>And of course, it worked well.<br><br>Today, we have people taking up jobs in the military as a living.<br><br>So why don't we make the military job more attractive? That's what i meant. Make NS not compulsory. Let young singaporeans volunteer themselves. Chunk in some good benefits.<br><br>To answer the question on how sure i am that singapore will not be in chaos. No one can be sure. I believe not even you can say a definite answer. What i can see is that we should take education to a further step. have some students learn the importance of defending the coutnry. If you look at the present syl. , it's way to little. So, if we start from educating the young, plus a better benefit, who knows, we may have a better fighting force, willing to fight for singapore. Better than the present. That's what i see.<br><br>octega said that neighbours like malaysia (north) and indonesia (south) may invade singapore during chaos. That's very wrong to say that. Fristly, you may start a potential war between our neighbours and we all know that will be the end of singapore if that happens. We depend on them for lots of stuff like oil and water. But i believe that they have intergity. We should never ever let our personal opinions like that affect our judgement.<br><br>So what i'm saying is that you got to think further. What's the point of making NS compulsory? We got some who are so unwilling in the force. We can build a much better force if it is not compulsory.<br><br>It also promotes the government's latest policy in giving singaporeans more freedom. So let us all have the freedom to choose if we want to serve</div>
