So, the focus now rest on their intent instead of their assembly. Since, they were caught red-handed with signs of protesting nature, they ran afoul of other laws. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually relm did bring a fresh perspective on ns for me. i have never thought of ns as a violation of my human rights. i has always thought of ns as a duty that i must do, but i have never thought that it violated my human rights. i suppose i was brain washed. ns is not necessary a violation of human rights but i can see how it can be argued as as a violation of human rights. i wonder why i never thought of it that way. arrrrr, i have been brain washed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi again. According to what i know, the US enlistment act is pretty similar to the one in Singapore. This is beacuse most countries are trying to make you guys 'volunteer' for NS so that there is no legal backing for you to quit once you join. It is also because these countries have signed the UN universal declaration of human rights which forbids forced labour but, yes, it did say NS is not included. But most countries will never take that risk so they had this as some kind of back up plan in case the UN law fails in some way.<br><br>About Toofree's comments, I was just answering to Toofree's last post. Thus, since Toofree had my comments directed to the various sections on the Enlistment act, I had only used those sections to justify my point at that time.<br><br>If the US enlistment act is the same or similar to the one in Singapore, the same 'loophole' will be visible.<br><br>One thing strange about the Singapore enlistment act is what it has added after the main enlistment part. Wonder why Singapore chose to add that.<br><br>Next, propaganda has also been used by Singapore. The media has been playing adverts about the armed forces, am i right? Then, have you seen any other country doing that? Few does. So don't be fooled by what you see. Ask yourself, if that's really what's going on.<br><br>Is Singapore's armed forces large, too large. And is way enough? That, I can't say. For i have no stats on that, unless anyone can provide some stats. If Singapore has more than expected, I would suggest lessening the intake and spending the money and time to train on the present unit. Experience and not total strength is the one that wins at the end.<br><br>Well, I will be away for a couple of days. I'm truly sorry if i can't respond to your comments. Will be back sometime next week. [/img]</div>
