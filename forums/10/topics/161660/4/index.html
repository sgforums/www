Nothing would always turn out to be 100% our way. Humans have their own unique set of thoughts.<br><br>Firstly, i must highlight that besides our present NS force, there are still people to defend our country. They are doing it for a living. People like the police force and stuff like that. Why had they join the force? That we must look into. MR Goh Kim Swee was the one who proposed the idea of NS. It was becuase Singapore at that time greatly needed a fighting force large enough to defend Singapore for the British announced it's withdrawal plans from Singapore. So, Singapore had only less than 3 years to build it's own army. but how can we ensure a regular flow of army without incurring higher costs was National Service.<br><br>And of course, it worked well.<br><br>Today, we have people taking up jobs in the military as a living.<br><br>So why don't we make the military job more attractive? That's what i meant. Make NS not compulsory. Let young singaporeans volunteer themselves. Chunk in some good benefits.<br><br>To answer the question on how sure i am that singapore will not be in chaos. No one can be sure. I believe not even you can say a definite answer. What i can see is that we should take education to a further step. have some students learn the importance of defending the coutnry. If you look at the present syl. , it's way to little. So, if we start from educating the young, plus a better benefit, who knows, we may have a better fighting force, willing to fight for singapore. Better than the present. That's what i see.<br><br>octega said that neighbours like malaysia (north) and indonesia (south) may invade singapore during chaos. That's very wrong to say that. Fristly, you may start a potential war between our neighbours and we all know that will be the end of singapore if that happens. We depend on them for lots of stuff like oil and water. But i believe that they have intergity. We should never ever let our personal opinions like that affect our judgement.<br><br>So what i'm saying is that you got to think further. What's the point of making NS compulsory? We got some who are so unwilling in the force. We can build a much better force if it is not compulsory.<br><br>It also promotes the government's latest policy in giving singaporeans more freedom. So let us all have the freedom to choose if we want to serve</div></blockquote>if malaysian and indonesia will not attack us in the times when there's no NS..<br>so what's the point of having it?<br><br>shouldn't we be like brunei then?</div>

Not because I am loyal, but because of what is at stake here for me. While I have the necessary requisites to stay overseas for good, I chose not to. Why be a 2nd class citizen there? For those yapping about scraping NS, maybe you should really consider what is valuble for you here? If family ties, friendship and the people around you in Singapore does not mean a thing to you, then perhaps you may be better off some other countries where you will be happy.<br><br>I have been through my NS in a combat vocation in the 90s.

            <div class='col-md body'>To say there is no potential war between our neighbours because "they have integrity" is simply not living in the real world; and to think "that will be the end of singapore if that (war) happens" then start your migration plan now.

NS has been a good part of my life, giving me an experience that I overseas colleagues never had, and this experience is useful even after I left full time NS. Learn to live with ppl (esp many of us fr one child family), learn to work as a team, and nothing test your team spirit better than putting you through a week long exercise. If you mix well with those around you, you will never be tekan, if you don't, no need to wait for sergeant.<br>Or anybody want to admit that physically you are not capable of handling NS? I hope not.<br><br>Do we want NS or reservists abolished because it is a waste of yr time and yr job more important? The fundamental question is, Do you want play your part in defending yr country? if you do, how? if you don't, say so!! DonÂ’t divert and talk about politics or foreign immigrants or thinking that half the reservist will run in time of war or even want to define your homeland before you want to serve. If half the reservists run away, including the PAP, will you stay and fight?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there's no need for a big-scale human defence force. But because politicians/citizens can make silly mistakes with stupid remarks about other countries (kaypoh) and incur people's wrath who could protest aggressively and be a potential problem for our politicians, they (politicians) thought it best to devise a NS defence plan to deal with those situations.<br><br>So is that the right thing to do/have? What's the right thing to have/do?<br><br>Knowing some politicians in the region do make silly remarks often and easily incur the wrath of people (like China-Taiwan), I think such places are not<br>"safe" to be in.<br><br>The place I want to be in is a place where politicians/people (in and around) don't poke their noses in other affairs. They make peace with everyone, not war.<br>They're really good neighbours (like NZ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So perhaps the question should be: do we have "silly" politicians/citizens within our ranks and what are we really doing about it? He/she/they could be our greatest enemy/s!!<br><br>And imo, having a huge human defence force doesn't deter enraged people from attacking us - they'll just find other ways than confront head on with our forces.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strongly agree.<br><br>I believe that terrorists are having a much smaller scale 'army' than the US but they managed to destroy the WTC and kill the many innocent lifes. So it does not matter how big your army strength is but the experience is what matters. The careful planning is what matters. There are of course more to add on.<br><br>So are singapore's NS men 100% willing to fight for their country? Will they run away? That, i don't think anyone can be sure of. And since no one can be sure, it's way to dangerous. That's why, we should make NS a volunteer thingy , chunk in some good benefits and that's the best army we will have. They volunteer for they want to defend. They have something which they call home and they will not run in times of chaos.<br><br>It would be a much better force. Yes, the total strength woul;d decreases but what is equipped with this new force is the willingness to fight for their country. And it's not based on the government forcing them but their will power is the one that drives them.<br><br>I believe that they can be equal or better than the present NS men.<br><br>Today in present society, a large army that is forced to be on duty does little but will power immuned in them does wonders</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i did not say that 'countries that do business with us will not attack us'. That, i swear it did never say a word. It's totally wrong to assume.<br><br>So you think i'm doing an academic research here? On this god dam forum. Go get some upgrades for your brain. Think further. Do you think this is a right place to research politics? Further more, why should one be doing a research on NS in singapore?<br><br>No no no. I'm not doing a research for academic purpose. A fool would only think of that. It's much worse. Got it? It's very complex. That is the thing i'm doing. So let me warn you guys that it's wise to think before you post anything. Evidence can be easily collected directly and indirectly.<br><br>I'm not just on the topic of NS. Many of you have actually helped me in some ways on my other topics. ha. many thanks.<br><br>So, is it really that easy to blend into singapore? than, do you mean that a terrorist who speak english can easily blend into the society. wow.<br><br>And you said singaporeans don't undersatnd me. wow. you are god. you know everything. yeh right. very funny. you don't even know my true identity. that's totally wrong to assume.<br><br>Yes. Singapore is a free country. BUT BUT BUT. Singapore has signed several, and i mean lots of agreements with the UN. Including the UDHR. The singapore laws are made according to the UDHR for your information.<br><br>Saying that the UN and the UDHR is rubbish shows how rash a desicion you are making. If someone were to make this matter of discrimating the UN stuff as stupid big business, i can tell you that singapore will not survive long. The UN may cut of ties with Singapore. And that means Singapore will no longer have the external protection.<br><br>So watch your words. Think before you post. For whatever you say sgdiehard, it's totally rash.<br><br>And of course, it shows how little you know about the world around you. It totally a disgrace to have you as a global citizen.<br><br>National service. What's the whole point in giving you money?<br>What's the whole point of you reporting to the camp? The officials will call your name and you take that stupid step forward. It's because of that step that you have just runied everything. They are actually making you 'volunteer' for NS so that no law can actually protect you. They are making it suit the UDHR so that it is not a form of force labour. They are twisting things here and there to make it such that you are the one who volunteer for NS.<br><br>Volunteering for NS is the way how singapore runs NS. Few know it. The government is actually making you to have that step forward. That step and the oath, you have a choice to not make or do it.
