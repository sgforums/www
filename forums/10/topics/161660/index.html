            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">UPDATE! MANY OF YOU HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE TOPIC HEADING SO I AM REPHRASING IT TO</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>[SHOULD SINGAPORE HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF OPERATING NATIONAL SERVICE?]</strong></span><br><br>What do you think of it? Well, before you even come to a conclusion, read below.<br><br>Many around the world, and i mean many, have sent mails to the United Nations calling to abolish national service around the world. However, the UN of course, can't do that. And so, they came up with a report specially for that.<br><strong>http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/7CE2591E478971AEC1256E680037B66A/$File/G0410972.doc?OpenElement - website for the report by the UN Chief</strong><br><br>There had been many recent deaths reported. What seemed to be happening is that the media has taken sides and to report the news in the Governmnet's favour. Can't really blame them for they are the only media and of course, closely monitored by the government = no freedom. It's totally different from the US where freedom rules.<br><br>The news of the deaths jsut seem to fade away and there  has been not much probe into it. What really happened, we don't really know the whole picutre. Are there more deaths than reported in the news? I can say a definite yes.<br><br>Just look at the PSLE examinations. Many have committed suidcide because of their results. But have the news reported any in the recent years? NO. There are no reports on the tv but, i have spoted one in the SPH straits times. It is a fact that many commits suicide beacuse of their results.<br><br>So, is the government hiding something from us about the actual deaths. The inhumane punishments during national service, is it legal of them to do so? NO. It is a no. Why? Well, read up on the law. Singapore has agreed to several UN agreements and it clearly states HUMAN RIGHTS. You can search for UN Human rights via Yahoo! . It states all the laws and stuff there. <strong>http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/index.htm - website for Human Rights Law</strong><br><br>It's so contridicting.<br><br>My suggestion is that the government should use things like CCA points rewards, pirority to enter uni here and stuff like that for those who willing come forward to participate in national service for two years when they hit 18 instead of making it compulsory.<br><br>So, who's in to appeal to the government to abolish national service?<br>If you need for back up evidence, i have plenty and i can go into detail. Singapore has indeed broken many of the human rights agreements of the UN. Go check it out. It;s a fact</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've just found this website with the really funny article about singapore's ns being illegal.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">National Service in Singapore is illegal.<br><br>Section 10 of the Constitution of Singapore states :<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Slavery and forced labour prohibited<br>10. -(1) No person shall be held in slavery.<br>(2) All forms of forced labour are prohibited, but Parliament may by<br>law provide for compulsory service for national purposes.<br>(3) Work incidental to the serving of a sentence of imprisonment<br>imposed by a court of law shall not be taken to be forced labour<br>within the meaning of this Article.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Which means that forced labour is prohibited unless for national<br>service purposes.  Now Section 12 of the Constitution of Singapore<br>states :<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Equal protection<br>12. (1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to<br>the equal protection of the law.<br>(2) Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall<br>be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only<br>of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the<br>appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in<br>the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or<br>disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any<br>trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Which means that sexual discrination is only allowed when parlaiment<br>does it by law.  Now Section 2 of the Enlistment Act (Chapter 93)<br>states :<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>"person subject to this Act" means a person who is a citizen of<br>Singapore or a permanent resident thereof and who is not less than 16<br>years and 6 months of age and not more than 40 years of age or, in the<br>case of a person who<br>(a) is an officer of the armed forces; or<br>(b) is skilled in an occupation which the Minister by notification in<br>the Gazette designates as an occupation required to meet the needs of<br>the armed forces,<br>not more than 50 years of age;<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Which means that enlistment is not enforcing sexual discrimination.<br>That translates that Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Armed<br>Forces are violating section 12 (1) of the Singapore Constitution when<br>they are only enlisting men and not women.  Sexual Discrimination can<br>only be dowe with law.  Since Enlistment Act does not only call for<br>the enlistment of men then excusing women is unconstitutional as<br>Section 12 of the constitution calls for equality.<br><br>Besides the following is declared in the "Proclamation of Singapore"<br>contained in the "Independence of Singapore Agreement  (A Constitutional Law):<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Now I LEE KUAN YEW Prime Minister of Singapore, DO HEREBY PROCLAIM AND<br>DECLARE on behalf of the people and the Government of Singapore that<br>as from today the ninth day of August in the year one thousand nine<br>hundred and sixty-five Singapore shall be forever a sovereign<br>democratic and independent nation, founded upon the principles of<br>liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her<br>people in a more just and equal society.<br>(Signed) LEE KUAN YEW Prime Minister of Singapore<br>Dated the 9th day of August, 1965.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Which means that Singapore should always seek the happiness and<br>welfare of her people in a more just and equal society.  By only<br>having men serve national service and excusing women from national<br>service Singapore is definitely seeking the happiness and welfare of<br>her people is a less equal and just society.  Singapore is violating<br>her own Independence of Singapore Agreement.  Why are Singaporean<br>allowing this?<br><br>Since the enlistment of only men is illegal then all the men in<br>military prison are there in violation of the Independence of<br>Singapore Agreement and the Constitution of Singapore.<br>Besides the "Proclamation of Singapore" is protected by Articles 5<br>of the 1968 Geneva Convention on International Laws and Treaties.<br>A violation of "Proclamation od Singapore" is a violation of<br>International Laws.  Such violation of International Laws will<br>bring Singapore's existence into question!!!<br><br>I NOW call for the release of all military prisoners in Singapore!</span><br><br>What's your view on this article found on the web.</div>

It's totally true. The law i stated exists.<br><br>It's just like when i've told my friends about the space exploration- return to flight mission to the iss, they think i'm crazy. But, without the space programme, we will not survive the solar merger, the asteriod mn 2004 which is heading onto near collision course in 2029 and stuff like that. We will all be dead.

The latest, Malaysia.<br><br>So what i'm saying is that these are all facts. They are all presented in front of you at this instance. If you say that was stupid, than you are really really really selfish about yourself.
