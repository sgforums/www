              <p><em>Chee Soon Juan<br><br></em>In what has become a landmark speech <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Minister Mentor pointed out in July 2007</span></strong> that, thanks to his party, the economy was headed skywards: Tourism, consumer confidence, job creation, inflow of wealth, etc were all at an all time high. Not only was the economy going great guns, social development was apparently also doing swimmingly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/MMLKY.jpg" border="0" alt="MM LKY"></p>
              <p>MM LKY </p>
              <p><br><br>In fact things were so rosy then that Mr Lee couldn't hide his excitement: "If there are no wars or oil crises, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>this golden period can stretch out over many years</strong></span>."<br><br>Barely one, let alone many, later Singapore's economy started to go into a tailspin – and, might it be pointed out, there were no wars or oil crises.<br><br>In other words, the MM's prediction was spectacularly wrong – not that there is anything surprising with that, Mr Lee had been wildly off the mark many times before:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In January 1998</strong></span> Mr Lee predicted: <strong>"I don't think you're going to get a significant or dramatic political change in Indonesia." Four months later, Suharto was toppled</strong>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In 1995</strong></span>, the then Senior Minister proclaimed: <strong>"Both the Suzhou and Singapore sides recognise that they need to work as a team for the Suzhou Industrial Park to compete successfully..." Three years later, the project collapsed</strong>.<br><br><strong>In 1997</strong> just prior to the general elections, <strong>Mr Lee told HDB residents that upgrading would lead to a "40 to 50 percent increase in the value</strong> of your HDB property." <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before the year was over</span>, property prices plunged with the advent of the Asian financial crises</strong>.<br><br>There's nothing wrong, of course, about making bad predictions. Let's be fair, everyone at some point has made calls that have turned out embarrassingly wrong. Mr Lee has made, and will make, his fair share.<br><br><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>The difference with the MM's words is that they drive policy formulation which involves spending of billions of dollars of public monies.</strong></span> Once spoken, these words precipitate PAP groupthink; few dare to tell the Mr Lee that he is wrong, let alone hold him accountable for his errors in judgement which have catastrophic consequences.<br><br>Oracle of the East he is not but you wouldn't know that if you spoke to the servants with whom the MM surrounds himself and on whom he lavishes made-in-heaven salaries. These highly intelligent individuals apparently go into a synaptic short-circuit when they are in his presence and suspend all form of independent thinking. (See also <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/556-tearing-down-the-facade"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">Tearing Down the Facade</span></span></a>).<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Herein lies the danger, which is that of allowing one man to call the shots and of accepting Mr Lee's propaganda that he and the people he has anointed are the only one's who have the answers to our future.</span></span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This danger must be highlighted, and highlighted again and again until it drenches our national psyche</span></strong>.<br><br><strong>In the beginning...</strong><br><br>It is clear from his utterances in that fateful 2007 speech how little Mr Lee understood of the economic world. Just months before the crash of the global financial labyrinth, at a time when the system was at its bursting point, the MM told us all:</p>
              We have drawn in many professionals, especially in financial services, which has expanded to its highest ever levels. Many financial institutions have moved their top people and their regional headquarters to Singapore...<br>
              <p><br>Indeed, Mr Lee and his ministers had gone into overdrive to push Singapore to be the financial capital of the world, regardless of whether our national infrastructure was equipped to handle such a brutal and risky transformation or not. He did not see, nor did he understand, the decadence that had enveloped Wall Street and that the corruption was already driving the world's financial system to its knees. He was still telling Singaporeans that the boom could go on for years.<br><br>Here's what had happened: Banks in the US were hedging on the housing mortgage market through financial instruments they called "credit default swaps".<br><br>These fancily named derivatives were really nothing more than side bets -- not unlike the kind that avid football fans place when they watch two teams play each other. The bettors need not buy a direct stake in the teams but stood to gain or lose depending on the outcome of the game.<br><br>This was what happened at the banks: Essentially, bets were taken on how the mortgage-loans performed. If mortgagees defaulted on their loans, insurance would be paid out through the credit swaps that investors purchased.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/Missingthesigns.jpg" border="0" alt="We Finance Anyone"></p>
              <p><br><br>Of course, the financial institutions raked in the money when the US housing market was on a roll between 1996 and 2006, with much of activity fueled, unfortunately, by unscrupulous lending. Housing loans were given to people, called subprime borrowers, who did not meet the criteria for borrowing at the prevailing interest rate. This was a recipe for trouble because as soon as the US economy and the housing market started to wobble, many of these borrowers were unable to keep up with their loan payments.<br><br>Then someone screamed “Subprime!" and all of a sudden the housing industry pancaked. Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures escalated as Americans defaulted on their housing loans and banks were left high and dry.<br><br>But as bad as the debacle was, it still wasn't the worst thing that happened to the banks. On the side, investors came a calling and wanted to be paid because they had bought the credit default swaps. The problem was that the banks and investment houses had sold so much of these instruments that they were simply overwhelmed by the amounts they owed (estimates have it in the trillions of dollars). Unbelievable as it may seem, these financial institutions did not set aside any funds to make these payouts. The scheme was really nothing more than legalised gambling run by over-leveraged bookies. Hence the banking meltdown.<br><br>Of course, hind-sight suffers not from astigmatism. But there were many signs that all was not right within the financial world. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Billionaire investor Mr Warren Buffet had repeatedly warned of the scourge of the derivatives market, calling them “weapons of mass financial destruction”.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/warren_buffet.jpg" border="0" alt="Warren Buffett"></p>
              <p>Warren Buffet - <em>"There is an electronic herd of people around the world managing an amazing amount of money - I think it's a fool's game"</em></p>
              <p><br><br><a href="http://www.fintools.com/docs/Warren%20Buffet%20on%20Derivatives.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">As early as 2002</span></span></a>, Mr Buffet was already warning: <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">“I view derivatives as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.”</span></strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">In 2003</span></span>, <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>he repeated his message that derivatives can push companies onto a "spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown" and didn't mince words saying that these financial schemes have been devised by "madmen".</strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Mr Buffet rang the warning bell again in May 2007:</span></strong> "There is an electronic herd of people around the world managing an amazing amount of money...<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/34606-buffett-on-derivatives-a-fool-s-game"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">I think it's a fool's game</span></span></a>."<br><br><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">As prescient as he was, Mr Buffet was not the first to sound the alarm against the Wall Street whiz kids. Dr Frank Partnoy, an investment banker himself before he became a professor at the University of San Diego, had written a book back in 1997 entitled <em>F.I.A.S.C.O.</em> in which he warned about the shenanigans that were going on in the financial houses.<br></span></strong><br>He authored another book in 2003, <em>Infectious Greed</em>, where he again called attention to the marketing of derivatives and how this was destabilising the financial market.<br><br>Another academic, New York University's <a href="http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=852345&amp;lang=eng_news&amp;cate_img=logo_world&amp;cate_rss=WORLD_eng"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">Dr Nouriel Roubini</span></span></a>, had warned at the World Economic Forum in 2007 that a “hard landing” was about to come with the bubbles created by the financial system. (Were any of our ministers there?) He predicted that all the unbridled wheeling and dealing would end in “painful consequences for the U.S. and the global economy.”</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note that these red flags were all raised <em>before</em> Mr Lee Kuan Yew made his “golden period” speech (Mr Buffet's "fools' game" warning came just two months before).</span></strong><br><br>In fact, just before the MM's speech, Bear Stearns, then the fifth largest investment bank in the US, was breathing its last breaths. Two of its hedge funds were up to their eyeballs in the mortgage derivatives market and they were bleeding funds. The bank was losing so much money that shortly thereafter it filed for bankruptcy. <br><br><strong>If the Buffets and Partnoys were screaming about the risks, and if Bear Stearns had collapsed in such a stunning fashion, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why did Mr Lee and his cabinet ministers not note these danger signals and adopt a more cautionary tone in his speech</span>?</span> Were they all asleep at the wheel?</strong><br><br>But not only was there no circumspection, Mr Lee was urging everyone to “maximise our opportunities in this golden period”!<br><br><strong>In competence and in experience</strong><br><br>Mr Lee had claimed sole credit for himself and his ministers that things had gone on so well. He actually started off his speech with this:</p>
              Every night there is this buzz along Orchard Road. <em>It is because a competent and experienced team of ministers</em> took painful and unpopular measures in the last few years since the Asian financial crisis to get our domestic policies to encourage growth. Tourism is up. Consumers have confidence; restaurants, food courts are thriving; unemployment has remained low at 2.9 per cent with a healthy creation of 49,000 jobs for the first quarter this year. This is on top of a record creation of 176,000 jobs in 2006. We are into a period of good economic growth and social development. (emphasis added)<br>
              <p><br>He repeated the line later in the same speech: "An experienced team of ministers is getting our policies set in the right direction." In 2003, never tiring of reminding the people of his goodness, Mr Lee repeated that Singaporeans were fortunate in having a "competent government in charge, anticipating events."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Competence”, “experience”, and the ability to “anticipate events” are the words Mr Lee chose to describe himself and his ministers, and to justify their salaries.</span></span></strong> Indeed if they all possessed such traits of distinction why did they not see, and warn Singapore of, the crisis that was brewing and all the warning signs that were hollering for attention?<br><br>Now that the MM's rhetoric has been so extravagantly shown up, there is only silence within the establishment. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Speech? What speech?</span></em> seems to be the new strategy going forward. Everyone pretends that it was never made. And yet, that speech is probably the most serious misjudgment of Mr Lee's carreer.<br><br>But among the many words that Mr Lee has spoken only one matters, but it is one that we will not hear: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Accountability.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><br><br><em>Part II, to be posted shortly, highlights even more of Mr Lee's wayward predictions and how they have made the current economic situation even more painful than it has to be.</em></p>

              <p>In <a href="/index.php/perspective/special-feature/1881-holding-lee-kuan-yew-accountable-part-1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">Part I</span></span></a> of this essay, <strong>I drew attention to the fact that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was negligent when he, in a speech he delivered in July 2007, called on Singaporeans to <span style="color: #ff0000;">“maximise our opportunities in this golden period.”</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>This happened at a time when the world's economy was already teetering on the brink.</p>
              <p><br>But some argue that Mr Lee is no longer the prime minister and hasn't been one for nearly two decades. Why should he be the one to take the blame? Take a look at what he wrote in his memoir:</p>
              Singapore's financial centre was considered over-regulated compared to Hong Kong's. Critics wrote: "in Hong Kong, what is not expressly forbidden is permitted; in Singapore, what is not expressly permitted is forbidden”...Only after the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) had demonstrated the strength of its system to weather the financial crisis of 1987 and 1997-98 did I feel confident enough to move closer to a position where what is not expressly forbidden is permitted.<br>
              <p><br><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note the pronoun.</span></span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It was he</span>, not the cabinet,</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>who allowed the financial system to become less regulated</strong></span>. Note also the period: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It was post 1997</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He was not the prime minister then</span>, it was Mr Goh Chok Tong. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why was PM Goh not the one to decide which course our financial system should take?</span></strong><br><br>But why is a speech Mr Lee made in 2007 even important in the present crisis? <br><br>If you were a Lehman Brothers' investor back then and had heeded the MM's advice, you would have ploughed even more money into buying the minibonds. (Some of the Town Councils obviously did.) If you were looking to buy a house, you would have paid top-dollar for the bubble property price. And if you were looking to start a business then, you would have borrowed heavily to capitalise on the boom.<br><br><strong>And if you were Mr Lee or his daughter-in-law, Ho Ching, you would have placed tens of billions of dollars of our reserves in Western banks. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Which is exactly what they did.</span><br></strong><br><strong>Banking on banks</strong><br><br>The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek Holdings, led by <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Lee and Madam Ho respectively, were merrily maximising their opportunities by bailing out European and American banks even as these companies were going bust due to corruption, greed, and bad management</span></strong>. <br><br>In the second half of 2007 Swiss bank UBS had written off US$33 billion due to bad debts and exposure to the US subprime crisis. Despite this meltdown, the GIC incredibly injected nearly <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a4a05a14-d27d-11dc-8636-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">US$10 billion</span></span></a> into the bank in December that year. Four months later, UBS wrote down another <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/business/worldbusiness/02ubs.html?fta=y"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">US$19 billion</span></span></a>. <br><br>Matters for the bank worsened in November 2008 when one of its senior officials, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=az9oCSuVN_y4&amp;refer=home"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">Raoul Weil</span></span></a>, was indicted in the US for conspiring to help 20,000 wealthy Americans evade taxes amounting to an estimated US$20 billion. He was declared a fugitive by the US Government and has since stepped down from his post at the bank. The latest news is that the Swiss bank has posted a total loss of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/02/10/ubs.jobs.losses/index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">US$17 billion</span></span></a> for 2008.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despite what had happened at UBS, Mr Lee was still feeling bullish with our money and made another investment of US$6.9 billion in January 2008, this time in Citigroup. Within months, the US banking giant collapsed and had to be rescued with a bailout of more than US$300 billion from the US Government.<br></span></strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But Citi's executives, as financially and morally bankrupt as they were, still found enough chutzpah to take receipt of an exclusive luxury jet worth US$45 million.</strong></span> They only reversed course after warnings emanated from the US Government about their profligacy. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">These are the kinds of people with whom MM Lee had entrusted our savings.<br></span></span></strong><br><strong>Not to be outdone, Temasek announced in July 2007 that it had invested </strong><a href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/media_centre_news_releases_230707.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;"><strong>$4.5 billion</strong></span></span></a><strong> in Barclays Bank. That same year the bank announced a US$2.7 billion write-down.</strong></p>

Madam Ho Ching gradually increased Temasek's stake in Merrill until it reached <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/27/business/temasek.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">US$5 billion</span></span></a> in 2008. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The company, owned by the Ministry of Finance, said that it was buying in to Merrill because of its "great franchise, which has existed through many crises through a long period of time.”<br></span></strong><br>In September 2008, the American company went bust and had to be taken over by Bank of America.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Temasek gave another reason for the investment: It "had great confidence in [Merrill's CEO] </span></strong><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/27/business/temasek.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">John Thain</span></strong></span></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">.”</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Four months after BoA's takeover Mr Thain was forced to step down.</span></strong></span> The reason? <span style="color: #800080;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He had not fully disclosed all of Merrill Lynch's losses.</span></strong></span> Even in the firm's dying months, Mr Thain had spent <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/28793892"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">US$1.2 million</span></span></a> of company money to renovate his office – including US$87,000 for a rug, US$25,000 for a table, US$87,000 for guest chairs, US$35,000 for a commode and US$1,400 for a wastebasket. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Madam Ho must have a rather liberal definition of "great confidence". It obviously doesn't include due diligence.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">As a result of these escapades, it was revealed that Temasek is estimated to have lost 40 percent, or an equivalent of $74 billion, of its portfolio due to exposure to the finance industry</span></span></strong>. Madam Ho announced last week that she was stepping down -- with no regrets -- as its chief executive. <br><br>In the meantime, <a href="http://singaporedemocrat.org/articleSWF1.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam</span></span></a> stuck his neck out and assured everyone that Temasek and the GIC had "assessed the proposals rigorously" before jumping in to make the investments, a statement he'll probably live to regret making.<br><br>I wonder if these rigorous assessments included looking at how both banks invested their funds. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The latest </span></span></strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/madoffclientlist020409.pdf"><span style="color: #8b7f65;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">revelation</span></span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> is that Citi, UBS, Merrill and Barclays had all invested in the Bernie Madoff scam.

They are going to lose money."<br><br>Investing in the banks was, of course, part of Mr Lee's mega scheme to build Singapore up as a financial centre. Another part of the plan was to attract as many financial professionals to the country as possible: "We have drawn in many professionals, especially in financial services, which has expanded to its highest ever levels. Many financial institutions have moved their top people and their regional headquarters to Singapore to manage the wealth that is flowing from the Gulf oil states, the US, EU and Japan."<br><br>Translation: We have become a tax haven. And as the super-rich do their utmost to evade taxes by moving their monies to our shores, taxmen from the US and EU will follow their trail. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is providing a haven for tax cheats and turning a blind eye to tax crimes this Government's idea of sound economic strategy?</span></strong> <strong>What happens when the US and EU starts putting the squeeze on us? Are we really maximising our opportunities or merely masquerading our objectives?</strong></p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Did you hear that boom?<br><br></strong>“These initiatives have sparked off a boom in building around the Marina and Sentosa.” The MM was of course referring to the F1 Grand Prix that was held in Singapore last year and the controversial IR casinos that are being built.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/Sands-SheldonAdelson.jpg" border="0" alt="LV Sands - Sheildon Adelson"></p>
              <p> Las Vegas Sands - Sheldon Adelson - going bankrupt suddenly get US$2Billion loan</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only boom we heard was the one in Las Vegas when the Sands Corporation imploded financially in 2008. Sands, headed by Mr Sheldon Adelson, was contracted to develop the Marina project. If Sands had gone bankrupt, Singapore's Marina would have been left in the lurch. <strong><span style="color: #800080;">The Singapore authorities quickly got in touch with Mr Adelson and, shortly thereafter, the gaming mogul miraculously raised $2 billion -- in a year gripped by financial crisis.<br></span></strong><br>Analysts expect construction of Marina Sands to top <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KA15Ae01.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">US$6 billion</span></span></a> (initially budgeted at $3.85 billion). In contrast Sands Macao casino cost $265 million to build and recouped its costs in less than a year. But that was in the boom years in 2004. Experts estimate that Marina Sands will have to earn more than US$1 billion a year just to remain viable. And this has to occur in the midst of a protracted period of an economic bust. Was this what Mr Lee meant by “maximising our opportunities”?<br><br>What about the F1 Grand Prix? <strong>The Government pumped in about </strong><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,189678,00.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;"><strong>$100 million</strong></span></span></a><strong> to host the event in the hope that it would produce a kickback through increased tourism and sales. <span style="color: #800080;">The result was that retail sales for September 2008 – the month that the race was held – dropped by 0.8 percent.</span></strong> The Singapore Retailers Association's executive director Lau Chuen Wei said: <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>'This is evidence that F1 did not bring with it the increase in business for the retail sector.”</strong></span><br><br><strong>The uplift<br><br></strong><span style="color: #800080;">Mr Lee also enthused in 2007 that “The whole Asian region is getting a lift-up. Singapore is at the junction between the two giants, China and India. We are well placed to benefit...”</span></p>
              <p>Let's see,<strong><span style="color: #800080;"> China is seeing its growth plummet to heart-stopping lows</span></strong>, companies are closing down by the thousands and, in the process, workers are being laid off in the millions -- 20 at last count. The Beijing government is seriously nervous about widespread social unrest.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #800080;">India's economic expansion has come to a screeching halt</span></strong>. The country is reeling from double-digit inflation, foreign investment is drying up, the rupee is falling, and the stock market was down by as much as 40% last year.<br><br>These two countries desperately need fresh flows of capital and investments, without which businesses cannot continue to stay afloat, let alone service their debts. Collectively, China's companies have about US$2.4 trillion in debt repayments to consider.<br><br>And where are the funds going to come from? According to the MM, “There is high liquidity in the money supply of the US, EU and oil-producing countries. This accounts for the large in-flow of foreign money that has benefited the regional stock exchanges.” <strong>He could not have been more wrong.</strong> <span style="color: #800080;">The following year the </span><a href="http://www.upi.com/Emerging_Threats/2009/02/02/Walkers_World_Chinas_debts_mount_up/UPI-49811233590891/2/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;"><span style="color: #800080;">Institute of International Finance</span></span></span></a><span style="color: #800080;"> reported that the net capital flows from industrialised countries to emerging economies would trickle to a low of US$160 billion – plunging from the US$840 billion in 2007</span>.<br><br><strong>En bloc blocked<br></strong><br>Over the last few years, a frenzy took over the property market. Seemingly rational people vandalised cars and property because they couldn't get their fellow homeowners to sign the collective agreements to sell their estates to developers who were willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the en bloc purchases. Neighbour took neighbour to court and disputes erupted all over.<br><br>This prompted Mr Lee to comment in 2007 that "Demand for high end office and residential accommodation has increased. Many home owners who sold their condos in en bloc sales have received windfall gains. Some of them in turn are buying upper end HDB executive and 5-room flats, pushing up their values."<br><br>The bubble was dramatically inflated but everyone was too busy enbloc-ing to notice it. Then came 2008. The fourth quarter of last year saw property prices drop by a margin that was the <a href="http://www.propertywire.com/news/asia/fall-singapore-property-prices-200901032336.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">biggest in a decade</span></span></a>. More than 10,000 houses and apartments had to be sold under a deferred mortgage plan where buyers were allowed to postpone their loan payments until the properties were completed.</p>
              <p>The frenzied rush to sell the condominiums vanished. Owners hoping to attract enbloc buyers had to reduce sale prices by as much as <a href="http://www.hot-property.sg/enbloc-sale-with-a-40-discount/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">40 percent</span></span></a> in some cases. Developers who had hoped to re-develop their acquisitions are now stuck with their purchases because there is no demand for new homes. A senior manager at the ERA, a realty company, said: "These holding costs are tremendous, because projects like these, some of them are worth a few hundred million to maybe close to a billion dollars. So they would just have to perhaps rent them out to collect as much as they can in terms of rental." Some of the rental are going for as low as <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20090131/tap-088-en-bloc-units-rented-half-price-231650b.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">50 percent</span></span></a> of the usual rate.<br><br>"There was a big surge in demand for offices 10 or 11 months ago," explained CapitaLand <a href="/CapitaLand%20Chief%20Executive%20Liew%20Mun%20Leong"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8b7f65;">Chief Executive Liew Mun Leong</span></span></a>, "but it suddenly stops and falls off a cliff." <br><br><strong>No regrets<br></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now that the predictions that Mr Lee made in 2007 have gone up in smoke -- and together with it many billions of dollars -- what does the MM do? <br></span></strong><br><span style="color: #800080;">First, roll out the Vintage Lee Act:</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Wag the finger at Singaporeans.</strong></span> "So this generation may believe that Singapore and Singaporeans will automatically go up the escalator every year. This is not so," Mr Lee told his audience at a Lunar New Year dinner last week. He forgot that he was the one who gushed that the golden period could go on for years.<br><br><span style="color: #800080;">Second, </span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>lay the blame on others:</strong></span> "People and systems tend to be carried away by exuberance. Investors get greedy and rush in to buy, believing that prices will only go up. When prices collapse, investors find they have lost huge sums." Of course, these are other people and other investors. Not him and his ministers who just got caught up in the system because "it is in the nature of the free markets of the western world that our economy is plugged into." <br><br>In 2007, it was he and his "competent and experienced team of ministers" who adopted "domestic policies to encourage growth." In 2009, it is the banks who "have lost confidence in themselves, in their fellow banks and other financial institutions, and even in their customers."<br><br><span style="color: #800080;">Third,</span> <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">pretend that there is no poverty in the country</span></strong>. "But nobody will be destitute, depending on soup kitchens or begging in the streets. Everyone has a home..." Mr Lee said to his audience, who were either too polite or too subservient to tell him to take a drive outside the Istana to HDB void decks. <br><br><span style="color: #800080;">Fourth</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>play the you-don't-know-how-lucky-you-are gambit</strong></span>. "My generation of Singaporeans will never forget the 1960s and early ‘70s..." he started off and then waxed nostalgic about <em>Konfrontasi</em> and shanty huts. It's another way of telling Singaporeans how good his party is. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">In fact Mr Lee talked about everything regarding the present crisis<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">except his role and the role of his ministers in the debacle</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No mistakes were admitted, no errors conceded</span>.</strong> If he had any tinge of regret about that "golden period" remark, he showed no sign of it.<br></span><br>In an age where accountability has become the touchstone of good government, the PAP continues to march remorselessly forward.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Ho Ching, the wife of prime minister <a class=" lingo_link" style="display: inline; font-weight: 400; cursor: pointer; color: blue; border-bottom: 1px dotted; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?Itemid=34&amp;id=240&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view">Lee Hsien Loong,</a> is departing from stewardship of Temasek Holdings in good time for her successor to have to be the one in charge when the disastrous performance for 2008 and 2009 comes around.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>Such are the circumstances that the Singapore leadership has decided that it is best that a foreigner replace her – not that Temasek's earlier recruitment of Wall Street whiz-kids has done it much good. This time former BHP Billiton boss Chip Goodyear just might shift Temasek's attention away from disastrous forays into finance towards the natural resources which are so abundant in Southeast Asia but so conspicuously lacking from its Temasek's portfolio.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">BHP is in good shape compared with the other major mining companies such as <a class=" lingo_link" style="display: inline; font-weight: 400; cursor: pointer; color: blue; border-bottom: 1px dotted; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?Itemid=31&amp;id=637&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view">Rio Tinto</a> and Xstrata. But do not be deceived by this into thinking that Goodyear is the cautious, far-sighted manager needed by a sovereign wealth fund such as Temasek. BHP owes its relatively strong position largely to luck.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>Goodyear, a Wharton-bred former investment banker, made his reputation through an array of acquisitions in a rising metals market. He stepped down as chief executive in September 2007, but remained with the company and close to his successor Marius Kloppers when BHP launched a typical top-of-the-market US$66 billion bid for rival miner Rio Tinto, itself then trying to digest its own acquisition spree, notably aluminum giant Alcan. Only Rio's determination to resist the takeover saved BHP from the potential disaster of such a costly acquisition and Goodyear being classified with the Wall Street crowd whose hubris and arrogance has become the biggest ever bonfire of the vanities.</p>
              <p>Ho Ching proved the classic bull market player with Singapore's public funds. At first she could claim success in raising returns by more active management of Temasek's investment portfolio – and in rising markets always report profits generated by disposals as well as by the operating profits of its major assets, the Singapore property, banking, power, telecoms, aviation and shipping companies.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But under her leadership, and spurred by foreign advice, a larger and larger proportion of assets were invested in the financial sector. By March 2008 this had climbed to no less than 40 percent of Temasek's portfolio. Nor was that enough. It continued to believe in Wall Street's self-delusions that first half 2008 just saw a few "localized difficulties" rather than the richly deserved meltdown that occurred, increasing its stakes in <a class=" lingo_link" style="display: inline; font-weight: 400; cursor: pointer; color: blue; border-bottom: 1px dotted; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=985&amp;Itemid=32">Merrill Lynch,</a> Barclays and others, and putting most of its China investments into banking.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>Even as late as the end ofAugust, a managing director, Marish Kejriwal, was being quoted as saying "The financial services industry is one we believe in… It is a proxy to the economic growth" – an extraordinary statement and one which showed that Temasek had learned nothing from the Asian crisis of a decade ago, or from Japanese financial troubles, or indeed the mid-1980s banking failure in Hong Kong and Malaysia etc. To make matters even worse, Kejriwal also noted "We recently concentrated on US and UK primarily because we see value."</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Temasek's overall performance is hard to assess. Although more transparent than most sovereign wealth funds, it still falls far short of what a public company would have to report. The performance of its major listed subsidiaries is easy enough to track but there is a lot that does not appear, including methods of valuation of some huge, leveraged investments made in private equity funds.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>Injections of capital from the <a class=" lingo_link" style="display: inline; font-weight: 400; cursor: pointer; color: blue; border-bottom: 1px dotted; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1113&amp;I">Ministry of Finance</a> are also a key to its expansion. For example, <strong>last financial year its portfolio value rose by 13 percent to S$185 billion but much of this was apparently accounted for by an official injection. Nor are there any details on dividends, if any, paid to the MoF.</strong></p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Indeed, not only are the accounts skimpy and largely lacking in the notes normally found but anyone wishing to track the latest Annual Review against past ones will be unable to do so via the Temasek Holdings website, which now has only the latest Review (2007-08) not the previous ones.</strong></p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>What can be deduced, however is that reported profits last year, which zoomed 50 percent to S$20 billion on revenue of just S$83 billion, owed much to disposals, including Tuas Power for S$4.2 billion. The rundown in Singapore assets has been marked. They are now only 33 percent of the total compared with 38 percent a year earlier. This trend is presented as a necessary and valuable diversification, but it also helps maintain profits as the Singapore disposals are mostly of assets acquired years ago and thus can generate big <a class=" lingo_link" style="display: inline; font-weight: 400; cursor: pointer; color: blue; border-bottom: 1px dotted; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=32&amp;cid=0&amp;ei=ARryRafNCZH4rQOJ4YGcCg">capital gains.</a></p>
              <p>Apart from the trend to non-Singapore assets, there have been two other trends. One is towards non-Asian OECD markets such as US and UK, and the other to unlisted and so-called "liquidity" investments. <strong>These mostly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">opaque investments</span> now <span style="text-decoration: underline;">account for 52% of total assets</span> helping to further obscure the details.</strong></p>
              <p>The latest Review also has a none-too-subtle Ho Ching boast. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assets acquired in the previous six years are credited in one chart with annual growth in value of 32 percent, or double the 16 percent by assets held prior to 2003</span>. It is not hard to imagine that the numbers for 2009 will look rather different – assuming they are published. Nor was the 10-year annual Total Shareholder Return as published particularly impressive – 9 percent since the dark days of the Asian crisis.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But whatever the performance, the skimpy nature of Temasek's published data makes independent analysis very difficult – even assuming that the major brokers, rating agencies and <a class=" lingo_link" style="display: inline; font-weight: 400; cursor: pointer; color: blue; border-bottom: 1px dotted; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=874&amp;Itemid=151">investment banks</a> would ever be willing to incur official wrath by attempting to do so.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>As for Goodyear, even with the help of a big capital profit on the December sale of PowerSeraya to Malaysia's YTL for S$3.8 billion, his first Annual Review as Ho Ching's successor will need some remarkable accounting contortions if it is not to look grim indeed.</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.norway.org/policy/gpf/norwegian+pension+fund+global.htm">‘TRANSPARENCY and TRUST: Keys to the Norwegian Pension Fund’. </a></p>
              <div class="article">
              <p class="articleIngress">Transparency and trust are driving forces behind the management of Norway’s revenues from oil and gas production. As sovereign wealth funds (investment funds owned by governments) receive increased scrutiny by regulators, the Norwegian Pension Fund – Global may become a model for other sovereign wealth funds.</p>
              <p><span class="date">1/24/2008 ::</span> Norway, one of the world’s largest petroleum exporters, has invested its oil wealth in a fund with a current market value of more than $350 billion. This makes it Europe’s largest, lagging behind only that of the United Arab Emirates among SWFs.</p>
              <p>Morgan Stanley projects that sovereign wealth funds could grow from their current total of $2.5 trillion to $12 trillion within a decade. A concern in the United States and Western Europe is that secretive management under government ownership may raise national security concerns, distort markets by pursuing strategic objectives (not financial) and threathen financial stability.</p>
              <p>“There is a serious likelihood of Western governments and funds clashing over what they can buy and where,” chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank in London, Gerard Lyons, recently told the International Herald Tribune.</p>
              <p>Will the emergence of sovereign wealth funds really increase the volatility of markets? The opposite may be the case. Because of a long-term investment horizon for SWFs, the funds will not be forced by capital requirements or investor withdrawals to liquidate positions rapidly. “They won’t get ‘cold feet’ in down-times when other investors scramble to sell, but rather stay in it for the long haul and contribute to stabilizing the market,” said Lars Fjell Hansson, Counselor for Economic and Financial Affairs at the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C.</p>
              <p><strong>“There is a strong case for sovereign wealth funds to adopt the best practice of open funds like Norway,” Gerard Lyons in Standard Chartered Bank emphasized.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What makes the Norwegian fund different from several other sovereign wealth funds is the amount of information it makes public about its strategy and investments</span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Its <em>performance and risk exposure are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reported quarterly</span></em> and its holdings in about 3,500 companies are <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">detailed annually</span></em>; in most cases, its investment in any company amounts to less than one percent of available shares.</span></p>
              <p>The fund does not seek to control companies through buy-outs. In fact, by its own rules the fund <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">restricts its ownership in any company it invests in to five percent of shares</span></em></span>.</p>
              <p>The investment objectives are purely financial in nature, <em><span style="color: #800080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">safeguarding assets for the long term</span></span></em>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Norwegian fund is an instrument for ensuring that a reasonable portion of the country’s petroleum wealth benefits future generations</span>. This is regarded as an ethical obligation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">returns from the fund</span> will be spent in the annual national budgets</span>.</p>
              <p>The fiscal rule says that four percent of the fund may be spent, which is estimated to be the real return of the fund over time. <span style="color: #800080;">This strategy of controlled spending will also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>keep inflation in Norway down</em></span></span>.</p>
              <p><strong>The second ethical obligation is to respect fundamental human rights</strong>. The fund is taking a stand against serious violations of human rights, such as child labor, gross corruption, and severe environmental degradation. The fund divests itself of shares in companies which produces certain weapons, for example, cluster-munitions. Norway has called for a complete ban on such weapons. The ethical guidelines were adopted by the Norwegian Parliament in 2004.</p>
              <p>At a hearing in the United States Senate on November 14, 2007, experts testified on the growth of sovereign wealth funds and on maintaining a balance between attracting foreign investments to the United States while managing potential security issues. Edwin Truman, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, presented a scoreboard ranking sovereign wealth funds according to benchmarks on structure, governance and transparency &amp; accountability and behavior.</p>
              <p><strong>The Norwegian Pension Fund - Global scored 23 out of 25 possible points</strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This placed the fund second among the 32 countries on the index, one point below New Zealand's Superannuation Fund</span>.</p>
              <p>“The U.S. government should continue to actively encourage foreign governments with large cross-border investments to develop and follow a set of best practices with respect to managing those investments in their interests, in our interests, and in the interests of the stability and openness of the international financial system. Our scoreboard provides a starting point for the development of such a set of best practices for sovereign wealth funds,” Truman said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Placing third was Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund, followed by Canada’s fund and the Alaska Permanent Fund</span>. “Timor placing this high seems like an anomaly, given that most developing countries placed in the lower part of the index,” Embassy Counselor Hansson said. “But it is probably because as part of its development assistance to Timor, Norway assisted in setting up the structure of the Timor Petroleum Fund. This shows that the guiding principles of the Norwegian model are solid,” he said.</p>
              <p><br><strong>Facts about The Norwegian Pension Fund – Global</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has the overall responsibility of the Government Pension Fund. The operational management of the Government Pension Fund – Global is delegated to Norges Bank (the Norwegian central bank). </li>
              <li>Key objectives in the management of the Norwegian Pension Fund – Global includes a high degree of transparency in all aspects of its purpose and operation, the fund’s role as a financial investor with non-strategic<br>holdings, an explicit aim to maximize financial returns, and clear lines of responsibility between political authorities and the operational management. </li>
              <li>The fund returned 7.9 percent last year and has averaged 6.5 percent a year over the past decade.

              <p>If the New Zealand Superannuation Fund is in first position, and the Norwegian Pension Fund in second with a score of 23 out of 25 for sovereign funds achieving best practices, and Timor Leste Petroleum Fund being Third, followed by Canada's Fund and Alaska Permanent Fund making the top five - where does Singapore GIC and Temasek Holding stand ?</p>
              <p>Considering that Timor Leste - being a new nation with such a short history - can reach Third in rank in best practices of its sovereign fund, should Singaporeans not raise serious concern to the way that the Singapore's GIC and Temasek Holdings are being managed ?</p>

              <p><br>When will the economy pick up ?</p>
              <p>Given the time frame - what would have been the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">opportunity cost</span></em> for that loss $100 Billion done elsewhere ?</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government has been more generous doling out funds to rescue failed Western financial institutions than rescuing Singapore Companies that failed in the 1987 and 1997 economic downturns.</p>
              <p>The lost amount of $100 Billion would have done so much more for the welfare of Singaporeans - which LKY and his PAP has declined even to consider even during the most bleak periods of 1987, 1997 and 2004 in Singapore's economic downturn.</p>
              <p>Can the Government hoped to regain any parts of their investments if ever these companies are shut-down or re-sold by their present Owners or Managers ?</p>
