              <p>just asking... does any opposition member in singapore predict the present fiancial crisis 2 years ago ? If george bush and the incredible american banks themselves doesn't see such a scenario and prevent it, I do not see who can predict such a disaster. I also see a lot of fiancial legends buying shares now and they r burned as well. Nobody knows wat the future is like </p>
              <p>Fact is, there r always doom days predictor writing books on global warming, world running out of crude oil or bird flu killing the whole population etc. However how far should the government go in preventing the above scenario ?</p>
              <p>However I agree tat the gov deserves to be blamed for losing so much money. Someone's head should roll.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle">Did CapitaLand just adopt SDP's proposal? </span></strong></p>
              <p>It was reported today that
              Government-linked company CapitaLand will pay its managers with
              shopping voucers. If this sounds familiar, it's because the Singapore
              Democrats recently proposed in our alternative budget that Singaporeans
              be given spending vouchers. 
              Even before the budget debate began in
              February, the SDP had made a 5-point alternative plan that would help
              Singaporeans in the recession as well as to stimulate the economy.
              Among these is dispensing vouchers to households especially to the
              lower-income ones.<strong> </strong>(See <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1845-budget-spending-not-transparent-sdp-proposes-alternative-5-point-plan-">here</a>) Even a PAP MP raised the idea during the Parliamentary session. <br><br>So
              the next time the ruling party and its supporters say that the SDP is
              not a constructive opposition, just tell them that if CapitaLand and
              PAP MPs can adopt this and other of our proposals (see <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1875-pm-and-pap-mps-adopt-sdps-economic-ideas">here</a>), maybe its time the PAP starts acknowledging the truth about the Singapore Democrats...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Go vote for SDP in next elections.</p>

              <p>i support angel's view. If singapore government is so bad, then those who are unhappy can move to other countries.</p>
              <p>GIC is paid to make investments, otherwise why are they in GIC in the first place. Given the economic climate, any stocks or bonds u buy sure kena big time. But the key is how to minimize the losses now and achieve higher return in the future. Do we have the holding power and the answer is a definite yes!</p>
              <p>If our government is sucking our $$$, then andrew and ah pok can consider moving to australia. The tax rate there is around 40-50%.</p>
              <p>Continue complaining and whining if u must. For whatever, u do in this forum (scold, insult, curse, whatsoever), u will still live in pathetic misery. </p>

              <p>Work for a better tommorrow? The public do not have much say on how the country is run, how to "work for better tommorow". Its not even within our means. Unless you count planting flowers or trees to improve the enviroment as one way to move forward. And why should i just ignore the failings of the current govt when they are fecking paid big bucks, more than the international average for politicians. I want heads to roll! damn it!</p>
              <p>Giving money is a sign for good goverment?  do tell me how much that money can change the standard of living for most of us? for one is too buy something new or extra money for the month, for another it means eating an extra dish for each meal for a month or so. Even that it depends whether it is hawker, food court or restaurant meal. Like that transsexual faggot Vivian have said boldly.</p>
