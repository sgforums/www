              <p>Shafi'ie charged for standing up for Singapore</p>
              </div>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br>He may not be locked in combat in Iraq but he is arguably the most courageous soldier in Singapore today. <br><br>Recruit Muhammad Shafi'ie, the youngest among the <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em> (TBT) activists, faces two trials in as many weeks: one for protesting
              against escalating cost of living in front of the Parliament House on
              15 March this year and the other for contempt of court.<br></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The 19-year old Singapore Polytechnic
              engineering graduate is currently a National Serviceman in the army at
              the Pulau Tekong Camp undergoing his Basic Military Training (BMT).<br> <br>Mr
              Shafi'ie is now into his seventh of his 13-week BMT. He commutes
              between camp and the Subordinate Courts to join his fellow activists in
              the on-going trial.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>"Everyday, I leave Pulau Tekong at seven in
              the morning by ferry to reach the jetty at Changi from where I head
              straight to the court to face the trial," he said.</span><br> <br>Regarding
              the TBT protest, Mr Shafi'ie said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"In the year 2007, the GST was
              increased to 7% from the previous 5%. Following that, the public
              transport fees, tertiary education fees, the ERP, to name a few, were
              also increased. At around the same period of time, the highly paid
              ministers had another round of pay rise.</span><br><br>"It does not make sense
              that the government is taxing the population more and claiming that it
              is actually helping the citizens, by giving back a fraction of what is
              taken from us in the form of 'offset packages'. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where is our money
              actually going to?</span><br><br>"What I did on 15 March with 17 of my friends was to tell the government - <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em>!" <br><br>What
              about his parents? They are, of course, worried about his involvement
              in political activism. In fact, his father was rather disappointed when
              Mr Shafi'ie pleaded not guilty to the current charges brought against
              him. Father probably wanted to get the matter over with so that his son
              could get out of actiivist work.<br><br>Asked why he was not pleading
              guilty and what he thought of the trial, the NSman said:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "I don't think
              what we did on 15 March can be called a crime. We hurt no one and
              neither did we create any disorder. What we did was to express our
              concerns as citizens on issues that affect us deeply.<br><br>"In fact
              the Constitution states that citizens have the right to free speech,
              assembly and expression. These are basic rights, not privileges. So I
              don't understand why we are being charged for exercising our rights as
              citizens.</span>" <br></p>
              <div class="img_caption left" style="float: left; width: 225px;"><img class="caption" title="Shafi'ie with Jufrie Mahmood " src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/TBTtrial/shafiie_jufri.jpg" border="1" alt="Shafi'ie with Jufrie Mahmood " width="225" align="left">

              </div>
              <p>Through
              his steadfastness, Mr Shafi'ie is slowly changing his parents' minds.
              His mother attends the TBT trial in the subordinate court every day.<br><br>To the mild-mannered NSman, Mr Jufrie Mahmood, seasoned opposition figure and fellow <em>Tak Boleh Tahaner</em>, has this to say:<br><br>"I
              hope that in the future, this land will be a more conducive and
              compassionate place for all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But before that can happen, we must
              correct the wrongdoings that are happening now. It is a responsibility,
              to ourselves and to the people around us.</span><br> <br> "It is truly
              heartening to have a young man like you coming to the fore. I am sure
              there are many more like you out there waiting to be enlisted. You have
              started the ball rolling. Keep it going and keep up your spirits!<br><br>"It's
              a long, long haul indeed. But remember, a journey of a thousand miles
              begins with the first step. The first few steps have been taken. If
              older members like myself don't make it to the end, we feel assured
              that youngsters like you will be there to continue on the journey. With
              true grit, we shall achieve, maybe sooner rather than later.<br><br>"As for myself, I will continue playing a supporting role and giving my two cents worth.<br><br>"We
              must persevere and have faith in what we are doing. To bring about
              change under the present political environment, we just cannot afford
              to follow the ineffective old formula year in and year out.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><br>"Though
              we are much maligned now by the establishment and the local media, the
              day will come when we will be exonerated. The truth will inevitably
              emerge."</span></strong><br><br>Mr Shafi'ie will face another trial together with Mr
              John Tan and Mr Isrizal next week in the High Court over contempt of
              court charges from 4-6 Nov 08. The three were charged with wearing
              T-shirts bearing a picture of a kangaroo in a judge's gown.</p>

              <p>Dear whiskers, stupid doesn't mean that he can't study. It is true for the converse. Getting a doctorate doesn't mean that you aren't stupid. I am sure you have come across people who have good grades and academic qualifications but are downright stupid in other areas like social skills.</p>
