              <p>they're not doing it at all, whoever is at the top of the command chain is wasting SDP's resources and showing themselves inept in political circles.</p>
              <p>look at how they can convince people to do stupid things in public, what if the same resources are turned into convincing more people to their cause insteading of reducing their numbers though lawsuits and jail??</p>
              <p>Find an issue people care about, organise a talk on it, inform people on it instead of turning it into another "SPD GST/TBT protest 2008"</p>
              <p>there's also the MLM model</p>
              <p>so many ways to do it but some nutcase at the top can't think.</p>

              <p>Well, have you gone to a PAP member forum or a Youth PAP forum before?</p>
              <p>You haven't, clearly.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you one thing, young Singaporeans are no longer the naive bunch of yesteryears. They have their own thinking and their own beliefs.</p>
              <p>All it takes is a spark by the right person for them to right the direction of their thinking.</p>
              <p>I have no problem with the platform of the incumbent (note it's referring to the ruling party). I just have a problem how the current members have deviated from their manifestos.</p>

              <p>all ideas are simple at the moment they come about, all complicated ideas can be explained in one line. its the situations faced that makes ideas branch out in other ways.</p>
              <p>if someone were to actually get inside and garner enough support and strike at a moment of weakness, who's to say it wouldn't work? what you're thinking is influencing LKY and friends in SDP's way, what if you're talking about someone who is very supportive of SDP but decides to join PAP and become one of them? and along the way showing strong support for PAP and after drawing enough PAP guys to his/her side splits the party against the current leadership?</p>

              <p>a descendent of a royal house designated to be the heir of a dictator. not a very good example but it shows it is possible to be carried out. got other examples from ancient times but won't fit into current context. this one the closest i can think off.</p>
              <p>anyway singaporeans have a habbit of looking up to the rich, given a rich or a poor man to carry out a task most likely will support the rich one. rich one also have enough money to carry out political campaigns.</p>

              <p>Agree agree.</p>
              <p>One point CSJ fails to realise that (and that's why I call him stupid) is that Singaporeans are fundamentally pragmatic. Mass protests that will only cause disruption are a definite no-no for them.</p>
              <p>Doesn't it fail to strike Mr PAP and Mr PKYAP that the SDP was more popular under Chiam See Tong than under CSJ?</p>
