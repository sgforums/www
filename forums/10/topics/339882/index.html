              <p>As a non-singaporean, i too find it amusing how Singaporeans react in everyday life situations. Sometimes it's good to laugh at but sometimes it's not. I notice that whenever I am on an mrt talking to a mate, people stare at me probably because the aussie accent I have.</p>
              <p>But one thing I have noticed that some singaporeans hate being "Singaporeans". Actually you should be proud of where your from, just because other people make a bad name for your country, it doesn't mean you gotta hate your country or your parents.</p>
              <p>From what you said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"if i, a singaporean is laughing at my fellow countrymates . i wonder how the foreigners would think and how would they spread the reputation of singapore in their homeland."</span>  Well I guess foreigners have already spread the rumours about singapore that it is a decent place to stay in, good working environment, good money and others. Most of the feedback you get from foreigners is good, so why worry about singapore's reputation?</p>

              <p>as a non-singaporean, i find it very amusing how there are some

              other pple' and 'singaporeans who do bad things and disgrace the

              <p>shit happens in every country. just because you have not seen it
              does not mean it doesn't happen.</p>
              <p>and visitors generally have a good impression of singapore. stop
              fucking worrying about what 'outsiders' think. if you're not happy,
              do something. don't fucking whine.</p>
              <p>the one thing people complain/love the most is the weather. too
              bad you guys can't do anything about this one. and the stupid
