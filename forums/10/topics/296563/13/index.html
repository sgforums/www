Whether what they have done deserves credit, that's your call - it just isn't as far as I'm concerned. As a matter of fact, that's precisely why we are having a discourse, isn't it?<br><br>Now, as you mention from the examples cited above, hindsight is clearly a double-edge sword. While it's easy to challenge my perspective on it being easy to criticise a decision with the benefit of hindsight, it isn't all that hard to reassess your argument that UBS isn't as badly hit by the subprime crisis too is a benefit of hindsight, isn't it?<br><br>If you're going to leverage on the benefit of hindsight to go back 2 years to see if GIC would have gotten the same stake in UBS for the same sum of money, why not look 2 weeks ahead after GIC bought a stake in UBS which would have yielded even better returns for the same capital?<br><br>Right or wrong, it's your call and ultimately, with or without hindsight, we're just coming from different sides of the coin. It too is your call if you think I've erred in my judgment, but I stand by what I said in view of the coordinated actions taken jointly by the Central Banks controlling 3 of the major currencies on the globe.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teraexa:</div><div class="quote_body">Sometimes let's face it, we should not oppose for the sake of opposing.

              <p>i read some where that UBS share holders support the proposal in 2 third majority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike the Eastern Aviation which the voting has been affected by a lot of political and physical factors,like share holders find difficult to vote.</p>

              <p>For UBS</p>
              <p>Currently the share price is 33.86 Swiss francs</p>
              <p>minimum of conversion price is 51.48 Swiss francs.</p>
              <p>This implies if the share of UBS share is 10 Swiss francs, GIC must still convert at 51.48 Swiss francs.</p>
              <p>Its an opening for loss if the sub prime problem persists.</p>
              <p>Critics probably have to wait 2 years before they can blast GIC.Nevertheless the conversion price is not good.</p>
              <p> PS: Warren buffet did say he declined to buy the banks because he feels the subprime problem is not over yet.</p>
              <p>        Jim Rogers says he knows people at GIC and thinks they are not very smart. Should only buy when they hit the bottom</p>

              <p>You seem to be lacking alot of stuff in between your ears.</p>
              <p>UBS shareholders make decisions for their OWN benefits.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that there is a goal alignment between PAP and UBS for the ultimate benefits for Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>You mean if you are a UBS shareholder based in say Switzerland, you will be concerned about whether Singaporeans have made positive returns by investing in UBS?</p>
              <p>So if UBS Board of Directors deems that share issues for the benefit of UBS shareholders, at the expense of Singapore's investment funds. The UBS Board is making decisions benefitting the Singapore government (ultimately the citizens)?</p>
