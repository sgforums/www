My point is that the same piece of news was covered by all major newspapers and news channels, hence the general sense of gloom that had negatively affected UBS share prices...<br><br>Its not like the common man will throw his money into a bank that just lost $10 billion if all he's got is $10k. The risks are too high for him and he won't have resources to hold for long term.<br><br>Institutional investors however, don't have that constraint. What is 5 years to GIC? Or even 10 for that matter, if UBS is still nicely profitable and paying nice dividends consistent with GIC's expectations of a decent ROI.</div>
