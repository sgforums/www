            <div class='col-md body'>Been to so many interviews and frankly speaking I'm very frustrated liao. Nowadays I don't really know what the employers are looking for.

You fit just nice, they settle for the degree holder. What the hell!<br><br>What they want? Worse still they like to nitpick your resume and stuff and expect you to know how to do them like a professional. After army you expect guys can remember how much. Some of them more power still. Can say things like. What you been doing for the 2.5 years after school! Or better yet tell you things are different from the army! Of course I know that. Hell. You think I happy to waste 2.5 years in the army to come to society and get this kind of treatment. To make matter worse, most HR dept seems to be occupied by ladies who don't and can't take NS into consideration.<br><br>Any diploma guys and below out there just ORD and facing all this shit?</div>

Your army experience can always help out in job application - I helped one of my friends to draft his resume . In the army , you have picked up the skills of interpersonal communication ( you have to talk to your platoon what) ,  the endurance to withstand any pressure ( like jungle training) , critical thinking ( decision making if you are an officer) , conflict management ( i.e. happens when ur platoon people want to give someone a blanket party and you soothed them down) etc. My friend himself have sent out more than 10 resumes and got only 1 interview from one employer.  So job market is not that good. You have to bear that in mind.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At least you have been to so many interview, what about those who sent out thousands of applications but not 1 replied to him/her?<br><br>Also, I feel that instead of venting your frustrations here or anywhere else, why not put this energy into researching how you can further enhance your ability to handle an interview, like what fymk has suggested?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I understand what you mean fymk. I am not really trying to pick on the HR ladies. Its just that I find them pretty cold and unsympathetic.

And I don't even want to go into the foreigners part.Pray tell me fymk. Where can I get any kind of work experience if I'm not given any chance to learn in the first place. I know about the point about making use of army experience. Believe me, I've tried. Their "comments" were usually irrevelant.<br><br>The worse thing I feel is that diploma holders seem to be caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. Most of our jobs in the old days are taken up by degree holders and if we considered a "lowly job" we are sometimes too over qualified for it.

Yes.<br><br>If not for the fact that I intend to pursue further studies to get a degree over here, I think I would have left Singapore for greener pastures like one of my friend currently in China.

Cold, unforgiving etc.<br><br>I dunno really........ When I initially ORD from NS, I thought like wow! Now I can look forward to the rest of my life. Apparently theres not much to look forward to here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Maybe what my friend said does have a ring of truth to it now.
