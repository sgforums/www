Hence the essence of the party interest come in, to ensure competition and all ideas are centre around the party core vision.<br><br>Good governance, integrity and accountability are in a nutshell important aspect brought around by the 'election' effect or the essence of a democratic system and in no way, should it be removed. However, I am against using opposition as solely a rule of the thumb to form the 'check' party, not unless opposition is a credential one with reputable members.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>I think even PAP leader dare not to say to place party interest above nation interest.What is party interest?It is for selfish interest.<br><br>If a govt want to win the support of the majority of the MPs,it should be voluntarily and not by force.Mind u,can u imagine the govt can't win support of its own MPs and has to  force them to vote for its polcies?</div>
