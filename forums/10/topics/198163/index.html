            <div class='col-md body'>To the threadstarter:<br><br>Having elections is part of good governance. It keeps the people up there on their toes knowing that the people can simply go against them if they don't like their policies.<br><br>I don't understand your point - no point having elections if the ruling party is going to resort to low-brow tactics like gerrymandering and using upgrading as bargaining chips? If that's the case, then I say there's no point having money, either. We've seen too many people stealing it, cheating people of it and even killing over it. So why should we have money?<br><br>If anything, the actions of the ruling party have truly put off people this time. They can call it a strong mandate for all they want, but the fact that they lost one-third of the vote shows that people won't stand for this sort of thing. Perhaps the actions of that one-third didn't unseat the ruling party, but I say that every vote against them is a call for them to wake up their bloody ideas.<br><br>And that is what democracy is all about. To make sure that the government does things for the greater good of Singapore, and not for the greater good of PAP.<br></div>

I answered, yes, it can help ensure that the government will be more honest and receptive to the people's wishes, knowing that the people can vote it out if they wished to do so.<br><br>Yet what do you do? You twisted my words instead, taking it to mean that I agree with your assertion that the people can't ensure good governance. Were my words really so ambiguous that they could be interpreted differently?<br><br>And for goodness' sake... my name's Fudgester. With your laughably puerile standard of English ('govenrnace'? 'oppoition'?), your already-oversimplistic arguments come across as more of a laughing stock than something to ponder about.<br><br>I don't often get this pissed, but I do when some jerk presses my tension buttons.<br><br>Congratulations, sunshine... you just pressed those buttons.

I don't. I only see the ruling party making its own decisions unilaterally without the support of the people. For your information, there has only been one referendum in Singapore's history - and that was back in 1959 to decide whether to join Malaysia or to go independent. If we're not using referendums now, what makes you think that the government will use it if there are no elections to keep them in check in the first place?<br><br>'You think' is an opinion, not an argument. Come up with solid points to substantiate your opinion, or it becomes a hypothetical joke to be laughed at.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It will has to be a utopia world if leaders placed nation interest before party interest because in reality, this concept/model is not going to work. Say if 84 MPs individually represent no party, then there will be a trouble of having 84 diversive views in a parliament. Hence the essence of the party interest come in, to ensure competition and all ideas are centre around the party core vision.<br><br>Good governance, integrity and accountability are in a nutshell important aspect brought around by the 'election' effect or the essence of a democratic system and in no way, should it be removed. However, I am against using opposition as solely a rule of the thumb to form the 'check' party, not unless opposition is a credential one with reputable members.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
