              <h1>Singapore to launch tougher public order law</h1>
              <p>By Nopporn Wong-Anan</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore, which already has tough
              restrictions on freedom of assembly</strong></span>, plans to tighten them further
              ahead of a major Asia-Pacific summit in the city-state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Public Order Bill, introduced in parliament on Monday before the
              Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November, was needed
              to "squarely address gaps in the current framework to enhance the
              ability of the police to ensure security during major events," the
              Ministry of Home Affairs said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under the proposed law, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>police could prevent activists from leaving
              home if they knew they were going to a political rally. It would also
              allow police to order a person to leave an area if they determine he is
              about to break the law.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All outdoor activities that are cause-related will need a police
              permit, no matter how many people are involved. </strong></span>That is a change from
              the current law requiring a permit for gatherings of five or more
              people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Opposition politicians and activists were quick to criticize the
              proposed law. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Even in communist China, peaceful protests are
              tolerated," said Chee Siok Chin of the opposition Singapore Democratic
              Party.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The bill allows police to stop people from filming law enforcement
              if it could put officers in danger.</strong></span> The bill cited live media coverage
              of Indian police trying to rescue hostages in the Mumbai attacks last
              November as posing risks to the officers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Police could stop small peaceful protests against unpopular visiting
              government leaders</strong></span>, such as from Myanmar, if the law was introduced,
              activists said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last week, three Singaporeans tried to present a bouquet of orchids
              to visiting Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein for him to give to
              detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung Sann Suu Kyi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thein Sein was having an orchid named after him at the Botanical
              Gardens, a Singapore tradition for visiting heads of government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The law is certain to pass, since the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has an overwhelming majority in parliament.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It also passed an amended law on Monday to ease a decade-long ban on
              political party documentary-like films, but introduced restrictions on
              dramatized political videos.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"These two sets of amendments should be viewed as part of the
              longstanding periodic adjustments the PAP has made<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> to limit politics to
              tightly controlled electoral contests conducted in the absence of a
              meaningful civil society," said Garry Rodan of Murdoch University in
              Western Australia.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Others said the two laws were pre-emptive measures for the
              government to prevent a repeat at the APEC meeting of confrontation
              between police and protesters that took place during the World Bank/IMF
              meeting in 2006, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and also to deal with potential social unrest during
              Singapore's worst-ever recession.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"As long as the government feels a threat, it needs greater measures
              to deal with greater problems,"</strong></span> said Terence Chong at the Institute of
              Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.</p>

              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained.</p>
              <p>They were driven by ideology. Today’s generation has no culture <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and averse to taking political risk. Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future. </strong></span></p>
              <p>But I cannot blame the present generations, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.</strong></span><br><br>So the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> result is that we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. </strong></span></p>
              <p>They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>less independent-thinking and lack in initiative.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained.</p>
              <p>But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that makes society.”</strong></span></p>

              <h1>Singapore to launch tougher public order law</h1>
              <p>By Nopporn Wong-Anan</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore, which already has
              tough restrictions on freedom of assembly</strong></span>, plans to
              tighten them further ahead of a major Asia-Pacific summit in the
              city-state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Public Order Bill, introduced in parliament on Monday before
              the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November,
              was needed to "squarely address gaps in the current framework to
              enhance the ability of the police to ensure security during major
              events," the Ministry of Home Affairs said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under the proposed law, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>police could prevent
              activists from leaving home if they knew they were going to a
              political rally. It would also allow police to order a person to
              leave an area if they determine he is about to break the
              law.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All outdoor
              activities that are cause-related will need a police permit, no
              matter how many people are involved.</strong></span> That is a
              change from the current law requiring a permit for gatherings of
              five or more people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Opposition politicians and activists were quick to criticize the
              proposed law. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Even in communist China,
              peaceful protests are tolerated," said Chee Siok Chin of the
              opposition Singapore Democratic Party.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The bill
              allows police to stop people from filming law enforcement if it
              could put officers in danger.</strong></span> The bill cited live
              media coverage of Indian police trying to rescue hostages in the
              Mumbai attacks last November as posing risks to the officers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Police could
              stop small peaceful protests against unpopular visiting government
              leaders</strong></span>, such as from Myanmar, if the law was
              introduced, activists said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last week, three Singaporeans tried to present a bouquet of
              orchids to visiting Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein for him to
              give to detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung Sann Suu Kyi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thein Sein was having an orchid named after him at the Botanical
              Gardens, a Singapore tradition for visiting heads of
              government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The law is
              certain to pass, since the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has
              an overwhelming majority in parliament.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It also passed an amended law on Monday to ease a decade-long
              ban on political party documentary-like films, but introduced
              restrictions on dramatized political videos.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"These two sets of amendments should be viewed as part of the
              longstanding periodic adjustments the PAP has made <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to limit politics to tightly
              controlled electoral contests conducted in the absence of a
              meaningful civil society," said Garry Rodan of Murdoch University
              in Western Australia.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Others said the two laws were pre-emptive measures for the
              government to prevent a repeat at the APEC meeting of confrontation
              between police and protesters that took place during the World
              Bank/IMF meeting in 2006, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and also to deal with
              potential social unrest during Singapore's worst-ever
              recession.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"As long as
              the government feels a threat, it needs greater measures to deal
              with greater problems,"</strong></span> said Terence Chong at the
              Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Thein Sein was having an orchid named after him at the Botanical
              Gardens, a Singapore tradition for visiting heads of
              government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The law is
              certain to pass, since the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has
              an overwhelming majority in parliament.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It also passed an amended law on Monday to ease a decade-long
              ban on political party documentary-like films, but introduced
              restrictions on dramatized political videos.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"These two sets of amendments should be viewed as part of the
              longstanding periodic adjustments the PAP has made <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to limit politics to tightly
              controlled electoral contests conducted in the absence of a
              meaningful civil society," said Garry Rodan of Murdoch University
              in Western Australia.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Others said the two laws were pre-emptive measures for the
              government to prevent a repeat at the APEC meeting of confrontation
              between police and protesters that took place during the World
              Bank/IMF meeting in 2006, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and also to deal with
              potential social unrest during Singapore's worst-ever
              recession.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"As long as
              the government feels a threat, it needs greater measures to deal
              with greater problems,"</strong></span> said Terence Chong at the
              Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.</p>

              Our gahmen seems to be getting more and more paranoid as seen from its more and more repressive laws. This is one of the results from being in power for too long; it just too afraid to lose the control.

              <p><br> <em>Our gahmen seems to be getting more and more paranoid as seen from

              <p>The PAP regime is quite obsessed with power and control.</p>
              <p>In our ASEAN region, they are one of the more repressive regimes.</p>
              <p>They want to control every aspect of Singapore life.</p>
              <p>I think one reason could be due to the minority status of the old dog.</p>
              <p>He is of minority hakka/baba group, but Singapore majority is hokkien group.</p>
              <p>He feels insecure ruling this hokkien group as they won't truely follow him, an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>The only way to control this group in the dog's mind is through repression and mass propaganda.</p>
              <p>That is probably one of the factors why the dog destroyed the chinese schools and imposed ang moh on hokkiens.</p>
              <p>He wants to weaken the dialect groups as he feels that they are a threat to him.</p>
              <p>Turn all the hokkiens to become anglo dogs like him, weaken their culture, so that they will more easily follow him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A bit like the policy of <span style="font-family: Arial;">Russification:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Russification was the name given to a
              policy of <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/alexander_iii.htm"> Alexander III</a>. Russification was designed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>take the sting out of
              those who wanted to reform <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/russian_revolution.htm"> Russia</a> and to bind all the Russian people around one
              person – the tsar.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Russification was first formulated in
              1770 by Uvarov. He defined three areas of Russification – autocracy, orthodoxy
              and ‘Russian-ness’. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Of the three, Russian-ness was the most important.
              Before Alexander III, Russification meant that all the tsar’s subjects,
              whatever their nationality, should be accepted by the tsar as being ethnic
              groups in their own right provided that they acknowledged their allegiance to
              the Russian state, which included the government and the church</strong></span>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Under Alexander III, Russification took
              a new turn. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He believed that all cultures and nationalities within the empire
              should be wiped out (though not physically) and that all the people within the
              empire should become ‘Great Russians’. Russification had no time for small
              ethnic groups that were more concerned about their culture at the expense of
              Russia’s as a whole. To be loyal to Russia and therefore the tsar, you had to
              be a Russian first rather than, for example, a Kazak or Cossack.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/russification.htm">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/russification.htm</a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Turn all the hokkiens, teochews, hainan, cantonese etc, westernise them, make them study ang moh in school, destroy their dialect culture, turn them into anglo dogs.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">All cultural morale become weak, so easy to control, won't rebel, go follow anglo dog regime.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">One flaw in this plan is that by weakening and destroying local culture, the local identity becomes very weak, no roots, so the migration rate will increase.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If so, it would appear that the dog's way of solving this problem is to import more foreigners which leads to more destruction of local culture, so the cycle continues.</p>
