              <p>Oh please! YOU DELUDED FOOL! Who the hell do you think you are? With due respects to the others reading, I will attempt to keep my bile down - citizens will always be encouraged to participate, but only responsible citizens, even if they hold differing views. But in the case of you Blockhead, no sane responsible organisation would ever invite you for constructive engagement, if your irresponsible and ridiculous accusations on your postings here is anything to judge by!</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahahaha - the Great Mentor Shepherd will be surprised that his 'dearHunter' have the ability to produce bile with only 1% inspiration to get into any condition even to produce 99% perspiration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not typical of a liar - claiming not to be from the Ruling Party, and will shamelessly forget the claim by parroting their Master's lines with such emotional accuracy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you now repeating and extending the OB Markers in the same way as the Ruling Elites - by allowing those citizens to participate in the political process on condition that they are obedient to the Master's Voice ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You have certainly shown yourself to be a hopelessly dejected failure with each response that you attempt with your pathetic 1% inspiration; and your 99% perspiration has done nothing more to your image as a failed 'dearHunter' as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You will perhaps be more successful as a 'dearHunter' in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe - as he certainly need persons who cannot work smart with only 1% inspiration, and will need all the 99% perspiration to get anything done.</span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahahaha - Great Mentor Shepherd will be happy to believe that his faithful lackey will believe in 'freedom of speech' and has the "ability to exercise his rights" - when the same rights are not extended to Singaporeans OUTSIDE of the Speakers' Corner. Only the vanity of a juvenile 'dearHunter' will believe that he is entertaining a very wide audience in this Speaker's Corner.</span></p>

              <p>There is a difference between freedom of speech and freedom to slander. There is no issue with criticising the govt, at times due to ignorances or naivety. The issue is when one slanders against the govt without any evidence or fact, such as you and your kind loves to do.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The dearHunter's brilliance with 99% perspiration in creating 'Freedom to Slander' theory should be making educational history, which unfortunately will remain limited in scope with his 1% inspiration to go beyond his minimalist understanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can a wilfull juvenile fed on regurgitated food, know what is good for himself, when his wilfull nature prevents him from even accepting what his parents know is good ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can a 'dearHunter' be innocent of ignoring clear facts, or should his large audience find him guilty of ignoring clear evidences, and wilfully misinterpreting facts to delude everyone and himself ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How much of the 99% perspiration did the juvenile 'dearHunter' take before finding some clue about civilisation on Earth ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is only in a unique Singapore Civilisation that Singaporeans have learnt from the Ruling Elite in perpetuating lies till it turn into truth, twisting a new understanding that taxes are to accepted as subsidies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the 50 years of Singapore style of 'civilised politics' - the ultimate lessons that Singaporeans can learn from the Ruling Elite is their unique lessons in how to slander Singaporeans who dare to challenge the Politics of the Ruling Party - by slandering with genuine authority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is the unique First World Civilisation of Singapore - as seen by a 'dearHunter' with a 1% inspiration to depend on 99% perspiration to be contented in living in a $27 garbage bin that he proudly will call it a civilised home.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">yes, i know that the price of gas may be link to the price of crude, but is it justifiable to explain for price hike in power quoting price of crude?  it is an attempt to deceive the consumers</span>.</p>
              <p> There is no deception, simply because we don't have gas as a natural resource. ( the hot air from Atobe don't count!)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore do not have gas ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely alot already has been coming from the 99% perspiration from 'dearHunter' - even if the contracts signed with Malaysia's Petronas and Indonesia's Pertamina is not delivering ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Way back when several developed countries' national electrical grid systems used oil as a fuel for electrical generations, their hardware were configured to have the ability to switch to natural gas to generate electricity.</p>
              <p>This was so due to the seasonal demand of electricity. During cool springs and summer, there was not much demand for electricity, but during winter, the demand peaked to keep people warm. As such, electrical companies switched to gas, a cheaper alternative than fuel back then, to keep costs down.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How "<em>way back</em>" do you think your 1% inspired mind can cope - to start thinking the likely earliest date that co-gen power exist that allow their oil fired generators "<em>to switch to natural gas to generate electricity</em>" ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But then, most of gas producers were also oil producers, and they are not stupid (unlike Atobe). They pegged gas to oil prices and consumers have to bear the costs.</p>
              <p>And when easy extraction surface oil was claimed to be diminishing and its price shot thru the roof, so did gas prices followed. The world could do nothing and just paid up.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the 99% perspiration of a 'dearHunter' gained some knowledge about global pricing of crude oil and gas ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it due to 1% inspiration to search the World Wide Web to know the relationship of global pricing between crude oil and gas; or was it based on 99% perspiration that got you to make presumptious assumptions that the prices of oil and gas are fixed by producers ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perhaps you could educate yourself by reading <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ftproot/features/reloilgaspri.pdf">“The Relationship Between Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices”.  <span style="color: #0000ff;">that was prepared by someone with 99% inspiration and 1% perspiration to prepare this remarkable report that punctured all your presumptious 'gas-back' assumptions.</span></a></span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Similarly, in Singapore, our supply comes from Indonesia, and the price we get for natural gas is pegged to oil. The indonesians are the ones getting rich, not our govt or treasury. We have no choice but to accept, and take it as one more source of energy than to have total reliance on the volatile middle east for oil, which supplies may be cut if wars break out there.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a Ruling Party lackey will want the ordinary Singaporean to believe that natural gas price is pegged to global price for crude oil - with the sole objective of justifying increases for electricity rates based on the false excuse that crude oil prices have hit the roof. Read the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ftproot/features/reloilgaspri.pdf">“given referenced piece”  <span style="color: #0000ff;">before you burst more of your hot gas when giving your juvenile reply.</span></a></span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>As for me, on a personal basis, i would prefer not to have any dealings with these chinese women rapists indonesians. I have no business dealings with them and even if i were to be given a ten foot pole to sign deals with them, i would rather tell them to take a hike.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is obvious that an impotent 'dearHunter' - unable even to lay his "<em>cleaner for a wife</em>" - will spite all Indonesians as "<em>chinese women rapists</em>". </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you manage any business with a 1% inspiration, or even make any business to succeed with 99% of your perspiration ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Try not to be too cocky with the Indons, as your Great Mentor Shepherd has some great buddies over there - who may not take too kindly with the juvenile remarks of his most vocal carpet-beggar, and they may simply leave our hard-earned monies in jeopardy for the greedy investment decisions made.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I don't mince my words, but unfortunately, our govt cannot talk the way i do, and have to engage in diplomatic lingo so as not to offend them, for the sake of our People. So for those of you who complain that our govt is not doing enough, do understand their constraints in having to do the diplomatic tango with Indonesia and Malaysia, not that they want to, but they have to for the sake of peace and stabiltiy for our country and People.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It will take a 'dearHunter' alot more then 99% perspiration to get his teeth to mince words that are nothing more then 'hot gas' that came up from the rear end.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can anyone compete the very unique ways of a 1% inspired 'dearHunter' talking style - least of all a government that has 99% of his missing inspiration ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who writes with such patronising language, you certainly know how to trip the government's diplomatic tango with Indonesia and Malaysia with your foul thoughts about our neighbor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It clearly shows that you are cut from the same piece of white cloth with your "<em>fork tongue</em>" in your juvenile ways of twisting lies into truths - as so well learnt from your Great Mentor Shepherd and his Elite Flock.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are you so desparate to shore up your bag of natural gas arguments ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Can you show where are the twisted words, lies and half-truths - that you repeatedly claimed but have yet to show which point in my replies are twisted words, lies, and half truths ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1. Your claim that natural gas and crude oil price is fixed by producers</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you had simply read the Introduction part of my reference piece - </span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ftproot/features/reloilgaspri.pdf"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The Relationship Between Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices”.  -</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">it would have saved you the agony of being embarrassed again</span>.</span></a></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Just 'googling' for answers does not an intellectual makes you. You may have found a paper on it, but did you read it? Obviously you did not. If you had read that study closely, it would co-relate what i had explained in my post for simpler understanding for others here.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Back to the rubbish bin for you, you who in an earlier post, can claim natural gas is cheaper than oil!.</strong></span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This clearly show that you have based your arguments without thinking, and clearly intend only to make your usual "grand performance" to talk down to others with your hollow patronising ways.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was there any closeness between your statement that "<span style="color: #000000;"><em>most of gas producers were also oil producers, and they are not stupid (unlike Atobe). They pegged gas to oil prices and consumers have to bear the costs</em></span> " - and the referenced piece that clearly state that the price of natural gas and crude has taken divergent paths ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even another thread had shown your statement to be false when it was shown that the <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/321682">“International Banking cartel driving up oil prices ”.  </a></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you intend to be clever with your bag of hot gas patronising views ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are most welcom to keep your generosity with your Made-in-North Korea $27 garbage bins - it will help you when your "<em>cleaner for a wife</em>" will have more to do and keep out of your juvenile verbal philandering ways.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Your claim that "Tax" is "Subsidy"</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If anyone is guilty of twisting any words, it would have been the every readily crude 'dearHunter' - allowing his skin to be used as a carpet for the Great Mentor Shepherd to wipe his shoes on.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">How are you to cleverly justify with any sound reasons - your patronising statement that "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>taxes</strong></span></em>" that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>take money</strong></span> from Singaporeans, are "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>subsidies</strong></span>" which are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>money given</strong></span> to partially remove some of the costs charged to citizens ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Your understanding of politics is pathetic, let alone economics.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Whose money is the govt 'giving' and 'taking'.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Dumbnuts! Oh please spare me the agony of having you an idiot on my hands!</strong></span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For a 'dearHunter' with a 1% inspiration mind, we should certain defer to your inspired vision clouded by your 99% perspiration in understanding your highly esteemed politics that only you can bastardised with such expertise from your Great Mentor Shepherd.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are we looking at the money now ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you appreciate the overall impact to the economy and the fair distribution of costs to the different levels of society ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can a 'dearHunter' with only 1% inspiration to even succeed in achieving 99% perspiration, let alone to have any potency to do anything to anyone whom he sees with his supreme performance in his unique level of idiocy ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">3. Freedom to slander</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Only in the annals of a 'dearHunter' will this "<strong>freedom to slander</strong>" exist - as it is evident that his Great Mentor Shepherd is such a skillful practitioner in this <strong>''voodoo art of  slander with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impunity</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immunity</span>"</strong> that is frequently directed at his political challengers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It seems that "Freedom to Slander" do not exist in any civilisation in History, except for the civilisation created by the Great Mentor Shepherd and defended by his lackeys and carpet-beggars as personified in the undiscerning 'dearHunter' - with his 1% inspired mind that will be energised into 99% perspiration by the Great Mentor Shepherd.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Of course you wouldnt know what is Freedom to slander and cannot find it any civilisation, because you are an animal, a beast and an outcaste who will accuse anyone of anything even if the human is innocent.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you claimng that the Great Mentor Shepherd to be similarly "<em>an animal, a beast, and an outcasts who will accuse anyone of anything even if the human is innocent</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He has exercised his wilfull "Freedom to slander" with impunity and immunity by incarcerating Singaporeans such as Chia Thye Poh for 32 years without any evidence ? He had similarly done the same with the members of the Catholic Church who were social activists and whom he accused without evidence that they were members of an underground communist cell working within the church. He had similarly maligned James Gomez - with impunity on a simple issue of a piece of paper in Election 2006. He has similarly slandered JBJ - calling him a charlatan - when his own son PM LHL will recognise JBJ to be a true Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You surely have a Great Mentor to learn from as he Shepherd you daily into his pen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The 'hunter' in a juvenile 'dearHunter' has now become the 'hunted'.</span></p>
