              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>When does a tax becomes a subsidy?</p>
              <p>Ans. When that tax had been around long enough to be depended as
              revenue to fund social programmes. If without these tax monies,
              some social programmes may be curtailed or underfunded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example:- there are est.500,000 cars in Spore. Straits
              Times, sat, oct 20, 2007</p>
              <p>Avg km/car per year = 20,000km ( 15,000 to 25,000)</p>
              <p>litres used         =
              1,666litres ( base of avg 12km/litre)</p>
              <p>Fuel tax received = 1,666 X $0.40cts X 500,000 cars (40cts
              per litre)</p>
              <p>                        =
              $333.2 million</p>
              <p>These are only rough figures, would be lesser if based on
              previous years car population.</p>
              <p>But still, it is an est $300million tax which is not going into
              some politician's pocket, but for social funding, such as
              maintenance of smooth roads, MRT works and projects, traffic
              lights, road signs, etc, etc, for the other 3million non-car owner
              citizens who use such roads to go to work, school and
              recreation.</p>
              <p>If we cut away this tax, we will have lost one
              revenue for such works and will have to dig into our reserves.
              Thus it becomes our society must subsidize car owners, as they are
              the heaviest users of our roads ( being that a space 5m long sits
              only 1 person compared to public transport of 8-10 persons on
              the same space).</p>
              <p>Similarly, GST can be called a subsidy instead of
              tax, because our cents paid to gst are used to
              subsidise other citizens for social programmes.</p>
              <p>Do remember that we own no natural resources. We don't
              have any royalties significant enough to collect from. All we
              have to help our fellow citizens for this generation and the
              next are taxes, as the previous generation had done.</p>
              <p>Such taxes are not crippling, as it is based on free will and
              not forced. But if all cry out for tax to be removed and give more
              handouts, then Either we crawl back to Msia for economic support
              and speak Bahasa Msia or we help one another to maintain our
              independence and multi-racism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: However, the issue here is that cutting away the tax or
              subsidy will only help oil price to raise. Simple economics.
              Although the amount we use is small as compared to heavy
              users such as China or USA, but if every nation big or small
              thinks their amounts are insignificant and don't do
              anything, oil price will continue to climb where no oil
              price had gone before! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>repost from another thread by me.</p>
              <p>PS: Anyone who wishes to argue that tax is not a subsidy or
              subsidy is not tax, you are free to challenge me and let me
              convince your stubborn thick confused head. And if anyone else wish
              to argue that what i had presented was petrol tax, what about
              electrical tarrifs? Read my following post - another repost.</p>

              <p>Simple economics would say that petrol is a good with an inelastic demand, and this is especially so in the short run.</p>
              <p>And thus for inelastic goods, cutting taxes or increasing subsidies or increasing/decreasing prices or vice versa, would not result in much change in quantity demanded. However, a small change in quantity demanded would however result in a more than proportional change in price. People will still have to travel somehow.</p>
              <p>That aside, we all know that the main reason for oil prices is speculations. It's a great wakeup call to governments to divert resources into alternative energy sources.</p>

              <p>Well, first thing is it helps people taking public transport (often the poorer people) since they uses less fuel. The people with their cars pay more, people with cars with bigger cc pays more and people with sports car will be worst off. It encourage people to use public transport which uses less fuel.</p>
              <p>Industries uses a lot of fuel or the most fuel and they will pass it down to consumer who buys then. But in todays competitive market, they will also try to cut down on wastage and fuel as well and tis is a good sign. On the consumer side, u really have to pay for the increase price of goods. However u really uses tis good. It is better than me, not using tis good at all and subsidised your spending by giving fuel incentives.</p>

              <p>Look, I sincerly empathise with those who are hit hard by the energy crisis. Even if we were to take public transport, cut down the amount of cars and buses, or save electricity, the fact is, oil will still not drop, or drop to significant levels.</p>
              <p>Because oil is a commodity heavily used for industrialization. Factories, manufacturing, and shipments rely on it. The only real way oil will be go down is to STOP buying consumer goods altogether! But it would not be realistic, hell no, not even me would give up on my new hp or HDTV.</p>
              <p>We need alternative energy research. And rather than to bitch and moan and blame everyone else under the sun, lets think positively - sustainable approach.</p>
              <p>Oil prices will continue to rise as economies get more affluent and  demand for better manufactured consumer goods. Much of oil costs will be added to the costings and passed on to us. Thus, if we want a certain lifestyle, then we best be prepared to pay more for it, AT OUR  OWN EXPENSE AND NOT OUR FELLOW CITIZEN'S EXPENSE, thru the cries for subsidies and tax cuts.</p>

              <p>I am not threatening anyone but am commenting on a fact about your calling people slanderers and alleging all sorts of things against critics who are loyal citizens willing to spend time to ask for better governing of the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let this be my point of view and let it be heard by anyone you like. I will stand by what I said as well as posted in The PAP Poem in response to your calling me nutcase etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, in case you do not know, I have written to all the MPs and Ministers of my many posts and I expect you to convey my very critical posts to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have also written to youngpap and quite a number of MPs asking for invitation to take part in PAP internal policy debates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If PAP is so good and so open and accountable, why be afraid to invite me to do so?</p>

              <p>Exercise of the freedom of speech is just and good, however do temper it with excercise of freedom of expression. Differing views will exist, and the SDP/PAP/WP divide has become gapingly wide. Mudslinging is just...... wrong....</p>

              <p>You are so right - there are good points and bad points about PAP.</p>
              <p>I for one have acknowledged this it many times before. However apart from initial success for the past 20 plus years the whole governing system has been dominated by taxing, hoarding monies and profiteering.</p>
              <p>Look at HDB making double on lands falsely claiming subsidy of public housing. Look at vehicle taxes, how many times do you have to tax people for driving a vehicle and how many times do you have to increase fees and charges on basic  medicare, public transportation, utilities etc. which should have been funded out of taxes paid.</p>
              <p>Look at the families whose income is $1000 pm. After paying 60 % of income towards basic necessities how much is left for meals and necessities. What kind of government is this? Is this a caring governent still working in the interest of the people.</p>
