              <p>If you want the good life, be prepared to work hard for it. Protesting and bitching aint gonna help one bit, more so over issues we have no control, except to make all end up losing even more.</p>
              <p>Be realistic. We need to upgrade our skills, seek better paying jobs or cut back on exuberant spending or cut down on wastages. The crisis is worldwide.</p>

              <p>Look, I sincerly empathise with those who are hit hard by the energy crisis. Even if we were to take public transport, cut down the amount of cars and buses, or save electricity, the fact is, oil will still not drop, or drop to significant levels.</p>

              <p>Because oil is a commodity heavily used for industrialization. Factories, manufacturing, and shipments rely on it.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Global Economies have seen continuous cycles of progress and development since the end of WW-2, and it was during the 6-day Israeli War that saw the Arab oil producing countries forming a cartel to use oil as a bargaining chip to force Israel to withdraw from occupied land.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This move only cause a political backfire on the Arabs, when a surge in oil storage by major oil consuming nations resulted in a world glut - as had happened when Malaysia tried to control a global rubber cartel in the early 70s, only to be thwarted by US development in synthetic rubber and offered it as an alternative to natural rubber.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The price of crude oil has seen continous tussle between Middle-east oil exporters, who depend on the West as the consumer market, and at the same instance will need the West for its technologies and expertise to extract the Middle-eastern oil.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both sides need each other to progress, and the <strong>current crisis</strong> in uncontrolled crude oil prices <strong>is happening at a time when economic slow down</strong> is occurring across the globe, and has affected consumption as consumers tightened their belts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the FBI has been called by the US Government to investigate if the present oil pricing is a conspiracy to sabotage the global economies, or from sheer greed by speculators finding a niche area that has been left exposed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you intend to fit in your theory of oil prices increased due to increasing demands of consumer goods from affluent global economies ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were Singaporeans not asked to reach for the Swiss Standard of Living ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your claimed "inside knowledge" when not even a PAP member - are you privy to some knowledge that any Citizen has asked for the Government to pay for our oil ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not a fact that the petrol sold in Singapore do not have any subsidy from this Government - and that even as there is no subsidy to the petrol sold in Singapore, this Government has even dared to place taxes on each litre sold ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will it not result in the citizens who do not own cars also paying for the cost of "over-priced" Singapore petrol that a merchant will have to pay but will pass the cost of petrol to the consumer - who may or may not be a vehicle owner ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does this not result in a scenario in which Citizens who do not own vehicles will be required to pay for the tax of those other Citizen owning vehicles ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is time that the 'deerHunter' learn to accept reality and live within the means of his intellectual capacity, or he will be making every visitor to this SC - to pay for his selfish and vain desire to gain attention from his make-believe wide audience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not your selfish inability to give up the HDTV, which surely cannot meet the reality in living within your means in a $27 garbage bin ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely the stupendous abilities of a 'deerHunter' can be made out in the usual self- indulgently patronising views given in an amateurish effort at a juvenile Grand Standing Performance ?</span></p>

              <p>Seriously, stop complaining.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No matter what actions ANY government is doing, peak oil is a very real thing. (some idiots actually believed that peak oil is a myth...wake UP!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And furthermore, the human society in modern day depends on oil way too much. An increase in oil prices means the price of EVERY single good will increase. Increase in oil prices mean transportation cost will rise, food prices will rise as well, and every other thing will all rise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The cost of living WILL continue to increase as long as we are dependent on oil. And for people who own cars, stop complaining. People's obession with owning cars does more harm than good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not like there is no public transports...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every single people in the world from US to north korea will have to cut down their spendings on luxury, because the world can NO longer support such a huge amount of people enjoying themselves in luxury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If energy is subsidised, people are simply doing more harm to themselves than good. Right now, energy is a very precious resource...and the only way to restrict wastage is to ensure the cost goes up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People may not enjoy the cost of living going up, but this is a reality faced by everyone...the golden age of humanity have come to a pass in a sense...less people will be able to maintain the same lifestyle they currently enjoy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Change your lifestyle, it is not going to be easy, but it is necessary for a person to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What makes you think singaporeans should be different from any other country?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, if we want to get more energy, we can always build a nuclear power plant in singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good long term investment anyway.</p>

              <p>you want subsidy?</p>
              <p>before you ask that question, remember that money no grow on trees... so who? in your opinion should fund that subsidy?</p>
              <p>running down our reserves is not an answer... because if our reserves drop, the value of singapore dollar goes with it... and right behind such depreciation, mister INFLATION would be following closely behind.</p>

              <p>forget hyflux... with oil prices rising... and their standing contract to provide water to the govt at a fixed price... i would be worried if i hold any of their shares.</p>

              <p>NO economist i know would ever support subsidies.... argentina, once the richest nation on earth became wat it is today, because of "subsidies". singapore with no natural resources would end up worst then ethiopia if we follow your idea.</p>

              <p>if our govt increase the price of power based 100% on crude prices... your electricity bill would have went up by more then 500 percent already, given that the price of crude oil was only US$22 in 2002 (yesterday its at US$142!!!).</p>
              <p>but the govt's foresight to switch to LNG due to the oil production peak... we have been spared the full brunt of the rise in oil prices.</p>
              <p>unfortunately, the LNG peak production is only about 10 to 20 years after the oil peak production.... we need an alternative energy source quickly, or we will all suffer.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no deception, simply because we don't have gas as a natural resource. ( the hot air from Atobe don't count!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Way back when several developed countries' national electrical grid systems used oil as a fuel for electrical generations, their hardware were configured to have the ability to switch to natural gas to generate electricity.</p>
              <p>This was so due to the seasonal demand of electricity. During cool springs and summer, there was not much demand for electricity, but during winter, the demand peaked to keep people warm. As such, electrical companies switched to gas, a cheaper alternative than fuel back then, to keep costs down.</p>
              <p>But then, most of gas producers were also oil producers, and they are not stupid (unlike Atobe). They pegged gas to oil prices and consumers have to bear the costs.</p>
              <p>And when easy extraction surface oil was claimed to be diminishing and its price shot thru the roof, so did gas prices followed. The world could do nothing and just paid up.</p>
              <p>Similarly, in Singapore, our supply comes from Indonesia, and the price we get for natural gas is pegged to oil. The indonesians are the ones getting rich, not our govt or treasury. We have no choice but to accept, and take it as one more source of energy than to have total reliance on the volatile middle east for oil, which supplies may be cut if wars break out there.</p>
              <p>As for me, on a personal basis, i would prefer not to have any dealings with these chinese women rapists indonesians. I have no business dealings with them and even if i were to be given a ten foot pole to sign deals with them, i would rather tell them to take a hike.</p>
              <p>I don't mince my words, but unfortunately, our govt cannot talk the way i do, and have to engage in diplomatic lingo so as not to offend them, for the sake of our People. So for those of you who complain that our govt is not doing enough, do understand their constraints in having to do the diplomatic tango with Indonesia and Malaysia, not that they want to, but they have to for the sake of peace and stabiltiy for our country and People.</p>
