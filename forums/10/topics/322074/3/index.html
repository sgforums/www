              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This $500,000 will cover your primary school eduction, ( you could not have build the building , let alone a pedagog to teach you all subjects ), secondary, and tertiary education. The road that you walk on, the lights to shine your paths at night, the HDB that you lived in, ( which would had been private property price), the mrt and buses ( which you could never afford one by yourself and chauffered too), the bringing of foreign investments so that there will be jobs for you, the medical fees, the TV and radio entertainment, the cinema building halls, stadiums to watch football in, the NTUC fairprice foodstuff, help the old who do not know how to financially plan their retirement by offering interests on CPF savings, etc, etc.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you had been one of those talents who had contributed back to our society, just as all of us citizens had thru our taxes or suggestions to MPs, or such as the pragmatic solutions made by our PM Lee to ensure we all survive such times, I personally would have howl and weep and even drag your feet at the airport to prevent you leaving. But from all your postings, you had only spit at the govt, the representative of us ALL citizens, thereby spitting at us and our contributions even in these trying times. So get lost, i would not shed a tear, but a sigh of relief.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">$500,000 is darn cheap actually. You will be considered as got off lightly. Ciao!  </span></span></p>

              <p>Did ministers or LKY pay for these roads and infrastructures or the chairs in the office they sit on?</p>
              <p>Just be short and to the point?</p>
              <p>If government collects taxes and say they cannot subsidize provisions of basic government services like health care, public transportation or low-cost public housing and is bent on recovering full costs on such services what will happen to all the taxes or that portion of tax meant for such basic services then.</p>
              <p>Where will such hoarded monies go to? If you as a government do not want to use taxes to pay for basic services like these shouldn't you at least as a government collect lesser tax in view of lesser spending on the people's basic necessities.</p>
              <p>Yet an average family in the lower income group earning $800-$1,000 pm are being forced today to pay 60% of their income just for such basic services?</p>
              <p>Do you see the injustice caused by such taxing and non-stop hoarding of monies and profiteering by all the government ministries and statutory boards and GLCs using the same excuse as Durai in NKF.</p>
              <p>The worse is when you start increasing GST again and again despite such taxing and hoarding and profiteering with such lower income and even middle income earners having to pay more and more to support such a monstrous government without any one of the ministers or MPs speaking for them.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't annual off-budget surpluses made from land sale and the extraordinary surplus of $6.75 billions in the 2007 account be used to offset such hunger for more surpluses to bloat their own appetite for monies?</p>
              <p>And in case you forget an average family paid more than $500,000.00 in their 30-35 years working life towards housing tax, vehicle excise duty, COE, ERP, petrol tax, road tax, stamp duty,  etc etc not to mention income tax and GST.</p>
              <p>Just go and figure out the arithmatic for yourself. Don't be such a blockhead.</p>

              <p>you asked did LKY pay for the roads and infrastrucutres... may i ask you, do you know what is public GOODS? i doubt it... any economist would not have asked such a stupid question.</p>
              <p>next is the chairs in the office they sit on... may i ask... are those LKY personal property? if no... why should he pay for it?</p>
              <p>and going to the short and point... LKY also pays taxes like you and me, taxes which are used to fund the production of public goods and services.</p>

Since you accuse our govt, the mandated by a free vote administration to govern our country, of not subsidizing people's basic services, etc, etc and whatever crap, then as a citizen who will is no longer willing to shoulder you as a burden, please pay a nominal fee of $500,000 to our treasury and <strong>get lost.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This $500,000 will cover your primary school eduction, ( you could not have build the building , let alone a pedagog to teach you all subjects ), secondary, and tertiary education. The road that you walk on, the lights to shine your paths at night, the HDB that you lived in, ( which would had been private property price), the mrt and buses ( which you could never afford one by yourself and chauffered too), the bringing of foreign investments so that there will be jobs for you, the medical fees, the TV and radio entertainment, the cinema building halls, stadiums to watch football in, the NTUC fairprice foodstuff, help the old who do not know how to financially plan their retirement by offering interests on CPF savings, etc, etc.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you had been one of those talents who had contributed back to our society, just as all of us citizens had thru our taxes or suggestions to MPs, or such as the pragmatic solutions made by our PM Lee to ensure we all survive such times, I personally would have howl and weep and even drag your feet at the airport to prevent you leaving. But from all your postings, you had only spit at the govt, the representative of us ALL citizens, thereby spitting at us and our contributions even in these trying times. So get lost, i would not shed a tear, but a sigh of relief.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">$500,000 is darn cheap actually. You will be considered as got off lightly. Ciao!  </span></span></p>
