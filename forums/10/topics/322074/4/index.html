              <p>i know what you are trying to say. but sorry, u interpreted what i said earlier wrongly.</p>
              <p>my point is:</p>
              <p>since our powerplants are burning 100% CNG, which is half the price of crude, why is the SP quoting crude oil figures to justify its price hike? consumer are not dumb. I'm sure people understand what is gas and what is crude oil.</p>
              <p>why can't they simply justify their price hike with information telling us about the rise in price of gas?</p>
              <p>what they are doing is that to explain for the rise in price of chicken rice, they quote the figures for rising price of duck rice.</p>
              <p>yes, gas and oil are related, but their price are not pegged as u said. they are independent of each other, with their price set by market demand. and so far, gas is still in less demand than crude. (most cars on earth have not converted to CNG yet, as does all other vehicles, e.g. ships and planes.)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>When does a tax becomes a subsidy?</p>
              <p>Ans. When that tax had been around long enough to be depended as revenue to fund social programmes. If without these tax monies, some social programmes may be curtailed or underfunded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example:- there are est.500,000 cars in Spore. Straits Times, sat, oct 20, 2007</p>
              <p>Avg km/car per year = 20,000km ( 15,000 to 25,000)</p>
              <p>litres used         = 1,666litres ( base of avg 12km/litre)</p>
              <p>Fuel tax received = 1,666 X $0.40cts X 500,000 cars (40cts per litre)</p>
              <p>                        = $333.2 million</p>
              <p>These are only rough figures, would be lesser if based on previous years car population.</p>
              <p>But still, it is an est $300million tax which is not going into some politician's pocket, but for social funding, such as maintenance of smooth roads, MRT works and projects, traffic lights, road signs, etc, etc, for the other 3million non-car owner citizens who use such roads to go to work, school and recreation.</p>
              <p>If we cut away this tax, we will have lost one revenue for such works and will have to dig into our reserves. Thus it becomes our society must subsidize car owners, as they are the heaviest users of our roads ( being that a space 5m long sits only 1 person compared to public transport of 8-10 persons on the same space).</p>
              <p>Similarly, GST can be called a subsidy instead of tax, because our cents paid to gst are used to subsidise other citizens for social programmes.</p>
              <p>Do remember that we own no natural resources. We don't have any royalties significant enough to collect from. All we have to help our fellow citizens for this generation and the next are taxes, as the previous generation had done.</p>
              <p>Such taxes are not crippling, as it is based on free will and not forced. But if all cry out for tax to be removed and give more handouts, then Either we crawl back to Msia for economic support and speak Bahasa Msia or we help one another to maintain our independence and multi-racism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: However, the issue here is that cutting away the tax or subsidy will only help oil price to raise. Simple economics. Although the amount we use is small as compared to heavy users such as China or USA, but if every nation big or small thinks their amounts are insignificant and don't do anything, oil price will continue to climb where no oil price had gone before! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>repost from another thread by me.</p>
              <p>PS: Anyone who wishes to argue that tax is not a subsidy or subsidy is not tax, you are free to challenge me and let me convince your stubborn thick confused head. And if anyone else wish to argue that what i had presented was petrol tax, what about electrical tarrifs? Read my following post - another repost.</p>

              <p>There is no deception, simply because we don't have gas as a natural resource. ( the hot air from Atobe don't count!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Way back when several developed countries' national electrical grid systems used oil as a fuel for electrical generations, their hardware were configured to have the ability to switch to natural gas to generate electricity.</p>
              <p>This was so due to the seasonal demand of electricity. During cool springs and summer, there was not much demand for electricity, but during winter, the demand peaked to keep people warm. As such, electrical companies switched to gas, a cheaper alternative than fuel back then, to keep costs down.</p>
              <p>But then, most of gas producers were also oil producers, and they are not stupid (unlike Atobe). They pegged gas to oil prices and consumers have to bear the costs.</p>
              <p>And when easy extraction surface oil was claimed to be diminishing and its price shot thru the roof, so did gas prices followed. The world could do nothing and just paid up.</p>
              <p>Similarly, in Singapore, our supply comes from Indonesia, and the price we get for natural gas is pegged to oil. The indonesians are the ones getting rich, not our govt or treasury. We have no choice but to accept, and take it as one more source of energy than to have total reliance on the volatile middle east for oil, which supplies may be cut if wars break out there.</p>
              <p>As for me, on a personal basis, i would prefer not to have any dealings with these chinese women rapists indonesians. I have no business dealings with them and even if i were to be given a ten foot pole to sign deals with them, i would rather tell them to take a hike.</p>
              <p>I don't mince my words, but unfortunately, our govt cannot talk the way i do, and have to engage in diplomatic lingo so as not to offend them, for the sake of our People. So for those of you who complain that our govt is not doing enough, do understand their constraints in having to do the diplomatic tango with Indonesia and Malaysia, not that they want to, but they have to for the sake of peace and stabiltiy for our country and People.</p>

So if u ask me did singaporean suggest tat fuel be subsidised, the problem will be linked whether is the thread starter a singaporean or not in the first place.</span></span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">The previous debate in 2005 certainly proved that 'stupid-is-not-necessarily-smart.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The question - "Did Singaporeans asked for fuel subsidy ?" -  was not about whether the TS is a Singaporean.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">About removing tax from fuel, will it not become the same argument and scenario whereby gov give money to subsidised fuel ? If they do not tax fuel, they have to tax somewhere else. So is taxing fuel a good way of distributing wealth ?</span></span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tax is to take money from the people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Subsidy to from the government to help absorb part of the bill to the people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How in your brilliant "smart-stupidity" do you intend to convince anyone that without taking the money from the people - {i.e. no tax} - the government has subsidised fuel ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If they do not tax fuel, the government is already getting their surplus tax revenue on every big and small economic activities through an all enveloping 7% GST.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you confirm that the 7% GST is also levied on the fuel that car owners purchase in Singapore - which means that the 7% GST is applied onto a fuel sales price that has a Government fuel tax already in it ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you intend to distribute wealth, when the poor is also made to pay for the fuel taxes that a rich businessman pays - by passing it into the costs of the goods sold to the poor ?</span></p>
