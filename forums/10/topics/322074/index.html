              <p class="header"><strong>S'pore sets up two new institutes to boost water research and liveable cities</strong><br> <span class="update">By S.Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 24 June 2008 1615 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore is boosting its capabilities in water
              management and sustainable urban development. It will be setting up two
              expert bodies - the Institute of Water Policy, under the Lee Kuan Yew
              School of Public Policy, and the Centre for Liveable Cities.
              <br> <br>Opening the World Cities Summit and the International Water Week,
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said every city's goal of a good living
              environment and efficient use of resources cannot be achieved in
              isolation.
              <br> <br>There is no doubt countries place high importance on issues like
              water management, energy efficiency, air quality and urban planning.
              That's evident from the overwhelming response from delegates to the
              World Cities Summit and the International Water Week.
              <br> <br>PM Lee noted that urbanisation is happening at an unprecedented
              scale. So to ensure cities remain dynamic engines of growth, sound
              urban management policies are needed. And topping that list is energy
              conservation.
              <br> <br><strong>Mr Lee said: "To achieve results in energy efficiency and
              conservation, it is important to get the economics right. Energy,
              whether electricity or petrol, should be priced properly and not
              subsidised."
              <br></strong> <br>At the same time, Mr Lee noted that R&amp;D on clean energy
              technologies, including safe nuclear power, needs to be an important
              component of mankind's response to global warming.
              <br> <br>Another critical element of sustainable living is water management.
              The Prime Minister feels that, on the whole, the world is not short of
              water but what is lacking are sound water management practices.
              <br> <br>He said: "It is not enough to build the best water treatment
              plants, and then neglect to protect the water catchments from squatters
              or pollution. Ensuring a clean and reliable supply of potable water
              requires cities to take an integrated approach - from the reservoirs,
              catchment areas and water treatment plants, to the reticulation,
              sanitation and sewerage system. "
              <br> <br>In Singapore's case, the National Research Foundation has a S$500
              million programme to finance research in environmental and water
              technologies.
              <br> <br>Dr Tony Tan, Chairman, National Research Foundation, said: "These
              investments have yielded dramatic reductions in the cost of water from
              recycling of used water and desalination through the use of advanced
              membrane technology."
              <br> <br>As some of Singapore's solutions may be relevant to other emerging
              cities, the country's two new institutes on water policy and urban
              planning can play a role in collaborative research projects and
              information sharing. - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p>Thanks to western inventors, we are so lucky to have a chance to produce water at lower cost.</p>
              <p>I wonder how is hyflux involved in this. Will it be competing against hyflux or complement it being used by hyflux. I assume its is more cost effective than hyflux's?</p>

              <p class=""><strong>S'pore sets up two new institutes to boost
              water research and liveable cities</strong><br>
              <span class="">By S.Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia |</span> <span class="">Posted: 24 June 2008 1615 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore is boosting its capabilities in water
              management and sustainable urban development. It will be setting up
              two expert bodies - the Institute of Water Policy, under the Lee
              Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and the Centre for Liveable
              Cities.<br>
              <br>
              Opening the World Cities Summit and the International Water Week,
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said every city's goal of a good
              living environment and efficient use of resources cannot be
              achieved in isolation.<br>
              <br>
              There is no doubt countries place high importance on issues like
              water management, energy efficiency, air quality and urban
              planning. That's evident from the overwhelming response from
              delegates to the World Cities Summit and the International Water
              Week.<br>
              <br>
              PM Lee noted that urbanisation is happening at an unprecedented
              scale. So to ensure cities remain dynamic engines of growth, sound
              urban management policies are needed. And topping that list is
              energy conservation.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Mr Lee said: "To achieve results in energy efficiency and
              conservation, it is important to get the economics right. Energy,
              whether electricity or petrol, should be priced properly and not
              subsidised."<br></strong><br>
              At the same time, Mr Lee noted that R&amp;D on clean energy
              technologies, including safe nuclear power, needs to be an
              important component of mankind's response to global warming.<br>
              <br>
              Another critical element of sustainable living is water management.
              The Prime Minister feels that, on the whole, the world is not short
              of water but what is lacking are sound water management
              practices.<br>
              <br>
              He said: "It is not enough to build the best water treatment
              plants, and then neglect to protect the water catchments from
              squatters or pollution. Ensuring a clean and reliable supply of
              potable water requires cities to take an integrated approach - from
              the reservoirs, catchment areas and water treatment plants, to the
              reticulation, sanitation and sewerage system. "<br>
              <br>
              In Singapore's case, the National Research Foundation has a S$500
              million programme to finance research in environmental and water
              technologies.<br>
              <br>
              Dr Tony Tan, Chairman, National Research Foundation, said: "These
              investments have yielded dramatic reductions in the cost of water
              from recycling of used water and desalination through the use of
              advanced membrane technology."<br>
              <br>
              As some of Singapore's solutions may be relevant to other emerging
              cities, the country's two new institutes on water policy and urban
              planning can play a role in collaborative research projects and
              information sharing. - CNA/vm</span></p>

              <p><br>oh ya, you are right, I was wrong to say that they make water from air.</p>
              <p>I think there is such a device in the market but Hyflux basically does desalination of sea water using membrane technology.</p>
              <p>Thus, I think the new lower-cost technology could be positioned to rival Hyflux but then, there is high chance it would not since no body would slap its own face.</p>
              <p>So, the new lower-cost technology also uses membrane technology to derive drinkable water. since its said to be lower-cost, I think it is more cost-effective than Hyflux current technology. Else, it would not be labelled as lower-cost.</p>
              <p>So, I suspect this technology might complement hyflux potable water-making process. If its not, that is it cannot be used to complement Hyflux tech, it simply means Hyflux may not be as competitive as this new business.</p>
              <p>Just my layman point of view.</p>
              <p>well, no one owes nobody no living. the best remains only.</p>

              <p>Look, I sincerly empathise with those who are hit hard by the energy crisis. Even if we were to take public transport, cut down the amount of cars and buses, or save electricity, the fact is, oil will still not drop, or drop to significant levels.</p>
              <p>Because oil is a commodity heavily used for industrialization. Factories, manufacturing, and shipments rely on it. The only real way oil will be go down is to STOP buying consumer goods altogether! But it would not be realistic, hell no, not even me would give up on my new hp or HDTV.</p>
              <p>We need alternative energy research. And rather than to bitch and moan and blame everyone else under the sun, lets think positively - sustainable approach.</p>
              <p>Oil prices will continue to rise as economies get more affluent and  demand for better manufactured consumer goods. Much of oil costs will be added to the costings and passed on to us. Thus, if we want a certain lifestyle, then we best be prepared to pay more for it, AT OUR  OWN EXPENSE AND NOT OUR FELLOW CITIZEN'S EXPENSE, thru the cries for subsidies and tax cuts.</p>
              <p>Either we learn to accept reality and live within our means or we make everyone else pay for our selfish desire of materialism.</p>
