              <p>In this whole wide world is there a judge or court who will allow someone to call someone else a liar over a form filling without the need for proof before calling the alleged a liar ?</p>

              <p>The only really innovative thing I last saw from him was him creating a clone to talk to himself, appearing to give "support" to his post.

              <p>James Gomez claimed he had submitted the form.</p>
              <p>But ED staff said he did not.WP then made this as a big issue.</p>
              <p> ED produced the CCTV clip to prove Gomez on that day ,</p>
              <p>after taking the form out of his briefcase<span style="color: #ff0000;"> in front</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">of TV camera ma</span>n,<span style="color: #ff0000;">putted it back into the briefcase</span>!!</p>

              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hRCFmf5wDg</p>
              <p>After the camera not pointing at him,Gomez putted the form back</p>
              <p>into his briefcase.</p>
              <p>Has he been really distracted?Too Tired?Too smart?</p>
              <p>u can see the ED is very empty.No one seemed disturbing  him.</p>
              <p>No body was talking to him when he returned the form back</p>
              <p>into his briefcase.We can understand he putted back the form</p>
              <p>without knowing it if he was talking to some one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Has he really checked his briefcase after ED staff told him</p>
              <p>that he did not submit the form?</p>
              <p>How big is his briefcase?</p>

              <p>Supposed he did it accidentally and it is only a procedural or formality aspect of election law or regulation like entering the polling station accidentally by GCT can it be something more flexible and resolved on more understanding basis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand it Mas Selamat's escape was caused by paid employees or ministers of government not doing enough to prevent more serious problems as reported by the Commission of Inquiry, do we apply such same standard adopted against Gomez to pursue telling of lies or evading of responsibility as being pursued against WP or Gomez?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The running of a country surely has to be improved and someone who claimed to be the first-world leader will have to set an good example to follow such rule of law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he does not want to set a good example to get rid of all the dirty politics then if the oppositions should come into power one day with PAP becoming the opposition will he agree that it will be right morally or legally for rule of law too for oppositions to put up the same petty defamation law suits against PAP oppositions.</p>

              <p>In this whole wide world is there a judge or court who will allow someone to call someone else a liar over a form filling without the need for proof before calling the alleged a liar ?</p>

              <p>Someone in our country has been abusing the word "liar".   Ironically, he did not show any proof to substantiate him calling the people liars.   A good example is the recent case where he claimed IBA sent a letter.  </p>
              <p>So I see, in this country only that man, son and their party are given the prerogative to any how use the word "liar/liars".   I nearly forget that they are above the law.</p>
