            <div class='col-md body'>From ST forum. Ms Lee says<br><br><strong>Civil servants should be seen to earn their bonuses</strong><br><br>I REFER to the recent announcement on bonuses for the civil service.<br><br>May I ask whether all civil servants are paid largely the same three months plus $220 for good performers and 3.3 months plus $220 for better performers?<br><br>What criteria distinguish not-so-good performers from 'good' and 'better' ones, or is the floor grade 'good' and therefore the minimum payout is three months plus $220?<br><br>While stress levels and rewards between the public and private sectors remain hotly debatable, use of public funds should be subject to transparent benchmarking against performance. Certainly, I have yet to hear of the private sector paying bonuses in July, December and March.<br><br>I do not begrudge deserving civil servants a bonus, but they should be seen to earn it, like the rest of us. This begets accountability, as distinct from the politics of envy.<br><br>The private sector best rewards those with value-creation and problem-solving skills, while poor performers face warnings, pay cuts and dismissal.<br><br>With salaries in the public sector already benchmarked against those in the private sector, the public expects no less than an efficient civil service.<br><br>The private sector does not expect to follow the public sector's lead in bonus payouts, with SMEs citing soaring rentals, increased costs and the need to save for a rainy day.<br><br>With the Government and government-linked companies as Singapore's largest landlord, is the public sector's bonus being squeezed out of the private sector?<br><br>Indeed, it lends credence to the iron-rice-bowl perception of government service.<br><br>Does the public consider staff of, say, the Land Transport Authority and HDB to have earned their bonuses? Do they even deserve a bonus?<br><br>Lee Soon Chin (Ms)<br><br>Latest comments<br><br>Lol! I am really quite surprised the writer can even suggest that govt don't pay bonus. Seriously, if the govt wants to pay peanuts, all you get are monkeys and the economy will go back to 3rd world status.<br>Posted by: MadLiverpoolFan at Sat Dec 01 17:15:09 SGT 2007<br><br>get the facts right before launching attack...civil servants are not getting 3 months bonus. It is just 13th month plus one month bonus. Compared to last year, it is actually lesser. If you talk about fairness, is it then right that bank tellers who are not doing anything more tedious than a frontline service staff in govt dept entitled to a whoppy 3-6 months bonus when time is good in banking sectors?? And, there is no more such thing as iron rice bowl in govt service for goodness sake!<br>Posted by: cutebaby at Sat Dec 01 17:10:32 SGT 2007<br><br>#4 And some of us who have been in govt svc for a quarter century do know. On balance, civil servants tend to move towards the line of least resistance - least effort, least time, least risk, least responsibility. There are exceptions (false humility prevent 'moi' from raising hand), but generally these give up or get the chop.<br>Posted by: chiabb at Sat Dec 01 13:23:15 SGT 2007<br><br>This is one of the Governments PLOY to divert attention from the public of the seriousness of our plight given the continuous price icreases of almost ALL basic essentials like, rice, sugar, flour(bread), petrol, cooking gas, hawkers' food, .......the list can go on and on.......<br><br>By declaring that the economy is good and Civil servants "deserves" fat bonuses is not going to go well with the FRUSTRATING public.<br><br>We should all show our DISSATISFACTION with the government's lame action, if any, to stamp the increase of basic essentials.<br>Unfortunately we cannot do what the ethnic Indians did in Malaysia. So the next best thing is to THINK MORE CAREFULLY WHEN YOU VOTE!!!!!!!!!<br>Posted by: dragonovic93 at Sat Dec 01 12:55:21 SGT 2007<br><br>Wa Lao what's the problem in paying extra bonus to under achievers?<br><br>No problem, gahmen got lots of money from tax payers. If they need more just increase GST, personal or other taxes, prices of HDB houses, erect a few more ERP gantries, etc..... "foreign talents" and scholars are never out of ideas.... to s**** the poor private-sector working public.<br><br>VOTE FOR PAP and become POORER AND POORER.<br>Posted by: WEESWEEPOH at Sat Dec 01 12:41:49 SGT 2007<br><br></div>

This topic about ministers approving their own bonuses or rewards is of great concern to citizens as many of them are not even getting any bonuses or at the most only the 13th month.
