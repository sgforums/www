For example, draconian internal security and SARS laws actually helped saved our nation against external threat. Everyone's favourite examples of bastions of democracy - Hong Kong, England, United States - failed in those incidents. We can argue, if they can't even prevent a *major* terrorist attack, can you trust them to prevent Yishun MRT station from being bombed?<br><br>With regards to the "illegal gathering" outside the embassy, try to view it objectively. Why when sincere Burmese gathered a few days ago, they were not disbanded.<br><br>Read the SDP's account of the event.<br><br><blockquote>And so people continued to make their way to the Burmese embassy and at one point they numbered more than 200. Each and every one of them sat quietly on the pavement after they signed the petition, in solidarity with the brothers and sisters at home.<br><br>Many were deep in prayer. Others sat stoically and munched absent-mindedly on their dinner. Even when an embassy car drove up to enter the compound, the crowd quietly parted to allow it through. No shouts, no cussing. Just dignified anger. </blockquote>What happened to this group of people? Were they forcefully disbanded?<br><br>Even by SDP's own admission, the police were half-hearted and confused. It seems that the police reacted 'cos of CSJ and his petition!<br><br><blockquote>Sufficiently startled, the police swung into action. ASP Deep Singh went around the crowd asking for all to leave the place as it Â“was an offence for five or more people to be assembled without a permit.Â” He received a polite but defiant applause for his efforts.<br><br>His subordinates were, meanwhile, diligently confronting visitors at the entrance to St MartinÂ’s Drive. <strong>They were asking for particulars and telling people that they could not go to sign the petition.</strong><br><br>Despite their best efforts, however, many people ignored the policeÂ’s half-hearted and confused demands. What if the people there were residents in the area or were visiting friends?</blockquote></div>

Anyway my initial point is that the ones feeling the misery are the burmese and i absolutely am disgusted with the SDP for politicising this event. Whilst the Burmese just want to light candles and gather, SDP tries to add to the flames.
