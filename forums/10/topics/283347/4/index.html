Daw Aung San Suu KyiÂ’s poster was strategically propped up to ensure maximum visual impact.<br><br>It didnÂ’t take long for the police show up. Dr Chee was warned that the gathering was an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act.<br><br>By about 3 pm, the crowd started to build up. As they visitors signed the petition, they also took the opportunity to write messages to the Burmese junta and posted them on the gates of the embassy. It didnÂ’t take long for the entrance to be covered up with angry notes.<br><br>Sufficiently startled, the police swung into action. ASP Deep Singh went around the crowd asking for all to leave the place as it Â“was an offence for five or more people to be assembled without a permit.Â” He received a polite but defiant applause for his efforts.<br><br>His subordinates were, meanwhile, diligently confronting visitors at the entrance to St MartinÂ’s Drive. They were asking for particulars and telling people that they could not go to sign the petition.<br><br>Despite their best efforts, however, many people ignored the policeÂ’s half-hearted and confused demands. What if the people there were residents in the area or were visiting friends?<br><br>More important, under what provision of the law can the police stop people from walking down a street?<br><br>And so people continued to make their way to the Burmese embassy and at one point they numbered more than 200. Each and every one of them sat quietly on the pavement after they signed the petition, in solidarity with the brothers and sisters at home.<br><br>Many were deep in prayer. Others sat stoically and munched absent-mindedly on their dinner. Even when an embassy car drove up to enter the compound, the crowd quietly parted to allow it through. No shouts, no cussing. Just dignified anger.<br><br>It was a moving sight spoilt only by the pig-headedness of a government to not allow any peaceful gathering as long as it didnÂ’t adorn the PAP badge.<br><br>Come and support the Burmese democratic revolution. Don't look the other way and pretend that nothing's happening. See you tonight outside the Burmese embassy.<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleburmaprotest6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleburmaprotest6.html</a>[/b]</blockquote>I thought the Singapore government asked that the Burmese government not suppress peaceful demonstration?<br><br>The Singapore government is so hypocritical.<br><br>I think the P4P government should practice what they preach.</div>

If you don't dare to use it you will loose it. This is up to you, now we are fighting for this freedom. We are not going to give it up. -protestor in video being interviewed<br><br>I strongly agree with this. How about you Singaporeans, are you going to fight for your freedom? If the PAP want to stop it's hypocrisy it should not suppress peaceful demonstration in Singapore. Don't you think it is time to correct our assembly law in Singapore?</div>

Not to belittle Singaporeans, they, of course, have the depth in their own fields, be it finance, engineering, law, medicine, operations, sales, administrative etc. which are acquired through extensive interest.<br><br>This is not an easy problem to solve and spans several areas.<br><br>For one, there is fear. However, I do find that some political players end up instiling more fear even if their intentions were good.<br><br>This is why I relayed my incident with the police officer. He asked me a question like someone on the street asking me for directions. I answered and that was it.
