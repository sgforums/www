            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Petition-signing at Burmese embassy in Singapore</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Yg05RDcZ4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Yg05RDcZ4</a><br><br><strong>Steady stream of petitioners despite harassment by Singapore police</strong><br><br>It started quietly with Mr Gandhi Ambalam, Dr Chee Soon Juan and Ms Chee Siok Chin setting up a small table in front of the Burmese Embassy at St MartinÂ’s Drive. Daw Aung San Suu KyiÂ’s poster was strategically propped up to ensure maximum visual impact.<br><br>It didnÂ’t take long for the police show up. Dr Chee was warned that the gathering was an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act.<br><br>By about 3 pm, the crowd started to build up. As they visitors signed the petition, they also took the opportunity to write messages to the Burmese junta and posted them on the gates of the embassy. It didnÂ’t take long for the entrance to be covered up with angry notes.<br><br>Sufficiently startled, the police swung into action. ASP Deep Singh went around the crowd asking for all to leave the place as it Â“was an offence for five or more people to be assembled without a permit.Â” He received a polite but defiant applause for his efforts.<br><br>His subordinates were, meanwhile, diligently confronting visitors at the entrance to St MartinÂ’s Drive. They were asking for particulars and telling people that they could not go to sign the petition.<br><br>Despite their best efforts, however, many people ignored the policeÂ’s half-hearted and confused demands. What if the people there were residents in the area or were visiting friends?<br><br>More important, under what provision of the law can the police stop people from walking down a street?<br><br>And so people continued to make their way to the Burmese embassy and at one point they numbered more than 200. Each and every one of them sat quietly on the pavement after they signed the petition, in solidarity with the brothers and sisters at home.<br><br>Many were deep in prayer. Others sat stoically and munched absent-mindedly on their dinner. Even when an embassy car drove up to enter the compound, the crowd quietly parted to allow it through. No shouts, no cussing. Just dignified anger.<br><br>It was a moving sight spoilt only by the pig-headedness of a government to not allow any peaceful gathering as long as it didnÂ’t adorn the PAP badge.<br><br>Come and support the Burmese democratic revolution. Don't look the other way and pretend that nothing's happening. See you tonight outside the Burmese embassy.<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleburmaprotest6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleburmaprotest6.html</a></div>

When feelings are high, tensions are high, people tend to do stupid things. Like during a soccer match, one spark could lead to a big fight between the supporters.<br><br>Usually protests don't solve the problem. NGOs protest frequently during those big-shot politician meetings, but what have they achieved?<br><br>Also with all the people outside making so much noise, how you expect the Burmese ambassador to work?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is what Chee Soon Juan stands for. Making a nuisance out of himself to bring Singapore down whenever possible, for his personal agenda. When drug traffickers are hanged he would go round and spread what barbaric laws Singapore has etc. Anytime there is a diplomatic spat he will side the foreign counterparty etc. He rides on compassionate grounds. However, when the Tsunami struck, did he go and help rebuild houses in the region when Singapore did ?</div>

You need them to be smug. When they are smug, they think the citizens are supporting them. You put them on "high alert" they will start dishing out carrots .. and citizens will think twice before voting for the opposition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>PAP associated with Junta ..
