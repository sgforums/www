              <p class="byline">By Daniel Buenas</p>
              <p class="byline"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May 01, 2006</strong></span></p>
              <p class="byline"><a href="http://business-times.asia1.com.sg/">The Business Times</a></p>
              <p>PEOPLE'S
                  Action Party leaders - including Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong - last
                  night launched a scathing attack on veteran opposition leader Chiam See
                  Tong's idea for economic union between Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Speaking
                  at a PAP rally in Potong Pasir, Mr Goh - who has been tasked by Prime
                  Minister Lee Hsien Loong to help the party's candidate Sitoh Yih Pin
                  unseat incumbent Mr Chiam in the coming elections - said the opposition
                  leader was not being a 'realist'.</p>
              <p>He was referring
                  to Mr Chiam's suggestion at a rally in Chua Chu Kang Park on Saturday
                  that one way to grow the economy would be for Singapore and Malaysia to
                  strike an economic union.</p>
              <p>'Economic
                  union is possible only between two countries of equals, otherwise it is
                  not possible,' Mr Goh said. 'My point for bringing this out is, to show
                  that (while Mr Chiam) has some ideals, some vision, he is not a
                  realist.'</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam had also said on Saturday that
                  such a union would allow Singaporeans to travel freely to Malaysia, and
                  that because the Opposition has no history with the Malaysian
                  government, it could 'bargain on a clean slate' on bilateral issues.</p>
              <p>In
                  response, Mr Goh said: 'When it comes to negotiations with the
                  Malaysians, would you rather Lee Kuan Yew negotiate or Chiam See Tong?
                  Just ask yourself . . . would you rather I (or PM Lee) negotiate, or
                  Chiam See Tong?'</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam's comments also came under fire
                  from two other PAP leaders who turned up at the rally - Trade and
                  Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister for Community Development,
                  Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan - as well as Mr Sitoh himself.</p>
              <p>Mr
                  Balakrishnan noted that, while Mr Chiam's plan would allow Singaporeans
                  to 'pack their bags and travel to Malaysia anytime',<span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it would also
                  allow equal access to Singapore.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>'His teammates in the
                  Singapore Democratic Alliance have been saying that foreigners have
                  been taking away jobs from Singaporeans,' Mr Balakrishnan said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'You
                  want union? You want free entry of people, of foreigners . . . are you
                  really talking about making this place so everyone can come here? No
                  work permits, no employment pass no control? Think again. Think very
                  carefully,' </strong></span></span>he said.</p>
              <p>In his speech, Mr Lim also questioned
                  Mr Chiam's suggestion, and asked Singaporeans to compare the economic
                  strategy of the PAP to that of the Opposition in order to judge who
                  would better serve their interests.</p>
              <p>'Mr Chiam says, we join
                  Malaysia, we have a market of 27 million straightaway. Therefore, we
                  can have double-digit growth every year,' Mr Lim said. 'Wah lau, so
                  easy ah . . . so why just join Malaysia? Why not join Indonesia? They
                  have 240 million people. Maybe triple-digit growth.'</p>
