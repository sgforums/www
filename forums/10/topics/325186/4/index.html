              <p><strong>Singapore ranked fifth most expensive city in Asia</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore is now the fifth most expensive city in Asia, according to Mercer Worldwide Cost of Living Survey.</span></p>
              <p>Singapore’s rise in rankings is partly due to the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar.</p>
              <p>Other contributing factors include its high quality of living and continued strength as a regional hub.</p>
              <p>Tokyo is the costliest Asian city, followed by Seoul, Hong Kong and Osaka.</p>
              <p>In world standings, Singapore is in 13th position, one notch higher than in 2007.</p>
              <p>Moscow was ranked the most expensive city both in Europe and globally for the third year running.</p>
              <p>Mercer’s survey covered 143 countries across six continents. — CNA/de</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Is this good news to Singaporeans and the ruling party?</span></p>

              <p>Mercer does not seems to provide the statistic for earning of the cities so it is hard to do a comparison. Another survey done is the city mayor economics</p>

              <p>Of course, people r gonna say I am an "internet troll", work for the gov and treat me like a dog, the figures r out for people to see. Do u know why there r lesser and lesser posting for the gov, because there r people tat hurl verbal abuses to people who genuinely felt the gov had done a good job.</p>
              <p>My best advise is, just bear with such insults. Though they r numbered more, tis sort of negative propaganda will work against them eventually.</p>

              <p>Atobe is credible as compared to those trolls here.    He reasons well and knows the situation in Singapore as for the other 2 to 3 trolls here, they are here just to expect to read posts that are pleasing to them.   If posts are not pleasing to them, they start their nuisance, spoilt, troublemaking is in their blood.   These trolls are good in twisting their words.  </p>
              <p><a href="/users/241813">Gutentaginator</a></p>
              <p>I simply skip their postings (often long winded) whenever I see trolls posting here. No offence to them , its just that I already know their motive and simply have no time to waste on trollism. They are the worst forms of existence.</p>
              <p>There is also Atobe tat probably spam so much insults it can filled up to thosands of words. In fact he spams insults to any body who seemed to be associated with PAP supporter. Isn't tis bullying people to follow his view ?</p>

              <p>Gazelle, Love Supreme, TCH05, Pekei, Chinkara, Guttorosa, Mammalia, Aelop, Point_Blank, DeerHunter, 4 different versions of LIES, few  childish versions insulting the moderators, and now this is his newest nick. Each account has been banned because of his childishness and behaviour.</p>
              <p>Do have one single discussion in which you disagree with him, and you will understand his childishness, autism and many other bad character traits.</p>
              <p>I don't resort to attacks on all govt supporters; only to Gazelle, whom if you point out his mistakes (like what I did recently when he mentioned tax invasion), will resort to insults and vulgarities to divert away.</p>
              <p>Please do not list yourself together with him; you will be demeaning yourself if you do that. It will be more discouraging for you if you support him.</p>
