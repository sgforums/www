It is a surprise people r quick to point out gazelle or deerhunter yet slow in realising other people r committing the same offence.

              <p>Ok, I apologize for that. I just realised I meant the one 3 posts above (by Gazelle's clone), and not reservistsianz (2 posts above), although I typed so, because I forgot to include the counting of my own post as well before I posted it. Like that happy?</p>
              <p>Although I'm pretty sure that the quicker ones would already have caught the gist because I have highlighted the words 'hurl' and 'verbal abuses' as well, something which reservistsianz has clearly not done, and which you have selectively decided not to mention just to prove a point of yours for god knows what reason.</p>

              <p>So why don't you call Maurizio by the full name too? He wasn't even playing with your nickname that you chose by extending different meanings from it, but a shortened version of the nickname that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you have chosen</span>.</p>

Surprisingly in the thread, about 20 of his replies, he never address another person nick at all in the beginning statement. In another thread, singapore ranked 5th etc etc, he also never mentioned another person nick, or shortened version of it as well.

              <p>Well, if you had told me that giving all of the company's profit to an individual, and thus resulting in paying less tax overall, and hence committed tax evasion, then you do not know what is tax evasion. Need I quote for you your sentence again?</p>

              <p>U see, u cannot say I am talking about u because there r 1001
                                  forums in the world and tons of people who start with the initial
                                  "e" in their nick. However the insult is already implied. And wat
                                  will u do ? If I am not wrong, u may become defensive and reply
                                  maliciously back and stating the addressee to someone implied to me
                                  but not explicitly me. And wat will tis result ? Insults to and
                                  fro, emotions running high and it become a flame war.</p>
              <p>U can argue claiming tat mario (yes, tat
                                  is intentional) is not insulting me at all, then I can
                                  also claim the above passage is completely relevant, especially on
                                  the family manner part. And wat will tis results ? U wanna defend
                                  mario for all his insults. Fine. It just shows tat people r realy
                                  just targeting the opposers and supporting their action.</p>

              <p>Seems like you have lost your cool. So you finally understood what it feels like if someone else defend others, whom in your eyes, had been rude?</p>
              <p>Thus, <strong>can you then explain why you defended someone for many posts  whose action you have not seen at all for being rude?</strong></p>
              <p>Are you thus a hypocrite? The saying goes: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't do onto others what you don't want others to do to you.</span></p>
              <p>But if you want to say anything bad about me, do feel free. I'm serious. This is a forum, a virtual world afterall, and I don't bother with such trivial stuff. I'm here to discuss some politics, have entertainment, make cynic pokes at the government, and most importantly, to help and share with people if they have any queries in homework or in the areas of health and fitness, if I know the answer to. I believe you have seen me ignore any insults or anything, from the likes of Gazelle and clones.</p>
              <p>And again, this is not even targetting supporters or anything. If you cannot even be consistent in what you have said and what you have done, how can you blame anyone else?</p>
              <p>If you really can get so agitated and upset in this virtual world, I guess you should really mature more.</p>

              <p>Com'on la. Wat r u doing ? U r trying to support people for being rude and spam all kind of insults to other people isn't it. Even if u have something bad to say about another people, u can always say it in a nicer fashion. U wanna play tis game I can write a very malicious reply as well</p>
              <p>There is a certain guy whose nick start with "e" and writing nonsensical rubbish in the forum.  He probably has no people teaching him about manner in his home and tat is why he love to insult people and love to encourage people to insul other people. His thinking process is probably all skewed up and tis type of stupidity is genetic in nature. Tis make me worry how on earth does tis kind of person actually graduate from a university.</p>

              <p>bro,</p>
              <p>glad you are stopping at that on this nick topic. as i said, you nick is a `perpetual fruit ripe for the picking'. there is no way you can avoid getting slimed when one has a point or case against your post or opinion. your nick helped in the cause against you. so, people are going to use it to good effect, including me.</p>
              <p>either you live with it or, `reincarnate'.</p>
