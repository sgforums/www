              <p>That old man never will stop having his nose in the air, will he? He thinks he's some sort of God or something.</p>
              <p>And to think that he laments over the degradation of graciousness- wait, can it even be called a degradation of our society-culture when 'graciousness' was never there in the first place?</p>
              <p>I remember a snippet of his<a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/01/09/a-gracious-society-i%E2%80%99d-settle-for-a-gracious-government/"> speech</a> on the radio about a month ago about him linking financial progress to graciousness (or a lack thereof) in our society. Apparently he ISN'T ignorant about the fact that Singaporeans are generally a bunch of selfish, kiasu, arrogant and ill-mannered people who pride themselves on their financial success and silver-spooned births.</p>
              <p>My take is that the apple does not fall far from the tree. I am a Singaporean- always was and always will be, but I am ashamed to say that I, too, am the selfish, kiasu, arrogant, money minded Singaporean that I despise.</p>
              <p>If not on a large scale, perhaps a little. There is a thick streak of that behaviour in me, and honestly, I can't blame myself because I was brought up in a society where everyone was like that for a good 15 years. I have sinced moved to Malaysia, and honestly, the level of humility between these two countries is STARTLING.</p>
              <p>I actually had to learn humility, which was never taught in Singapore schools. Instead, they just taught us to keep aiming higher "or else you cannot survive".</p>
              <p>What kind of SOCIETY is the Singapore government nurturing?</p>
              <p>I pity the future generation. They're going to be much worse off than us.</p>
              <p>The only way is to see PAP being brought down and a more humble party lead us.</p>

              <p>Dont think Japanese leaders would ever compare themselves with China or Korea, Germany with France or Britain, USA with Russia, cause they recog they are at least on par if not more superior. But many Asian countries do compare themselves with countries in certain areas of development, e.g. development of the 4 asian dragons, or how countries tackle the financial crisis ...</p>
              <p>I guess the purpose of the comparison is as important as who are being compared with. HK and Singapore often compared between themselves to perform better, in being the busiest port, choice of MNC as regional HQ, .... They are neither developing countries nor neighboring countries, but relevant countries.</p>
              <p>The problem with the comparison made by LKY is that it was made to glorify the success of the PAP government. Everybody knows that the growth of Singapore is not solely due to the PAP government. Even dictatorial government such as Marcos and Suharto could also bring prosperity and growth to their country. To make thing worst, his sensationalized remark about female Singapore working as maids overseas was highly insensitive and offensive, rather unbecoming of a leader.    </p>

              PENANG, MALAYSIA: Do not compare Singapore's economy with that of Malaysia's.
              
              It is like comparing "first-class grapes (Singapore) with first-class apples (Malaysia)," Prime Minster Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said when addressing the Chinese community at the Penang Chinese Town Hall (PCTH) dialogue session yesterday.
              
              "We are a population of over 20 million and we rank eighth in the world in terms of our competitiveness.
              
              "This is not the Government's figure and I am not telling you lies. This statistic is from an international survey.
              
              "If I quote statistics from our own surveys, you will not believe us. Everywhere I go, the business community tells me that Malaysia is doing very well. These people are smart. You cannot fool them because they are well-read," he said, adding that the Government had no reason to lie.
              
              "Please trust us - we are your government. If you look at the economy, we are doing well. That is a fact proven by figures. But people still claim otherwise because of increasing prices. This is a very simplistic way of analysing the economy.
              
              "Nobody is happy to see prices rising but this is out of our control. The question is not how to bring down prices but how to help the rakyat (people) cope.
              
              "Every country in the world is faced with rising oil prices except maybe Brunei but you cannot compare. The RM40bil (S$17.5bil) oil subsidy we give out can be used to build better schools, roads, hospitals and infrastructure but we don't want to burden the people," he said, adding that education and medical treatment was also heavily subsidised by the Government.
              
              "We subsidise even water and electricity, yet people are angry when they hear the word 'toll'. We try to subsidise as much as possible but we still need to impose toll charges because we need to build roads," he said before thanking the Chinese community for contributing to the country's economy.
              
              "The private sector is dominated by the Chinese and I want to say a big "thank you" to the community for creating so many job opportunities," he said.
