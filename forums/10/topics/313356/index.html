              <p>This is the begining of cost increase in medical care. first, the good news....with the revision of the medical insurance, the cover for B2 and C class is raised....then come the bad (not so bad considering the cover increased) news.....insurance premium increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The worst news has yet to come. that is the medical cost will increase with "improved medical service and medical treatment". This will leave you with having to folk out more from your pocket for medical treatment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am very sure we will be seeing this very soon.</p>

              <p>I like his style. No wonder, SM says he's the best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(First, he give you the sweet.) Revised Medishield covers increased for B2 and C class to help the poor to be able to maximise medical care and pay less.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Then, he took back some of the sweet.) But in order for these to happen, Medishield Insurance premium had to be increased to offset the cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(This is what I think will happen. Finally, he will take back the rest of the sweet and demand you to pay for having to keep the sweet on your behalf). But in order to keep our medical care 1st class, we have to revamp medical health care. Government Hospital cost will be peg with Private Hospital and "C" class will be reduced/abolished/renamed(due to old ah pek link "C" to Death) to B2 and B2 to be renamed as B2 plus and B2 plus to be B2 plus plus) thus Government subsides will be reduced accordingly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminds me of the monkeys and their bananas</p>

              <p><br>Do you expect doctors to see patients for nothing? If you are prepared to pay hundreds of dollars to see Manchester play for 90 mins or watch the F1 race, surely one should expect to pay more to doctors who deal with life-threatening conditions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without higher medical insurance premiums, who is going to pay the increasing medical fees of patients? And medical fees will only continue to rise, because we can do more for patients and patients expect more. In the 50s, if you have a cancer doctors will probably tell you to go home and prepare your last rites. Of course it is cheaper to kick the bucket than to go for surgery and chemotherapy...maybe you prefer that? </p>

              <p> Yes, yes, you win.</p>
              <p>The poor should stop paying hundreds of dollars to watch Manchester United play for 90 minutes or watch the F1 race.</p>
              <p>Those people organising these events should stop targetting poor people who are trying to make ends meet and instead shift the focus to the richer elites who can afford to pay thousands of dollars a night to stay at some grand hotel overlooking the Marina area to see cars whizzing by just for a few seconds.</p>
              <p>Yes.</p>

              <p>Indeed wise mushroom I concur.</p>
              <p>Surely a man who is holding a position that is <strong>vital</strong> to the <strong>survival</strong> of mankind have to be paid, and more I say more than what we paid for silly races and babaric games. A man, whom without his prescence our nation would be disease ridden, alas and god forbid, a garden city no more. Singpapore without this vital group of people will be like a human body without white blood cells; she dies. This group of people are of course our sweepers and our cleaners. But here is the problem, these vital people are paid very much lower than our all important people who can afford to watch babaric games.</p>
              <p>I am not asking for your pity on this group of people, but shouldnt the govenment help out these people, to the government welfare is their F-word, untouchable word. The white blood cells have serve your body so well, without whom you will die, and now you are not going to care about them? Please, the 7% is for something useful iznt it?</p>
