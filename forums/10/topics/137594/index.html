            <div class='col-md body'>During the worse of recession back in 2003, Union chief had not objected to proposal of Ms Pung Ying Ying's committee to make all workers' wages variable, i.e. reducible to help employers overcome recessions irrespective of likelihood of abuses by employers who might take advantage of such scheme to reduce wages of workers to increase their own profitability.<br><br>Workers of Singapore are at the mercy of tripartism one of the major pillars of government.<br><br>Government has no hesitation to reduce workers' pays even if they increase their own pays quickly on the first sign of external recovery. Whether workers should correspondingly restore their reduced wage levels and CPF cut-backs is not their priority.<br><br>Taking the above-mentioned Union attitude towards workers, are Unions seniors and deputies working for the interest of workers or citizens of Singapore?<br><br>Are they intervening when employers take advantage of MOM's policy to bring in more foreigners on the undefined S-pass scheme?<br><br>The answers should be from the people.

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I would like to state my position. I'm not pro-gov nor a union member. I'm just an ordinary citizen in the red dot.<br><br>The role of Unions in SG is very different from the other countires. We cannot stereo type unions' role by comparing them with other countries, who are rich in natural resources.<br><br>Our only resources in SG is human. Therefore, we depend on foreign investments for survival. We have to look at our predicament from a higher perspective. If our unions are going to be like those in Aust. who goes all out to fight for their workforce, we are going to lose lots of foreign investors. How many companies will want to invest their money here when riots, downtools, strikes, boycott,...etc happens now and then. We can't survive with such environment.<br><br>It is rather obvious that the tripartite system is just an eyewash. How many times did our unions call for a strike? The most recent issue of SIA - Pilot unions ends with our Big Bro stepping in. But it was for the interest of our national airline and the country as a whole. We can only sympathised with those who are affected.<br><br>The only way our unions can show their relevance in SG is to provide services to control prices of our goods and services. I would think they did a good job in Insurance. But they had killed a lot of provision shops in our neighbourhood. Nothing much we can do about it. We can only think positive and take the advantage to benefit from the services they provide.<br><br>With integrity in PAP and NTUC, the unions have serve their unique role in attracting foreign investors. On conclusion, they (unions) are just part of the Gov system to lead SG into being a first world country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

It was a bad time to declare independence, to be exact. If we remained longer with London, our unions would have been more developed. In western countries, the unions fight tooth and nail for ordinary workers' welfare. Those in the 60s were mere communist fronts and had no noble intentions.</div>

There is no recourse except to take up legal action if say your employer decided not to honour employment contract.

With more manufacturing moving out of Singapore, and more low end jobs on contract basis, more management and white collared jobs in Singapore, the number of employees eligible to be "Unionise and protectable" has drastically reduced till such a point that Unions seems to be redundant. They should evolve or "reinvent" themselves to suit the current situation.</div>

Pardon me, but I thought, from teh content and tone of your post, that you were supporting that. Becuase what I read of what you wrote reminds me strongly of govt propaganda.<br><br>2) I agree we do not have natural resources i.e. physical capital. But I'm beginning to think that unlike what PAP has been brainwashing us to think for the last 40 yrs, human capital/resource is not our only resource. We have cultural capital as well, a rich history beyond PAP years. If only we could use that.. Unions have tor einvent themselves, just like everything else, including religious bodies and the government, and when I talk about reinvention of government, i mean doing a change to the administrative system, and not merely shuffling faces between civil service, private sector management and cabinet. But when you reinvent yourself, you still need to stay true to your original aim, 'cos tt is the purpose of reinvention: to allow yourself to achieve your aim more easily. Reinvention does not mean changing your basic thrust. the fact is, we would not have to depend so much on foreign investment, if we  built up our domestic industries. That, I think, was one of the flaws in PAP's otherwise-perfect economic development plan. They went into a frenzy inviting and selling Singapore to MNCs, such that by today Singapore has become the slave of all the MNCs it hired.  A nation is not defined by a Parliament House, a set of ministerial buildings, and the Istana. It is defined as the community of people within a particular geographical region, and a community is made up of individuals. Because of this very elementary fact, I have stopped believing in the slogan "nation above society, society above self", at least in its first part, because both are synonymous; it's pure tautology, unless of course the govt is trying to make itself semi-divine.<br><br>3) I don't blame you for your fear of "traditional unions". That's what we are told constantly over and over again by Straits Times or other government agents, or in school textbooks (if you're a pre-NS student like I am). But let's take a look at the real world in the 21st Century, not in the 1960s and 1970s. More specifically, let's look at Scandinavia. In Finland and Norway, workers are allowed to strike, boycott and so on and so forth, but yet those two countries have the highest levels of industrial peace throughout the continent. These methods usually do not get beyond the negotiating table. And I have not read about investors leaving these two countries yet. In fact, these two countries have favourable comments from investors! No armageddon so far... Besides, employers know that a productive workforce is essential for commercial success, and satisfying workers' wants will usually lead to improved productivity.<br><br>4) And after all that, how do you think unions should reinvent themselves?<br><br>the pikamaster</div>
