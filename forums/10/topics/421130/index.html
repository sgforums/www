              <p>Hey anyone watching CNA now? Tharman is being interviewed. It seems more like a platform for PAP to tell sgporeans how they are helping the citizenry. The reporter asked Tharman if this budget is meant to coincide with the elections, his answer was this is definitely the last budget before elections is due in Feb 2012. LOL. And then he talked about how this budget is meant to help singaporeans. The reporter let it go at that and moved on to advertisement time.</p>

              generally positive responses from Singaporeans about Budget 2011. <br><br>Close to 30 per cent of the more than 600 feedback inputs REACH received were on growth payouts. <br><br>REACH said most people supported the government's move to share surpluses. <br><br>But
               some felt the amount was not enough to cover rising costs, and others 
              felt it was unfair to base the payout on housing size. <br><br>Rewarding working Singaporeans was also a hot issue with 20 per cent commenting on it. <br><br>A majority of contributors welcomed the additional support for lower- and middle-income earners.<br><br>They also welcomed the removal of television and radio license fees, more progressive personal income tax schedule. <br><br>Most
               were generally for the increase in Central Provident Fund (CPF) 
              contribution by employers, with a few suggesting the additional amount 
              be credited into the Ordinary Account or Minimum Sum instead of the 
              Special Account.<br><br>REACH said there were concerns that the higher CPF contribution would be an additional burden for employers. <br><br>Other hot issues were boosting workers' productivity and skills, and support for families with children. <br><br>Compared to the same time last year, REACH received three times more feedback inputs for Budget 2011. <br><br>The most active feedback channels were the REACH Online Discussion Forum, its Facebook page, and email. <br><br>REACH Chairman Amy Khor said contributors were largely happy with the Budget. <br><br>She
               added that Budget 2011 has addressed Singaporeans' immediate concerns 
              about inflation without eroding the work ethic, while achieving 
              Singapore's long-term economic growth. <br><br>Members of public can continue to share their views on Budget 2011 on the </span><a class="path" href="http://www.reach.gov.sg/Microsite/Budget2011.aspx">REACH's dedicated Budget website</a><span>.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span> </span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Day two of debates over the Budget statement saw MPs 
              voicing concern that some groups of Singaporeans had been left out. MPs 
              also appealed for more flexibility when implementing the measures.<br><br>It
               is hard to be a single parent in Singapore, with no state maternity 
              benefits and no tax reliefs when hiring domestic help, which are granted
               only to married women.<br><br>MPs said it is even harder for those in the low-income bracket.<br><br>MP
               for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Dr Lam Pin Min said: "Single-parent families are 
              not specifically targeted by social security policies in Singapore. 
              Low-income single-parent families have to compete with other vulnerable 
              groups for means-tested social assistance. Even then, some assistance 
              programs have eligibility conditions that disqualify such families."<br><br>"In
               many aspects of public policy and discourse, single-parent families are
               looked upon as undesirable alternative household entities that are to 
              be discouraged and are thus excluded from some social services that are 
              available to 'normal' two-parent families."<br><br>Other MPs noted that the eligibility criteria for utilities rebates relied too much on the size of the occupant's HDB flat.<br><br>Michael
               Palmer, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, said: "The government's rationale
               for this is that the occupants of these flats come from a higher income
               bracket because they can afford to buy larger flats and therefore do 
              not require as much subsidy as those in the smaller flats.<br><br>"However,
               often the occupants of the 4- and 5-room and Executive flats are not 
              only the owners and their children, but also one set of parents and 
              perhaps a younger brother or sister and even his or her family. What is 
              also quite common is that there is possibly only one main breadwinner 
              who supports the household, while the spouse looks after the children 
              and ageing parents. These residents feel the pinch of supporting more 
              dependants while receiving less help."<br><br>Instead he suggested 
              taking into account the household income and the number of members in 
              the family. Alternatively, he said rebates for utilities, and service 
              and conservancy charges could be set within a band for each flat size, 
              and the amount each household received could be based on household 
              income and family size.<br><br>MPs also said only the basic salary should be considered under the Workfare scheme.<br><br>It now has a monthly income cap of S$1,700, which includes overtime pay and allowances.<br><br>MP
               for Tampines GRC Irene Ng cited the example of a resident, 59-year-old 
              Mr Kamaruzaman Abdul Rahman, who works as a pest controller. His basic 
              salary is S$1,100 which he supplements with a second job as a floor 
              polisher, which earns him S$800 a month.<br><br>Ms Ng said his combined 
              income, including allowances, comes up to S$2,000, and noted that he 
              also had reached the top end of his salary scale of S$32 a day as a pest
               controller. That he does not qualify for Workfare "runs counter to 
              one's sense of social equity," she said.<br><br>"It is not uncommon for 
              some low-income workers to put in extra overtime to earn more money...as
               for the low-income workers who hold two low-paying jobs, can the 
              minister consider a Workfare bonus and WIS (Workfare Income Supplement) 
              for them too, perhaps subject to a ceiling of maybe S$2,300 of the 
              combined basic salaries of their two jobs," added Ms Ng.<br><br>Her call
               was echoed by Marine Parade MP Lim Biow Chuan, who suggested that the 
              income ceiling could also factor in the number of dependents in each 
              household.<br><br>While MPs supported the measures to help the low and 
              middle-income households, some thought they were being taken for 
              granted. With global uncertainty and its impact on Singapore's economy 
              yet unknown, they felt this was no time to breed what they called "a 
              culture of demand".<br><br>MP for Marine Parade GRC Dr Ong Seh Hong 
              said: "During a bad year, one expects reliefs and assistance packages. 
              This I can understand. However during a good year, if one also expects 
              goodies and bonuses, this indeed is not a healthy national culture."<br><br>MP for Jalan Besar GRC Heng Chee How agreed.<br><br>"We
               must never kid ourselves into believing that money will come out of 
              nowhere. You can share in good years, but in bad years, where is the 
              money going to come from?"<br><br>And on the back of worries over a 
              widening income gap, some MPs asked that more resources be directed to 
              help those from low-income families move up the social ladder.<br><br>MP
               Sin Boon Ann suggested that tax breaks be given to private sector 
              companies that offer internship or mentorship opportunities to students 
              from less-well-off households, while MP Cynthia Phua suggested that the 
              Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports consider making 
              kindergarten and childcare education free of charge for children from 
              low-income families.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span> </span></p>

              <p>We have seen this over the years, haven't we? PAP MPs act as the opposition to show we don't need real opposition. Remember how Lily Neo asked Vivien a few years back about the low assistance for the poor? The latter shot back and said if the poor want their makan in the hawker centre, food court or restaurant.</p>
              <p>This time round....vote to show them who's boss!!</p>

              <p>Aaiyah Rock^Star, PAP MPs act as opposition because the opposition is just too quite mah?</p>
              <p>The opposition MPs only know how to ask the usual questions e.g. on human rights and low income. We need some credible opposition in the parliament who can really grill the PAP MPs on their economic principles on how they derived the budget.</p>
