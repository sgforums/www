              <p>A. Singapore can be what it is today and maybe even better. If no LKY, still have other founding fathers who actually did the heavy lifting.</p>

              <p>His mistake in streaming the students out in his primitive education system took years to debunk because he has buried his head in the sand and that was changed only after encountering much economic problems and strong objections from the population.</p>
              <p>His mainstay policy is taxing and profiteering at the expense of the people until they lose their retirement, hoarding monies to build his own ego of surplus which does not benefit the citizens but only to be lost on Shin Corp or Global Crossing etc etc.</p>
              <p>The worse is promote himself and his own name and reputation based on some leadership claim which is totally unfounded based on facts and his stubborn and narrow-minded refusing to change policies which did not work as Catherine Lim or Ngiam Tong Dow has put it.</p>
              <p>All such narrow-minded attitude towards the people has set back our economic competitiveness which could have done much much better had he not been too self-centred and selfish to guard his own interest.</p>

              <p>Many of our good people with practical knowledge in various field are migrating. Some say it is about 10 per day. LKY's own figure of brain drain is itself evidences of his own lack of leadership or success - a well-run country does not have so many grouses and harsh policies against their own people. If our 800 top brains have stayed behind we could have created many more jobs instead of throwing the door open to foreigners to cut the face so as to spite the nose.</p>
              <p>Why was there a difference from the figure of LHL who knows. Minister Ng Eng Hen has given figures which tends to under-state seriousness of problems about unemployments.</p>

              <p>With graduate mother or streaming schemes presentations may look tempting at first but upon closer practical scrutiny there were many flaws concealed to allow leaders who are selfish and self-serving as seen from their many past practices to get away with such policies for years.</p>
              <p>Did graduate mother or educational streaming policy been proven as proposed or conceptualized by LKY. Never !!</p>
              <p>Foreign worker import policy also in the same way was presented in a one-tracked fallacious manner to make it look as if it will create job. If we are to look at it closely it will be found to be selfish in order to allow the government to grab a few foreigners to quicken filling up of jobs without throwing the net wider to allow local to step into the available jobs. Why can't there be a holding-hand period to allow lesser-related unemployed locals to go through a longer probation to convert them to the particular jobs available instead of stopping at the normal schedule dictated by selfish employers who merely want to get cheaper foreigners to earn quick bucks which in the longer run are costing them more due to other social problems caused to housing, transportation, facilities etc which push up our local costs of living.</p>
              <p>The fundamental issue at stake here which LKY failed to see is "Government owes its existence to its citizens including all its past success and surpluses used by government to promote itself so no citizens should be forsaken in any crisis"</p>

              <p>Was it LKY or the generation from the 1930s and 1940s, who were then already in their 20s in the 1950s and made the sacrifices by believing in the speeches that LKY gave when he started out in politics under the Colonial Government ?</p>
              <p>If at all, LKY misled Singaporeans into believing him when he sought independence from Colonial Rule only to see an autocratic goverment making the Colonial Laws even tougher to control Singaporeans -</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> <span style="color: black;">"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind." <em>- Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates ''</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">With LKY having a free hand since 1965, and under his continuous influence - is Singapore a better and free society according to his grand vision encapsulated in his speech made in the Malaysian Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Jumping the Time Lines, Singapore present day population problems had originated also from LKY's insistence in a 2 child Family Planning in the 1960s - that was vigorously promoted, including psychological pressure to have the women undergo operation to prevent future pregnancy after the second child birth.</span></p>
              <p>Singapore's present political landscape is due entirely to the insecurity of LKY in being challenged, resulting in the side lining of his generation of leaders that formed his Team in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.</p>
              <p>Every member of his earlier teams had been able to stand-up and debate him on his ideas, and it seems that most allowed him to have his ways due to his ''gift of the gap'' and an ''agile and alert mind'' that is a storehouse of data and events.</p>
              <p>The present Political Landscape will pose a future danger to Singaporeans as the various institutions that existed in the 1950s and 1960s to provide check and balance to the Political Structure were systematically dismantled.</p>
              <p>Even LKY's idea of a 2-Key control over the National Reseve seem to be quietly dismantled after the late President Ong Teng Cheong put this concept to a test by asking the GCT Goverment to produce an audit of the National Reserve so that the President will know what he is looking after.</p>
              <p>LKY's idea of not allowing a New Cabinet to utilise the budget surplus from the previous Cabinet was made under the pretext of protecting the National Reserves from being ''supposedly raided'' by any rouge political party forming the next Government.</p>
              <p>This is merely creating future political problems for Singaporeans who will dare to cast out the PAP from any supposedly freak election result.</p>
              <p>Why should this be seen as a freak result ?</p>
              <p>If all these problems are not created by the wilful act of one Man that believe himself to be infallible, and leaving the ordinary Singaporeans to sweat it out to make things succeed - can Singapore be what it is today ?</p>
              <p>The fact that the Singapore economy continue to tick is not due to the Politicians - who are quick to blame overseas factors that affect Singapore - but is due to the energy and enterprise of ordinary Singaporeans making our own way through a minefield of legislations that slow us down.</p>
              <p>The silly speed limits - of 50kmh, 70kmh, 80kmh and 90kmh - that blanket Singapore roads have made criminals out of every Singapore driver, as no one seem to respect this piece of legislation, and one can see car zipping along at speeds that are in excess of the prevailing limits.</p>
              <p>No one is caught until the law is enforced.</p>
              <p>Can the Singapore economy exist at the various speed limits that restrained Singaporeans, if Singaporeans did not take the risk to break the law and be criminalised ?</p>
              <p>This is Singapore under a kiasu Government that takes a short cut in passing legislations that shoot the mouse with a cannon.</p>
              <p>Is the POWER of ONE not to blame ?</p>
              <p>Is his contribution not over blown ?</p>

The book comes in two volumes, volume one subtitled "The Spell of <a title="Plato" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Plato"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Plato</span></span></a>"<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[1]</span></span></a></sup>, and volume two, "The High Tide of Prophecy: <a class="mw-redirect" title="Hegel" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Hegel"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hegel</span></span></a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Marx" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Marx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Marx</span></span></a>, and the Aftermath"<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[2]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The subtitle of the first volume is also its central premise — namely, that most <a title="Plato" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Plato"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Plato</span></span></a> interpreters through the ages have been seduced by his greatness. In so doing, Popper argues, they have taken his political philosophy as a benign idyll, rather than as it should be seen: a horrific <a title="Totalitarianism" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Totalitarianism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">totalitarian</span></span></a> nightmare of deceit, violence, master-race rhetoric, and eugenics..."</p>
