            <div class='col-md body'>In Solidarity With University StudentsÂ’ Application Of Permit For Peaceful Demonstration Against Inhumane Oppression In Myanmar<br><br>The National Solidarity Party unreservedly condemns the brutal killings of peaceful demonstrators by the Myanmar Junta. We urge the world as well as the Singapore Government to use whatever means they have to prevent any further blood letting and help Myanmar to set a time table towards a stable and peaceful transition to democracy.<br><br>We take issue with the PAP government for their rejection of the application by university students for peaceful demonstrations in Singapore in protest of the inhumane oppression. To evolve into a Â‘realÂ’ First World country, SingaporeÂ’s developmental path must go beyond mere economic consideration. The cultivation of social-political values, awareness, and public spirit is an important step towards a more balanced Nation. We must try to cultivate a high sense of moral and social concerns among our future generations beside the traditional pursuit of<br>materialism.<br><br>We have witnessed recently that there are some positive signs of civil activism from citizens. The initiative of the university students is one such example of social-political participation by citizens. However, it is regrettable that the request was flatly turned down. This demonstrates that the PAP government has not progressed with time.<br><br>Social-political activism through means of peaceful public demonstrations by citizens and politicians alike serves to create bonds and shared public values in the society. Contrary to PAP propagandas that such activities could break the fabric of the Nation, many places around the world, such as vibrant Hong Kong, has shown us that such civil public demonstrations build up social and national identity.<br><br>While supporting the suffering Myanmar people in their bid for democracy, we also urge the PAP government to uphold the core values of democracy on this land by facilitating peaceful public expressions like peaceful protests and demonstrations.<br><br>In solidarity with the students, we hope that our intrepid and broad-minded students can persist with the application of a permit to advance their noble cause, whilst being mindful of not overstepping the law. At the same time, we would like to see a manifestation of open-mindedness on the part of the PAP government by granting the student the required permit. This will demonstrate the governmentÂ’s sincerity beyond the rhetoric expression of Â“revulsionÂ” at the human tragedy in Myanmar.<br><br>Central Executive Council<br>National Solidarity Party</div>

They therefore hope nobody can rise up to his level.<br><br>Heck, UWA students can march against Iraq war.
