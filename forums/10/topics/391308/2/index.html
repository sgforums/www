              <p>Hey "zwei-siao" - why will you want to be so modest to push the champion vulgar title to others, when the records are clear of your supreme performance with vulgarity ?</p>
              <p>Was that the "zwei-siao-Hog" in you finally brought to the surface and displayed the habit of screwing your own mother; or was that a slip that revealed your father's chip left in your block that prompted you with such a shocking anti-social abuse in a public forum ?</p>
              <p>All of which is not a surprise for me to have aptly referred you as the resident "zwei-siao-Hog" since your effort to push your face onto others without any ability to put on a good front.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must be quite bankrupt of any arguments to have been so pathetic as to dig up an old dead thread from Jan-Feb 2009 - to prove nothing of what you intend to imply.</p>
              <p>That thread had you roundly screwed and flounding in a pathetic state of whining.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is even more pathetic to suggest that I have been supporting the PAP in any way, when all the time you had been fixated with your accusation that I am a supposed supporter of CSJ.</p>
              <p>Where on earth did a "zwei-siao" mind get so caught up in such a paradoxical web ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is quite understandable for a desparate and bankrupt person to grasp anything in the air that float through your hollow imagination to shore up your sinking position.</p>
              <p>Try harder to improve your weak "zwei-siao" position.</p>
              <p>It is no use to prove your own worth by being more vulgar to dig deeper into your pathetic "zwei-siao" existence as a pseudo-Bavarian Hog.</p>
              <p>It will also not help to strut around in abject anger and come up with hollow ideas to plant your worthless "zwei-siao" interpretations of what were clearly stated.</p>
              <p>Did you finally accept the fact that "<em>LKY has fulfilled his goal of filling the stomachs and dull the minds of the people</em>"  ?</p>
              <p>We are not surprised that you are those whom LKY had so easily fulfilled his goal in having your mind not only dulled, but turned hollow.</p>
              <p>You would have been safer with your own "zwei-siao" idea that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/377726?page=12"><em>’Malays are original settlers in Singapore, and all others ethnic groups are immigrants here’</em> </a> - as only you are the only accepting this fact.</p>
              <p>Will anyone wish to dispute the "zwei-siao" idea that you hold so dearly ?</p>
              <p>For one who is so fixated with things from the past that only you will be so "zwei-siao" to hang on to - it is amazing that you will accuse others of being myopic and causing troubles for yourself.</p>
              <p>Obviously, you have not been neglected and left dangerously alone to nurture your "zwei-siao" existence. </p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that only one like you you will suggest the "zwei-siao" thought of abusing any mother - let alone mine ?</p>
              <p>Pathetic.</p>
