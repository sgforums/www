              <h1>MM Lee urges Singaporeans to “bear” with competition with foreigners</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 19, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Caught off guard by the rising public anger against its misguided immigration and pro-foreigner policies, the ruling party has been fire-fighting for the last few weeks to appease Singaporeans by introducing last-minute cosmetic changes to “sharpen the distinction between citizens and PRs.”</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>One of its chief architects and proponents of a disastrous plan to boost Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people, Singapore’s octogenarian strongman Lee Kuan Yew has made an amazing U-turn yet again.</p>
              <p>In a speech made to Tanjong Pagar residents lately, Lee now said that Singapore citizens and PRs have received “very different treatment in government policies” and urged Singaporeans not to forget the “contributions” that foreigners have made to the economy.</p>
              <p>He tried to fend off criticisms that the government has backtracked on its immigration policy now by explaining that the inflow of foreigners was being moderated now and not earlier because “they were needed for the building of the two integrated resorts, which will create more jobs for Singaporeans, draw tourists and boost the economy.”</p>
              <p><em>“When you grumble about the workers, remember they do the heavy work for us. Without them, we would not be here.”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>However, besides blue collar workers, there is an increasing number of foreigners who are taking up jobs which can otherwise be filled by Singaporeans such as the PMETs.</p>
              <p>According to a Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore had depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s GDP growth in the last few years was fueled largely by the availability of cheap foreign labor which keeps business costs low, thereby inflating the growth figures artificially.</p>
              <p>A certain percentage of Singapore ministers’ multi-million dollar salary is pegged to GDP growth – the higher the growth, the more money they bring home.</p>
              <p>At the same time, Singapore’s income gap between the rich and the poor has widened considerably. It is quite obvious that the economic gains “contributed” by foreigners are not shared equally across the population – the rich has become richer while the poor has become poorer.</p>
              <p>Lee also called on Singaporeans to bear with the inconveniences or competition for space on buses, MRT trains, even in schools with foreigners as if the “the Government were to reduce the flow too much, the economy would slow and this would lead to property prices and incomes going down.”</p>
              <p><em>‘We always give preference to our own citizens,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>The ruling party appears to be completely clueless on how to lead Singapore in the next lap of development and is unwilling to wean off its perennial addiction to foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be hoodwinked by Lee’s latest “wayang” to pull a wool over their eyes again.</p>
              <p>Let us recall what he said in an interview with the National Geographic magazine only a few months ago:</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>He described the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
