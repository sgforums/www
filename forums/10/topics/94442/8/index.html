            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, why be a singaporean?<br>I used to be proud to be a singaporean, when compared to my neighbours the malaysian, we were considered more modern and advanced in economy... those were the innocent days when as a youth, I went around being proud of my "country" singapore.<br>But why be a singaporean?<br>Look at my present situation..why has my opinion changed and why do I feel sad to be a singaporean now? Why am I on the verge of breakdown... angry with the singapore goverment and all your stringent rulings...<br>Yes, why be a singaporean?<br><br>I am a single mother....my baby is turning 1 year old and I have no home to call my own....why?<br>I've turned for help to many organisations...even to my neighbourhood MP - PAP...but all my requests for a home has been rejected....why?<br>I have to work hard to earn enough money to provide for my baby, and as if that is not difficult enough for a single mother, I have to set aside money for renting a place to stay....why?<br>Mostly, I'm deeply offended my the reply letter I received from HDB.....<br>I quote:<br>"we wish to explain that the government's public housing policy is aimed at promoting family formation through marriages. To discourage unmarried parenthood, a single unmarried mother is therefore not eligible to buy/rent a HDB flat with the child born out of wedlock"<br>"As you are not officially married to your child's father, it is regretted that HDB is unable to accede to your request to buy/rent a flat with your child who was born out of wedlock"<br><br>Yes, why be a singaporean?<br>Yes, I am a single mother....but note that I am not an uneducated, 16-year old girl with a baby...I'm a woman reaching my 30s soon and marriage is not something you rush yourself into...not even if you have a baby.<br>Is the singapore government and HDB promoting family life or are they forcing young couples to get married to get a flat? I feel being cornered by the singapore rulings and regulations...am I to find just any man to marry so that I can get shelter? So I have to force myself into a marriage alliance that will definitely not last...that will end in divorce?<br><br>Yes, why be a singaporean.<br>I'm proud to be a single mother. The neighbours may talk...my relatives may whisper behind my back...but they are not feeding me and my baby. No one is supporting me...I stand on my own feet... I am strong. I will survive......But can I survive in singapore? I was fuming when I had to make a birth certificate for my baby...We are being discriminated by our own country...I am no longer proud to be a singaporean. I am not proud that my baby is a singaporean. I ignored all the whispers and gossip...but how can I ignore my country turning against me....the letter from HDB kept mentioning "child out of wedlock" .... so my baby is not human....my baby doesn't need a home? I feel like burning that letter but No...I must keep it for evidence to show....to explain to my baby that she must not be proud to be singaporean...to tell her that we cannot stay here forever...<br><br>Yes, why be a singaporean?<br>I'm smart....I have always excelled in my studies...I will give myself 5 years....I will migrate....singapore is not my home country....I have no benefits in being a singaporean....no reason to stay....Goodbye everyone....I know I'll do better elsewhere.....I will rather pay tax elsewhere.....I will rather spend my money elsewhere....But never to singapore who have rejected me and my baby.....NEVER.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The HDB's one size fits all approach to building and selling flats is the reason why they have such a big surplus of unsold flats now. Good for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> I still find it hard to understand why any Singaporean citizen should be denied the right to buy a HDB flat (singles, single parents etc). Friends from other countries always think I'm joking when I tell them about HDB polices, including things like eligibility to buy, HDB's control of the demographic profile(cannot have too many malays, too many indians, blah blah) in all HDB estates, the prices of HDB flats etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those unaffected or left untouched, they say Singapore is good. For those affected, they complain that Singapore is no good. That's human nature. Unless it affects us, we are usually blind or ignore anything else outside our problems.<br><br>I think overall Singapore is a good country. No country in this world can cater to all it's citizens. There are definitely flaws in the system but this is necessary. Parents treat each n every child differently due to their needs, character n age. We used to think that our parents are biased or practice favouritism but as I age, I realized the neccesity to do so. Everyone is different but to keep the whole place running, there must be a set of general rules to follow. Sometimes it works your way, sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>When we can see things from not thru our own eyes, but thru the eyes of necessity, maybe we'll understand why things are what they are. And if we can't, just enjoy the journey the best we can. We have so much good in Singapore yet we complain about just as much. We complain about the MRT, the price, the timing, the crowd, the construction or whatever. But if we didn't have the MRT, then we complain about how backward we are not to have one. Anyone can find a way to please everyone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>We gotta learn to accept our society as it is. Things we dislike or disagree can be approached in different ways. It's all in our mind. Once a teenager told me how tough his life was. I told him I understood how he felt but he refused to believe me. He said I had good friends n family n he had nothing. I have what I have today becos of how I choose to see things. Imagine a convict meeting Nelson Mandela for the 1st time n not knowing who he is. He sees Mandela n says that Mandela is having a good life while he himself is rotting away in prison. If Mandela told him that he went thru the same shit, I won't be surprised if the con doesn't believe.<br><br>Everyone faces society problems at any point of time in our life. Deal with it in the best way possible by 1st not fighting against it. Like water, it always becomes where it goes. A gentle river seems meek but many years of lapping against the strongest stone can stiil wear it away. IF WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE WAY THINGS ARE HERE, WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE WAY THINGS ARE ANYWHERE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is despicable rufree2live...you should scan and post the letter up on the WWW so the world realizes what single women in Singapore face -- a country that so recently shifted openly to promoting gay policies for the almighty buck -- can't see past gainfully employed mature women having a level housing platform when they choose a non-traditional lifestyle. It's not out-of-wedlock mothers they fear, it's the independence that springs forth from successful single mothers -- and they would rather squelch than support it. What they have stated in their letter probably breaches fundamental human right conventions -- if indeed Singapore is a signatory to any -- all that fluff about equality regardless of race, reglion, sex, etc....that's recited every day -- pure lipservice?<br><br>Democracy isn't about acceptance, it's about speaking out and getting groundswell support for change, and if you can't well that's still democracy in action. If you're prevented, discouraged or fearful of doing so, that's a different issue all together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What you say is true, dear origami, that for those unaffected, singapore seems a good country.... Remember that I was one of them once upon a time.... I was proud to be a singaporean too.<br><br>As humans, we are bound to feel unsatisfied with our life at many different stages of our lives... that helps us zero in on our dissatisfaction so that we can excel furthur my making changes to our lives....<br><br>As a country, having strict regulations maintains law and order for the country to prosper so it is true that the country will fail to please all its residents....<br><br>But note that I am not simply whimpering at the first sign of distress. I've approached for help at the beginning.... I had faith, I had the confidence that being a singaporean, I will be acknowledged for the need that has arised; a basic nessessity, a home.... I'm not begging for shelter... I am requesting for a home for which I am willing to buy at the normal price sold to everyone else... which I can do so under the regulations when I turn 35 in years to come, but for which I appeal to get sooner to provide a home for my child. I cannot understand why this is so difficult for the goverment to understand... and look at the number of empty flats around in singapore!!! It's not as if there's an excess demand... I'll say there's an excess supply and they are not releasing it to the people of singapore that are needy for it...<br><br>And thanx, unsung_hero, for your heartfelt message.... however, as per my lawyer's advice, if I were to post this on WWW, I would end up having unwanted trouble when the singapore government traces me and finds some means of shutting me up permanently.... what would happen to my baby then?<br><br>So anyway, for those claiming your undying love to singapore, I wish you luck that you will be taken care of here for I know that my baby and I have been forgotten....<br><br></div>
