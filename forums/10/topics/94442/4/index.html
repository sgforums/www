To me disciplinary problems = police case problems ....unless you talk about homework not done or act pai kia and teacher caught you for vulgar utterings...that's nothing.

Just feel  sorry for you that you actually think that you belong to the marginalised group (as evident by your implication of the words "regardless of this").  Anyone like me who has been to normal stream and tried to advance into positions, will find out that the past academic results will catch up with them in Singapore .

Social fabric has been torn apart because of differences in religion, politics and foreign influence. Family values have changed because of the different education your parents received and what you were taught, or not taught. Foreign influences coming into you living rooms and bed rooms directly via two boxes, yr TV and yr computer monitor. There is nothing we can do about it but to recognise it, face it, and think how can we handle it. Running away, don't be singaporean will not solve your problem.<br><br>What affect our job is globalization, including fund management which racked havoc to the financial systems in Asia in 1997. Few years ago, Nike moved all the shoes manufacturing to Indonesia, created jobs for thousands of indonesia who left their farms to work for a better living. After one year, or slightly more, Nike found Vietnam cheaper so the orders went to Vietnam, leaving 7000 indonesians out of job! could go back to farming because their farms had been left unattended for too long. They went on to the streets to demonstrate but what could the government do?<br><br>It is known that many IT jobs moved to India and the Philippines. Many MNC regional HQ moved from LA to HK then to singapore and now to Shanghai. What can we do?<br><br>European don't have it good because of the great influx of cheap labour from eastern europe and north africa. Ever heard of any angmoh expatriates who came here return home happily? Ever heard of angmoh who went for their summer vacation and return to office only to find out that they have been replaced? I tell you, there are plenty of cases like this. That is why today nobody talks about loyalty to your companies anymore.<br><br>Foreign fund managers came in to singapore and brought up the share prices and many singaporean followed. When they pulled out, the STI dropped like crazy and there goes our hard earned money. What can we do? don't invest in stock?<br><br>There is nothing we can do to all these! This damn situation was created by the american, the very one who claimed to be democratic and value human rights. To them those who have money to invest have the first right to the money the companies make; the workers who work for a living comes later. So if return of investment is not there, workers are retrenched. Unfortunately singaporean companies, even SIA and SATS follow. They announced making so much money, then announced retrenching so many workers to save so much money. There is a lot of hypocrisy in the American system!! True democracy or not I don't know but human rights is double standard<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> But what can we do?<br><br>The bosses first priority is to make profit, evil or not. Employing FT who are cheap but useless, or locals who are expansive but productive, is entirely up to them. That is why they are called Boss!! But what if the FT are cheap and productive or the locals are expansive and useless? Beware, there are billions of Chinese and Indians, not to mention Philippinos (who also speak good english), Taiwanese, Indonesian, Malaysian who are catching up fast!! The chinese says, "Bu Shi Men Long Bu Guo Jiang", which means you have to be a fierce dragon to swim across the river. These FT did not wait for their government to give them job in singapore, they swam across!!<br><br>If you are young, you can learn, you can go places. "Dong jia bu da da xi jia." i.e. if you don't work here you can work elsewhere. There may be short term setback but have faith in yourself, be hopeful, stay healthy, keep you debt low and manageable.

Personally, I love and think that the Japanese culture of encouraging creativity and innovation is one of the biggest reason for their success.</div>

I am very sure he is whole heartedly a Singaporean.<br><br>His point is that we, the original Singaporeans, has been cheated by the PAP government for betraying our intrinsic special benefits as citizens.<br><br>He is right.<br><br>Do you know that the PAP is increasing our population by emigration. The target is 8 million by 2008.<br><br>We are in danger of losing ourselves to foreigners and becoming second class in our own country.<br><br>PAP has betrayed us. Lim yew Hock may have sold Christmas Island. The PAP government has sold us to the new emigrants, foreigners and investors.<br><br>Let us petition the government to stop its emigration policy!<br><br>Your<br>Future Prime Minister<br><br>Relevation<br>True Blood Singaporean Loyalist.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I beseech Revelation to stop referring to himself as the "future prime minister". Your purility will get you nowhere, certainly not into parliament.<br><br>I left Singapore a couple of years back and I never looked back. Seriously. I am having the time of my life in this "foreign" land which I have grown to love. I hate being squeezed into little concrete boxes called HDB flats and living like a sardine. I can't stand the SS-like totalitarian bullying methods of the PAP. After I left Singapore, I really saw the flaws in the country.<br><br>For those of you who want to get out, I urge you to. The government no longer cares for you, so why bother to be "patriotic" to a country that has deserted you? Follow your dreams and migrate! You will be thankful that you did. Don't let the Singapore media fool you into thinking that Singapore is some utopia and that other countries pale in comparison. Ironically, I think the reverse is true. The quality of life, the freedom and the rights you can receive by staying out of Singapore is much better than working my butt off to pay for a tiny car and my HDB sardine house for the rest of my life, seeking enjoyment in cinema complexes, shopping centres and artificial beaches. My children will grow up in an elitist environment, blacklisted for failing some primary 3 exam and condemned to be a panel beater for the rest of their lives. You call this living??? Leave Singapore while you still can!</div>

I am sick of seeing my friends and acquaintances sidelined for far too long in society because they are dramatists, artists and poets; people who dare to think and ponder on the sorry state which we are in now.People whose lifestyle and attitudes piss off the ones that are in charge.Sure, it pisses them off grealty because these control freaks can't keep us dear lemmings from escaping the cage which supposed to be the best place for us, safe from the threats of creative destruction.Will someone enlighten me what the hell is creative thinking lessons?And what in God's name does anyone mean when they say you can do any project as long as we approve it?Over-regulation only chokes the blood vessels of the nation, and yeah it bleeds white over time.<br><br>I see old men working their asses off at hawker centers and fast food outlets, not because they are too bored to enjoy their golden lives, but by the stubborn refusal of certain people to realise that there are other ways to reduce the livi ng cost of the old and infirm.Have we become a South East Asian Maquiladora, merely a factory for MNCs to come in and not be subjected to a minimum wage?By passing the buck to another generation, is this securing a stable future for our children?I want and call for socially equitable FDI.Not wanton exploitation of the dreams of our children because we are told to study Subject A because Industry A is gonna bring in the bucks.And more often than not, the sugary sweet forecasts leave a bitter pill in the mouth for our young.<br><br>I want my Singapore to be a place where I can raise my children to be people who are not penalised in one way or another for being themselves, not be treated as units of produciton but as individuals with goals and worthy desires  which we must accord mutual respect.They must not come home and tell me that they are afraid of the police because Daddy is an opposition politician.Is this hard to acheive?We must grab the future we desire, no one will hand it to us on a silver platter.What I have said may sting, but it is the truth, whether you like it or not.The faster we as a society wake up and realise WTF is wrong here, the better.Time waits for no man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not want to be a Singaporean but I would rather be a PR. Being a PR is better, not so much liability. Anyway what has Singapore ever done for people on the lower rung like us. Nothing. Maybe got something. NS liability.<br><br>Only know how to tell us to "upgrade" and "accept" our lives. Even PM Abdullah from Malaysian know how to tell the farmers it is disgraceful to be contended with what you have and stay as a "HAPPY POOR" man.<br><br>If I get rich I will also leave this country for good. It has never done anything for me nor given me any chances at all. I'm sure that a lot of other young people on the lower rung has also realise we deserve a better fighting chance than this.<br><br>To put state before people is rubbish from my point of view. It only means the lower "value" people are expendable. When people are HAPPY and GET WHAT THEY WANT most of them will find a way to give or contribute back to the society. Not the other way round.<br><br>Singapore is a good country but it is not a good home! And a home is the place where my heart will be!</div>
