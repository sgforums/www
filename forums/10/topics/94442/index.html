            <div class='col-md body'><br>" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why be a Singaporean</span><br><br>In the light of the recent drive to attract foreign talent into Singapore's economy, the Singaporean is often neglected and not given the due respect he/she deserves. A simple glance at any application form will show that PRs and Singaporeans have near identical rights. Why be a Singaporean at all, when it comes with the chore of National Service and reservist duties?<br><br>The PRs can send their children to our local schools and pay the same low fee. The PRs can get education in our universities, paying the same fee as the citizen. Even foreigners signing up for Master's degree courses at NUS/NTU pay only a few hundred dollars more than Singaporeans.<br><br>Singapore does require the expertise of many foreigners, so making life expensive for them or blocking their path with red-tape is not advisable.<br><br>But the issue I want to put forth here is that Singaporeans should matter.<br><br>Why should being a Singaporean only give us a small discount or worse, no special rights and privileges over the PR? Take a look at the NTU website for Master's degree courses. For some 1-year courses, a foreigner needs only to pay S$400+ more than a Singaporean. A PR pays exactly the same fee as a Singaporean. Take a look at the websites of Australia universities. The foreigner (international student) will have to pay 100% or more than an Australian. In other words, in the tertiary education sector there, being an Australian citizen has definite advantages.<br><br>What are the privileges of a Singaporean student here? The issue of loyalty to the nation was highlighted recently in the Straits Times. Unless one has actually gone to war for Singapore, I don't feel that anyone has the right to condemn another Singaporean as unpatriotic. Such unpatriotic feelings come about for many reasons and most are quite valid.<br><br>How many men have felt angry that their lives are disrupted by reservist duties when their PR colleagues get to enjoy everything Singapore has to offer but without the sacrifice? How does a Singaporean man, aged 37, feel when he finds out that his 32-year-old Malaysian colleague, after being a PR for 10 years, gets a pink NRIC but need not serve any form of NS?<br><br>The former-Malaysian mountain climbers and soon-to-be trekkers to the North Pole, may claim that they are sacrificing their lives, jobs, time and money for Singapore. But nobody forced them to do it. No one threatened disciplinary action if they did not do it. They took it upon themselves to do all this.<br><br>National Service, on the other hand, is not a voluntary activity. We can't choose when we want to enlist and what we want to do for 2.5 years. Nor can we get a deferment of our reservist duties easily. We can't choose not to declare that we are leaving Singapore for more than 24 hours. Wives, mothers, girlfriends can't request to have their husbands, sons or boyfriends to be with them when the NS/reservist callup is due. These are the inconveniences and sacrifices that Singaporeans make. They alone should be enough to give Singapore citizens the right to have more privileges than the PR or foreigner. National Service is not a trivial matter, the government says. Therefore, shouldn't the citizen (male and female) who is affected by NS be given more significant and tangible benefits?<br><br>Singapore citizens can vote in the general elections but the PR can't. But how many Singaporeans actually had a chance to go to the ballot box in the last elections. After the machinations of the ruling party, many electoral zones had walkovers. So, if being able to vote is a privilege of the citizen, then citizenship becomes a farce.<br><br>I am not advocating that we should make PRs and foreigners pay much more for goods and services. But it is the Singaporean who must not be made to pay the same amount as the non-citizen. The difference must also be significant. I am not referring to regular shopping but for matters like education and applications for certain things. It may sound very simplistic as a way to make Singaporeans feel that they are appreciated. The government statisticians will shoot this suggestion down, I am sure. But I am also sure that attitudes towards being a Singaporean will become more positive if we can see that being born in Singapore and serving NS tangibly benefits us.<br><br>If the goverment laments that many Singaporeans are not patriotic, why not make a survey asking how many PRs will volunteer for NS (and reservist)? I am sure the percentage of Singaporeans who still love this country will be much higher than for that of PRs volunteering for NS. Let's face it, PRs only love Singapore for its money-making potential, peace, cleanliness, security. Take these factors away and the PR will have no qualms about abandoning the Lion City. Should a Singaporean man do likewise, he can be charged with desertion. So, let's ask ourselves again,"What do I actually get for being a Singaporean??"<br><br>suhai13"  (QUOTE)<br><br>What is the benefit and role of being a Singaporean?<br><br>Is it purely to work very hard in order to have our hard earned money taken away by Government in many different form of taxes and charges?<br><br>Without Singaporeans as their cash cows, our Government couldnt have achieve a present day high economy.  And progress  of our nation.<br><br>Inspite of that, are we treated like we deserved to be treated?<br><br>Is the Government grateful to it's citizens for providing a free flow of cash for  them to make more money overseas?<br><strong><br>I dont think so!</strong><br><br></div>

Well we r born by birth as Singaporeans as FireIce pointed out. Try to make the best out of the system to your expectations. If all else fails, you can always move to a place where the system is more to your liking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
