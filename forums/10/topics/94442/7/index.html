Furthermore PAP always recruit bright talents to join their party, thus gaining advantage over their opposition.<br><br>Think of it this way,we were raised in a way the government wants us to be, lawful-bidding citizens who aren't afraid to speak out,but afraid to take  political actions. There could be a lot of opposition parties if everyone takes action but not words, but unfortunately there aren't much, either because we are fearful of the law or simply not interested in politics.<br><br></div></blockquote>You're absolutely right, from what I've gather; most people are in fear of voting against PAP even if they are not happy with PAP.  Cos, Pap have this access to everyones' identity in the country.  They are worried of Pap make life difficult for them.<br><span class="large"><strong>In my whole life, I've have not seen a voting ticket.</strong></span><br><br>Accept the vote for Our respectful Mr President Ong Teng Cheong of Singapore.<br><br>I don't know what is lau lee and lau goh doing.</div>
