I am just an ordinary singaporean, mainstream or sidestream i don't know. Call me pro control if you like cause I like to control others, but don't try to control me. i am proud to be a singaporean because of who we are and what we are. I bei song only ni bei will scream, whether you are PAP or not. I don't know the difference between liberal democracy, western democracy, pseudo democracy or communitarian democracy. I know my grandfather ran away from china because of communism so i won't like communism. I know the government who provide shelters and food are good government.  Freedom to choose mean you must have a real choice. There are great democracy in america but what are the choices? Bush or Kerry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> same as in indonesia, Megawati and Bambang <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> what is the diff?<br><br>Back to the question, pls! <strong>Will you still love singapore if there is no democracy tomorrow?
