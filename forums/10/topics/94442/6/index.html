Japan will never recognise anyone of non ethnic japanese descent as citizens. Even 3rd gen koreans are refused citizenship. My aunt is married to a japanese but they refuse to give her citizenship. She and my uncle are basically discriminated in the japanese society because she is not japanese.</div>
