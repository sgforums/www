But given the current economy unless you got a degree GOD knows only when you get to land your 1st perm job. I never consider a temp job as a proper job. After that must work to scrap money to study.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll not die for a system that has made eunuchs out of her local-born citizens.Don't get me wrong, i'm pro-globalisation, but somehwere down the line, we must have affirmative action or else equality and attempted social equilibrium will go down the drain and incur greater future cost to our society.Our guys serve two years, supposedly to protect the nation and instil a sense of belonging in them, but when they step out and enter college or the workplace, they already find themselves lagging behind due to a lack of constant usage of the mind(believe me lah).Such morosity gets to them and they find it hard to be employed when a so-called FT comes in and snatches a job which there are countless locals which are eligible , qualified and bloody hell served their time for.By all means, give the FT the job if we cannot find a suitably qualified candidate, not let the lowest common denominator in.<br><br>IMHO, being engaged with the world at large means you choose from the best that they can offer and realise that our locals who possess skills not found elsewhere, will capitalise on that leverage and find their place under the sun.Wholesale import of foreigners who are essentially redundant skills-wise is a weak policy and a stupid one.Firms who face a labour cost problem should lobby the government to reduce infrastructure cost, which is pretty much inflated in my eyes.We should never cut back on the focus on the human, for they will enusre the route of our society.This is a very sad and hopeless place if this present trend continues.</div>

If s'pore falls, the ELITE can easily flee to other countries taking our CPF and national reserves with them n say tat WE ARE FIGHTING from overseas to regain s'pore. wat abt us in s'pore? we have to fight coz our CPF r with the ELITES parking in some other countries. if no fight, we die with no money coz the ELITES can say tat the CPF belongs to SINGAPOREAN but s'pore has fallen, so there is no more SINGAPOREAN. if fight, we still die but our children MIGHT get the money if we can regain s'pore.<br><br>there is no win-win situation but there is no much lose = at least i never lose much.</div>

But seriously, i think that sooner or later the NS will have to be reduced in importance.<br><br>Afterall, we have 1/4 of the population freeloading on the defense provided by our males and govt is still welcoming them. Maybe only in the civil service are males paid higher due to their NS stint, everywhere else they come into society later and are paid same wages. Somethimes they even suffer discrimmination in their workplace due to their reservist commitments.</div>
