If his attitude is poor though his studies is excellent, i wouldnt hire him at all. So it really depends on discipline. Applies to foreign also<br>The low starting pay is all taken up by all yr fellow indian mates so only left high pay job for singaporeans haaa....<br><br>Most of all i think ur intention is to tell ppl not to be a Singaporean...

They do not see the ugly side of unemployment and retrenchment that is going on in singapore. University fresh grad have resort to taking on odd unwanted jobs with low salary after paying so much for the HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED tertiary education because the FT win over their desired jobs. Highly paid Manager got retrenched and have to drive taxi around to feed his family and pay for the HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED inflated HDB flat that they leased for 99 years.</div>

Family values have changed because of the different education your parents received and what you were taught, or not taught. Foreign influences coming into you living rooms and bed rooms directly via two boxes, yr TV and yr computer monitor.

Few years ago, Nike moved all the shoes manufacturing to Indonesia, created jobs for thousands of indonesia who left their farms to work for a better living. After one year, or slightly more, Nike found Vietnam cheaper so the orders went to Vietnam, leaving 7000 indonesians out of job! could go back to farming because their farms had been left unattended for too long.

I tell you, there are plenty of cases like this. That is why today nobody talks about loyalty to your companies anymore.<br><br>Foreign fund managers came in to singapore and brought up the share prices and many singaporean followed.

To them those who have money to invest have the first right to the money the companies make; the workers who work for a living comes later. So if return of investment is not there, workers are retrenched. Unfortunately singaporean companies, even SIA and SATS follow. They announced making so much money, then announced retrenching so many workers to save so much money. There is a lot of hypocrisy in the American system!!
