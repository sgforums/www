We support the use of drug rehabilitation... to stop them offending in the first place."<br><br>The proposals come as the prison system in England and Wales is nearly full.<br><br>'Radical departure'<br><br>The Sentencing Advisory Panel is a government-appointed body which recommends sentencing changes to the Sentencing Guidelines Council.<br><br>Its report recognised that the "no jail" option would be a "radical departure" from the present practice.<br><br>"The most severe sentence for a standard offence of theft from a shop would be a high-level community order, even where an offender may have failed to comply with such an order in the past," it added.<br><br>Factors which could lead to a custodial sentence included using violence, operating in gangs, using children to commit the offence or targeting vulnerable victims.<br><br>A second option would allow jailing for a standard offence when committed by a "seriously persistent" offender.<br><br>Responses to the paper can be made up to 16 November, before the panel considers its final report.<br><br><strong>The BRC said the cost of the offence worked out as adding Â£1 on the weekly shopping for every household in the country.<br><br>"It is not a victimless crime," Mr Dodd said.<br></strong><br>'Visible work'<br><br>Shadow home affairs minister Edward Garnier called the panel's proposals "a significant softening" of the punishment for shoplifting.<br><br>And Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Hunter called for a "better system of public service sentences" for offences such as shoplifting such as litter-picking and cleaning up graffiti.<br><br>In 2004, 61,670 adults in England and Wales were sentenced for shoplifting, with about 21% of them jailed.<br><br>Since November 2004, police have been able to deal with shoplifting cases up to the value of Â£200 with on-the-spot fines. Just over 14,000 fines were issued in the first nine months of 2005.<br><br>It is not a victimless crime<br>British Retail Consortium<br><br>SENTENCING ADVISORY PANEL<br>An independent body which is required to consult widely on possible changes to sentencing.<br>The 15 members are appointed by the lord chancellor, in consultation with the home secretary and lord chief justice.<br>They include former judges, magistrates, academics, senior police officers and prison governors<br>Their recommendations are sent to the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which advises courts on sentencing<br></blockquote></div>
