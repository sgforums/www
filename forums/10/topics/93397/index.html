            <div class='col-md body'>Do you sympathize with reasons or human?<br><br>Let me list down certain facts.<br><br>1. My father lost his middle finger on his right hand 20 years ago in an accident at work which is the fault of the management. For that matter, it had caused many financial difficulties for my family even up till now. Due to his inability, he was unable to perform many tasks and was unemployed for a long duration. Does the company still have to pay up the difference for these twenty years even though it was paid for medically and he was given a small sum which amounts to nothing in recent years?<br><br>The answer is no. Times are different. You learn to adopt changes, not look back on past achievements.<br><br>2. The Sports Council is in charge of funding new talents. Let us look at it at their side of view. You're given a sum of money which is already insufficient and many expectations. Now someone ask you to pay a monthly salary to someone who achieved like two decades ago. He contributes basically nothing to the current system but acts only as a trophy of past glories. Is he worthy? The sports council locally could not even compete with China where there are hundreds living off the Government by playing the game everyday as they are recognised as talents. So tight is the budget that adding a freeloader is basically madness. Think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would agree that rather than harass him every 4 years and pretend to honour Mr Tan (I feel they are just using his name for publicity or what..), at least put the money where the mouth is. Honouring can be done not just by money, of course thats practical...but I think the least they can do is to dedicate something to him, like a statue, road or whatever lah....so that at least his efforts are not forgotten 40 yrs down the road...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this morning CLASS 95 was toking abt this issue...and it was said in year 2000, Mcdonalds asked Tan howe Liang that they will fulfil any wish he has. Tan said it is impossible. Macdonalds told him its ok just say it. He said he just wanted to be in the Olympics just one more time before he dies. Macdonalds sent him to Sydney that very year.<br><br>It was also said that since our very rich SSC or SOC has set aside 1 million dollars for a gold medal, 500000 for a silver and 250000 for a bronze and no one has won the prize yet, surely they can find it in their heart to present a sum of it to Tan, it is definitely not to much to ask.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the 1st phase of Singapore Nation Building, between 1965 and 1992, the main policies were:<br><br>(1) Meritocracy<br><br>(2) Governmental Efficiency,<br><br>(3) Education,<br><br>(4) Industrialization,<br><br>(5) Controls and Regulations to ensure law and order,<br><br>Arts, Cultures, Welfare, Community bonding, Openness, Accountability, Creativity, Teamwork, Entrepreneurship, Sports etc did not seem to fit in with the above-mentioned main policies.<br><br>Today, there is a realization that sports, arts and cultures, welfare, community bonding, youth participation in nation building, entrepreneurship etc  are just as important.<br><br>Tan How Liang the only Singapore gold medalist was not recognized because under that kind of policies there was no point given to sport excellence.<br><br>So, how do we promote sports, community bonding or entrepreneurship?<br><br>Mass participation and practical knowledge should be emphasised in schools and works to reverse the overriding impact of these past policies. But past policies were still emphasised by various ministers.<br><br>We have an educated workforce today with many over-educated people but not enough entrepreneurs to give them jobs.<br><br>We are still harping on importance of talents and foreign talents. How about local talents? Can those local talents be duly recognized first before trying to promote foreign talents?<br><br>Is it true that we still must rely on all these past government policies bent on attracting more foreign workers in order to do well. Proofs must be produced before continuing with all past assumptions of any kind to avoid making of so many mistakes just to justify past policies on jobs and investments.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

We cannot afford in the past when our economy was bad, but what is $1k a onth from the whole country nowadays. Not even enough to feed a hand of a high rank Civil servant. For your analogy of the insurance thing, too common and too many cases to be compare to the one and only case for the only medalist in our nation. We are not even back paying Mr Tan How Liang, just compensating him when we can afford to. Monthly allowance for him and object of recognition like statue at National stadium and naming the gym after him, can we have all that please... for our only Olympian winning the Sliver Medal.</div>
