              <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/logo/uawlocal592.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="145" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.uaw592.org/">United Aeropsace Workers Local 592</a>,
              a trade union based in Illinois, USA recently contacted the Singapore
              Democrats and conducted an interview with Mr Gandhi Ambalam, Chairman.
              The interview touched mainly on the political situation in Singapore
              and how it exploits workers here. <br><br>Below is the write-up and text of the interview by Timothy Mills:
              <br>Given the loss of 533,000 American jobs in November, the largest
              downturn in thirty-four years, it is vital that we have a public
              discourse on the cost of free trade and its twin – runaway corporations.<br><br>In
              a free trade advocate’s view, the global marketplace is an idyllic
              universe of decision makers where everyone is free to buy and sell. In
              actuality, the exchange between the great masses of humanity and a
              transnational corporation is neither free nor fair. Does free trade
              mean that companies can do what they want, no matter the circumstances?<br><br>Take the city-state of Singapore. It has been hailed by business executives as one of free trade’s success stories.<br><br>The
              whole truth, however, is quite different. As an employee of Hamilton
              Sundstrand, I learned about the down side of such a success story as I
              watched machinery and good jobs being uprooted in Rockford, destined
              for Singapore.<br><br>Some folks may still be asking, “Why are
              companies with long histories in our community, such as Sundstrand, so
              attracted to Singapore?” Here are a couple of reasons:<strong><br><br>#1</strong> In 2003, the governments of the United States and Singapore signed the
              U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. The agreement gave the green light
              to corporations seeking to benefit from great disparities between the
              two nations, such as living and environmental standards, as well as
              human rights. <a href="http://ctrc.sice.oas.org/Trade/USA-Singapore/USSSingaporetext.pdf">http://ctrc.sice.oas.org/Trade/USA-Singapore/USSSingaporetext.pdf</a><br><br>Corporations
              setting up shop in Singapore may hire from a pool of immigrants who
              come from poverty-stricken south Asia. Approximately 600 thousand
              foreign workers are employed, representing thirty percent of the
              nation’s total workforce. For these workers, employment in Singapore
              symbolizes an opportunity to send money back home to their families.<br><br>In
              a letter sent to Congress, the Citizen’s Trade Campaign warned that the
              proposed trade deals between U.S.-Singapore and U.S.-Chile would
              undermine labor and environmental protections:<br><br>“…the remedies
              provided for the only enforceable labor and environmental provision in
              the agreement are fines capped at levels insufficient to serve as
              deterrents. Additionally, any fines assessed for labor violations are
              paid by the violating country back to itself, rather than to the
              complainant, amounting to nothing more than a budgetary transfer.<br><br>“Further,
              the only enforceable labor and environmental provision in either pact
              is that countries enforce their own existing standards - meaning that
              Singapore and Chile are free to maintain labor laws that do not meet
              the core ILO [International Labor Organization] standards, or can
              eliminate or weaken existing domestic labor and environmental laws in
              order to attract investment or trade with no threat of fines or
              sanctions.” <a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/singapore.php">http://www.citizenstrade.org/singapore.php</a><strong><br><br>#2</strong> Singapore is a one-party corporate state. The People’s Action Party has
              been in power since 1959. That’s no accident. I call it a corporate
              state because government and business are joined at the hip. And that’s
              no democracy…<br><br>"I’m often accused of interfering in the private
              lives of citizens. Yet, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn’t
              be here today." - Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister, Singapore<br><br>In
              a November 26 ’08 press release, Reporters Without Borders, a free
              speech advocacy group, denounced the recent Singapore court ruling
              against Wall Street Journal Asia which will cost it 25 thousand
              Singapore dollars: “…for publishing two editorials and a letter by an
              opposition leader questioning the country's judicial system… Even if
              the fine is not colossal, the ruling very clearly shows that
              Singapore's judges have no intention of letting the foreign media
              express themselves freely…”<em><br><br>The Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ), a staunch free trade advocate, has been critical of the
              Singapore government’s use of a “contempt of court” citation against
              the publisher of the WSJ Asian edition. The Journal has also criticized
              the Singapore judicial system.<br><br>According to the WSJ, “Singapore
              leaders have won damages in the past from foreign media groups when
              they report on local politics, including the <em>Economist</em>, the <em>International Herald Tribune</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em> <em>News</em>.”<br><br>However,
              not many individuals or organizations have the necessary resources
              (such as the WSJ) to mount a strong defense of their rights. Foreign
              journalists may feel stifled by a meddling regime, but at least they
              can purchase a ticket home.<br><br>So what happens to the citizens of
              Singapore when they speak out against the government? The following are
              abridged responses from a Q&amp;A session with Chairman Gandhi Ambalam
              of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).<br></p>
              <blockquote><strong>Q: How would you compare the extent of civil liberties in Singapore to the USA? </strong><br><br>For
              civil liberties to exist, first there has to be a functioning
              democracy. What we have in Singapore is not a democratic government,
              but an authoritarian regime that does not believe in letting the
              citizens have their basic rights. Rights such as freedom of speech,
              freedom of assembly and freedom of expression are enshrined in
              Singapore’s written constitution. But they remain only on paper. In
              reality, these universal rights are curtailed by “laws” introduced by
              the one-party controlled legislature to “safeguard national security
              and public order”.<br><br>[Police] move in to arrest protesters for
              staging simple acts of peaceful demonstration to register their
              displeasure over increased cost of living. Public rallies and protests
              are not allowed for fear of it turning into “racial and religious”
              riots that the city state had seen in the 1950s/60s.<br><br><strong>Q:
              How does the ruling party use “libel,” “slander,” or “defamation” law
              suits to regulate or punish opposition groups such as the SDP?</strong><br><br>The
              ruling party leaders, in particular the octogenarian Lee Kuan Yew use
              the libel laws liberally to silence the political opposition,
              especially during election time. Dr Chee Soon Juan, the
              secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) has been sued
              repeatedly for “defamation” and is made a bankrupt twice over, unable
              to contest elections and prevented from leaving the country. The SDP’s
              future itself remains in doubt following a recent awarding of hefty
              damages by the court to Mr. Lee and his prime minister son Lee Hsien
              Loong over an article in its newspaper, published during the run-up to
              the 2006 general elections. If the party is unable to pay the damages,
              its fate could be sealed through winding up proceedings by its
              creditors, Mr. Lee Sr. and the prime minister.<br><br><strong>Q: What’s it like to be a member of an opposition political party in Singapore? </strong><br><br>It’s
              like living in former dictator Suharto’s Indonesia. Our leading members
              are aware that they are under constant surveillance by the secret
              police. Their telephones are tapped and overseas visits tagged by the
              immigration authorities. To avoid any scandal, opposition political
              party members have to maintain constant vigilance and make sure that
              there are no “skeletons” in their cupboard.<br><br><strong>Q: What would happen if you wanted to put a political program on TV or the internet? </strong><br><br>Both
              the print and electronic media are totally controlled by the ruling
              party. The state-owned and controlled TV is yet to interview any of our
              SDP leaders, let alone “put on a political program”! The Internet, even
              though the authoritarian regime is grappling with the idea of
              controlling it, still remains outside its grip. But how long this will
              last is anybody’s guess.<br><br><strong>Q: What would happen if you wanted to publish political literature in the newspapers? </strong><br><br>[All
              of] the 14 “newspapers” in the four official languages are controlled
              and headed by a former deputy prime minister. A number of known former
              secret service operatives work as reporters and journalists.<br><br><strong>Q: What is the relationship between foreign capital and your government? </strong><br><br>Singapore
              is a haven for foreign capital. Big businesses, especially the ones
              from the US, Germany and Japan are given red carpet welcome with
              generous tax incentives and other perks. Western companies love to
              locate their regional operations here and the expatriates’ first choice
              in Southeast Asia is, not surprisingly, Singapore.<br><br><strong>Q: It’s my opinion that Big Business is too “cozy” with your government and mine.  How would you respond to that comment?</strong><br><br>I
              don’t know much about the “coziness” that exists in your country
              between big business and your government. But in Singapore, the
              government has turned the place into a “playground” for the rich.<br><br><strong>Q: Are workers in Singapore aware of the trend that U.S. companies are moving operations to south Asia? </strong><br><br>Our
              workers are too busy slogging for a living to know about US companies
              moving to south Asia. But what they know is since the time Singapore
              became independent in 1965, US companies, especially the
              labour-intensive ones looking for cheap labour, have been migrating to
              this island state and lately relocating to other parts of the region,
              including south Asia, in search of still lower-wage workers. This
              phenomenon is not something new to the workers here who are constantly
              reminded that without foreign capital and [multinational corporations]
              their jobs are in peril. The workers are conditioned to always lower
              their expectations in this globalized world where competition is
              intense.<strong><br><br>Q: What can the trade unions (or other
              organizations) in the United States and Singapore do to prevent global
              corporations from pitting workers against each other for jobs?</strong><br><br>The
              SDP tried in the past to help some workers wanting to form independent
              trade unions, but to no avail. The archaic Trade Unions Act, the
              Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act, all of which were
              introduced in the late 1960s and are still in force, make it impossible
              for workers to organize themselves away from the [Singapore’s]
              government-controlled National Trades Union Congress. Under this
              environment, there’s hardly any awareness about “pitting workers
              against each other for jobs”. The awareness has to come from the US and
              we in the SDP would continue with our struggle to free our workers from
              the clutches of the authoritarian regime in Singapore. Since
              corporations have gone global, workers too need to go global.<br><br>Although
              the free traders insist that there is no better way to keep afloat the
              ship, we do have an alternative. If democracy is to survive this
              century, it is imperative that we stand up for a fair global economy -–
              a system based upon freedom and social justice for workers of all
              nations. We can draw up this new plan and make it a reality if we have
              the resolve to do so. </blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1615-us-trade-union-interviews-sdps-ambalam">http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/</a><br></blockquote>
