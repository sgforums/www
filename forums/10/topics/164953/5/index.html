Jail or fine? Which is fine? What kind of Â“firm actionÂ” should MINDEF take against Â“those who do not fulfil their dutyÂ”? Although Melvyn chose not to procreate in Singapore, Â“firm actionÂ” can still be taken.<br><br>Well, Â“it is hearteningÂ” to know that MINDEF will review those Â“firm actionsÂ” amidst public Â“firmÂ” reactions. These perennial Â“reviewsÂ” are probably a product of SingaporeÂ’s understanding of human nature: the pointing finger of the public will go limp in a few months, when the focus is turned to other arousing activities. That will be the time when Â“Mindef will give a full response on the matterÂ”, but of course,  Â“when the review is completedÂ” and when Quitter Melvyn has staged enough concerts to acquire a $5000 rebate. The Enlistment Act will, in the mean time, allow fortunate sods to pay their way out of NS liabilities (in which case we have to address their genealogies). At the same time, this Â“ActÂ” will put a few lower class citizens behind bars as a warning to those who are planning NS evasion.<br><br>If you must procreate in Singapore, and the fetus happens to have an Y chromosome, parturition must be performed in other countries. This is to allow the Â“Enlistment ActÂ” to institute Â“firm actionsÂ”. In the meantime, as law-abiding citizens of Singapore, let us stand up for Singapore.<br></div>

This would be a blow to the cause of classical music here.<br><br>Lim Boon Hee<br></div>
