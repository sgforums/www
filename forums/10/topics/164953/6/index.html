            <div class='col-md body'>Good news for NS defaulters!<br>Tougher penalties for NS evaders? Defence Minister says enlistment laws are being reviewed<br><br>Friday • December 2, 2005<br><br>Zul Othman<br>zul@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>FOR those who knowingly evade National Service (NS), the Ministry of Defence is looking at tougher penalties.<br><br>This was revealed by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hian yesterday, while he commented on the case of Singapore-born pianist Melvyn Tan, who evaded NS and left Singapore nearly 30 years ago to pursue his studies at Britain's Royal College of Music.<br><br>Tan then became a British citizen in 1978 and found fame as a classical pianist.<br><br>Last month, it was reported that Tan — returning to Singapore to give a series of concerts at The Esplanade and be a jury member in a national piano and violin contest — was slapped with a $3,000 fine for dodging the draft compulsory for all Singaporean and permanent resident males between 16 and 40 years old.<br><br>This sparked off an intense debate on whether Tan had been let off too lightly.<br><br>Under the Enlistment Act, Tan could have been fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to three years, or both.<br><br>While Minister Teo was heartened by the strong support Singaporeans had shown towards NS, he added moves were afoot to review the existing enlistment laws.<br><br>Said Mr Teo: "We will ask for stricter penalties for people who deliberately and knowingly evade National Service.<br><br>"In the case of Melvyn Tan, the way that he was dealt with is exactly the same as the way that other people in similar circumstances were dealt with, both by Mindef and by the Courts."<br><br>Without going into the details of the planned changes, Mr Teo said the ministry was looking at imposing "custodial sentences for those who deliberately and knowingly evade NS".<br><br>"I think it's very important we send a strong signal that NS is an obligation, which they should fulfil," he said.<br><br>"But ultimately, the important thing is not the penalties, but that Singaporeans see the need for NS and the importance NS plays in preserving the peace and security."<br><br>When asked if Tan got off lightly, Minister Teo said: "This is something for the Courts to decide. The Courts have to decide this in relation to other cases which they have seen.<br><br>"From my personal point of view, as Defence Minister, I would like to see firm sentences in cases like this."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This case doesnt seem so much to be about the 5K or whether Melvin served NS or not. Melvin who? there could be 1001 other special cases. for example, the ns issue was brought up when a stupid-mouth female scholar commented that boys who went through ns ended up more a whiner and even suggestions to propose that girls should serve ns if they knew so much and take everything for granted,e.g. that they could further study and advance their careers well before other guys who sacrificed their precious years or if natioanl sport stars could be exempted if they brought fame to the country etc.<br><br>The core of the issue is those who have been through it knows it sucks. and that many are beginning to question its role in today's society. is the sacrifice worth it? especially in the Singapore context where other pressures of global competition, sustainability and bread and butter issues begin to creep in and affect the individuals in more ways and closer to home.<br><br>Yes, national defence is important, and only when some disaster or war strikes will people realize its importance and feel engaged. however, the 911 terrorist attacks on US shows that even a super power, however advanced in might and prepared as they are, are susceptible. so, do we view defence as a chore, a sickening obligation that you should just 'saf'? or should it be positioned in a more strategic and involved way for all? so the fear is no matter how much you put in, it may all be futile. some view the pride we have in our preparedness like a parade of toy soldiers. all this is good for morale only within the circumference of the tiny red dot, but reality is often a different picture. what is more important is ns should be not only part of the male singaporean's life, but that of every citizen. it should engage and educate people in a more positive way than being a dread. for one thing, if the national 'service' is such a chore, inflexibility and making the process rigid only encourage abuse and prevents genuine commitment. if people realized its importance, only then would a volunteer and committed mindset be in place. why stage a protest and attack on a pianist when the real problem is not with that individual, but a collective issue with the system? could we have just considered him like another of those hundreds of rich foregieners who took up PR because they got the so called skills and money to come here? Or are we just angry at ourselves and feel good at punishing others so we can live better? it is a multi faceted issue we are looking and so we should shed that kampong mindset. not just 2.5 years or that getting a break-down analysis of the 5 K peanuts. that is being practical in an impractical way.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lionnoisy:</div><div class="quote_body">STimes 01.12.2005 reported his bond of $30,000 was forfeited 30 years ago.<br><br>Is it a 3 rm flat costed 10,000 to 15,000 30 years ago?<br><br>If so,his parents lost 300,000 in today value.<br><br>What  u can bought 30 yrs ago for $30,000?<br><br>Pl check for me. </div></blockquote></div>

Defence Minister says enlistment laws are being reviewed<br><br>Friday • December 2, 2005<br><br>Zul Othman<br>zul@newstoday.com.sg<br><br><span style="color: red;">FOR those who knowingly evade National Service (NS), the Ministry of Defence is looking at tougher penalties.</span><br><br>This was revealed by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hian yesterday, while he commented on the case of Singapore-born pianist Melvyn Tan, who evaded NS and left Singapore nearly 30 years ago to pursue his studies at Britain's Royal College of Music.<br><br>Tan then became a British citizen in 1978 and found fame as a classical pianist.<br><br>Last month, it was reported that Tan — returning to Singapore to give a series of concerts at The Esplanade and be a jury member in a national piano and violin contest — was slapped with a $3,000 fine for dodging the draft compulsory for all Singaporean and permanent resident males between 16 and 40 years old.<br><br>This sparked off an intense debate on whether Tan had been let off too lightly.<br><br>Under the Enlistment Act, Tan could have been fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to three years, or both.<br><br>While Minister Teo was heartened by the strong support Singaporeans had shown towards NS, he added moves were afoot to review the existing enlistment laws.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Said Mr Teo: "We will ask for stricter penalties for people who deliberately and knowingly evade National Service.</span><br><br>"In the case of Melvyn Tan, the way that he was dealt with is exactly the same as the way that other people in similar circumstances were dealt with, both by Mindef and by the Courts."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Without going into the details of the planned changes, Mr Teo said the ministry was looking at imposing "custodial sentences for those who deliberately and knowingly evade NS".</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">"I think it's very important we send a strong signal that NS is an obligation, which they should fulfil," he said.</span><br><br>"But ultimately, the important thing is not the penalties, but that Singaporeans see the need for NS and the importance NS plays in preserving the peace and security."<br><br>When asked if Tan got off lightly, Minister Teo said: "This is something for the Courts to decide. The Courts have to decide this in relation to other cases which they have seen.<br><br>"From my personal point of view, as Defence Minister, I would like to see firm sentences in cases like this."</blockquote>Good move.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
