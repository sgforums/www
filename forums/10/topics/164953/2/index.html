            <div class='col-md body'>The ministers know this is a hot potato to handle...all of them are taking cover now. That colonel in the SAF essentially washed his hands off, saying that they had dealt with him by charging him...it's up to the court to sentence him...nothing to do with SAF.<br><br>The responsibility now falls to the AG Chambers....why did the Public Prosecutor not appeal against the sentence? We all know how keen the DPP is with pressing for a harsh sentence to send a stern warning against others who might commit a similar crime.<br><br>But not in this case, involving an elite.....I suspect the mastermind who told the judge not to impose a custodial sentence also instructed the DPP not to appeal...<br><br>I wish there is an MP I can ask to raise this issue in Parliament...but whilst I have been communicating with the MP in my constituency here in the UK, I don't even know who is my MP in Singapore now, since my constituency changes in every election. The fact is, I got to vote my UK MP as a citizen of the British Commonwealth, but I have never got to vote my MP in Singapore, since it's walkover each time...<br><br></div>
