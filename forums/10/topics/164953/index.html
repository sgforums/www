In any case, it is poor taste to invite a <strong>convicted criminal </strong>to be a judge at such an event. Are there no suitable judges for a music event in Singapore?<br><br>On top of that, the papers had reported that he had written to the authorities before his return. The reason why he had not returned all these years has been the fear of imprisonment. Yet he dares to return now....it is too much of a coincidence that the court chose not to hand out a custodial sentence.<br><br>The entire episode smells far too fishy to be above board...<br><br>As Gordon Hewart, Lord Chief Justice once said, "...justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done".<br><br>I cannot see it and neither can thousands of Singaporeans....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW you may not agree with Robert Teh's point of views. But you must notice by now that he engages you like a gentleman with no name calling or mud slinging. That does not mean he is scared or his views are weaken.<br><br>For your info, Robert was here for a very long time. Check previous postings.<br><br>I am sure he doesn't want to boost this. I also doesn't want to say until now. I read once about his views being sorted by The Straits Times in The Straits Times.<br></div>
