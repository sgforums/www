              <p>alamak, why so angry leh?? only a discussion mah, haiz, singaporeans, so stoopid one, alway angry for nothing. And also, alway aim at the wrong thing...never aim high one.</p>
              <p>The collective agreement is for Public sector lah, the agreement specified that Bonuses and Pay increment must tight with real GDP growth, that is the KPI that they must work on and strive to excel on it. The Public sector unions such as the amlgamated union of the public employees, HDB staff unions, all GLC employees unions, ministers and all other civil servant's together agreed on this formula of taking GDP as the benchmark of their performances.</p>
              <p>Cool now leh...little bit thing only want to scold people liao. How to talk??</p>
              <p>As i said before, Shareholders can opt to remove the CEOs, citizens as stakeholders of this country can also opt to remove the govt, but so far, nothing happen leh. So, it gives them a mandate to executive their executive orders for the sake of Singapore, singapore people can be stupid, but certainly not a fool, if things dun go well, they know who to vote for, but if oppositions are those lousy lousy type, kind of 1 good and 10 lousy type, we also got no choice. Just like when i send my car for servicing, going to agent is very expensive, outside shops is more cheaper, but i see outside those ah seng and ah kow way of working, i hv doubt in their skill and experiences, so i still take on the agent, tho it can burn a hole in my Versace Bag, but you got guarantee and also feel more comfortable. YOu understand!!! stay calm and cool ok. Scolding and talking big dun win you anything.</p>

              <p>First of all the collective agreement were basically signed by milliondollar club house.</p>
              <p>There are no unions in the Singapore publics servants as such there was no negociation within the statutory vs the Singapore Publics Servants board that could represent all publics servants.</p>
              <p>The salary was more of a handdown to the civil service ....At the lower end there are no voice.</p>
              <p>Because there is no civil servant union to negociate....So what public sector are you referring to?</p>

              lky is just too scared of any viable opposition and making up excuses in the name of stability. While he curbs Singaporeans' civil liberties he can say anything he wants through the media which he controls even criticizing Singaporeans which rights he violates by restraints. For lky liberty all men are made into slavery. Lky is the Singapore's thug! Make no mistake about it. He's a thug and more than that. 
              
              I have no qualms about a monarchy as long as the country admits that it is one. Singapore is a sad story of systematic fraud.

              <p>First of all the collective agreement were basically signed by milliondollar club house.</p>
              <p>There are no unions in the Singapore publics servants as such there was no negociation within the statutory vs the Singapore Publics Servants board that could represent all publics servants.</p>
              <p>The salary was more of a handdown to the civil service ....At the lower end there are no voice.</p>
              <p>Because there is no civil servant union to negociate....So what public sector are you referring to?</p>
