              <p>herzog,</p>
              <p>why wanna build those stuff like nuclear fission?besides a kid from usa did it once at home in his basement.</p>
              <p>hey herzog...just cuz the industries yu have been in are those cock types and phasing out type of process.</p>
              <p>they have production lines in spore thats able to produce $1 billiion / year in a space half a football field.all with robots and process all that dont require human intervention.all doing production.all assembling faster and better than china or any human alive every day!in that kinda production line which have been in existence for decades.....no humans ever needed except for loading of materials and random QC checks.....they are way faster than any human in production....and they are way cheaper as u dun need to pay robots salary. SO WE ALREADY HAVE IT IN THE PAST.....WE ARE ALREADY FASTER,BETTER AND CHEAPER!WHAT U WANT??GET RID OF THE ROBOTS AND REPLACE THEM WITH SLOWER HUMAN FOREIGNERS?</p>
              <p>thing is you dont even often see this in the USA where it was designed and manufactured so if u have werked in a cock production line that needs plenty human intervention then...........well....at least ya have a job that pays the bills....</p>
              <p>but if u insists to get a robot to design a nuclear fission or fusion for u, i can design it for you once i do the uranium  refinement  process properly...but do ya have that kinda cash??.but why do u need to do nuclear when theres wind power or wave powered?</p>
              <p>they arent interested in wanting to do a faster,cheaper and better job kinda story....its the cpf contributions from the 6 million people..they already have faster ,cheaper and better production lines in spore donkey years ago!</p>

              <p><br>if he earns 3 millions before he lost 1 million due to unforeseen circumstances beyong his ability to react, i can still pardon him. And certainly i will raise his pay if he performed well this year, because at the end of the day, i employed him, so i am responsible for what he did and will try my best to standby him. Just like when we voted the Govt and they won, we must trust them, support them if not, we are going against both our moral value as a voter and also the consituitional laws of Singapore that give them the mandate to make decision for the Republic of Singapore.

              <p>hey herzog...just cuz the industries yu have been in are those cock types and phasing out type of process.</p>
              <p>they have production lines in spore thats able to produce $1 billiion / year in a space half a football field.all with robots and process all that dont require human intervention.all doing production.all assembling faster and better than china or any human alive every day!in that kinda production line which have been in existence for decades.....no humans ever needed except for loading of materials and random QC checks.....they are way faster than any human in production....and they are way cheaper as u dun need to pay robots salary. SO WE ALREADY HAVE IT IN THE PAST.....WE ARE ALREADY FASTER,BETTER AND CHEAPER!WHAT U WANT??GET RID OF THE ROBOTS AND REPLACE THEM WITH SLOWER HUMAN FOREIGNERS?</p>
              <p>thing is you dont even often see this in the USA where it was designed and manufactured so if u have werked in a cock production line that needs plenty human intervention then...........well....at least ya have a job that pays the bills....</p>
              <p>but if u insists to get a robot to design a nuclear fission or fusion for u, i can design it for you once i do the uranium  refinement  process properly...but do ya have that kinda cash??.but why do u need to do nuclear when theres wind power or wave powered?</p>
              <p>they arent interested in wanting to do a faster,cheaper and better job kinda story....its the cpf contributions from the 6 million people..they already have faster ,cheaper and better production lines in spore donkey years ago!</p>

              <p>The collective agreement already justified that when GDP goes up in an export orientation economy like us, it mean that profit increased, therefore we judge it as well done, and when you done well, you should be rewarded, that is the rule of the game.</p>
              <p>As i said before, our govt being so flexible that they are able to cut 20% of their paid during the deep financial crisis, took the lead in encouraging many management to cut thier pay, so now a bit of few percentage increase just to get an even out, which certainly not an increase if you consider the 20% cut earlier.
