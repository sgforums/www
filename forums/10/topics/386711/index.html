              <p>The salaries of Singapore’s multi-millionaire ministers look set to be revised upwards in 2010 with Singapore’s economy growing again.</p>
              <p>In his New Year message to Singaporeans, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore’s economy is likely to grow between 3 and 5 per cent next year.</p>
              <p>Describing 2009 as a “volatile year” for the economy, PM Lee said:</p>
              <p><em>“Considering the anxious moments at the depth of the crisis, our subsequent recovery is something to take heart from……Next year we are expecting 3-5 per cent growth.”</em></p>
              <p>PM Lee also urged Singapore workers to ‘up-skill, re-skill and multi-skill,’ adding: ‘They must be flexible, willing to adapt to changed conditions, and take on new jobs as conditions change.’</p>
              <p>The variable component of Singapore ministers’ pay are pegged to the nation’s economy. They took a pay cut of up to 20 per cent this year as a result of the sluggish economy.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s ministers are the highest paid in the world. The annual salary of PM Lee is about $SGD 3 million dollars, or 5 times more than that of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>Even his father, the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew who admitted that he is “not doing much work except doing forecasting”, received a higher pay than Obama.</p>
              <p>The elder Lee boasted unashamedly that he would earn “much more” in the private sector.</p>
              <p>At 86 years of age, Lee rakes in more than $200,000 a month. In contrast, the median pay of the average Singapore worker is only $2,600.</p>
              <p>The obscene salaries of Singapore’s ministers is a constant source of unhappiness among the populace.</p>
              <p>After winning the 2006 general election, the ruling party increased the pay of its ministers by more than 50 per cent to bring it “more in line” with the private sector.</p>
              <p>With the next election likely to be held in 2010, Singaporeans must think twice before giving PM Lee and his team another “mandate” to “reward” themselves with another fat pay cheque.</p>

              <p><strong>Topic: [Public Sector Salary Increase] Good, clean govt costs more?</strong></p>
              <p>So what's your view on the pending pay increase of civic servants? After a pay freeze of quite a good number of years, is the upward adjustment justified? <br><br>Singapore's edge over others: Good, clean govt <br>So it's crucial to ensure competitive pay, says minister <br>By Sue-Ann Chia <br>Mar 28, 2007 <br>The Straits Times <br><br>SINGAPORE has an asset that gives it a competitive edge over almost every country in the world, said Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean. <br>The asset: good, clean government. <br><br>Mr Teo highlighted this advantage yesterday when he explained why it was necessary to ensure that salaries of ministers and civil servants are competitive so that Singapore continues to have a good government. <br><br>Mr Teo, who is also Minister-in-charge of the civil service, acknowledged that the subject was difficult to explain to Singaporeans. However, he is confident that most people in Singapore would want a good government. <br><br>'I would ask that we pause and think what it is that will be required to ensure that we continue to have a good government. Not just for today but to put in a system that enables us to have good government for many more years to come. <br><br>'It is, of course, a debate which people will have many views on,' he told reporters after a dialogue with about 200 community leaders of Pasir Ris following the recent Budget debate. <br><br>The leaders had quizzed him about Workfare and the package to offset the July hike in the goods and services tax. They also indicated that more could be done to help the middle-income and senior citizens stretch their dollar. <br><br>In raising the issue of ministerial salaries with the group, Mr Teowas referring to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's announcement last Thursday that public sector pay is lagging behind the private sector. <br><br>The salary of ministers and top civil servants is pegged at two-thirds the median of the top eight earners in each of six professions. This would work out to an annual pay package of $2.2 million. However, the current pay of ministers and the top mandarins is $1.2 million. <br><br>An announcement of their salary revision is expected to be made by Mr Teo in Parliament on April 9. <br><br>Last night, he declined to disclose by how much the salaries will rise. But he had this message for Singaporeans if they want to ensure that the country has good government in the future. 'That', he said, 'depends on getting good people to come into government and making sure that we pay them reasonably well. <br><br>'If we don't do that, in the long term, the government system will slowly crumble and collapse...corruption will set in and we will become like many other countries and face the problems that many other countries face.' <br><br>In urging Singaporeans to think about the key issues for maintaining good governance in the future, he said: 'Having a good government is really one of the key advantages that we have in Singapore, and one of the few assets and resources that we have. <br><br>'It has taken many years to build this up and it is a key part of our competitiveness. <br><br>'And it is also a key reason why we are able to provide good services for Singaporeans - health care, water supply, good education for their children - and we want to be able to continue to maintain a good system in government.'</p>

              <p>besides, being part of the government is a privilege, we do not need high wages to beg "talents" to form part of the government. there are many more able people who want to be part of the government and are willing to accept much llower pays.</p>
