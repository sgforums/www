              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From our Correspondent</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A letter to the Straits Times Forum by a Canadian Permanent Resident (PR) exhorting Singaporeans to be grateful for what they got has brought on a torrent of online vibes and sneers from Singaporeans. It attracted over 60 comments by 6pm, with more than half of them disagreeing with his views.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Entitled “Be grateful, S’pore”, Eric Brooks began his letter with the following sentence: “I am writing to share many things Singaporeans take for granted”, (read full letter </span><a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4284"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">) before going on to make comparisons between Singapore and his homeland Canada.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Below is a point by point rebuttal of the content of his letter by a netizen, Rointan1:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Eric Brooks,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My very first question is why dn’t you give up your Canadian citizenship and take up S’pore citizenship?? That would be the litmus test as to whether you really believe that S’pore is a “great” place to live!!!!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Anyways, let’s look at what you claimed:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1) <strong>“Now, with its economy rebounding at a 20 per cent rate this last quarter, </strong><strong>Singapore</strong><strong> has recovered from the collapse faster than any other country.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you aware that S’pore is the FIRST Asian country to go into recession?? Do you also know that S’pore suffered the worst decline in GDP globally??</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2) <strong>“….. </strong><strong>Toronto</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>Canada</strong><strong>, has its rubbish collected only once a week, yet it is considered one of </strong><strong>North America</strong><strong>’s cleaner cities.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you comparing apples with apples? S’pore is a tiny red dot whereas Toronta or North America land mass size is many many times S’pore’s. Also, rubbish are collected daily at all developed Asian cities (eg. Tokyo, HK, S.South, Taipei). At any rate, we pay for such service. Sure it may costs less here, but the wages in America are significantly higher than in S’pore (after tax basis).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3) <strong>“Most buildings in the </strong><strong>US</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Canada</strong><strong> have no sheltered walkways to protect residents from rain or snow, unlike most HDB blocks.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That is becos we don’t own HDB flats….we only lease the the flats from govt. The “buildings” you mentioned are obviously privately owned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4) <strong>“If a poor person lives in a building without a lift in the </strong><strong>US</strong><strong> or </strong><strong>Canada</strong><strong>, that is his tough luck. In </strong><strong>Singapore</strong><strong>, the Government is upgrading our four-storey HDB blocks with a new staircase and a wheelchair-friendly lift that stops at every floor.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That is is call vote buying!!! And such “upgrading” is not free. It is also due to the poor foresight of HDB in failing to notice an ageing population earlier. Above all, these are govt properies (see point above).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5)<strong> “If a poor person cannot afford to pay his mortgage in the </strong><strong>US</strong><strong> or </strong><strong>Canada</strong><strong>, he can be turfed out and left homeless. If an HDB dweller cannot pay his mortgage after he loses his job, he can seek a moratorium on payments from his community development council.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That’s where your ignorance is so telling. You obviously don’t know of people being forced to downgrade or got kicked out of HDB flats!!<br>Also, what about the generous social security you enjoy in Canada?? There is very little social security in S’pore. You won’t die of starvation, but you will live a very miserable life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6) <strong>“After living and working in six countries, I have known for a long time that no country takes care of its people the way </strong><strong>Singapore</strong><strong>.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have also lived in a number of countries and I find S’pore sorely lacking in many areas. So?? What are you waiting for? Take up S’pore citizenship. Oh, you will miss your family in Canada?? Then ask them to take up S’pore citizenship. Come come.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>On </em><em>31st July 2009</em><em>, a Canadian PR Eric Brooks wrote a letter to the Straits Times exhorting Singaporeans to be “grateful” to the government. (Read his letter </em></span><a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4284"><em><span style="text-decoration: none; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></em></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>) His letter brought a well-thought response from another Canadian and ex-Singapore citizen Wing Lee Cheong, which was not published by the Straits Times. The letter was first published on The Online Citizen on </em><em>6 August 2009</em><em>.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Dear Editor,</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As a fellow Canadian I am embarrassed by Mr Eric Brooks’ remarks to Singaporeans. Mr. Brooks is a visitor with a superficial knowledge of Singapore history. He should refrain from making such ridiculous sweeping statements.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was born shortly after the Second World War and raised in Singapore before immigrating to Canada. I have worked and lived in more countries than Mr Brooks. There is no doubt that most Singaporeans deeply appreciate the outstanding work done by the Singapore leaders in bringing the country from third world status to the present world class status. However, gratitude evolves with time and social changes. Singaporeans are now better educated. They travel, see, learn, compare and adapt. Singaporeans are not stupid or naive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Singaporeans now have a higher level of thinking and are more demanding. This demonstrates progress. Higher aspirations, greater expectations come with evolving progressive social changes. A society that remains complacent and stagnant deteriorates and eventually collapses.  No country can excel with a mindless society of puppets. The Singapore government should be grateful that its citizens are matured and not treat anyone with opposing views as public enemy. Most of them are as passionate as the government in making Singapore a better society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Singaporeans are smart enough to see through spins and propaganda and evaluate the truths for themselves. It is difficult for most Singaporeans to remain silent whilst  government leaders lecture them to be thrifty, not to be materialistic and not to demand for higher pay. On the other hand, the leaders reward themselves with pay packages that exceed the leaders’ of the eight richest countries in the world combined.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Singapore ministers’ argument that their pay package is only a small fraction of the country’s GDP is weak and debatable. The Canadian prime minister draws less than 10 per cent that of the Singapore prime minister’s but he governs a country 15,000 times the size of Singapore, with a population that is eight times larger and with a GDP that is ten times more. Vancouver in Canada is constantly voted the best place to live in the world. This example put the Singapore government’s argument out of context.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The government gives S$360 a month as financial support for the poor and needy. If such an amount is computed by the government as enough to survive, why then do they need to pay themselves by millions?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I cordially invite any member of parliament and/or news media reporter to come and stay with me for a period of time and I will show them that it takes only a small tiny fraction of their salaries to live happily and healthily in a beautiful environment with a  good standard of living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Is it a surprise that Singaporeans are discontented? It is just human nature. Confucius was quoted as telling the emperor on good government:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“How can the emperor be happy when the people have nothing? How can the emperor not be happy when the people have everything?”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Does Mr. Brooks know that 79% of Singapore students after studying overseas do not return to Singapore? Are they not grateful too?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So Mr. Brooks, before you further make a fool of yourself in Singapore, be grateful to Canada and not complain because of a temporary disruption in garbage collection in Toronto. Be thankful of the good healthcare system and the generous old age pension. If you truly like Singapore you should be a citizen. There are lots of Singaporeans who are willing to trade your citizenship if it is possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yours truly,</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Wing Lee Cheong</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span class="time">July 31, 2009</span> by </span><a title="Posts by admin" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/author/admin/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">admin</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">   <br>Filed under </span><a title="View all posts in Top News" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/category/top-story/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">Top News</span></span></a></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From our Correspondent</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A letter to the Straits Times Forum by a Canadian Permanent Resident (PR) exhorting Singaporeans to be grateful for what they got has brought on a torrent of online vibes and sneers from Singaporeans. It attracted over 60 comments by 6pm, with more than half of them disagreeing with his views.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Entitled “Be grateful, S’pore”, Eric Brooks began his letter with the following sentence: “I am writing to share many things Singaporeans take for granted”, (read full letter </span><a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4284"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">) before going on to make comparisons between Singapore and his homeland Canada.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Brooks quoted the examples of the rubbish being cleared daily, the sheltered walkways at HDB flats, the ongoing upgrading of old estates and the transport services to highlight his point that Singaporeans are blessed with a good government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He ended with a resounding appraisal for Singapore:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“After living and working in six countries, I have known for a long time that no country takes care of its people the way Singapore does.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Unfortunately, Eric’s open appeal to Singaporeans to be more appreciative of their government doesn’t seem to strike a chord with them. On the contrary, it has triggered a flood of invectives against him with some lampooning him for being “brainwashed” by the ruling party to utter rubbish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">lunxiaomei wrote:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Hullo Eric, but the heck did PAPa gave you? Come here to live and see for yourself. It is all rubbish you uttered.”</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Added iwbroke:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“This shows how shallow this new comer know about </em><em>singapore</em><em> or he has attended too many brain wishing function.”</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Some felt that Eric’s knowledge of Singapore is “shallow”:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mon_Veneris wrote:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“Only those foreigners who are rich enough can live in Sg. Look around and youll see how poor most s’poreans are are? More than 35% of our population do not have more tha $5000/- cash in their account at any time. Poor financial management? S’pore has very little space for us to make money. Getting employed now is a challenge. You got to fight it out with the FTs. Look the sad old uncle and aunties languising at the HDB void deck. Previously they are happily employed as cleaners. Now they kicked out by these healthy and young cheap labour from </em><em>China</em><em>. It too long a list to go on.</em></span><em><br><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Those sinfully paid ministers and top civil servants are do nothing to address this issue.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Wrote Moremann:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Eric, do you know we are the heaviest taxed peopled in the world, albeit indirectly.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Terencemail opined that Eric cannot claim to know Singapore well as he was here only for a few years:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“Eric not only has a shallow knowledge of Singapore, he also has a shallow knowledge of </em><em>Canada</em><em> and the rest of the world!</em></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">People should only comment about the state and politics of places they have really lived in for more than 10 years (not even if you’ve studied overseas for 3, 4, 5 or even 8 years!).

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>Most of the expats who have been posted to </em><em>Singapore</em><em> for a few years can hardly claim to truly know </em><em>Singapore</em><em>.”</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Others challenged him to give up his Canadian citizenship for a Singapore one if he is so enamored with Singapore:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Frankiestein minced no word in issuing the challenge:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Eric Eric, what makes you think you have the right to tell us Singaporeans and mind you true blue born and bred in Singapore Singaporean what we should be grateful about? Why don’t you give up your Canadian citizenship and come over take up shitizenshit here and experience for yourselves what being a Singaporean is like. All the more since you seems to admire the governance here. Then you can for once feels what it is like to be “screwed” left right center on a daily basis and have your life savings “snatched” away with the knowledge that you will only be paid a monthly sum till death and your money do you part. But such payouts are not guarantee in event of the annuity becoming insolvent….yeah that is real reassuring from the government.”</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Judging from the comments posted so far, it does appear that the majority of Singaporeans are deeply dissatisfied and unhappy with the way the country is being run.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is both an irony and a shame that such a letter was written by a PR and not a true blue Singapore citizen. Are Singaporeans really taking the government for granted?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perhaps the only way for Mr Eric Brooks to find out the truth is to renounce his Canadian citizenship and become a Singapore citizen himself.</span></p>

              <p>Sigh...if there is something we can do to improve Singapore, it would be to reduce the salaries of the ministers and members of parliament by half. At least. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From our
                                Correspondent</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A letter to the
                                Straits Times Forum by a Canadian Permanent Resident (PR) exhorting
                                Singaporeans to be grateful for what they got has brought on a
                                torrent of online vibes and sneers from Singaporeans. It attracted
                                over 60 comments by 6pm, with more than half of them disagreeing
                                with his views.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Entitled “Be
                                grateful, S’pore”, Eric Brooks began his letter with the following
                                sentence: “I am writing to share many things Singaporeans take
                                for granted”, (read full letter</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4284"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">)
                                before going on to make comparisons between Singapore and his
                                homeland Canada.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Below is a point by
                                point rebuttal of the content of his letter by a netizen,
                                Rointan1:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Eric
                                Brooks,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My very first
                                question is why dn’t you give up your Canadian citizenship and take
                                up S’pore citizenship?? That would be the litmus test as to whether
                                you really believe that S’pore is a “great” place to
                                live!!!!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Anyways, let’s look
                                at what you claimed:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1) <strong>“Now,
                                with its economy rebounding at a 20 per cent rate this last
                                quarter,</strong> <strong>Singapore</strong> <strong>has recovered
                                from the collapse faster than any other
                                country.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you aware that
                                S’pore is the FIRST Asian country to go into recession?? Do you
                                also know that S’pore suffered the worst decline in GDP
                                globally??</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2)
                                <strong>“…..</strong> <strong>Toronto</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Canada</strong><strong>, has its rubbish collected only
                                once a week, yet it is considered one of</strong> <strong>North
                                America</strong><strong>’s cleaner cities.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you comparing
                                apples with apples? S’pore is a tiny red dot whereas Toronta or
                                North America land mass size is many many times S’pore’s. Also,
                                rubbish are collected daily at all developed Asian cities (eg.
                                Tokyo, HK, S.South, Taipei). At any rate, we pay for such service.
                                Sure it may costs less here, but the wages in America are
                                significantly higher than in S’pore (after tax basis).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3) <strong>“Most
                                buildings in the</strong> <strong>US</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Canada</strong> <strong>have no sheltered walkways to
                                protect residents from rain or snow, unlike most HDB
                                blocks.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That is becos we
                                don’t own HDB flats….we only lease the the flats from govt. The
                                “buildings” you mentioned are obviously privately owned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4) <strong>“If a
                                poor person lives in a building without a lift in the</strong> <strong>US</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Canada</strong><strong>, that is his tough luck.
                                In</strong> <strong>Singapore</strong><strong>, the Government is
                                upgrading our four-storey HDB blocks with a new staircase and a
                                wheelchair-friendly lift that stops at every
                                floor.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That is is call vote
                                buying!!! And such “upgrading” is not free. It is also due to the
                                poor foresight of HDB in failing to notice an ageing population
                                earlier. Above all, these are govt properies (see point
                                above).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5) <strong>“If a
                                poor person cannot afford to pay his mortgage in the</strong> <strong>US</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Canada</strong><strong>, he can be turfed out and left
                                homeless. If an HDB dweller cannot pay his mortgage after he loses
                                his job, he can seek a moratorium on payments from his community
                                development council.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That’s where your
                                ignorance is so telling. You obviously don’t know of people being
                                forced to downgrade or got kicked out of HDB flats!!<br> Also, what about the generous social security you enjoy in Canada??
                                There is very little social security in S’pore. You won’t die of
                                starvation, but you will live a very miserable life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6) <strong>“After
                                living and working in six countries, I have known for a long time
                                that no country takes care of its people the way</strong> <strong>Singapore</strong><strong>.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have also lived in
                                a number of countries and I find S’pore sorely lacking in many
                                areas. So?? What are you waiting for? Take up S’pore citizenship.
                                Oh, you will miss your family in Canada?? Then ask them to take up
                                S’pore citizenship. Come come.</span></p>

              Myanmar and Singapore are the two worst ASEAN countries. At least the first is true without selling a false facade while the latter is a fraud.

              <p><strong>Andrew Loh</strong> / Contribution from <strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/GratefulA.jpg"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/grateful580250.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="250"></a></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;">Click to enlarge / Straits Times, 31 July 2009</div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p>Mr Eric J Brooks is a happy man – happy with how Singapore is. In his letter to the Straits Times Forum Page on 31July, his effusive praise for the Singapore government is unabashed. “After living and working in six countries, I have known for a long time that no country takes care of its people the way Singapore does,” he writes.</p>
              <p>Mr Brooks is a Canadian, according to the Straits Times letter’s heading, “A Canadian writes – Be grateful, Singapore”.</p>
              <p>Coming on the heels of the recent Temasek Holdings fiasco of Charles Goodyear’s premature departure and revelation of hefty losses, Mr Brooks’ praises of the government somehow ring hollow. Referring to Singapore’s economy which, he said, “has recovered from the collapse faster than any other country”, he lauded Singapore’s “years of good economic management.”</p>
              <p>He went on to compare his native Canada with Singapore – from public housing to rubbish collection, from sheltered walkways to service and conservancy fees. Singapore comes out tops in all these areas, as far as Mr Brooks is concerned.</p>
              <p>One would take Mr Brooks’ words with a pinch of salt – especially when in the same Straits Times edition of 31 July where his letter was published, this headline appeared on page three:</p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/SIA580250.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="250"></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;">Straits Times, 31 July 2009</div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p>And followed by this on the front page of the Home section of the same day:</p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/TouristsA.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="250"></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;">Straits Times, 31 July 2009</div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p>Evidently, Singapore has not “recovered from the collapse”, as Mr Brooks mistakenly claims. In fact, government ministers have repeatedly warned against assuming this. “It’s too early to tell” is a common and regular refrain from ministers.</p>
              <p>We do not know how well Mr Brooks knows Singapore or Singaporean life. We also do not know how long he has lived here – if he is living here at all. His letter does not say. Perhaps Mr Brooks should not dwell too much on the superficial, such as covered walkways or rubbish collection, but look deeper at the real issues.</p>
              <p>Here are a few he should ponder on:</p>
              <p>- 750,000 people don’t have any kind of medical insurance.</p>
              <p>- 116,600 unemployed (resident unemployment rate of 6%) without any unemployment benefits.</p>
              <p>- Only 3,000 people qualify for Public Assistance of $360 a month.</p>
              <p>- Elderly working for $600 a month as cleaners with only 2 days off a month.</p>
              <p>- Elderly collecting used aluminium drink cans and used cardboard boxes for $1.30 and $0.40 per kilogram respectively.</p>
              <p>- One of the highest public transport fares to bottom 10% income ratio in the world.</p>
              <p>- Bottom 10% of employed households have per capita monthly income of only $360.</p>
              <p>- 417,000 roll-over their credit card debts – one of the highest in the world.</p>
              <p>- One of the highest public housing price-to-median income ratio in the world.</p>
              <p>- 40% have less than $40,000 in their CPF at age 55, and average only have $60,000+, when the CPF Minimum Sum is now $117,000.</p>
              <p>- Highest ministers’ pay to average income ratio in the world.</p>
              <p>- HDB visited 60,000 HDB flat-dwellers last year who had difficulty paying their mortgages.</p>
              <p>- In the United States, typically when you default on your home mortgage, you just lose your home. In Singapore, you may lose your home, life CPF savings and may be made bankrupt too.</p>
              <p>Finally, Mr Brooks should note that it was only about four months ago that a survey by life insurer AXA found that Singaporeans were the least optimistic about the future among citizens of eight Asian countries. This was reported by <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/419658/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Channelnewsasia</span></span></a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Angela Lau, head, Branding &amp; Communications, AXA Life Insurance Singapore, said: “They’re not so confident about their health and career, and how they are going to cope with the challenges in life. For the career perspective, they are actually very concerned about job security.</em><em>”</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>On reflection, Mr Brooks’ letter is not a surprise, given that National Day is around the corner and our “nation-building” Straits Times is up to its old tricks again.</p>
              <p>Mr Brooks’ letter occupies prime space in today’s forum page – right at the top with that big bold headline exhorting Singaporeans to “be grateful”, from a foreigner no less.</p>
              <p><em></em></p>

              <p>And eric does not know that the efficiency of rubbish collection comes at the price of the life of the rubbish collector who works for a meagres pay and has to do lot more things than those of Canada. Canadians complain about service efficiency , but i rather have poor service than someone poor and uneducated exploited for hard labour.</p>
              <p>Eric, what happened to your christian principles? Are u a reject from your own christian community who believes in humanitarian values? It is because of your christian principles that Canada is still home to many migrants from all over the world. U are a shame to all christians. The poor in your country are treated equally and taken care of. Your country Canada is a much developed country than singapore in terms of social values. Your canadian govt is the one who really takes care of its people, be it rich or poor. Your govt believes in the fair go and ensures that there is no class divide in society. Be proud of Canada, I am, what about u. Gladly, pay your taxes and be happy that yr money goes to help the poor and underprivileged in Canada. When u are old over there, your govt takes care of u . and most importantly your country withits policies try to prevent what  we call economic terrorism, the most dangerous form of anarchy an aspect widely rampant in singapore.Economic Terrorism, and not holding such terrorists accountable, has an end result of anarchy as people are taught it is acceptable to commit crimes without repercussion to ensure personal survival at the expense of others, irrespective of the rules and society's morals (degradation of an orderly society's morals through sinful means such as greed).

              <p>Let me tell u something, Eric. Stop complaining about something as simple as rubbish collection and try to look at the world in a much broader scope.it is obvious that u cannot appreciate the generous social security you enjoy in Canada??. Is something superficial such as rubbish collection  so important to u , u spoilt brat?</p>
              <p>Singapore is a magnate to Rich and unscrupulous people who want to evade tax in western-euro nations and i am afraid u are one of them. And fyi, Singapore tax is one of the highest in the world per capita income. It is direct tax under the guise of indirect. Suicides and divorces ratios high for per capital population. Any fool like Eric who thinks tax is low in singapore is just deluding himself</p>
              <p>And fyi, there are no poor people in Canada, even those unemployed get a generous social security package but in singapore there are lots of them . look around u.</p>
              <p>Eric u can hide in yr luxurious home and stay ignorant. But once those who are protecting u fall because the poor revolted , thats the end of u.  It is also the reason  yr chrisitian country keeps everyone substantially richer and distributing income and wealth.  The emperor guarantees his throne when his people are happy and contented.

              <p>Never bring one's religion into equation when doing this.</p>
              <p>Yes, Canadian governments are willing to take care of 'em, but are you willing to put up with the racial abuse by those canadians?</p>

              <p><br>If one is a willing resident or citizen of Canada - should one not be expected to accept all that comes with the package ?</p>
              <p>If religion is not part of the equation, what possibly should be considered to make any kind of harmonious blend as the final product ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that Eric Brooks must have been employed to start a debate, in the similar way that a Swiss reporter was invited to write his opinion on the standard of rescue during the Singapore Cable Car disaster in the 1980s, and comparing it with similar cable car rescue as happened in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Would the Swiss have tolerated the rescue to take place almost 9 hours after the incident was reported, with the entire rescue operation given as a live mission to an untested Brigadier-General LHL to head all the civil and military efforts.</p>
              <p>The 9 hours of waiting was a result of the indecisiveness and dithering into some of the most spectacular suggestions to rescue the remaining survivors left in the cable cars hanging on one wheel on the cable, while at the same time "dry runs" were instituted to satisfy the "Baby God" that it will be feasible.</p>
              <p>What would be the purpose of this Eric Brooks contributions, if it was not suppose to call up the gratitude of Singapore to an over-glorifed Government ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it had ignited the awareness from all sides of the political divide, to the condescending tone of Eric Brook's opinion piece, and which one can see as back firing on those who had invited his opinion.</p>
