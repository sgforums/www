            <div class='col-md body'>see thats the point i've been tryin to make wif.<br>most rational debaters here would agree its alright to have your own views even tho it might seem a little extreme. but kyo23 goes about debating wif these negative views, which is ok, except that he laces it wif so much sarcasm that he blatantly announce that he find all those who disagree wif him as stupid ignorant folk who dont know better. well, my question is, izzit the majority who is blind, or izzit he the onli one who is blind? he draws far more flak than support for his comments i dont understand how he can still go on claiming blatantly he's the one who knows how things are and all the people who disagree wif him are ignorant fools.<br>dats why i stopped debating wif him, his comments angered me a lot but i realised he's just the minority of our fellow citizens who do not share our views. disagreeing is fine as long as first u show respect for the other person's views, then you can expect the others to respect yours.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

Not saying that it's impossible to change, but if you have so much complain to the extend of a need to 'overhaul' the system, something must be damn wrong.<br><br>Anyway, i believe for the younger generation, especially for those who've studied abroad, there is a tendancy for them to leave a country and settle elsewhere. And i the point to put across is that even when one is not in one's homeland, doesn't mean he's not patriotic. Just that he probably needs another kind of lifestyle that can't be found in his homeland.<br><br></div>
