And that you're the only "normal" one, and u got picked for that.  I don't understand how that can be the case.<br><br>Is discipline really a big problem with the SAF nowadays? Are the Officers really that incapable?<br><br>IF thats the case? Why are these officers made officers?  Just because they got an A' level cert?  Because they can become a uni-grad?  Do these officers WANT to be officers in the first place?  Personally, I would like to believe that officers are the men that will motivate, and lead the men into battle, people who know what they are doing, and not just what the physics textbook is talking about.  I don't care if my officer is just an O' level grad or wat, as long as he can be an example to his men, and understand that all his men are precious.

You might be the one who will initiate a war on singapore just like some big mouth talking without brain accusing indonesia without evidence. So you are any bigshot in singapore since you are in some formation to be talking like that?? SAF officer bigshot?<br><br>Since when singaporean became more expensive when we are labelled 2nd class citizen BY the government? The government want more foreign talent and hence that's what you see swarming around on the street and office building. Shotgun, go check out the market instead of tokking like a frog in the well, and be enlightened that not everyone who want to stay in singapore need to go thru those NS shit. They can simply come in easily with their degree cert and work as professional, being a PR or even taking up citizenship finally without the need to waste 2.5 years of their youth and run thru 13 years lifecycle of ICT without disrupting their job like local guy and hence affecting the company's business. So in the commercial sense, yes we are considered more expensive than those cheap foreign talent who can do the job better and longer hour than us. But in the NS sense, we are just needed for cheap labour to help defend singapore. In political sense, we are hopeless. So are we still considered expensive anymore in your sense i like to ask. Or are we simply expensive just because we are facing population crisis, having less male to be used as cheap labour by the government?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 27 February 2002).]</div>

Can't they think of retiring elsewhere while treating singapore as a working place to earn off bigbuck? Don be so naive.

            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo23, just as you are entitled to your view, I believe I am entitled to mine. Too bad you don't agree with me, but then I don't give a hoot about that. What you went through in SAF is your own problem. I went through the same thing and I enjoyed it. In fact, I am signing on again as a regular. I am not stopping them from coming to singapore, I am just saying that they should get out. True the govt will protect these anti-SAF people but then again, govt rely on SAF personnel to do so and "accidents" do happen in time of war. When did I say that foreigners should stay here forever? Maybe you should get your facts right before you accuse me of saying that. Lastly, it is true that I ain't no big shot, but neither are you.<br><br>Your idea of quality time means studying and earning big bucks. That reflects what a selfish nature you have. If you don't like the country and refuse to serve and protect it, then leave. I am sure singapore can do without such a selfish person like you.<br><br>I might not have your "level" of education and probably won't earn shitload of money like you perceive you would. But there is one thing I have, a country which I can proudly call home and protect.</div>
