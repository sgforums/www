If you are willing to pay cleaners and maids like S$2000 per month, I am sure many low skilled Singaporeans take up the job.<br><br>BUT, then again, Singaporeans will ofcourse start to complain that cost of living is too high to even survive on S$2000 per month.<br><br>IMO this is a LPPL question.  </div></blockquote>Hi Love Supreme,<br><br>Maybe you're right, if the salary like maids will be $2000/m there will be some low skilled locals will take the job but the question is are this locals will last on their job responsibility, maybe 2-3 months their gone... you just see your children in the street running around because your local maid don't like your wife nagging most everyday.... soda lari...you don't have control on them because they are local you don't hold their passport.... so how..<br><br>pls.. clarify what is "IMO/LPPL i'm not good short cut.. thnks.</div>

DO we have a CONSCIENCE AT ALL????</div>
