              <p>Okay everyone this is a thread asking for opinion. Name one advanced country that you think is in a good position to buffer the global crisis. No need to tell why but you are of course allowed to explain your opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I go first: Israel.</p>
              <p>I know the stocks are falling too in Israel but I think they will be able to come out of the crisis pretty well. At least better than most other advanced countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which country do you think is best prepared to withstand the global crisis? Russia? India?</p>
              <p>Perhaps we could even make a poll in the end to see which country ranked most voted.</p>
              <p>One forumers one nation. otherwise the poll would be meaningless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I try to check this thread as often as I can(I have to reject Bhutan I assume the poster wasn't being serious)</p>
              <p>Poll:</p>
              <p>Israel: 1</p>
              <p>China: 1</p>
              <p>United Arab Emirate: 1</p>
              <p>Australia: 1</p>
              <p>Malaysia: 1</p>
              <p>Thailand: 1</p>
              <p>(I put Thailand in because somebody mentioned it? Besides the king of Thailand is the richest man on the planet lol)</p>
              <p>Iran: 1</p>
              <p>(Well I agreed to put Iran in because I think it does have a huge reserve of oil though it may  not be considered a developed country yet). Though you have to realize the the price of oil is dropping substantially from over US140 each barrel down to less than US$50 per barrel.</p>
              <p>Singapore: 1</p>
              <p>At the moment there is no one single country which we could agree able to buffer much of the global crisis or pretty well able to buffer itself from its effects.</p>

              <p>China, because i think its leaders have a realistic idea of the problem. it can also rely on domestic consumption to tide over the crisis.</p>
              <p>India relies too heavily on exports while Russia is dependant on high oil prices to fuel its economy.</p>

              <p><br>they are advanced in their decomposition...</p>
              <p>btw.. "advanced" is a weird thing.. for a country to be "advanced" in the flawed economics being taught by the world, the country is considered strong and progressive if they can consume at a faster rate than anyone else...</p>
              <p>so.. what is the world trying to do to get itself out of the rut?</p>
              <p>the idiot economists are saying "china has to consume more" and "we must spend our way out of this rut"</p>
              <p>how the hell did the world get into this rut in the first place? it was through reckless and indiscriminate consumption...</p>
              <p>which "advanced" country can weather this best? if they keep going like they are going now, none.. because we are at the stage where it looks like we're past the stage where the world can sustain the population... yet every single government is telling us to increase the population...</p>

              <p>China, because i think its leaders have a realistic idea of
              the problem. it can also rely on domestic consumption to tide over

              <p>India relies too heavily on exports while Russia is dependant on

              <p>Eh? China's domestic market is pathetic in size and consumption compared to the US or Europe. A lot of major Chinese companies there overestimated the short term demand and now are short on credit as well.</p>

              <p>Granted, they won't be enjoying the same kind of growth they had but what i understand from what the TS is asking is whether it can withstand the economic crisis.</p>
              <p>But the general impression i get from talking with my Chinese colleagues and surfing their news websites is that they have a pretty decent understanding of the stituation and are dealing with it.</p>
              <p>The recent Mumbai attacks have also affected investors' confidence in India and that would affect India's ability to withstand the crisis.</p>
              <p>So overall yea, i think China's in a better position to survive the stituation.</p>

              <p>funny, i was just talking about this with a neighbour this afternoon, about how life is still shitty for the poor with or without the crisis. they're living hand to mouth anyway. its only those who found themselves unable to spend on luxuries that were more affected.</p>
