Its one of the few things that separates a PR from a Citizen.<br>2. Its one of the things you get to enjoy compared to non-citizens. Why I say enjoy is because some people feel proud to serve and thus they enjoy.<br><br>3. Let new immigrants have chance to also enjoy NS.  This wonderful thing must be shared. We must not deprive them.<br><br>4. After spending time and energy in NS, you get to compete with foreigners who did not serve NS. That is your advantage. You got NS they no gawd NS.  Also, you get the chance to prove you can climb faster on corporate ladder and earn money faster despite slight delay starting career.<br><br>See, all the many wonderful reasons to keep NS.  I hope all your sons get the chance to enjoy NS.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reasons for NS are more than reasonable. It is the only practical way to have a defence force.<br><br>The problem why many feel that it is a form of slavery in disguise is because of two things. The lack of a clearly defined threat and the way it is run.<br><br>My korean friends also have to serve NS. But for them, their family treats it as an honour. They tell me they don't look forward to it, but they understand the importance. It does help somewhat that their dear neighbours are run by a madman with nuclear arms.<br><br>But this is not to say that as long as there is an importance and clearly defined threat, the people will willingly serve. I have plenty of Taiwanese friends whose parents send them away from Taiwan for long periods of time just so they don't have to serve. I have a friend whose been away for about 7 years without seeing his parents.<br><br>Also, the way that NS is run has caused lots of discontent among those who have been through it. The majority of regulars treat NSFs as cheap labour and most of those in command positions just plain can't lead.<br><br>Sometimes, they're not to blame. When you have a quota system and you only have that limited resource, the quality that makes it through are going to be lower than when you have a system where by only the top make it through. Then again, for some of them, being chose to lead goes to their head and they end up wielding their power to the extent that it borders abuse.<br><br>It doesn't help that the government deals with it through unwritten rules where whistleblowers are stigmatized and all the inadequacy are kept under wraps.</div>

How many want seperation?
