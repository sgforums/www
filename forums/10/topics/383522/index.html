              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore’s popular blogger Mr Brown aka Lee Kin Mun had his article on the Bukit Timah flooding which was published 2 days ago in Singtel digital medial portal – inSing.com removed following a complaint lodged by the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources.</p>
              <p>Mr Brown shot to fame during the 2006 general elections with his parody “Bak Chor Mee” poking fun at the PAP leaders’ “over-reaction” at the James Gomez incident.</p>
              <p>His article, titled “mrbrown and the flood” is a satire making veiled criticisms of the government’s response towards the flooding in parts of Bukit Timah 2 weeks ago which caused immense damage to the buildings and cars there.</p>
              <p>Its first paragraph pours sarcasm on the reaction from the Minister of Environment Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</p>
              <p><em>“I think we need to appoint a Minister of Freak Incidents soon. After all, who is going to deal with the kind of incidents like the recent flooding of Bukit Timah? According to the authorities, the kind of rainfall that can cause such flooding was a ‘freak’ event that occurs only once in 50 years.”</em></p>
              <p>Another reads:</p>
              <p><em>“If your Ferrari happened to be submerged in a basement car park that fateful freak of a day, and your insurance does not cover “use of car as submarine”, you can still find solace that the next time this kind of flooding occurs, it will be 50 years later.”</em></p>
              <p>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim claimed that the flooding was a “freak” event which occurs once in fifty years and there is nothing his ministry can do to “plan ahead” for it. Dr Yaacob had used the same excuse to describe a similar flooding in Thomson area in 2006.</p>
              <p>After the flooding, PUB moved in to install flood sensors along the canals in Bukit Timah and also promised to widen them soon though construction work will only commence next year.</p>
              <p>Mr Brown wrote that further clarification from his editor “reveals that it was the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources that raised their objections to the column to MICA, who then conveyed the feedback to Singtel.”</p>
              <p><em>“The column I wrote entitled “mrbrown and the flood” was removed from the Insing site because Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA) the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) took issue with it and asked for it to be taken down. From what I understand, MICA’s MEWR’s issue (via MICA) with the column was that it criticized a minister and a ministry,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>The Singapore government is well-known for its low tolerance for criticism and dissent. A senior Straits Times correspondent Sue-Ann Chia was rapped by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong a few months ago for her “inaccurate” article on a PAP MP.</p>
              <p>This is not the first time which Mr Brown had got into trouble with the authorities. In July 2006, his column in TODAY daily was suspended following a satirical article on the rising cost of living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a harsh rebuttal to Mr Brown published in TODAY, the press secretary for MICA K Bhavani wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“mr brown’s views on all these issues distort the truth. They are polemics dressed up as analysis, blaming the Government for all that he is unhappy with. He offers no alternatives or solutions. His piece is calculated to encourage cynicism and despondency, which can only make things worse, not better, for those he professes to sympathise with.</em></p>
              <p><em>mr brown is entitled to his views. But opinions which are widely circulated in a regular column in a serious newspaper should meet higher standards. Instead of a diatribe mr brown should offer constructive criticism and alternatives. And he should come out from behind his pseudonym to defend his views openly.”</em></p>
              <p>The overbearing official response and subsequent treatment of Mr Brown drew widespread criticisms from bloggers and netizens. A group of 20 plus Singaporeans and citizens wearing brown T-shirts turned up at City Hall MRT station in support of Mr Brown.</p>
              <p>Since the unhappy incident, Mr Brown appeared to have “toned down” a little on his blog. He wrote later that he was worried that he might get into “trouble” with the authorities.</p>
              <p>Read Mr Brown’s article <a href="http://mrbrown.com/blog/2009/11/what-happened-to-my-mrbrown-and-the-flood-column.html"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a></p>

              <p><strong>Written by Mr Brown for insing.com</strong></p>
              <p>I think we need to appoint a Minister of Freak Incidents soon.</p>
              <p>After all, who is going to deal with the kind of incidents like the recent flooding of Bukit Timah? According to the authorities, the kind of rainfall that can cause such flooding was a ‘freak’ event that occurs only once in 50 years.</p>
              <p>Environment Minister Yaacob Ibrahim even said, “We knew the diversion canal was not big enough to take this.”</p>
              <p>That was very reassuring to know. I can imagine someone saying, “You know, those canals are not going to be able to take very heavy rainfall.”</p>
              <p>And someone else in charge might have said, “We know. But what to do? We cannot make the biggest canals to accommodate the biggest rainfall possible. We can’t cater to freaks. Anyway, once in a half-century only lah.”</p>
              <p>If your Ferrari happened to be submerged in a basement car park that fateful freak of a day, and your insurance does not cover “use of car as submarine”, you can still find solace that the next time this kind of flooding occurs, it will be 50 years later.</p>
              <p>So feel free to buy a new car and park it in underground car parks along Bukit Timah after this.</p>
              <p>While this is not Katrina, the residents of District 11 do not have it good, either. They work hard, live on prime land, and their homes cost millions of dollars. Plus their area does not even have an MRT station yet. And now, poor things, their district is the new Singapore River.</p>
              <p>I think we should see the bright side. Perhaps we can try to make the best of things. If you cannot stop the flooding, why not make Bukit Timah the Venice of Singapore? What could be more romantic and prestigious than living in Singapore’s Canal District?</p>
              <p>Instead of driving, residents can glide down Bukit Timah in gondolas and luxury boats. Why should only Punggol get the water sports fun?</p>
              <p>The fancy schools along that stretch can have annual Boat Races there, a la Oxford and Cambridge. ACS, SCGS, Hwa Chong, NJC, St Joseph’s, all competing in the annual Bukit Timah Freak Flood Inter-School Boat Race.</p>
              <p>Schools there will no longer need their own swimming pools. Instead, we can groom a new generation of young swimmers who have been trained from young to swim to school for their exams.</p>
              <p>It’s not a flood-prone area, it’s a waterfront lifestyle opportunity.</p>
              <p>Our submarine corps need not go elsewhere for their training exercises, too. Just get those ex-Västergötland class Swedish subs into the Bukit Timah Canal District and do their drills there. It may be challenging to create parking lots for the subs but I am sure the government will find a way.</p>
              <p>I hear they are installing some water-level sensor which will warn of rising water levels in Bukit Timah Canal. I suppose it is so that if the sensor goes off, the Traffic Police can notify nearby condominiums and residents can carry their cars upstairs to their attics or drive it to HDB multi-storey car parks nearby.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I feel a simple sign will do. Something that says “If the water level along Bukit Timah rises above this sign, please alert the authorities”.</p>
              <p>Another initiative the government can consider is to start neighbourhood Flood Watch. All the homes in Bukit Timah will be issued with buckets and assigned flood duties. In the event of flooding, residents will pour out onto the streets to scoop up buckets of water and dump the water in the Bukit Timah Canal. Clever, right?</p>
              <p>That is my suggestion to our leaders. Don’t fight the flood, go with the flow! It is only a freak flood, Singapore.</p>
              <p>Ah this just brings back fond memories of walking to my school along Bukit Timah Road in torrential rain, and walking right into the giant longkang near Coronation Plaza because flood waters obscured the pavement and the drain! Good times!</p>
              <p>Right! Let’s move on! Who wants to volunteer to be Singapore’s first Minister of Freak Incidents and Drains? Hands up! The position offers good pay and you only need to worry about stuff once every 50 years. – insing.com</p>
