            <div class='col-md body'>Even between universities, there is a difference. In NUS, you need 4 years to get a honours degree in business and that's only for the top 40% of the students. The other 60% graduate with a bachelor degree in 3 years.<br><br>Whereas in NTU, it takes just 3 years to get a honours degrees in business and close to 100% will get their honours degree in three years.<br><br>People are saying NUS and NTU are equal so why bother studying in NUS? All honours graduates get paid the same anyway so why not study in NTU?<br><br>There are some universities overseas that offer 4 year direct master course with easy cutoff points. Many rich people took the opportunity to get a master degree in london and they didnt need to work very hard for it while they watch other people studied 4 years just to get a honours degree or even a diploma.<br><br>4years to get a master degree or honours or diploma? which one do you want?<br><br>So bottomline is: you have to really think hard which institution will get you a better certificate at the end of the day. NUS may be the top 25 university in the world. Well it is also in the top 25 business school in the world. But at the end of the day, if you are just working in Singapore, perhaps an honours degree in NTU biz(3years) is much better than a bacheolor degree in NUS biz(3years).<br><br>I am not an NUS biz student.<br><br>Life is about decision making. Anyone can study well as long as they work really hard for months. (This may take up to years if the person has poor foundation though) It is what institution you study in that makes the difference. You just have to consider your pawns carefully and move the right one.<br><br>Not happy with your diploma?<br>1. Go overseas and study a master course and pwns those bachelor degree holders.<br>2. Prove that diploma graduates are better.<br>3. Whine all day all year long, till you die.</div>

Most university graduates, as pointed out, are most likely to come from a JC. 2 years in JC gave them soft skills. 4 years in university taught them theory, including practicals.<br><br>When university graduates graduate, they could find a job that requires both their hands-on experience and their soft skills.<br><br>On the other hand, a polytechnic graduate most likely have more hands-on experience than anything. While no doubt some could write well, majority I've met can't write as well.<br><br>The ability to write well is important in some jobs, especially a technical one. Nobody wants to read a report that is filled with jargon. And if you have a higher up that could understand no jargon, it's even worse.<br><br>I have no idea what people does in civil service, but I believe that they do write a lot, which probably results in such a great difference.<br><br>Maybe it's time for our polytechnics to take a look at their modules offered and see how they could improve it. Report writing and other soft skills need not to be an extra module, but be incorporated into their modules.</div>
