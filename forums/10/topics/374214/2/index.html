              <p>Ur argument is flawed.</p>
              <p>Say a young officer let a platoon of soldiers in war, succeeding is missions after missions, occcasionally failing some, occasionally losing some men in his platoon. Sometimes, some men in his platoon will go AWOL. Sometimes, some men hate the young officer to the guts because of the way he does things. Eventually, the young officer is promoted to a General after a few decades. One day, he lead a major mission and failed. Perhaps the failed mission caused him to lose a few medals, and some men. But the public is calling for him to cough out the lost medals and the lives of the men back?</p>

              <p>Did he bring Singapore up, or was it done by our grand-fathers and fathers, who helped him to overcome his bad decision to merge Singapore into Malaysia, and for his impetuous attitude towards the UMNO Politicians that resulted in Singapore being kicked out from the merger ?</p>
              <p>Where was he for almost 10 days after Singapore was thrown out of the merger with Malaysia ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that Dr Toh Chin Chye, Dr Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam had held the Singapore Government together - as LKY was shattered and demoralised, and had to recuperate at a government chalet at Changi Point ?</p>

              <p>There will be a long line of warranty claims that stretched back to 1965, and the first claim made will be for the troubles that he created with a failed merger when he could not hold our relationship with the UMNO politicians when we were part of Malaysia even as more wise voices have told him to be more cautious with his wilfull decision to merge.</p>
              <p>The next claim will be the stupidity in his 2 child policy that stopped our parents from giving us a bigger family, and for the necessity to compete harder today as he has to open the doors to allow new immigrants to be citizens in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The next claim will be on the CPF release plans which has been modified from payout at age 55, to a continuous delay to the payout date till one reaches age 85 - if we can get there without seeing our CPF saving being sucked by the high hospital and health care charges of the government managed hospitals.</p>

The current problems facing most Singaporeans is not just local but international because of the systemic breakdown of world capitalism.

              <p>So which opposition party in Singapore will allow citizen representation?</p>
              <p>Ceteris paribus? Whose side are you on, the normal hardworking citizens of Singapore or the business elites? Under monopoly and "perfect" competition, rich gets richer, poor gets poorer. Unfortunately the middle class will fall into the latter category as the financial crisis intensifies.</p>

              <p>What was the population of the Chinese population under the Qing Dynasty and the population under the Republic (then snatch away by the Communist Regime)?</p>
              <p>If circumstances under the Communist Regime wasn't favourable, I am sure the population would not have increased exponentially. Under the Qing Dynasty, all the resources was under the Officials &amp; Nobility (it's like all the resources being held by less than 0.01% of the population *i am just guessing the figures*)</p>
              <p>You should watch History Channel, they showed the squalid living conditions prior to the revolution, it was horrid.</p>
              <p><em>"The revolution was brought about by a number of factors, including but not limited to Qing corruption, Western and Japanese subjugation, the growth of local spheres of power, Warlordism, increased poverty amongst the populace, and Chinese intellectuals' growing exposure to Western schools of thought."</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://cero11.cise.ufl.edu/~webmaster/Learning_Modules/POL/content/POL_1911_revolution.html">Link to article.</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think the current regime has a genuine concern for the citizens at heart? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Vetos can indeed be politically motivated, but then again it's up to both sides to present their cases to the citizens and let the citizens decide whether it's politically motivated or the policies do indeed have their interest at heart. At present, you only have ONE party presenting their story. How can you ensure that THEY have our interest at heart? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The current political situation is but only a Blind Man's Bluff.</p>
              <p>I always believe that competition will lead to better quality, ceteris paribus. If you have another choice, the dominant political party will feel threatened and act in a more responsible way. <strong>I ask this of you. If say you are the Party Leader of the dominant party, would you act more responsibly if your position is threatened by an equal strength political party?</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>I do not believe that I have taken competition to extremes, it has always been like this, with competition things become better. It has been so in the Natural World with Darwin's survival of the fittest (Natural Selection), it has been so in the Business World and Political World. There are certainly more advanced economies in the world with two or afew dominant political parties than a single dominant political party. Surely if it's not beneficial, it would not have existed so long and perhaps if that's the case, most advanced economies should all be single political party government like Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why I said if PAP loses the next election, it is most likely a "Poison Pill" strategy, because everything is so booby trapped, the chances of them doing a good job would be minimal at best. It's like the PAP set them up for failure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Even if they can't deliver their promises, I would have known the set of circumstances the PAP booby trapped them for, I will still give them my support. I can't fault the oppositions for not helping me because PAP handcuffed their hands behind their backs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Whatever enacted by Parliament can always be repealed by parliament if you have the majority. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p>While you make some good points I don't agree on all of them. The current problems facing most Singaporeans is not just local but international because of the systemic breakdown of world capitalism. Even if the PAP lose an election to the opposition party, what will change? Can you guarantee a more egalitarian society? What is your political perspective besides being business friendly? Same strategy, different tactics, status quo remains and nothing changes.</p>

              <p><br>When you have been through the daily rituals of the insufferable angel, you will surely be most certain that she is no Jaycee Dugard; then again neither was the rich brat Patricia Hearst.</p>
              <p>Still, both are weaklings drawn to the aura of the omnipotent and unable to remove themselves from the silent dangers in the magnetic field that suck the senses from their ordinary existence.</p>
              <p>You are right that the current problems in Singapore is not just local but due to the breakdown in the globalised capitalist system.</p>
              <p>It is easy to resign to this fact.</p>
              <p>However, why should Singapore be caught in the quagmire ? </p>
              <p>Do we not have the world higest paid govenment who justified their position from their boast in their unique elitist talent brimming with the ultimate in meritocracy that can be found ?</p>
              <p>Should they not have seen the writings on the wall that even shrewd private investors have already prepared themselves even before the storm came ?</p>
              <p>This is not even said with the benefit of hindsight, as these were on record back in 1987, 1997 and even as early as 2003 and 2004.</p>
              <p>If we see the changes made in South Korea, and the changes in Indonesia - where the strong arm rule of Park Chung Hee  and Suharto were removed - it saw the spirit of the South Koreans released, which resulted in new found pride of themselves as a nation able to participate in the political process that determine their own future.</p>
              <p>Similarly, despite the cacophony of over 200 Million voices, Indonesia today is far better than the days of Suharto when this family rule over the self-proclaimed fiefdom.</p>
              <p>Switzerland was once promoted by GCT as a model for Singapore's hope for Standard of Living to be achieved.</p>
              <p>Somehow, that hope was quietly moved from center stage even as we are straddled with the Swiss Cost of Living without being anywhere near achieving the Swiss Standard of Living.</p>
              <p>Conveniently, the Swiss Political System was never promoted as a model - even as it has successfully amalgamated their population of 7.4 Million different ethnicities that spread through a land locked mountainous country - with the citizens involved in the political process through frequent referendums that everyone has responsibility in.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that despite the high costs of living in Switzerland, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/01/06/blank/key/02/05.html">‘Swiss has a fertility rate of 1.48 children per woman’ (*1) </a>compared to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KH27Ae01.html">‘Singapore’s fertility rate of 1.29 children per woman’ (*2) </a>- which the PAP Government has continuously lamented to no effect ?</p>
              <p>Other countries have similar political and social systems that allow Citizens to take control of their own political future, and responsible for their political relevance in a nation created for themselves - these include Sweden, Norway, Finland, Poland, and the new republics that managed to breakaway from old Russia.</p>
              <p>These are the models that we could strive for in fullfilling the Pledge of building a Democratic Society based on Justice and Equality for Singaporeans - (equality not only in terms of rights to ethnic groups, but opportunities, welfare, employment, security to individuals, families, businesses, and political entities).</p>

              <p>I am not the least surprised to know that for he mentioned
              before that there is no fairness for the oppositions. 
              Moreover, for people who know his style and crap are aware he
              "probably" rules with iron fists, oppression, self serving and
              so on.</p>
              <p>I gave him credit for his past contributions but at the same
              time it is sad the Singapore has such a leader.</p>
              <p>So do we think he loves Singapore, the answer is obvious isn't
              it?</p>
              <p>By the way, Singapore does not belong to him.

              <p><br> if you created something thru your life time, let say you build a
              vast business empire, surely you will treasure it, as it was thru
              blood and sweat that you make it. Even if someone below u took
              over, you will also need to oversee the important decision. Same to
              LKY, Singapore is like a child, a baby brought up by him to a
              teenager then adult age. How can he not care for it. Even till his
              last breath, if singapore shake, he will wake up and make a
              decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sincerely if you will to ask me, i too dun admire his life, so
              much stress, so much criticisms, insult and cursing on him, so much
              worrying, so old and still worrying and yet no one pity him for
              what he did in bringing what we are today, even to most
              sgforumers here, dun you realise that your present here
              with the ability to type english and surf internet are in some
              way connected to his effort of bring singapore up. Dun you
              realise that, certainly no one is perfect, not me, not you, not
              LKY. But the ability to make what we are today here, in this
              very moment, we should reserve some respect for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The human behavor is funny, for gal like me, see other boy seem
              to look more handsome than my bf, for guy, other girls seem better
              than their gf, and more so are those uncles who alway said bad
              about their wife when they chat with me. You live in this house and
              said the other house is better, you drive this car, but alway see
              the other car is better, same goes to leadership of singapore, now
              you hate and dislike LKY and think other are better, I can
              guarantee you that the day the opposition take over, you may miss
              LKY, then at that time you said actually LKy is good and all those
              praises. After all, we are humans, satisfaction never exist in our
              soul, and that is why we progress, and that is why we failed to
              realise what is contention. </p>

              <p>if they wanted to fleece u dry of money the rates would have been much higher...  sierra leone if im not mistaken.. lazy to google it..  has like 50% tax? ours only 17%.. lesser than what joseph taxed the egyptians.. 20%..  </p>
              <p>By right, taxes are supposed to make a country rich..  there is not a single country who got where it is today without taxes..  now, even if there is a new government, they would not remove taxes, might even increase cos they cant touch federal reserves without consent...</p>
              <p>anyway, bitterness is not the way to go..  if we get rid of taxes, for sure someone will say "HEY! give us healthcare!"  or " HEY! we need welfare! government not taking care of elderly!! "  to do that, you need taxes... then we repeat the cycle over again... until finally no one needs to work, everyone can laze at home and still get free money... then singapore confirm down within 5 years..    It is impossible to please everyone, and those who feel short changed will go form a new political party.. then throw poo at each other..  goes on endlessly.. </p>
              <p>oh and please, the only reason they are in control for more than half a century is cos everyone else is too busy bitching about it, and not stepping up to take the torch..</p>
