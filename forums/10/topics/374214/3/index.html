              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> When you have been through the daily rituals of the insufferable
              angel, you will surely be most certain that she is no Jaycee
              Dugard; then again neither was the rich brat Patricia Hearst.</p>
              <p>Still, both are weaklings drawn to the aura of the
              omnipotent and unable to remove themselves from the
              silent dangers in the magnetic field that suck the senses from
              their ordinary existence.</p>
              <p>You are right that the current problems in Singapore is not just
              local but due to the breakdown in the globalised capitalist
              system.</p>
              <p>It is easy to resign to this fact.</p>
              <p>However, why should Singapore be caught in the quagmire
              ? </p>
              <p>Do we not have the world higest paid
              govenment who justified their position from
              their boast in their unique elitist talent brimming
              with the ultimate in meritocracy that can be found ?</p>
              <p>Should they not have seen the writings on the wall that even
              shrewd private investors have already prepared themselves even
              before the storm came ?</p>
              <p>This is not even said with the benefit of hindsight, as these
              were on record back in 1987, 1997 and even as early as 2003 and
              2004.</p>
              <p>If we see the changes made in South Korea, and the changes in
              Indonesia - where the strong arm rule of Park Chung Hee  and
              Suharto were removed - it saw the spirit of the South
              Koreans released, which resulted in new found pride of themselves
              as a nation able to participate in the political process that
              determine their own future.</p>
              <p>Similarly, despite the cacophony of over 200 Million voices,
              Indonesia today is far better than the days of Suharto when this
              family rule over the self-proclaimed fiefdom.</p>
              <p>Switzerland was once promoted by GCT as a model for Singapore's
              hope for Standard of Living to be achieved.</p>
              <p>Somehow, that hope was quietly moved from center stage even as
              we are straddled with the Swiss Cost of Living without being
              anywhere near achieving the Swiss Standard of Living.</p>
              <p>Conveniently, the Swiss Political System was never promoted as a
              model - even as it has successfully amalgamated their population of
              7.4 Million different ethnicities that spread through a land locked
              mountainous country - with the citizens involved in the
              political process through frequent referendums that everyone has
              responsibility in.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that despite the high costs of living
              in Switzerland, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/01/06/blank/key/02/05.html">‘Swiss has a fertility rate of 1.48 children per
              woman’ (*1)</a> compared to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KH27Ae01.html">‘Singapore’s fertility rate of 1.29 children per woman’
              (*2) </a>- which the PAP Government has continuously lamented
              to no effect ?</p>
              <p>Other countries have similar political and social
              systems that allow Citizens to take control of their own
              political future, and responsible for their political relevance in
              a nation created for themselves - these include Sweden, Norway,
              Finland, Poland, and the new republics that managed to breakaway
              from old Russia.</p>
              <p>These are the models that we could strive for in fullfilling the
              Pledge of building a Democratic Society based on Justice and
              Equality for Singaporeans - (equality not only in terms of rights
              to ethnic groups, but opportunities, welfare, employment, security
              to individuals, families, businesses, and political entities).</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Just a few questions, a society based on Justice and Equality for Singaporeans, how are you going to achieve that? What are the frameworks? If we believe in an egalitarian society, why are some of us so rich? What is to be done? Will having a similar political system as Switzerland address the class issue? Or must it be fought for? Unless these questions are urgently answered, we will never acheive the promised society based on justice and equality. And a pity your essay will be viewed as empty rhetoric.</p>

              <div>'Sir, would you send in the army?'</div>
              <div>
              <p>AT YESTERDAY'S dialogue, writer Catherine Lim posed MM Lee this
              question: 'Sir, in the event of a serious threat of a freak
              election, would you do the unthinkable, that is, send in the army?'
              This is an edited extract from Mr Lee's reply:</p>
              <p>'You look at our record and the moves we've made. Let me put it
              simply like this. First, we maintain a system which gives any
              opposition the opportunity to displace us peacefully. We allow the
              system: we've not interfered with the civil service, the judiciary,
              parliamentary procedures, the police and so on.</p>
              <p>If you can win an election, so be it. If at some point we are
              not able to find a team which can equal an opposition team, on that
              day we deserve to be out. If we become corrupt, inefficient, can't
              deliver, we're out.</p>
              <p>What if we have a freak election, as we may well have? Many
              voters say openly: 'In my family, three of us voted for you but two
              voted against, just to let you know that we want an opposition
              voice.' In that situation, you may have a freak result. That
              worries me.</p>
              <p>So we've set in place a President with blocking powers. Any
              opposition that comes in will find that he cannot touch the
              reserves, otherwise you can promise the sky and spend the money.
              And all our hard-earned savings will go in five years.</p>
              <p>Second, you cannot change the top officials without the
              President's consent. Any raiding of the funds must be approved by
              the President who has a council of presidential advisers to advise
              him yes or no.</p>
              <p>Now, why should we do all these if we expect to overturn an
              election?</p>
              <p>We expect that if we are voted out, to stay out, and hope that
              within one term, that new government, incompetent and unable to
              deliver, will be out. And there's enough core competencies and the
              funds to enable a fresh PAP government to revive the system.</p>
              <p>I spent 15 years thinking about these safeguards and finally
              persuaded my younger colleagues that we needed these because they
              can't guarantee that each time they will produce a better team than
              the opposition just because you've done so in the past.</p>
              <p>I don't see any problem in the next election, and probably the
              election after that. But if we don't get a good team in the
              election after that and the opposition does get a good team
              together, we're at risk.</p>

              <p>like i said in my thread..its an extract..and i had based on that..just because its an extract doesnt mean such words never came out from their mouths ya??the whole point is..from the extract..it is the words of an unwise and selfish leader.</p>
              <p>the next election,govt,sun rise are all opportunity cost questions.the point is, he was hoping for a lousier opposition, block their finances so they will fail..and pick up the pieces and re emerge as heros.letting the whole world know that sg cannot do without pap or more importantly him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and no i did not misrep him..i do not rep him in the 1st place..its the first conclusion i get from the papers..</p>

              <p>What was the population of the Chinese population under the Qing Dynasty and the population under the Republic (then snatch away by the Communist Regime)?</p>
              <p>If circumstances under the Communist Regime wasn't favourable, I am sure the population would not have increased exponentially. Under the Qing Dynasty, all the resources was under the Officials &amp; Nobility (it's like all the resources being held by less than 0.01% of the population *i am just guessing the figures*)</p>
              <p>You should watch History Channel, they showed the squalid living conditions prior to the revolution, it was horrid.</p>
              <p><em>"The revolution was brought about by a number of factors, including but not limited to Qing corruption, Western and Japanese subjugation, the growth of local spheres of power, Warlordism, increased poverty amongst the populace, and Chinese intellectuals' growing exposure to Western schools of thought."</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think the current regime has a genuine concern for the citizens at heart? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Vetos can indeed be politically motivated, but then again it's up to both sides to present their cases to the citizens and let the citizens decide whether it's politically motivated or the policies do indeed have their interest at heart. At present, you only have ONE party presenting their story. How can you ensure that THEY have our interest at heart? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The current political situation is but only a Blind Man's Bluff.</p>
              <p>I always believe that competition will lead to better quality, ceteris paribus. If you have another choice, the dominant political party will feel threatened and act in a more responsible way. <strong>I ask this of you. If say you are the Party Leader of the dominant party, would you act more responsibly if your position is threatened by an equal strength political party?</strong></p>
              <p>I do not believe that I have taken competition to extremes, it has always been like this, with competition things become better. It has been so in the Natural World with Darwin's survival of the fittest (Natural Selection), it has been so in the Business World and Political World. There are certainly more advanced economies in the world with two or afew dominant political parties than a single dominant political party. Surely if it's not beneficial, it would not have existed so long and perhaps if that's the case, most advanced economies should all be single political party government like Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why I said if PAP loses the next election, it is most likely a "Poison Pill" strategy, because everything is so booby trapped, the chances of them doing a good job would be minimal at best. It's like the PAP set them up for failure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Even if they can't deliver their promises, I would have known the set of circumstances the PAP booby trapped them for, I will still give them my support. I can't fault the oppositions for not helping me because PAP handcuffed their hands behind their backs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever enacted by Parliament can always be repealed by parliament if you have the majority. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>Perhaps a National Referendum might help also.</p>

              <p>Population growth rate is not really a very accurate yardstick on whether life is better.</p>
              <p>You could go see for yourself the countries with the highest population growth rate. How many of them have horrible poverty rates or social instability?</p>
              <p>Japan has 0 to negative population growth, would you consider it then a horrible place?</p>
              <p>I do not disagree with you on the current political stituation.</p>
              <p>And to your question in bold my answer would be no. I would be inclined to act to weaken the political position of the opposition party and strengthen that of my party. That may and may not result in responsible behaviour. </p>

              <p>unfortunately,as a leader, he cant be using words to cite a wrong example in the so called everse psychology..things like go ahead and jump off the building if you wanna to a suicidal person might just push the person over the edge..a leader cannot just alter his words after an incident has happen by saying, hey im using reverse psychology..it aint my fault the listener is dumb..while it will be a ++ for him no matter what is the result..he will always say see..i told u so..country leaders do not just address to the nation but also on a global context..</p>
              <p>and good point by spdcp..though in his case..being seperate entities between leader of sg and pap member is kinda a rough divide..</p>

              <p>With the benefit of hindsight, that's like telling the last
              Ching Dynasty citizens that a Republic is not good for China, they
              should remain under the control of the Ching Emperor, because the
              President of the Republic will act in the same despotic manner as
              the Ching Emperor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If everybody thinks like you do, I guess there is no need for
              the different political parties, just one political party will do,
              since they are all the same. Why should US have Democrats and
              Republicans? Just one party will do, there won't be any need for an
              election too. Since no election, why not just turn it into another
              Burma (Myanmar), where we have one strong arm General leading the
              country. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under your perspective, election is an exercise in futility.
              Let's scrap the election process and turn Singapore into
              a Monarchy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>To answer your questions - <em>"a society based on Justice and Equality for Singaporeans - how are you going to achieve that ?"</em></p>
              <p>Starting from the present as a base - what do you see ?</p>
              <p>How do you think that Justice can be Fairly and Equitably applied, in which the PAP - as a political party does not manipulate the legislative process to monopolise every aspect of Singapore Life ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the dismantling process has to begin by placing controls to prevent any political party to manipulate the legislative process to make liberal amendments that end up bastardising the Singapore Constitution.</p>
              <p>There should not be any political influence imposed on the selection of candidates to he office of The Elected President, and the prospective candidates can be vetted by a select committee of prominent lay persons formed by prominent members from commerce, industry, academia, and the professionals who shall be the peers to select the llikely candidates for the decision to be made by the Community.</p>
              <p>A similar process can be designed with the Legal Fraternity taking the lead in selecting the candidates to fill the positions in the Judiciary, for the decision to be made by a select committee formed along similar lines as above to represent the Community.</p>
              <p>An independent Judiciary free from political and societal debts, incumberrances and obligations must be ensured, and their terms of appointment to be for fixed periods reviewed every five to ten years by the same select committee.</p>
              <p>The entire economy based on the Government Linked Companies being involved in every essential services provided to Singaporeans should be reviewed, in which these "national companies" should be 100 per cent publicly listed - the Chairmen, CEOs and Executive Directors to be non-political persons.</p>
              <p>The Trade Unions should be free from politics and from political controls, and with the existing arbitration system in place there is scope for better employer-employee negotiations to progress.</p>
              <p>The Civil Service should be similarly re-educated to be non-partisan and to serve with diligent professionalism irregardless of whichever political party forming the government.</p>
              <p>With 44 years of history in nation building, what has LKY left behind as his legacy if it has any abilities to withstand the vagaries of future political events ?</p>
              <p>Instead of designing a legacy that allow free play and non-partisan professionalism in a new Singapore Society, LKY has designed a seemingly failsafe system for the PAP's perpetual interests in continued political control over all aspects of Singapore's political, economic, social, cultural, and commercial life.</p>
              <p>It is a shaky foundation that is designed to resist political change, as the PAP appointees are in all the various positions that give the PAP total control to all the strings pulling Singapore Society.</p>
              <p>These appointees can act to disrupt the efforts of any New Government formed by any other political party other then the PAP.</p>
              <p>It is a LKY legacy of instability that will eventually lead to Singapore's self-destruction.</p>

              <p><br> To answer your questions - <em>"a society based on Justice and
              Equality for Singaporeans - how are you going to achieve that
              ?"</em></p>
              <p>Starting from the present as a base - what do you see ?</p>
              <p>How do you think that Justice can be Fairly and Equitably
              applied, in which the PAP - as a political party does not
              manipulate the legislative process to monopolise every aspect of
              Singapore Life ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the dismantling process has to begin
              by placing controls to prevent any political party to
              manipulate the legislative process to make liberal amendments
              that end up bastardising the Singapore Constitution.</p>
              <p>There should not be any political influence imposed on
              the selection of candidates to he office of The Elected
              President, and the prospective candidates can be vetted by
              a select committee of prominent lay persons formed by
              prominent members from commerce, industry, academia, and the
              professionals who shall be the peers to select the llikely
              candidates for the decision to be made by the Community.</p>
              <p>A similar process can be designed with the Legal Fraternity
              taking the lead in selecting the candidates to fill the positions
              in the Judiciary, for the decision to be made by a select
              committee formed along similar lines as above to represent the
              Community.</p>
              <p>An independent Judiciary free from political and societal
              debts, incumberrances and obligations must be ensured, and their
              terms of appointment to be for fixed periods reviewed every
              five to ten years by the same select committee.</p>
              <p>The entire economy based on the Government Linked Companies
              being involved in every essential services provided to Singaporeans
              should be reviewed, in which these "national companies" should be
              100 per cent publicly listed - the Chairmen, CEOs and
              Executive Directors to be non-political persons.</p>
              <p>The Trade Unions should be free from politics and from political
              controls, and with the existing arbitration system in place there
              is scope for better employer-employee negotiations to progress.</p>
              <p>The Civil Service should be similarly re-educated to be
              non-partisan and to serve with diligent professionalism
              irregardless of whichever political party forming the
              government.</p>
              <p>With 44 years of history in nation building, what has LKY left
              behind as his legacy if it has any abilities to withstand the
              vagaries of future political events ?</p>
              <p>Instead of designing a legacy that allow free play and
              non-partisan professionalism in a new Singapore Society, LKY has
              designed a seemingly failsafe system for the PAP's perpetual
              interests in continued political control over all aspects of
              Singapore's political, economic, social, cultural, and commercial
              life.</p>
              <p>It is a shaky foundation that is designed to resist political
              change, as the PAP appointees are in all the
              various positions that give the PAP total control to all
              the strings pulling Singapore Society.</p>
              <p>These appointees can act to disrupt the efforts of any New
              Government formed by any other political party other then the
              PAP.</p>
              <p>It is a LKY legacy of instability that will eventually
              lead to Singapore's self-destruction.</p>

              <p>A very good read but you're still side-stepping the main issue of class. You write, "The Trade Unions should be free from politics and from political
              controls, and with the existing arbitration system in place there
              is scope for better employer-employee negotiations to progress." Trade unions today are subservient to the government and big corporations and are not as militant as before. If the trade unions are indeed independently elected by workers themselves, chances are they will want to represent their own class interests. Strikes will occur with workers demanding for better wages, whereas big businesses will also want to maintain their profits. Enact laws against either then aren't you an oppressor no different from any ruling elites? Again, how can you ensure equality and justice without addressing the class issue.</p>
              <p>I just don't see how you can accomodate either based on the free market principles. I might just stick to the PAP for the current stability it can provide. Unless opposition parties truly address the class issue, nothing will change for the normal hardworking citizens of Singapore. Just like the turn of the 20th century, future political events in the 21st century will still be dominated by the class issue.</p>
              <p>"It is LKY legacy of instability that will eventually
                                      lead to Singapore's self-destruction." As much as I'm not a supporter of LKY, it will not just be him but a number of factors, both internal and external, that will contribute to the cessation of Singapore as a nation state.</p>

              <p>A very good read but you're still side-stepping the main issue of class. You write, "The Trade Unions should be free from politics and from political controls, and with the existing arbitration system in place there is scope for better employer-employee negotiations to progress." Trade unions today are subservient to the government and big corporations and are not as militant as before. If the trade unions are indeed independently elected by workers themselves, chances are they will want to represent their own class interests. Strikes will occur with workers demanding for better wages, whereas big businesses will also want to maintain their profits. Enact laws against either then aren't you an oppressor no different from any ruling elites? Again, how can you ensure equality and justice without addressing the class issue.</p>

              <p>What of postmodernism if this is all mankind is able to achieve. How much of nature actually play a part in society and what of social consciousness. Are you a believer in social darwinism, just like all those 19th century philosophers? And how can you use a child as an example when it has limited consciousness. What of the boy who makes 100 footballs and decides to share with others for football games when he realises it serves no purpose hoarding them all. And yes, I stand by what i say. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There will be no justice and equality without addressing issues of class</span>. With the right tools, yes, it is possible to create not a classless society but a dictatorship of the working class based on direct democracy. We should all strive for this. As it is politically sensitive its better for me to avoid any lengthy discussion. If you base your politics on justice and equality, the social forces of class will surely come back and haunt you.</p>
              <p>Free market has failed the majority of the world's population because of its own contradictions. While i admire your views, there is no way your politics can change anything, not ever, especially in a small nation state like Singapore which is so ever dependent on the changing political situations around the world.</p>

              <p>Population growth rate is not really a very accurate yardstick on whether life is better.</p>
              <p>You could go see for yourself the countries with the highest population growth rate. How many of them have horrible poverty rates or social instability?</p>
              <p>Japan has 0 to negative population growth, would you consider it then a horrible place?</p>

              <p>Ermmm.....you are talking about Advanced Industrial Economies or Third World Countries in terms of population growth? Third World Countries have a shortage of productive resources to sustain the population, therefore if population increases dramatically with a change in governance, the increase must be attributable to the change in goverment. Resources during the Qing Dynasty concentrated on the Emperor &amp; family, officials and landlords; resources during the communist era belonged to the state, citizens are alloted houses, land and given jobs. Does the spreading of resources to each individual citizen benefit more individuals or; does the concentration of resources amongst the top benefit more individuals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once economic system become too advanced, population rates tend to fall.</p>
              <p><em>Falling birth rates are not unique to Australia. In fact, birth rates have been falling in all the advanced industrial countries — and many are currently lower than Australia’s. Low birth rates largely reflect increased choices available to women, including access to birth control, access to education and employment, and higher living standards.</em></p>

              <p>OK.</p>
              <p>You win!</p>
              <p>Absoulute Monarchy is a far superior system of governance than Communism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then you are acting in a selfish irresponsible manner just like the current regime. If you fail to weaken the opposition, your party's demise is inevitable. A ruler indulged in his own selfish desires has no support from the people and will soon lead to his downfall. That's how the French Revolution started.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The inefficient and antiquated financial system was unable to manage the <a title="Government debt" href="/wiki/Government_debt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">national debt</span></span></a>, something which was both caused and exacerbated by the burden of a grossly inequitable system of taxation. Another cause was the continued <a title="Conspicuous consumption" href="/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">conspicuous consumption</span></span></a> of the noble class, especially the court of <a title="Louis XVI of France" href="/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Louis XVI</span></span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Marie-Antoinette of France" href="/wiki/Marie-Antoinette_of_France"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Marie-Antoinette</span></span></a> at <a title="Versailles" href="/wiki/Versailles"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Versailles</span></span></a>, despite the financial burden on the populace. High <a title="Unemployment" href="/wiki/Unemployment"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">unemployment</span></span></a> and high bread prices caused more money to be spent on food and less in other areas of the economy. The <a class="mw-redirect" title="Roman Catholic Church" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Roman Catholic Church</span></span></a>, the largest landowner in the country, levied a tax on crops known as the <em>dime</em> or <a title="Tithe" href="/wiki/Tithe"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">tithe</span></span></a>. While the <em>dîme</em> lessened the severity of the monarchy's tax increases, it worsened the plight of the poorest who faced a daily struggle with malnutrition. There was too little internal trade and too many customs barriers.<sup id="cite_ref-britannicatraite_2-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-britannicatraite-2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
