              <p>as cited in 3-sep ST, an edited extract of MM lee's response to author catherine lim with regards to freak election and the pap response..</p>
              <p>what our dear mm lee said really sadden and disgusts me..in particular to what he mentioned that if the pap was out..he can only hope the new government, without the financial support of national reserves will do badly and get voted out by the next election.</p>
              <p>truely, a great leader who loves the people will in a gentlemanly fashion hope the next party to do well and bring Singapore to greater heights and better welfare and bliss to the people is it not?however, none of this is reflected..what is shown is he hope the nxt bugger will fail like he predicted and so he can take over again to guide you low class losers that singapore cannot do without him..there is no interest of the country and her citizens at heart..</p>
              <p>i can understand the national reserves were hard earned money by him and more importantly his team..i wouldnt really like the idea of people touching my hard earned money too..but as a leader..the welfare of the people must come first before personal interests..but again..what is he seems to suggest is that if pap is voted out..at least they have already placed strict laws to prevent the opposition to touch the money to better the country and so they can only fail as money makes the world goes round...once they fail..pap will be voted in again and they will have the access to the money again to "rectify" the horrendous mistakes the opposition had done..</p>
              <p>i have no vendetta against the mm lee nor favour the opposition..but the words coming out of the mouth of a so called great leader sounds too selfish..</p>

              <p>Is the national reserves hard earned money by LKY and his team ?</p>
              <p>Or should the national reserves be the hard earned money taken from the hard labor of Singaporeans as wage slaves in a system created by LKY and his team ?</p>
              <p>The National Reserves belong to Singapore, and if Singaporeans elect a different political party to form the next government instead of the PAP - that is the will of the people, and the machinery of the country should continue to operate with the money that has been taken from the people.</p>
              <p>This is pure petty politics from a petty old man - afraid of his finite time on earth, and afraid of the finite ability to control what is not his to take along.</p>
              <p>This is the Third World Mentality of a Third World Politician.</p>
              <p>Singapore will be in trouble with the continued government formed by the PAP, as the arrogance is already spoken clearly and placed on record.</p>

              <p>domon, glad to see your first posting here.</p>
              <p>I am not the least surprised to know that for he mentioned before that there is no fairness for the oppositions.  Moreover, for people who know his style and crap are aware he "probably" rules with iron fists, oppression, self serving and so on.</p>
              <p>I gave him credit for his past contributions but at the same time it is sad the Singapore has such a leader.</p>
              <p>So do we think he loves Singapore, the answer is obvious isn't it?</p>
              <p>By the way, Singapore does not belong to him.    Singapore is not = PAP</p>

              <p><br>if you created something thru your life time, let say you build a vast business empire, surely you will treasure it, as it was thru blood and sweat that you make it. Even if someone below u took over, you will also need to oversee the important decision. Same to LKY, Singapore is like a child, a baby brought up by him to a teenager then adult age. How can he not care for it. Even till his last breath, if singapore shake, he will wake up and make a decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sincerely if you will to ask me, i too dun admire his life, so much stress, so much criticisms, insult and cursing on him, so much worrying, so old and still worrying and yet no one pity him for what he did in bringing what we are today, even to most sgforumers here, dun you realise that your present here with the ability to type english and surf internet are in some way connected to his effort of bring singapore up. Dun you realise that, certainly no one is perfect, not me, not you, not LKY. But the ability to make what we are today here, in this very moment, we should reserve some respect for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The human behavor is funny, for gal like me, see other boy seem to look more handsome than my bf, for guy, other girls seem better than their gf, and more so are those uncles who alway said bad about their wife when they chat with me. You live in this house and said the other house is better, you drive this car, but alway see the other car is better, same goes to leadership of singapore, now you hate and dislike LKY and think other are better, I can guarantee you that the day the opposition take over, you may miss LKY, then at that time you said actually LKy is good and all those praises. After all, we are humans, satisfaction never exist in our soul, and that is why we progress, and that is why we failed to realise what is contention. </p>

              <div class="headline">'Sir, would you send in the army?'</div>
              <div class="text">
              <p>AT YESTERDAY'S dialogue, writer Catherine Lim posed MM Lee this question: 'Sir, in the event of a serious threat of a freak election, would you do the unthinkable, that is, send in the army?' This is an edited extract from Mr Lee's reply:</p>
              <p>'You look at our record and the moves we've made. Let me put it simply like this. First, we maintain a system which gives any opposition the opportunity to displace us peacefully. We allow the system: we've not interfered with the civil service, the judiciary, parliamentary procedures, the police and so on.</p>
              <p>If you can win an election, so be it. If at some point we are not able to find a team which can equal an opposition team, on that day we deserve to be out. If we become corrupt, inefficient, can't deliver, we're out.</p>
              <p>What if we have a freak election, as we may well have? Many voters say openly: 'In my family, three of us voted for you but two voted against, just to let you know that we want an opposition voice.' In that situation, you may have a freak result. That worries me.</p>
              <p>So we've set in place a President with blocking powers. Any opposition that comes in will find that he cannot touch the reserves, otherwise you can promise the sky and spend the money. And all our hard-earned savings will go in five years.</p>
              <p>Second, you cannot change the top officials without the President's consent. Any raiding of the funds must be approved by the President who has a council of presidential advisers to advise him yes or no.</p>
              <p>Now, why should we do all these if we expect to overturn an election?</p>
              <p>We expect that if we are voted out, to stay out, and hope that within one term, that new government, incompetent and unable to deliver, will be out. And there's enough core competencies and the funds to enable a fresh PAP government to revive the system.</p>
              <p>I spent 15 years thinking about these safeguards and finally persuaded my younger colleagues that we needed these because they can't guarantee that each time they will produce a better team than the opposition just because you've done so in the past.</p>
              <p>I don't see any problem in the next election, and probably the election after that. But if we don't get a good team in the election after that and the opposition does get a good team together, we're at risk.</p>
