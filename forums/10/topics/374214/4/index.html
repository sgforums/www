              <p>Social conciousness will demand that the citizens are awake and know their social responsibilities towards the community, and in turn a group of like minded individuals will strive to protect their common interests within their community.</p>
              <p>Sadly, after 44 years of nation building, the PAP is afraid of a nation that is united in their political awakening, and have done their level best to depoliticise the citizens, even as they politicised the various entire government structure which they then will monopolise with such ease.</p>
              <p>LKY has refused to allow the Citizens to participate in the national debate, and will prefer to have the citizens to participate at the level of Town Councils - holding mini-referendums to decide on their neighborhood upgradings, and decide on who the Town Mayors for their constituencies should be.</p>

              <p>Was it about the child only, or was it about the Parents giving extra attention to a weakest child amongst all the children in the Family, and which result in an unequal attention given - when the Parents are only attempting to level the playing field to create equality for all the children over the longer term ? </p>

              <blockquote>And yes, I stand by what i say. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There will be no justice and equality without addressing issues of class</span>. With the right tools, yes, it is possible to create not a classless society but a dictatorship of the working class based on direct democracy. We should all strive for this. As it is politically sensitive its better for me to avoid any lengthy discussion. If you base your politics on justice and equality, the social forces of class will surely come back and haunt you.

              <p>It is a matter of opinion as to whether my politics can change anything, but given the status quo in which our minds are resigned to the present, obviously nothing can change as there is no impetus for change to happen.</p>
              <p>It is surprising that LKY should lament about Singaporeans no longer having the energy to venture, to be enterprising, to seek challenges - considering these attitudes are the results of his own actions over 52 years in power.</p>
              <p>Have you not noitced that even as Singapore maybe small and dependent on the changing political situations around the world, it has become more vulnerable due to the inherent weaknesses which were identifed in the reports prepared by two Economic Recovery Committees in 1987 and 1997 ?</p>
              <p>Even as Singapore is dependent on the World, this PAP Govenment has selectively responded to the changes in the political situations around the world.

              <p>That said, do you seriously believe that Singapore is totally dependent on the World at large ?</p>
              <p>LKY is smarter because he knows what cards are on the table, and what he has in his sleeve. He raises the stakes to scare the weaker hearts into action so as to herd the weaker ones to move in his preferred directions. (see the glossary of his famous speeches posted earlier in this thread).</p>
              <p>Each time when you hear a bogeyman story told by him, you should double your efforts to research on the real events that transpired, then form your own conclusions, instead of believing a rehash according to his preferred interpretations</p>

                  is a worldwide phenomenon, not only exclusive to Singapore and the
                  PAP. Most recent elections around the world have seen a dramatic
                  decline
                  in the number of electorates taking part on election day. So why are
                  people refusing to vote? They are downhearted and don't believe real
                  change can come into existence as long as the major parties continue to
                  represent big businesses and not the ordinary people. Just look at Obama and his popularity, probably one of the fastest drop in approval ratings any US president has ever seen. Go deeper into
                  politics and one realises it's the same with almost every country, very
                  much monopolised.</p>

              <p>Is that your idea of governance and equality? Is it not for the

                  are you saying the smartest kid should get all the riches in the world
                  and the least able one miserable scraps because the current
                  socal-economic system dictates that? How miserable when social life
                  becomes a competition! Shouldn't
                  the economic system evolve to meet the needs of everyone and not
                  profits for the tiny few elites? When these kids grow up, with varying
                  abilites, aren't they still dependent on one another? Again, I emphasize needs. What's the point of having 10 cars when i only drive one. Governments should also provide free education and healthcare as a right for all.</p>

              <p>No doubt something has to happen, but that is where the politics of

                  for any opposition party if it does not represent my class interest. I
                  do not have to repeat myself, same strategy with different tactics
                  changes nothing. This is where I must warn the electorate, if you want
                  change make sure your interest is represented. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Do not blindly vote, not for the PAP nor for the opposition if your interest aren't taken care of!</span> If no alternative exist, think very carefully before voting. It take
                  some guts for the construction of new opposition parties that addresses
                  not only the class issue but foreign policy as well. Only then might
                  the ordinary citizens in Singapore experience genuine change.</p>

              <p>Research and objectivity in politics is very important. Too many people take the mainstream media as unchallenged facts. Forumers interested in politics should not indulge themselves in identity politics; apply scientific analysis to history and human affairs is a fine start to better understand this world.

They are downhearted and don't believe real change can come into existence as long as the major parties continue to represent big businesses and not the ordinary people. Just look at Obama and his popularity, probably one of the fastest drop in approval ratings any US president has ever seen.

              <p>Based on your principle that when certain issues are not clearly resolved, one should not take any actions. and if Free Market is imperfect and concertedd international effort must be made - should we not ask ourselves who should take the first step to correct the status quo when the pre-conditions and its outcome is unclear ?</p>

              <p>The breakdown in World Capitalism was as much due to the inattentiveness of the various governments lack of supervision to the capitalist system.</p>
              <p>This is evident in the hands off approach of the ignorant White House cowboy -George W Bush - to the callous ways he allowed Greenspan to conduct businesses with the Financial Institutions that led to the global financial meltdown.</p>
              <p>Is the Capitalist System broken for good and cannot be reinstated ?</p>
              <p>With its ability to allow energetic enterprise to thrive it certainly has a lot of mileage left compared to Marx's socialist levelling of the classes.</p>

              A will find a way. When you have the opportunity don't be afraid to seize it to be out of the country. Unless you're ready to worship men. If you consider yourself a free man try to get out at the first opportunity.

              You see Malysia has been doing great. Hongkong has been doing great, taiwan has been doing great, South Korea has been doing great. But wait they don't have Lee Kuan Yew. And this Lee Kuan Yew continuously reminding his digits that Singapore wouldn't be as it is now if it ahdn't because of him. Take a look at other successful countries...they don't have Lee Kuan Yew. No man is indispensable and when he creates the illusion
              that he is. he is merely interested in holding on to power.  The regime is not interested in its people it's only concerned on maintaining grip to power. Liars, cheaters, murderers, cowards, thugs and bully!

              <p><br>A will find a way. When you have the opportunity don't be afraid to seize it to be out of the country. Unless you're ready to worship men. If you consider yourself a free man try to get out at the first opportunity.<br><br><br>You see Malysia has been doing great. Hongkong has been doing great, taiwan has been doing great, South Korea has been doing great. But wait they don't have Lee Kuan Yew. And this Lee Kuan Yew continuously reminding his digits that Singapore wouldn't be as it is now if it ahdn't because of him. Take a look at other successful countries...they don't have Lee Kuan Yew. No man is indispensable and when he creates the illusion that he is. he is merely interested in holding on to power. The regime is not interested in its people it's only concerned on maintaining grip to power. Liars, cheaters, murderers, cowards, thugs and bully!</p>
