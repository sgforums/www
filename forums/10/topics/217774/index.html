            <div class='col-md body'>The Stern Report, commissioned by the UK Government just scared the crap out of Tony Blair a short while ago into calling it the most significant and important study ever made by the UK Government.<br><br>I have not read it yet but it seems that what scared the heck out of Blair is the evidence that Global Warming is going to cause chaos in the economy of the world.  So much so that it was said that the impact would be worse than The Great Depression and the two World Wars combined.<br><br>What is scary is that Global Warming will dramatically change the lives of everyone as sea-levels rise, causing the biggest movement of refugees as most would move away from low-lying areas into higher ground.  And as land masses shrink, places now that are dry will experience more severe drought, while other places will be lashed by intense torrential rain that will flood the areas.<br><br>Obviously what will make the politicians listen is the "economic impact" bit.  Most politicians today are in bed with Big Corporation.<br><br>I am wondering if UK is willing to listen to sense and science, will the rest of the world?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Al Gore's film "an inconvenient truth" also had great impact. Over here in NZ and Australia, once the show was screened, suddenly the politicians are talking about environmental issues.<br><br>There are encouraging signs too, like I just took notice of this new vehicle at <a href="http://www.theaircar.com" rel="nofollow">www.theaircar.com</a> which is not only environmentally friendly, but also economically viable and seems to have a good chance of hitting the market. Australia is also thinking about going into Nuclear energy, which will greatly reduce the CO2 emition.<br><br>By the way, what do you guys think about nuclear energy now? I mean, in the past, its a serious no no, but there's a recent push for it, mainly because it doesn't release a lot of green house gas, certainly much much less than fossil fuel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nuclear energy has always had a bad and undeserved reputation.<br><br>It is probably because of... Big Corporation again... where things like Public Service is forgotten and profit becomes the Holy Grail instead.<br><br>There are many ways to recycle the waste, but it is "too expensive" so they will not.<br><br>However, I can see Big Oil fighting this report and everything to the bitter end, even if the bitter end means the end of the world as we know it.</div>
