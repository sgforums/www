              <p>Let put it in another perspective, if a singaporean student was found dead below a faculty building in the University of Surabaya, indonesia with multiple wounds and the indo police just said, he committed suicide. How will Singaporeans or his parents react??</p>

                  professor in indonesia and later committed suicide, let do the
                  reverse pyschology, of course the indo can ignore it and case
                  close, but do you feel sorry for the parents? Not to mention
                  nationalities</p>

                  I agree that as parent, we will feel for our kid especailly something happen to them out of the blue.  If David is my son especially my only son, I will feel &amp; do the same if not stronger.
                  
                  
                  However there is a thin line between facts &amp; emotions, we should not let ourshelves be too distorted by emotions that we end up blaming other people for our own wrong doing.
              
              Anyway I apologise for any loose talk earlier...

              <p><br>nevermind your loose talk, at least you r gentlemen enuf. Emotion is one thing, but the fact is not even proven, table it out and let all to see, why not singapore govt/doctors explain and discuss with the indonesia  govt/doctor who also viewed his body with different finding and let find a neutral solution, if the still cannot do it, let the international court arbitrade it. So that all can rest in peace.</p>

              <p>Same goes to the Indonesia young model who married the Malaysia prince, there was arguement going on as to assult sex or self inflict, and when the internation panel of doctors examined the injuries on young wife, it is indeed assulted sex.</p>

              <p><span class="source">Jakarta Globe</span></p>
              <blockquote>Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said on Wednesday that the government
              was committed to ensuring that Indonesian citizens received fair trials
              overseas.<br><br>“However, we have to be aware that there are
              limitations for us not to interfere [with trials] as we would not also
              want that to happen with our court,” he said.<br><br>Hassan said the
              Indonesian Embassy in Singapore acted mostly as an observer to the
              case, but said more could have been done to help the family if they had
              been more cooperative.<br><br>“How the embassy helped the family depended mainly on them, including in the legal process,” he said.<br><br>For example, the Hassan said that family could have used the Singaporean legal advisor that the embassy keeps on its payroll.<br><br>“They
              preferred to hire an Indonesian lawyer who surely will not have access
              to the Singaporean court and does not have a license to practice
              there,” he said.<br><br>The minister said the government remained
              “committed to supporting and protecting Indonesian citizens” but said
              that any assistance given to the family would extend only as far as
              Singaporean laws permitted.</blockquote>

              <p><br>I felt sorry for the family of late David Widjaja but it seemed the case is is like the scenario David stabbed professor n subsequently a fight broke out between the two of them, prof grabbed the knife n David kena hurt. Prof escaped n ran out of the room shouting for the help. David also ran out n went to the rooftop n committed sucide. Also from the same country but I felt that the family cannot accept the truth.</p>
