              <p>LHL's remark runs tangent to his commitment to a government that is accountable. he obviously has 2 sets of standards. WKS may be a nice guy who means well, and no doubt he works hard too; but it doesn't absolve him from his incompetency. MHA is under his jurisdiction. for the buck to stop at a level way below him, i.e. they even `buffer' the fault, is laughable. can we take them seriouslyã€€ï½ˆï½…ï½Žï½ƒï½…ï½†ï½�ï½’ï½”ï½ˆ?</p>

              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> Media Release: Mr Wong Kan Seng, resign</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore Democrats<br><br>The SDP has hitherto refrained from
              calling for Mr Wong Kan Seng's resignation in the wake of the Mas
              Selamat fiasco even though a strong case could be made for it. We were
              waiting to see if Mr Wong showed any contrition for the debacle.<br><strong><br>But
              the Minister has ducked, parried and done everything except assume
              responsibility for what happened. </strong>With the release of the Committee of
              Inquiry (COI) report and his utterances in Parliament, calling for Mr
              Wong's resignation is now imperative.<br><br>We present the SDP's case against the Minister and his top officers:</p>
              <p>With the partial revelation of the security arrangements at the
              Whitley Road Detention Centre (WRDC), it is clear that there was
              systemic failure within the operational structure of the facility. It
              was not just missteps on the part of lower-ranking police officers but
              rather wholesale negligence at the most senior levels.<br><br>If the
              COI report is to be believed, the junior officers should not be the
              only ones to bear responsibility of Mr Mas Selamat's alleged escape.<br><br>For
              example, security fixtures such as the installation of window grilles
              is the responsibility of administrative planners, not Gurhka officers
              or Special Duty Operatives.<br><br>Likewise, the effective and
              fail-safe operation of the CCTV system is beyond the control of
              officers charged with the day-to-day guarding of the detainees.<br><br>Similarly,
              the guards cannot be responsible for the "cement ledge" that enabled Mr
              Selamat to climb out of the toilet or for the positioning of the
              so-called "weak perimeter fence."<br><br>Such physical structures can
              only be put in place by planners and administrators of the Centre. Who
              in the Singapore Police Force is responsible for the installation,
              design or construction of the WRDC's features? <br><br>The Director of
              the Internal Security Department and his superior the Commissioner of
              Police, of course. They, and not just those handling Mr Selamat, must
              be held accountable. There is no wriggle room here: Commissioner Koh
              Boon Hui and his ISD chief are culpable of the security meltdown. Their
              resignation is a must.<br><br>What about their political boss, Minister
              Wong Kan Seng? It may be argued that Mr Wong cannot be in charge of the
              minutiae of the running of the WRDC. It must be pointed out, however,
              that the "security lapses", to use Mr Wong's words, were not fleeting
              moments of distraction. The structural weaknesses within the ISD Centre
              were yawning holes waiting to be exploited.<br><br>For instance, how
              can the Minister-in-charge of prison security not tell his subordinates
              what must be the ABCs of prison security: Secure all windows and doors
              so that prisoners cannot run, walk, or crawl out through them to escape.<br><br>And
              didn't he give a directive that surveillance cameras had to be working
              24/7? He wouldn't allow the CCTV cameras outside his own residence to
              be left unmonitored or the security personnel not guarding his home for
              any period of time, would he?<br><br>But this is not the end of Mr
              Wong's culpability. <strong>His personal handling of the saga right from the
              get-go had incompetence written all over.<br><br>It took 49 seconds for
              Mr Selamat to escape, 11 minutes for the prison staff to realise this,
              but a whole four hours for Mr Wong to sound the alert to the public.</strong><br><br>It
              took another week before his Ministry told people what the escapee was
              wearing. Then Mr Selamat was walking with a "distinct limp", then that
              the limp was obvious only when he ran. Again this came only days after
              the escape during which time the prisoner could have already made his
              way to the North Pole.<br><br>One would have thought that within
              minutes after he was alerted of the escape, Mr Wong would have gathered
              his top security officials, collate data of the situation giving
              priority to the description of Mr Selamat and his possible whereabouts,
              and disseminate them to the public. This could all have been done
              within the first hour of the breakout.<br><br>But instead of
              acknowledging his own misjudgments and making a genuine effort to get
              to the bottom of the mess, the Minister cocks a snook at the public by
              appointing, or at least agreeing to the appointment of, his subordinate
              Deputy Secretary Dr Choong May Ling and former subordinate and police
              commissioner Mr Tee Tua Bah to sit on the three-member COI.<br><br>Has
              the Minister no self-respect to at least insist that the COI be not
              only independent of his influence but also seen to be so?<br><br>As a
              result the COI report, or the little that has been revealed, has been
              lampooned and ripped to shreds for its contradictory, incomplete and
              poorly explained findings. It raises more questions than answers.<br><br><strong>The
              last straw for the Singapore Democrats is Mr Wong casting blame on the
              junior officers while not-so-subtlely exonerating himself. </strong>Mr Wong
              announced that junior officers "all the way up" to the supervisory and
              management levels of the WRDC will be disciplined and penalised.<br><strong><br>He
              unabashedly avoids mentioning his own role in the episode. This is the
              hallmark of a man without honour and pride in his work and his
              responsibilities. When things go wrong leaders – true leaders – step up
              and take responsibility.</strong><br><br>They don't make fall guys of their subordinates to save their own skins.<strong><br><br>In truth Mr Wong's reputation is in tatters. He has demonstrated beyond doubt that he is unfit to continue with his job.</strong><br><br>Mr
              Wong Kan Seng, the SDP calls on you to stop passing the blame. Enough
              is enough. It is not the officers, it is not the window, it is not the
              toilet. <strong>It is you. Now do the right and decent thing: Resign.</strong><br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party</p>

              <p>Death maybe not killed, can be suicide. But if he is dead, can cover up to be suicide what. But please, the terrorists are not stupid. If they have no contact with MKS, they wont assume that he is hiding in some spider hole in Singapore like Saddam, they will assume that hes dead.  </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It does matter whether if he is live, dead, captured etc. These people have no conscience, no fear and no humanity. To them, the only objective is a world of chaos. They cannot be reason with and cannot be bought. Do you think if they were willing to commit suicide in order to achieve an objective, they would bother with whether or not MSK is dead or alive? If anything, MSK's escape demonstrates weakness, weakness which will be exploited . The resignation of WKS, only proves that the government is willing to work with us, and for us; for that, WKS MUST resign.</div>

              <p>Not true, ISLAMIC terrorists do have a political objective which is to make the world convert to Islam by the sword, primarily targetting USA and its allies (or satellite states). </p>
              <p> "Do you think if they were willing to commit suicide in order to achieve an objective, they would bother with whether or not <span>MSK</span> is dead or alive"</p>
              <p>Yes they do. If Osama Bin Laden is captured tommorrow, I believe al Qaeda worldwide will be severely weakened and they will have trouble recruiting more members. To take your arguement further, whether WKS resigns or not already demonstrated that Singapore IS weak. His resignation is simply to remove the incompetent person who created this problem in the first place so as not to commit further blunders and hopefully install someone who can do the job. </p>

              <p>Please TELL us WHICH third world country counter terrorism agency impressed leh. I doubt even the CIA will come forward and say "Good job so far except for this mistake". Of course those countries impressed with ISD need guidance how to silence their own opposition as well..</p>
