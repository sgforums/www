              <p>1) Mr Lee, who is secretary-general of the PAP, said: 'Change has to take place in Singapore but change must take place not (between parties) but within the PAP.</p>
              <p>'As long as the PAP changes itself, and continues to provide clean and good government, and the lives of Singaporeans improve, the country is much better off with one dominant, strong, clean, good party.'</p>
              <p>2) 'In Asia, it very seldom works because having two or more parties has not guaranteed good governance or progress,' he added, citing Taiwan as an example.</p>
              <p>3) Neither does it mean it is the PAP's job to build up the opposition. 'It's hard enough to find one team to look after the country. How can you find two? As a small country, we must have a first division team, an outstanding group of people who can make up for our many limitations,' he said.</p>
              <p>4) The PAP has managed to survive more than 50 years because it kept itself 'vigorous, lean, relevant, able to win elections', adjusting its leadership styles to 'suit new generations of Singaporeans'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) Change can never come from within the PAP because of paradigms, this is a forgone conclusion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) What makes him think that Taiwan has no good governance? The political debates can get physical in parliament, especially between 2 people who feel strongly about their points. Does Taiwan or Singapore have a higher GDP per Capita? What is the price level in Taiwan (Electricity, Petrol, GST)? On the contrary, it's better to have 2 parties or maybe even multiple parties with balanced power rather than one dominant party to dictate terms for their own personal benefits. Like Durai who had control of his board in NKF, he can decide to increase salaries to the millions at his whims and fancies. It is not the nature of man to be philantrophic in his actions, more so for the members of PAP (how often have we not heard that they are worth multi-millions, then again how many end up as CEOs of large MNCs after retirement from politics, other than the CEOs conferred by PM in GICs and GLCs), if they are not philantrophic, all the more so they will engage in actions that will benefit themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Humans by nature are greedy and selfish, and we should not endeavour these same greedy and selfish beings to control themselves. That's why a balanced opposition is required to keep either parties from being too greedy and selfish, as opposed to the current one party dominance. Asking Durai to self regulate himself, is that even a possibility? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) Why is it difficult to look for good political candidates? It's because of the old man's way of suppressing opposition in the past, therefore it's hard to find good opposition candidates. Those that join the PAP are folks that wish to reap higher financial rewards, not those that truly wish to do the Singapore citizens good, merely a case of "adverse selection".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) The PAP survived 50 years by employing scare tactics and media propaganda. The battle wasn't fought on equal footings like other democracies, rather through the employment of manipulative crafts.</span></p>

              <p>When you have no new ideas of your own, the easiest thing to do I guess is to follow and not ask any questions. It's really simple, cognitively it saves us the need to think, it avoids having to feel the anxieties from fear, it fortifies our sense of security.. These are just few of the reasons why people would vote for the PAP en masse. The whole pitch about change through the PAP is an appeal to people who want more choices, yet are unwilling or uncertain about a future that deviates radically from the present course (and then u question what the hell is our present course?). So until there is an alternative which is able to address the above requisites, we will and shall always be a single party entity. We shouldn't bang out assessment of that notion on value judgements such as it's good or bad, that just simplifies the whole issue and opens it up to biases of all kinds. We should be asking ourselves a more general question.. such as with the way we are heading, what would Singapore be like another decade from now, what would our lives be like. If the answer is in the positive, of course uve found ur answer. If it is anything either than that, maybe one has to think abt the issues a little more? </p>
