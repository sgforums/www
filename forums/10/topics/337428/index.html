              PM says party must evolve, reinvent itself and engage S'poreans

              CHANGE must come to Singapore - but within the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) rather than in the form of a two-party system.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday stressed that the PAP must constantly evolve to keep up with the times. This means renewing its membership and leadership ranks, and coming up with fresh ways to engage Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee, who is secretary-general of the PAP, said: 'Change has to take place in Singapore but change must take place not (between parties) but within the PAP.</p>
              <p>'As long as the PAP changes itself, and continues to provide clean and good government, and the lives of Singaporeans improve, the country is much better off with one dominant, strong, clean, good party.'</p>
              <p>Addressing more than 1,000 cadres at the annual PAP Conference, Mr Lee acknowledged the desire for change among electorates across the world.</p>
              <p>'It has happened in Australia, it's happened in New Zealand recently,' he noted. And most notably, in the United States, too, where Democratic candidate Barack Obama swept to victory on his campaign platform of change.</p>
              <p>'So the country is set on a new direction. And if Obama succeeds, that's good.</p>
              <p>'If he doesn't succeed after four years or eight years, the Americans will try again with a new president, change party, the Republicans set a new direction.'</p>
              <p>But while the US is a big country with a big pool from which to find political talent, there is no such guarantee in smaller places, he said.</p>
              <p>'In Asia, it very seldom works because having two or more parties has not guaranteed good governance or progress,' he added, citing Taiwan as an example.</p>
              <p>In the last decade, its unhappy voters had swung from the Kuomintang (KMT), to the Democratic Progressive Party, and back to KMT again.</p>
              <p>'By Western definitions of democracy, Taiwan qualifies because it's got two changes of government - in, out, in.</p>
              <p>'But it is not a political system which is working properly. And I don't think you want that kind of political system in Singapore,' he said.</p>
              <p>But this does not mean the PAP has a blank cheque: It has to account to voters at the polls every five years. New parties will emerge quickly to take it on if 'something goes wrong with the PAP', he said.</p>
              <p>Neither does it mean it is the PAP's job to build up the opposition. 'It's hard enough to find one team to look after the country. How can you find two? As a small country, we must have a first division team, an outstanding group of people who can make up for our many limitations,' he said.</p>
              <p>The PAP has managed to survive more than 50 years because it kept itself 'vigorous, lean, relevant, able to win elections', adjusting its leadership styles to 'suit new generations of Singaporeans'.</p>
              <p>He cited initiatives such as the PAP Policy Forum in which younger party members discuss policymaking issues, intra-party elections to district committees, and establishing a presence in the new media.</p>
              <p>It is difficult for political parties to stay vigorous, he allowed.</p>
              <p>In Japan for instance, the Liberal Democratic Party has been in power for half a century, but 'has not sustained its vigour'. With no nurturing of younger talent, there is a loss of energy and fresh ideas, observed Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>China's Communist Party, however, is trying to keep itself strong, vigorous and tied to the ground. This was why it was interested in Singapore's political experience, and sent many study teams here.</p>
              <p>But Mr Lee cautioned that this does not mean the PAP had found the magic formula to keep itself strong.</p>
              <p>'It is always difficult to carry out self-renewal, to respond creatively to new challenges, to reinvent ourselves. But it is vital for the PAP to make every attempt,' he said.</p>

              <p>But while the US is a big country with a big pool from which to
                                      find political talent, there is no such guarantee in smaller
                                      places, he said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Oh wow.. again, the lame excuse of talent. I wonder if he considers himself and his current team as talented because the situation we're in certainly doesn't feel like it.</span></p>
              <p>'In Asia, it very seldom works because having two or more
                                      parties has not guaranteed good governance or progress,' he added,
                                      citing Taiwan as an example.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and a single party encourage a despot to become corrupted dictor with no regards for its citizen's opinion or welfare.</span></p>
              <p>In the last decade, its unhappy voters had swung from the
                                      Kuomintang (KMT), to the Democratic Progressive Party, and back to
                                      KMT again.</p>
              <p>'By Western definitions of democracy, Taiwan qualifies because
                                      it's got two changes of government - in, out, in.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">they don't seem to be suffering badly from it. at worst case, they seem to be doing just as badly as we are but as I understand, Singapore is in a worse predicament than Taiwan.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But it is not a political system which is working properly. And
                                      I don't think you want that kind of political system in Singapore,'
                                      he said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">what arrogance to decide what Singaporeans should or should not want. give us a fair election when EVERY SINGLE VOTE COUNT.</span></p>
