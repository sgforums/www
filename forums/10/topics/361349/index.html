              <p><strong>3 principles for change </strong></p>
              <p>By 
              						
              																
              															Zakir Hussain,  Political Correspondent</p>
              <p>CHANGES to Singapore's political system are in the works and on Sunday,
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong spelt out three principles that will
              guide these amendments.</p>
              <p>One, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they must be fair to all political parties</strong></span>; two,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> they should
              result in a strong, effective Government after an election</strong></span>; and three,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they must ensure diverse views are represented in Parliament. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Mr Goh also said that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will give details of the changes in Parliament this week. </strong></span></p>
              <p>He made these remarks to reporters at a community event when he was
              asked to comment on the subject, which President S R Nathan had touched
              on in his opening Address to Parliament last Monday.</p>
              <p>President Nathan had said: 'Our political system is not set
              in stone. Singapore politics must evolve over time, as the world and
              our society change.'</p>
              <p>The President's Address, including the plans and policies of
              individual ministries, will be debated by Parliament from Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh, in setting out the three objectives, said: 'Whatever
              changes which shall be made must be based on certain principles.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 'First, they must be fair to all contesting political
              parties. That means changes must not be biased in favour of one party
              or the other </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Second, they must end up, after the election, with a strong,
              effective Government. That means you do not want to have a system,
              which ends up with a weak, hung Parliament, and then you have a
              coalition Government. That is politically unstable for Singapore. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>'And third, they must facilitate representation of diverse views in Parliament, including views of opposition parties.'</p>

              <p><strong>3 principles for change</strong></p>
              <p>By Zakir Hussain, Political Correspondent</p>
              <p>CHANGES to Singapore's political system are in the works and on Sunday, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong spelt out three principles that will guide these amendments.</p>
              <p>One, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they must be fair to all political parties</strong></span>; two, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they should result in a strong, effective Government after an election</strong></span>; and three, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they must ensure diverse views are represented in Parliament.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Mr Goh also said that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will give details of the changes in Parliament this week.</strong></span></p>
              <p>He made these remarks to reporters at a community event when he was asked to comment on the subject, which President S R Nathan had touched on in his opening Address to Parliament last Monday.</p>
              <p>President Nathan had said: 'Our political system is not set in stone. Singapore politics must evolve over time, as the world and our society change.'</p>
              <p>The President's Address, including the plans and policies of individual ministries, will be debated by Parliament from Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh, in setting out the three objectives, said: 'Whatever changes which shall be made must be based on certain principles.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'First, they must be fair to all contesting political parties. That means changes must not be biased in favour of one party or the other</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Second, they must end up, after the election, with a strong, effective Government. That means you do not want to have a system, which ends up with a weak, hung Parliament, and then you have a coalition Government. That is politically unstable for Singapore.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>'And third, they must facilitate representation of diverse views in Parliament, including views of opposition parties.'</p>

              <p>If you look at the voting trend in the past few elections, people are glamouring for change, esp the younger generation. <br><br>PAP not matter how strong in the past, must acknowledge this new trend. <br><br>An invisible force that they are slowly but surely acknowledging but try doing so without embarassing themselves in the process.    </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In the usual PAP double talk, the proposed change is leading to no change.</p>
              <p>After 52 years of PAP manipulation and self-serving schemes to bolster its own political fortunes at the expense of all other Political Parties in Singapore - can we expect the PAP dominated Parliament to be altruistic in divesting its own political security and level the playing field to every Political Party in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Point 2 has already shown that the PAP is insincere in its proposed plans, when it require that after any Election it must lead to a strong and effective government, and when the PAP will believe that a weak and hung Parliament will lead to a coalition Government.</p>
              <p>This belief will surely make nonsense of Point 3, where they intend to have more diverse voices to be heard in Parliament, when at the same time the PAP is afraid of a weak and hung Parliament.</p>
              <p>Point 3 seems to be another PAP move to have diverse voices heard in Parliament through some ultra vires process by tweaking the rules for legitimate representation in Parliament. There will be moves to have more Nominated Members of Parliament that will enter Parliament outside of the election process.</p>
              <p>Is it any good for Singapore - if our voices are heard but ignored ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thinking behind Point 2 is a fallacy, as for the last 5 years, Indonesia and India has seen strong progress with Coaltion Governments in power.</p>
              <p>Indonesia's President Yudhoyono could not have proven his abilities when he was a new comer in politics. However, through a coalition with Golkar over the last 5 years, he has shown his mettle of tolerance, efficient government that brought progress to Indonesia compared to two successive presidents that had overwhelming election wins, but brought Indonesia no progress.</p>
              <p>Yudhoyona's Democratic Party came in with overwhelming lead in the recently concluded elections.</p>
              <p>India's Congress Party was without any charismatic leader after the death of the last Ghandi generation, and PM Singh was an unknown political factor with experience only in foreign affairs. Over the last 5 years of coalition between the Congress Party and other minor political parties, India has again returned the Congress Party in a sweeping election victory in the recently concluded elections - as the last coalition arrangement by the Congress Party had brought economic progress to India.</p>
              <p>Coalition government does not necessarily result from a weak or hung parliament, as seen in the coalition governments in Israel that faced constant threats from her Arab neighbors</p>
              <p>Weak or hung parliament can be a result of weak and unclear political policies, and indiscipline within the Party ranks in Parliament.</p>
              <p>This explains for the PAP decision of never lifting the Parliamentary Whip to allow their own Backbenchers to vote according to their conscience - even as they are allowed to air the views of their constituents against Party Policies.</p>
              <p>PAP's idea for "change" will mean "no change" - as seen in their actions over the past 52 years.</p>
              <p>After 52 years of uninterrupted political power, the PAP has become too accustomed to unfettered rule by dictating to the population whatever the PAP leadership will dream up at their "leadership sessions" - and implemented without any consultation with the population.</p>
