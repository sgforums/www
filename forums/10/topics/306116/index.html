              <p>I am just curious to know is PAP the only gahmen in the whole world to make buying annuity compulsory for the citizens. </p>
              <p>Smart alec lee hsien loong said he is not making spore a welfare state so I guess making citizens pay for annuity will allow PAP to continue to draw super high world class pay without any worry about taking care of the old.   Well, we taxpayers are paying for their pension, and they make us pay for our own "pension".   </p>
              <p>I believe there are better ways than to force people to buy annuity.   Afterall, it is our life we are living and PAP should not step in to make decision for us that we have to buy annuity unless PAP pay for the annuity.  PAP does not want people of Singapore to be a burden to them, however I think PAP is a burden to many of the people in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Australia is different as the govt is into providing welfare for the people.   It is stated clearly by the beloved son of the long life old man lee kuan yew that he is not making Singapore a welfare state (he said this for a number of times already).    We have to take care of the gahmen PAP in Singapore, PAP enjoys more benefits than the people of Singapore who feed them.</p>
              <p>PAP can suggest and get NTUC come out with the annuity and encourage people to buy but NOT force us to buy solely to serve their purpose so that we will not be a burden to them when we grow old.    If they don't make buying annuity compulsory, people will not get so pissed off by them.   If they are paying part of the annuity, I believe people will not be so sore, too.   To me, PAP making it compulsory for citizens to buy annuity is just like a robber forcing into my throat to tell me to give my money to him.</p>

              <p>The PAP government everything use force.Remember what senile old man Lee Kuan Yew said in the past?He said he learn from the British and Japanese the way of ruling Singapore,they use force,thats why Lou Lee now is using the same tactics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But,he didnt realise that the British and Japanese will fall also becoz of their dictatorial tactics.Thats why,Lee Empire will also fall in future after Lou Lee death.</p>

              <p>Well, you have just suggested money making for PAP.   PAP have earned enough from the people, think it is really high time they give it back to the people. </p>

              <p>I am only joking. I don't think that PAP will find IPA feasible...I suspect there's not enough funds for the payout.</p>

              <p> If that is true, then it really sounds like a dishonest business man trying to cover up his ass.   If they are going to use the ordinary account in CPF for the annuity, I bet many will curse and swear at them, especially those who has not much $ in the ordinary account because of the housing loan.   STrange, some of my friends told me their medisave account in CPF has much more money than the ordinary account. </p>
              <p>The whole annuity thing is just crap.   It is just a way to con the money of the people of Singapore.  Believe no government in the whole will be this scheming as PAP to do such unscrupulous thing.</p>
