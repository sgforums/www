              <p> </p>
              <div>TAIPEI’S CITY Hall is so proud of its mass rapid transit (MRT)
                  system that it runs a competition every year, asking people to send in
                  poems about the MRT. I can see why. The MRT is clean and comfortable
                  (in addition to chewing gum, the nasty habit of betel chewing nut has
                  been banned). People queue up in a civilised fashion before boarding
                  trains. And, when the doors open, they don’t barge in before passengers
                  can exit.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Signs and announcements are in Chinese and English and all
                  carriages have electronic displays showing which station is coming up
                  next. Every carriage has special seats for old folks, pregnant women or
                  people with disabilities. I’ve never seen fit, young people pretending
                  to be asleep in these seats.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>However, the best part about Taipei’s MRT is its frequency.
                  According to Taipei Rapid Transit Corp (TRTC), the company that runs
                  the system, trains arrive at two to four-minute intervals at peak
                  hours. Off-peak, it is four to seven minutes.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In reality, it is much more frequent. I know because I’ve timed
                  it. At peak hours, trains come as often as every minute. As for
                  off-peak hours? Well, I’ve never had to wait more than three or four
                  minutes. As a result, even during the morning rush hour, the trains are
                  never as packed as they are in Singapore.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>TRTC has won praise not just locally but internationally. It has
                  been ranked No 1 for reliability for four straight years (2004 to
                  2007), according to the Nova/CoMET International Railway Benchmarking
                  Group (of which Singapore’s SMRT Corp is also part).</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> All this got me wondering just how TRTC is able to deliver such a
                  world-class MRT service. Perhaps, it doesn’t have to transport as many
                  people as in the crowded Lion City? Perhaps, it’s government-owned and
                  isn’t under pressure to make as much money as possible and can run more
                  trains?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>So, I pulled up some numbers (see table). And the broad conclusion
                  is that Taipei proves it is possible to offer a high-quality,
                  high-frequency and affordable MRT service without losing money. It also
                  suggests that certain services, such as public transport, tend to
                  function optimally as natural monopolies and ought not to be owned by
                  companies that seek to maximise profits.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Let’s look first at the one common element between the two: the
                  cost of taking a train. Average ticket prices in Singapore and Taipei
                  are about $1. This is pretty low by international standards, as anyone
                  who has had the misfortune to take the London Underground knows.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Singapore and Taipei are also pretty dense cities, but the latter
                  packs more folks (5.5 million of them) into a smaller area (272 sq km).
                  In comparison, Singapore is home to 4.6 million residents spread over
                  some 692 sq km.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As such, in terms of coverage, Singapore’s network of five MRT
                  lines is more extensive, totalling 109.4km, versus TRTC’s 74.4km
                  network. However, TRTC has more stations on its smaller network, which
                  means less distance between stations and greater convenience for
                  commuters.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #800000; font-weight: bold;">MORE TRAIN RUNS IN TAIPEI</span></div>
              <div>Just how many people take the MRT each day? In 2007, Singapore’s
                  MRT moved an average of 1.56 million people a day. That’s just over a
                  third more than what TRTC transported last year. So yes, TRTC’s network
                  is smaller and it moves fewer people, which is one reason it feels less
                  crowded.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>However, what is illuminating is the difference in frequency.<strong> Last
                  year, TRTC made an average of 2,171 train runs a day. SMRT clocked in
                  at just over 1,000 a day for its fiscal year ended March 2008.</strong> This is
                  not strictly an apples with apples comparison. SMRT’s system is older,
                  has heavier loads and travels further than TRTC’s — factors which play
                  a role in how often trains can be run. The comparison also doesn’t
                  include data from SBS Transit, which runs the North- East Line. But, as
                  SMRT accounts for more than four fifths of total MRT ridership, it is
                  fairly representative of the whole picture.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <p>Since February this year, SMRT has added about 900 extra train
                  trips each week. According to the company, on average, its train
                  frequency during peak hours is between two and five minutes. During
                  off-peak hours, it is now between 3.5 and seven minutes. Given the
                  existing signalling system and infrastructure, its average peak-hour
                  frequency puts it among the top 20% of the world’s major metro
                  operators, SMRT adds.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.theedgesingapore.com/images/stories/TES350-Dec22-2008/taipei-mrt.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="260"></p>
              <div><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>SMRT MORE PROFITABLE</strong></span></div>
              <div>Still, it’s safe to assume that its bumped-up frequency continues
                  to lag TRTC’s. And this, to an extent, is reflected in SMRT’s
                  bottomline, which is much heftier than TRTC’s. In FY2008, SMRT’s rail
                  operations saw revenue of $436.9 million. Earnings before interest and
                  tax was $129.3 million. In comparison, TRTC saw approximately $415
                  million in fare revenue in 2007 and just $41.3 million in pre-tax
                  profit.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>TRTC is 73.75% owned by the Taipei City Government. The Ministry
                  of Transportation and Communications owns a further 17.14% while the
                  Taipei County Government owns 8.75%. Clearly, public-listed SMRT’s
                  returns on its rail operations are far better for its shareholders than
                  TRTC’s. However, TRTC — which has been profitable every year except its
                  first two — is better for its commuters, who have been inspired to pen
                  a poem or two in praise of their well-regarded metro.</div>

              i was also greatly impressed by the taipei mrt system. for a start, we can draw similar lines here like those in taipei to guide people to queue up. and i also notice that the lines for queues in taipei is on one side of the doors, leaving the other side for easier alighting by passengers. 
              
              i also feel our stations are small compared to those in taipei... not sure if this is a fact.. those in taipei are spacious...

              <p>is TRTC run as privately listed company??</p>
              <p>abt 30% of singapore commuters on SMRT are foreigners, are they
                                          train to queue behind yellow lines before the door open? i dont
                                          taipei has that much foreigners by comparison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, i am not a supporters of SMRT either.</p>
