              <h1>Graham Cornes blasts footy's  disturbing drug culture</h1>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="article-publish">
              <p class="author">GRAHAM CORNES</p>
              <p class="published-date">April 05, 2008 01:20am</p>
              </div>
              
              <p><strong>THE
              scene could not have been more obvious or more stark. The well known
              media/entertainment figure was bent over the bench in the men's toilet,
              inhaling a white powder.</strong></p>
              <p>Two people were with
              him, waiting expectantly. One was a current AFL footballer, the other a
              senior SANFL footballer. Their only regard for privacy was the
              separation the toilet provided from the other guests.</p>
              <p>The other setting was much more blatant; perhaps desperate is a
              better word. Three figures beside the Torrens Lake, metres off the path
              that is used each day by thousands of walkers, joggers, commuters,
              hunched over the improvised paraphernalia that is used to inject the
              poison into their systems.</p>
              <p>At first glance they could have been uni students, but on closer
              examination there was a hardness and a grime etched into the
              street-weary faces that betrayed their circumstances.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> The needle, the
              spoon and the flame, as cliched as that sounds, left no doubt about
              what they were doing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The latter of those two incidents, I witnessed personally</span>. The other
              was described to me by a friend, whose judgment and media-honed powers
              of observation I would trust.</p>
              <p>The circumstances of the participants seem so vastly different, but
              are they really? Is the junkie who shoots up in broad daylight beside a
              major pedestrian and cyclist thoroughfare that much different to the
              celebrity who snorts for recreation? The only thing that separates them
              is income and the degree of desperation.</p>
              <p>What is most disturbing about the incident that involved the media
              figure and the two footballers is that it happened within the last
              month, in this current football season.</p>
              <p>My friend went to great pains to point out that he didn't see either
              of the footballers inhale or ingest the substance, but it seemed
              obvious they were waiting their turns. But anyway, how could an AFL
              footballer be so dumb and an SANFL footballer so disrespectful as to
              put themselves in that situation?</p>
              <p>Wayne Carey shocked us all with his frankness and the depth of his
              self-destructive indulgences. He evoked many different emotions, but
              overwhelmingly the sentiment of those watching was of sympathy, even
              pity. The men shook their heads that such a powerful man could be
              reduced to this, and the women, other than the cold-hearted shrews,
              wanted to mother him.</p>
              <p>However, for all his frankness, there remained a lingering doubt
              about when he actually started to use cocaine. Was it really after he
              finished playing football? We know too many AFL footballers have tested
              positive for illicit drugs.</p>
              <p> We know Ben Cousins has ingested and inhaled the poison during the
              latter half of his career. We know habitual users can be in a constant
              state of denial, so it's very hard not to be cynical about the veracity
              of such statements.</p>
              <p>Besides, there were always rumours. While rumours don't necessarily
              equate to the facts, rumours in recent years have been enough for at
              least one of the Adelaide teams to seriously address them with its
              playing group.</p>
              <p>Of course, as the Ben Cousins saga played out, the club was even
              more compelled to counsel and monitor its playing group. However, if
              all clubs have adopted a similar drug education program, it is
              obviously not working at all of them.</p>
              <p>Perhaps there will always be the individuals who don't want to
              listen and don't want the help until they are caught, but then it's too
              late. It's a pity those feelings of remorse and contrition can't be
              felt before the drug-users are caught.</p>
              <p>The SANFL situation is different only because of the differing
              levels of professionalism and the SANFL's more limited resources.</p>
              <p>The SANFL tests for performance-enhancing substances under the WADA
              code. Like most sporting associations it does not test for illicit
              drugs. If those drugs show up under the Australian Sports Anti-drug
              Agency testing, it is reported to the SANFL but no sanctions apply.</p>
              <p>At nearly $900 per individual test, illicit drug testing is too
              expensive for secondary leagues and minor sports to fund. And indeed,
              why should sport be made to carry the major cost of what is primarily
              society's problem?</p>
              <p>So some SANFL players exploit the system. There are reports of
              certain venues frequented by local footballers where a drug culture is
              rife. I know of at least one SANFL player who contemplated leaving his
              club because of the drug habits of some of his team-mates.</p>
              <p>However, that is all apocryphal. It's as serious an issue for the
              SANFL as it is for the AFL, the other major football codes and any of
              the Olympic Sports, but it simply does not have the resources to
              enforce the ideal.</p>
              <p>The AFL player and the SANFL veteran involved in the disturbing
              escapade described above, both need a good kick up the backside. More
              than that, they need to be exposed publicly.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most of us are too sympathetic and considerate
              towards them and their clubs to do that. It's a pity they weren't as
              considerate.</p>

              <p>The Spotlight fallacy is committed when a person uncritically assumes that all members or cases of a certain class or type are like those that receive the most attention or coverage in the media. This line of “reasoning” has the following form:</p>
              <p>1. Xs with quality Q receive a great deal of attention or coverage in the media. 2. Therefore all Xs have quality Q.</p>
              <p>This line of reasoning is fallacious since the mere fact that someone or something attracts the most attention or coverage in the media does not mean that it automatically represents the whole population. For example, suppose a mass murderer from Old Town, Maine, received a great deal of attention in the media. It would hardly follow that everyone from the town is a mass murderer.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Spotlight fallacy derives its name from the fact that receiving a great deal of attention or coverage is often referred to as being in the spotlight. It is similar to Hasty Generalization, Biased Sample and Misleading Vividness because the error being made involves generalizing about a population based on an inadequate or flawed sample. The Spotlight Fallacy is a very common fallacy. This fallacy most often occurs when people assume that those who receive the most media attention actually represent the groups they belong to. For example, some people began to believe that all those who oppose abortion are willing to gun down doctors in cold blood simply because those incidents received a great deal of media attention. Since the news media typically cover people or events that are unusual or exceptional, it is somewhat odd for people to believe that such people or events are representative.</span></p>
