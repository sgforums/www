            <div class='col-md body'>When SMRT workers nearly went on strike<br>Friday Â• September 23, 2005<br><br>Lee Ching wern<br>chingwern@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>SINGAPOREANS take peaceful industrial relations for granted. But unknown to most, a strike that could have grounded thousands of commuters nearly took place three years ago.<br><br>In a surprising revelation yesterday, labour chief Lim Boon Heng told reporters how workers at SMRT Corporation almost went on strike in 2002 after the management backtracked on an agreement it had earlier signed with the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU).<br><br>"Singapore has been strike-free since 1986. But three years ago, we almost had a strike in Singapore because of a disagreement in SMRT," said Mr Lim, the secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), in a media conference on the sidelines of NTUC's Pre-ordinary Delegates Conference 2005.<br><br>According to the collective agreement signed between SMRT and the union in 2001, SMRT staff were entitled to a 3 per cent service increment in 2002. But when the time came, SMRT refused to cough up the amount.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "That made the employees so unhappy that they wanted to go on strike. The strike was averted at the eleventh hour when we drew the attention of the board of directors of the company to what was happening and the matter was resolved."<br><br>According to NTWU president Mohd Yunos Awang, the dispute affected some 3,000 workers including SMRT's station staff, train operators and engineering staff. About 2,300 of NTWU's 15,000 members are from SMRT.<br><br>He told Today: "After the first few rounds of negotiations, we were informed that management refused to pay. When the workers heard about it, they started calling us with questions and we had to manage the situation. We were willing to compromise at 2.5 per cent, but the management refused.<br><br>"There was a deadlock, but we, as a union, cannot stay idle. We then told the management we were ready for industrial action."<br><br>This got the management worried. It relented and, through NTWU's executive secretary Ong Ah Heng, informed workers that SMRT would pay the promised 3 per cent.<br><br>Since 1978, Singapore has not experienced any industrial unrest, except for a two-day strike in 1986, when a branch union of the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees' Union took an American company, Hydril, to task for anti-union activities.<br><br>Mr Lim, who was then NTUC assistant secretary-general, said at the time: "We don't like to see our record of strike-free industrial relations in Singapore for eight years go down the drain. But we can't allow workers to be treated this way."<br><br>To give Singaporeans a better idea of the hard work NTUC's industrial relations officers have been putting in behind closed doors, Mr Lim also cited another example. The Supreme Court recently outsourced the function of its shorthand writers to private vendors.<br><br>"Because of the narrow interpretation of certain procedures within the civil service, the employees were told that if they opted for a special resignation scheme, then they are forbidden to join the vendor that is taking over this function for this high court. So on the intervention of the union, with the support of NTUC, this matter was resolved in a way the majority of the employees found to be most acceptable," said Mr Lim.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So far I have not witness anybody trying to cheat by tapping the card earlier than where the commuter is going to alight!There may be a small number doing such monkey acts but to impose a jail sentence or a fine of $5000 or more on such petty act may make the world laughing at a rich but stinking nation like Singapore!Why Singapore always take a shortcut to solve any problems!Why they did not take a bit of trouble to find out more and why those commuters cheat on that few cents? Are they too poor to be able to afford to pay that extra few cents, how much they have tried to help these poor people?Why they increase the bus and MRT fares in the first place when the companies are still making tons of money? Why they took a shortcut to increase fares in order to make it more profitable to please the shareholders and not cutting the excesses enjoy by their top guns? Why they did not cut  wastages to save costs? Why they did not want to spend a bit to educate the public not to cheat, rather than taking a short cut to threaten  or fine or jail them just because of that few cents! By doing so, there may be some unfortunate absent minded commuters going to jail for their aged and short memory or poverty!I really feel shameful to be part of this campaign to jail  a poor commuter who wilfully or inadvertently cheat that few cents!<br><br>Most Singaporeans do not mind helping those who are short of coins after they board the bus! I have seen many generous Singaporeans doing that and personally I have helped many on the journey through life!Why is Singapore having such unsympathetic companies around and is Singapore proud to have them around????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ez-link: 4,100 incorrect transactions remain<br><br>IT IS indeed heartening to learn from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) that the ez-link system achieves a 99.9 per cent reliability rate and that 'cases of wrong deductions' have decreased from 0.27 per cent to just 0.006 per cent year on year ('Ez-link system highly reliable'; ST, Sept 24).<br><br>However, beyond these statistics, there are still some hard numbers to grapple with. With the reported 4.1 million transactions a day, a 99.9 per cent reliability rate still means that 4,100 transactions are incorrectly processed each day. I can only assume this means wrong deductions. That is equivalent to almost 1.5 million erroneous deductions a year, which is a lot of money.<br><br>I would also like to ask the LTA if the statistics on 'cases of wrong deductions' were taken from registered reports of such cases, that is, commuters filing a claim for a refund.<br><br>If so, I think it is grossly inaccurate because I am sure there are many, if not more, cases that are not reported.<br><br>If, however, the 'cases of wrong deductions' cited indeed came straight from the source system, I would like to ask the LTA what it would take for it to initiate an automatic refund to the affected stored-value cards. After all, at a very impressive failure rate of 0.006 per cent, we are dealing with only 250 transactions a day.<br><br>This is the responsible thing to do, and would mean a lot to commuters in the lower-income group, where every cent counts.<br><br>Joseph Wong Yong Lye<br></div>
