            <div class='col-md body'>COMMUTERS who cheat on bus and taxi fares could end up behind bars under proposed legislation to stamp out a problem that has dogged Singaporean transport operators for years.<br><br>Bus companies, for example, lose an estimated $9 million a year to fare cheats.<br><br>The penalties aimed at protecting bus firms and cabbies against cheats are similar to those provided by the Rapid Transit Systems Act for rail operators.<br><br>Typically, a dishonest commuter taps his ez-link card on the exit reader well before his intended stop. This way, he is charged a lower fare.<br><br>Under proposed amendments to the Public Transport Council Act introduced in Parliament yesterday, bus commuters found by council-appointed inspectors to have paid incorrect fares will face a penalty charge.<br><br>Those who fail to pay this yet-to-be-determined charge face fines of up to $1,000. Repeat offenders face up to $2,000 in fines and risk a jail term of up to six months.<br><br>SBS Transit spokesman Tammy Tan said: 'The proposed changes take into account the fact that our drivers get cheated, whether intentionally or not. While the majority of our customers do not cheat, there is a small proportion who do, and they are penalising those who pay the full fare.'<br><br>Currently, those caught underpaying bus fares will only be required to make up the difference, said Ms Tan, who hopes the proposed changes 'will deter incidences of fare misuse'.<br><br>Those who cheat cabbies will be dealt with more swiftly.<br><br>They immediately face a fine of $1,000 for the first offence, and $2,000 or a jail term of up to six months for subsequent offences.<br><br>'The new section 24D criminalises the failure to pay taxi fares,' says an explanatory note accompanying the proposed legislation.<br><br>According to ComfortDelGro, which controls 77 per cent of Singapore's 22,000 taxis, its cabbies face more than 40 cases of non-payment a month.<br><br>Veteran cabby C K Chan, 53, said he feels powerless when a fare does not pay. 'I think some of these people know that we can't do anything to them. This new law should make things better.'<br><br>Other proposed amendments include a five-year operator licence for bus companies.<br><br>Currently, bus operators apply for annual route licences. The extra requirement is expected to give the Public Transport Council more teeth to enforce service standards<br></div>

She had been taking this service for the past nine months and had been paying $1 each time she took it.<br><br>On Sept 10, she boarded bus number 13 at bus-stop B16 Upper East Coast Road at around 2pm. She was told by the driver that she had to pay $1.30 for the journey home. Unfortunately, she did not bring extra money and told the driver.<br><br>The driver dropped her off at bus-stop B02 Marine Terrace. Stranded with no money, my daughter had to walk all the way home.

Is it not true that the fare that a commuter pays is determined by the distance travelled and not is left to the discretion of the bus-driver?<br><br>Is this a case of victimising a young and naive girl? Was the 30 cents more important to the driver than the safety of a twelve-year-old girl? In a job where one deals with the public, couldn't the bus driver have exercised better judgement?<br><br>I am sure there are many parents like us who allow our children to take public transport alone, believing that the safety of our children will not be jeopardised at any cost.<br><br>I would like the Singapore Bus Service to answer my queries and educate their drivers so as to avoid a mishap in future and risk losing the confidence of parents like us.<br><br>M.

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't you think our public transport system sucks?<br><br>First, they have a public transport council who does not use the public transport (they drive). They decide the prices adjustment for the operators to make profit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Which transport company is not making profit today???<br><br>Next, they have a Buangkok and Woodleigh Stations not in use? Spending taxpayers money to investigate the white elephants placards.<br><br>They have monitor at the bus interchanges to show the bus schedules as if they are flights. So what if there is a jam along the way, you gonna reach your destination perhaps 30 mins late. Is it necessary to spend this money?<br><br>Silly TV mobile where most commuters would never be able to finish watching a movie while travelling. How many ppl can watch where u have 2 small screens? Why not have some piped music instead.<br><br>Now for jus a mere 30 cents, they chase a 12 yr old girl off the bus. Wtf!<br><br>So now they going to put fare cheats to jail and then talk about the yellow ribbon programme!
