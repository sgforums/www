            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from straits times forum.<br><br>I refer to the letter 'You'll get 40 cents refund, but come back for it after three days' by Mr Goh Aik Boon (ST Online Forum, Oct 17).<br><br>Fare refunds made easy for commuters who are overcharged<br><br>We would like to apologise to Mr Goh for the inconvenience caused.<br><br>Upon receiving Mr Goh's feedback, a check was conducted. It revealed that the overcharging on Service 8 on 26 September 2005 was due to technical glitches with the Ez-link card reader.<br><br>We will continue to work with the Land Transport Authority, which is the system's owner, to try and further reduce the incidence of incorrect fare deductions.<br><br>System faults which result in incorrect fare charges are random occurrences. For every case of overcharging, there is an equal probability of undercharging.<br><br>We would like to reiterate that public transport operators do not control such system failures and they certainly do not gain from them. When customers are overcharged, full refunds are given. But when commuters are undercharged, the operators do not claim from the commuters.<br><br>We would also like to explain that commuters who wish to claim refunds do not have to make a trip to the TransitLink office. They may file their claims through the TransitLink website (www.transitlink.com.sg) or hotline 1800-2255663 and they can get their refunds sent to them by post.<br><br>Alternatively, refunds can be directly credited to the commuters' DBS/POSB bank accounts or they can be collected from any ticket office.<br><br>For valid claims due to bus system errors, commuters may opt for a full cash refund of the fare deducted or complimentary voucher for a free bus ride on any bus service operated by the respective companies, including express and night services.<br><br>We have sent a separate reply to Mr Goh and TransitLink has also processed the refund for him.<br><br>Tammy Tan (Ms)<br>Director<br>Corporate Communications<br>SBS Transit Ltd<br><br>Kathryn Lau (Ms)<br>Assistant Corporate Communications Manager<br>TransitLink Pte Ltd<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from straitstimes forum.<br><br>I refer to Ms Tammy Tan's reply in The Straits Times' Online Forum on October 28 to Mr Goh Aik Boon's letter on fare refunds.<br><br>Despite SBS's assurance that commuters can obtain refunds easily at any of its TransitLink offices, I discovered that this was not so.<br><br>On one of my daily trips to work in May this year, I was overcharged by 50 cents. After reporting the incident at one of the TransitLink offices, I was asked to checked on the status of the refund two weeks later at any office.<br><br>I made two trips to the office in the next two months but was always told that my case was still under investigation.<br><br>Two and a half months later, I went back and got the same reply. This time, I called a staff from TransitLink customer service centre to demand a reply on the delay in my case.<br><br>She assured me that she would check and call me back the next day. It wasn't a surprise that I did not receive any calls from her. I finally gave up in disgust.<br><br>I wonder how many commuters in similar situations as mine gave up like me and let SBS Transit earn that extra cash.<br><br>SBS Transit can punish commuters who short-change it on bus trips but commuters aren't able to do so when its machines erroneously overcharge the fares.<br><br>Shouldn't SBS Transit have a refund turnaround time, failing which it should be penalised by paying commuters late refund fees?<br><br>Lee Li Lian (Ms)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from the straits times forum.<br><br>Empower public to act against fare cheats<br><br>HAVING followed the recent news reports on measures to be taken against fare cheats, my sense of civic-consciousness was heightened when I encountered one on my way home from work recently on Tibs bus service 608.<br><br>I was seated near the exit and saw a man board the bus along Marine Parade Road.<br><br>Before long, he tapped his ez-link card at Siglap, as a passenger was alighting.<br><br>However, he remained seated and was clearly not getting off. My eyes caught his but he ignored me after giving me a quick glance.<br><br>As the bus pulled into the interchange, he prepared to make a quick exit.<br><br>I decided it was then or never, and stood up to him, commenting that he had tapped his card way too early and could be fined for cheating.<br><br>He gave me a shove and retorted that he often forgot to tap his card and thus did so early.<br><br>I was a little stunned by his response and wanted to report the incident to the bus driver, who was a distance away and oblivious to what was happening.<br><br>The passengers around me were busy alighting and only one or two stood around us, impatient to get past the commotion.<br><br>In order not to draw more attention to himself, the fare cheat got off the bus and walked away, much to my dismay.<br><br>The point of highlighting this little episode is to pose this question: Instead of waiting for public transport officials to take action in such instances (if they happen to be around in the first place), are there ways for members of the public to come forward and play a bigger role in clamping down on fare cheats?<br><br>If people are not empowered to help implement some of these measures, even with stiffer penalties, these measures will just be all bark and no bite.<br><br>Tham Sui Pin (Ms)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lying again, trying to make more profit, say so. Make so many laws add this and that. In the end the public is paying while those rich people, is earning more and more, is not bother because they don't take public transport (or shld call commercial transport bcos making profit). Is their chairman related with minister, if so, whatever the public opposed is no use. the minister always on the side of the commercial transport, whatever public opposed they will always have reasons to say no. They said fare will decrease but I didn't see it happen. Add in the machine to deduct bus fare also no use, waste so many money and still so many flaw.</div>
