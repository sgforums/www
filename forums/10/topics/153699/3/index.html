            <div class='col-md body'>This is my take:<br><br>QN: Why we cheat:<br><br>ANS: We cheat because it is human nature to do so. Not just Singaporeans, but everyone else in the world. Why pay more if there is even a slight chance to pay less? We see this as a warped concept of savings and every cent saved per trip contributes to somewhere else. In europe, where they claim to be a developed community, the public transport system utilises a ticket validity system. The system is based 100% on honesty. You have to purchase your own ticket and validate your ticket before you board the train/bus. Should you be caught in random inspections, you are not asked to pay the balance but will be fined up to 80 euros! (almost 160 S$)<br><br>QN: Is it fair to jail a person for cheating on a bus?<br><br>ANS: This is seen as a deterent move to stamp out widespread cheating, especially among school tertiary students and above who do not have access to concession passes. Then again, knowing that our two main bus services in SBS transit and SMRT are govt-linked leaves no doubt that this is politically motivated as it would have taken a significant amount of lobbying at legislation level to succeed. A privately run enterprise would have been stonewalled and heavily criticised over an inept monitoring system with loops holes that cheats exploit. (EZ-link comes to mind at this point)<br><br>I would have been in favour for a heavier fine and a booking system that records past cheaters rather than the threat of jail looming over cheat wannabes. Jail seems harsh and certainly not equitable to this minor offence.<br><br>QN: What is the ultimate decision for such a drastic amendment?<br><br>ANS: Our inadequacies in developing a fullproof ticketing system (too much bravado and too little substance in the case of EZ link) , inept management unable to find alternative solutions to a loss in sales steming from cheats (what are the stats? Or is this a smoking gun?) and ultimately, this is the new 'prevention is better than cure' syndrome. By threatening an overkill penalty, the hope is that cheats in their infant stage will be scared off before they seriously challenge the system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Several people interviewed by ST yesterday indicated being overcharged multiple times on various trips.<br><br>Public Transport Council claimed that they must have forgetten to tap their cards. Then when the same commuters were overcharged again for another 5 trips, they claimed that there was a problem between automated and manual settings by drivers.<br><br>LTA supremo Yeo CT himself claimed that we have developed a good system and have advanced public transport.<br><br>Is he trying to cook an already boiled egg? Who is he kdding? All the public transport council and LTA provide are lame excuses again and again. The commuters who seek claims for overcharge must be furious when the blame is thrown back on them.<br><br>Like any computer program, patches need to be installed to upgrade the system periodically. Since when can anyone develop a proprietary system and claim it's bugproof at the same time? I don't see any follow-up work being performed in this aspect? Is our PTC and LTA so arrogant they are willing to sweep aside objective criticism and glaring errors in the EZ link system and claim it's a SUCCESS?<br><br>Worse, are they swatting aside commuter complaints over the obvious faults in the system and instead counter-claiming user dysfunction? Instead of addressing the REAL problem, they impose ridiculous penalties against cheaters (who arguably contribute a negligable proportion of the problem).<br><br>This entire episode stinks of glossing over their own mistakes by blowing-up the small issues of others as a cover-up.</div>

Ultimately, a quick glance at the profit margin will show that it has a marginal (almost negligible) impact on the earnings.<br><br>The focus of these companies should not be to legislate to solve their problems, but instead to implement problem solving solutions.<br><br>Crying to the govt will not succeed if one was a 100% privatised firm.</div>
