They DECLARED it in their annual earnings report. Their top brass undoubtedly receives profit sharing bonuses.<br><br>We should not confuse low pay with the cheating cost loss in revenue. Ultimately, a quick glance at the profit margin will show that it has a marginal (almost negligible) impact on the earnings.<br><br>The focus of these companies should not be to legislate to solve their problems, but instead to implement problem solving solutions.<br><br>Crying to the govt will not succeed if one was a 100% privatised firm. </div></blockquote>Like I said before, they only make the millions because of tax writebacks., as in the case of SMRT. WIthout the tax writebacks, they would probably be in the red.<br><br>The cheatings done by commuters has an indirect effect on the wages of the employees in the company as revenue and profit is affected. And 9 million SGD is not a negligible impact. 9 million SGD could result in higher wages for the employees and perhaps, slightly higher dividend payout.<br><br>Appealing to the government for help is probably a very good solution to the problem. Legislation is very effective in Singapore. This solution is also cost effective. The company does not need to incur extra charges and effectively roots out a problem which have been plaguing them for the past decade.</div>
