              <p>The first Annual Report on human rights and the Arab region by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS), entitled From Exporting Terrorism to Exporting Repression, was released on the 5th of December, 2008, in anticipation of the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  </p>
              <p> In this report the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) finds that the status of human rights in the Arab region in 2008 has increasingly worsened.    Attacks on the limited public and political liberties that exist have escalated in most countries in the region.</p>
              <p>CIHRS notes that, while Islamists are less frequently targeted, there is an increase in repression of reformists, human rights defenders and activists, the independent press and electronic media, leaders of protest movements, and of other forms of political action in Arab countries. <strong>This has been accompanied by earnest attempts to export increasing domestic repression outside the Arab region through the international mechanisms of the UN and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Initiative.</strong>   Arab governments have made large individual and concerted efforts  to silence independent Non-Governmental Organizations or erase them from public visibility completely, while  simultaneously  undermining International Human Rights Mechanisms (IHRM) of their ability to promote human rights and provide  protection for victims of rights violations.  Furthermore, these states have promoted and created resolutions and policies at IHRMs that are designed to undermine the very rights and freedoms these mechanisms are designed to promote.  </p>

              <p>How is it different from today. The seeds of conflicts today were planted during that period.</p>
              <p>Today, the Muslims have conflicts with the west, have conflicts in other parts of the world where there's no oil. There are only non-Muslims.</p>

              <p>Nope, for all the hype that Iranian-made weapons made, they only
                  form a fraction of all the weapons captured in Iraq. In fact, Iran
                  has captured foreign (probably US and Israeli) agents engaged in
                  espionage and the Bush Administration have authorised the CIA to
                  conduct hostile operations in the Middle-East.</p>
              <p>As for Syria, MI6 is already cooperating with its Syrian
                  counterpart- <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/20/syria-security-terrorism-milliband-deal">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/20/syria-security-terrorism-milliband-deal</a>.
                  If Syria is causing trouble, its part of western false-flags.</p>

              <p>Co-operation struck only last month? Didn't Miliband highlight "decrease in the number of foreign fighters crossing from Syria into Iraq over the past 12 months"?</p>
              <p>So, what false flag?</p>
              <p>&lt;Meanwhile, Syria continues to back militant Islamic groups in Lebanon
              and the Palestinian territories, aiding the rearmament of Hizbollah
              after the group's 2006 war with Israel. And though the number of
              foreign fighters crossing Syria's border into Iraq may be down, a US
              helicopter raid last month was claimed to have killed a top al-Qaida
              smuggler operating near the Syrian border town of Abu Kamal.&gt;</p>

              <p>Thats what was released after Miliband's visit.</p>
              <p>Given how the Middle-East was a British fiefdom and all the oil wealth present, western intelligence presence is probably ubiquitous.</p>

              <p>Some more desperate ones make up some lame reasons/excuses and use those weapons to kill others and then hide behind those reasons/excuses for protection.</p>

              <p>Human beings have the capacity to build as well as to destroy.<br>Alone, he has limited capability. But when he 'influence' others, that capability becomes extensive.</p>
              <p><br>What better 'influence' than religion to gain recruits, funds and sympathizers? More so a religion that 'allows' killing of innocents if 'mis-interpretated'?</p>
              <p><br>If people who blame religion as the root cause of terrorism are 'imbeciles', than can it be equally said those who do not are delusionists who dares not confront the truth, and in their blind apathy, are the cause of more terrorists being generated?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>This is no play play, billions of innocent lives are involved. If nothing is done, more will only die needlessly and senselessly.</p>
              <p><br>Correct the flaws in religions and evil men or women will have no access to funds, recruits and sympathizers. They will be isolated and can be easily tracked and apprehended by the authorities.</p>

              <p>The developement of human rights comes hand in hand with economic progress. In a chaotic and dangerous environment, the only human right affordable is based on religion, to provide comfort of a better afterlife and the ability to bear this life in suffering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Middle east is not without resources, but only that no investor would dare contemplate long term investments in that volatile region, save only oil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As such, whatever money govts and kings make, it is either hoarded up or spent overseas, of which only benefits other countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As much social developement and social spending can or had been used to generate economic activity there by govts, there are not enough jobs to grow an affluent middle class whom will be able to champion worthy causes such as environment or human rights with a large critical mass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, it is vital that the Middle East stop playing hosts to evil men twisting religion to their own selfish ends who are only destroying not only their religion, but their economic opportunities as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many middle-easterners knows this, but the evil men in the guise of religion is not giving them a chance to grow, and fearing reprisals from them, have no choice but to accept their fate being dictated by this evil minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There must be a change of policy to help our brother/sister humans living in the middle-east to move into the 21st century. But more importantly, they must be able to accept facts and want that change itself. If not, they will forever be where they are today, and no one else in the world can be blamed, for this is what they wished for.</p>
