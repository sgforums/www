              <p>I am very sad reading this thread.</p>
              <p>Even though in Arab region
              there is human rights problem, it is not in any way unique or different
              with other regions in the world.</p>
              <p>All regions have human rights
              problems, according to their own intrinsic issues, stages of
              development, history, culture, and so on.</p>
              <p>While some observer who come from outside, can notice and see
              those problems, I think it is important to be a little more humble and
              understanding, and think in terms of equality and respect.</p>

              <p>I saw this news on CNN.  A clear dysfunction practice that has yet to evolve. Another reason why the international communities could not accept Arab morality. </p>
              <p>Ever wonder why The west practice double standard.........?</p>
              <h1>Top Saudi cleric: OK for young girls to wed</h1>
              <p>The debate over the controversial practice of child marriage in Saudi Arabia was pushed back into the spotlight this week, with the kingdom's top cleric saying that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed.</p>
              <p>"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger," Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks quoted Wednesday in the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. "A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her."</p>
              <p>The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>Late last month, a Saudi judge refused to annul the marriage of an 8-year-old girl to a 47-year-old man.</p>
              <p>The judge, Sheikh Habib Abdallah al-Habib, rejected a petition from the girl's mother, whose lawyer said the marriage was arranged by her father to settle a debt with "a close friend." The judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty.</p>
              <p>Al-Sheikh was asked during a Monday lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="cnnStoryElementBox">
              <h4>"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls," he said, according to the newspaper. "We should know that Shariah law has not brought injustice to women."</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/human_rights_watch"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Human Rights Watch</span></span></strong></a>, recently told CNN that his organization has heard many other cases of child marriages.</p>
              </div>
              <p>"We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men," Wilcke said.</p>
              <p>Wilcke explained that while Saudi ministries may make decisions designed to protect children, "It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."</p>
              <p>Last month, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages.</p>
              <p>"The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/saudi_arabia"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Saudi Arabia</span></span></strong></a>," al-Harithi said. "Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed." He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place.</p>
              <p>Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN last month that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to "keep us backward and in the dark ages."</p>
              <p>She said the marriages cause girls to "lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."</p>
              <p class="cnnInline">The Saudi Ministry of Justice has made no public comment on the issue. </p>

              <p>The civil government doesn't really need to care because it has the money to give its citizens fuel/medical/tax subsidies. As long as that is fulfilled, social unrest would be kept at a minimum, it doesn't really need to care what this "Guardian of Morality" wants to do.</p>
              <p>Why would it need any reasons to transform? Its citizens are satisfied as long as the oil money is flowing in. Basic neccessities are fulfilled.</p>
              <p>You look at my comments like i'm blaming someone else for the problem, which i admit i did when i brought out the Americans. Rest assured the entire world, including Singaporeans has a hand to play in this sort of sorry affairs.  </p>

              <p>Social Economics has always been key to the stability of a society. As long as stability exists there will be no incentive to change, especially a way of life that has worked for them for centuries. While Saudi Arabia is the richest country in the Middle East, it is the most conservative (They don't even have female participants for the Olympics)</p>
              <p>They are actually the main sponsors for fundamentalist Islam and give more money to terrorist cells compared to Iran. (The number of Saudi Arabians in the 9-11 terrorists list is more than self evident) </p>
              <p>Actually i'm facing reality more than you are.</p>
              <p>If we want the Saudi Arabians to change, we have to pressure them to do it. Right now, we're buying something essential for the functioning of our country from them .</p>
              <p>As long as we continue to do that, we are not going to make them do anything. We expect them to change the fundamentals of their society because if offends our sense of morality, they can also demand we not rely on their oil if their social habits offends us so much.</p>
              <p>We want them to change? First we got to make sure we stop buying oil from them. Bahrain has to open up and liberalize because of their dwindling oil resources, i don't see how anything less would force Saudi Arabia to change.</p>
