            <div class='col-md body'>It was reported in the New Paper, that a cabbie who got out of his cab to help passenger with a baby pram board his taxi, had his toes rolled over by a passing car, was denied insurance claim by Comfort on a technicality - it happened outside of the taxi, and it is his own problem. This was reportedly how they replied to cabbie.<br><br>Now, I like to ask, is this a way to inculcate COURTESY, GRACIOUSNESS, and RESPONSIBILITY in Singapore's service sector by being so ultra technical and calculative when it comes to employee welfare? Especially when it is a government organtization??<br><br>The government accused Singaporeans of being UGLY, INCONSIDERATE, and SELF-CENTERED. But did they actually looked into what caused the people to become like so?? How people are treated, is exactly how people are apt to behave in daily life - CALCULATIVE, SELF-PRESERVING, and TECHNICAL when it comes to RESPONSIBILITIES, as a person or an organization.<br><br>I think, it's ultimately MONEY that speaks loudest in Singapore, not ethics of humanity. I believe if this unfortunate cabbie has a large stash of money hidden somewhere and can hire a lawyer to fight for his cause, Comfort would likely be more CONSIDERATE towards his injury. Afterall, the cabbie was injured in the line of duty, by being helpful. Unless Comfort can come out and say that they don't expect their cabbies to be helpful, or that if their cabbies steps out of their cabs to help passengers, they will be doing so at their own personal risks.<br><br>Comfort's attitude towards such self-initiated cabbies will certainly see that their cabbies will be less helpful in future. And this may set a precedence over all other sectors, private or otherwise.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So much for the Gahmen encouraging "Think out of the Box" thingy.<br><br>Typically a scenerio where corporate mindset is so rigid and so robotic-like.<br><br>"Coming out of the cab to help passengers is NOT technically part of the cabbie's scope of work."... say so a insurance agent as quoted in NP.<br><br>Very nice... now it will sends out a domino effect to all cab drivers out there who realized that a goodwill like this won't get you protected from insurance if accidents happened just outside the cab tho in line of duty.</div>
