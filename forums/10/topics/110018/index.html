            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of was told of a lucky Singaporean's close shave from that tsunami disaster on the morning of 26.12.2004. Let me recount this incident;-<br><br>That morning, he and his two young children were playing on the shallow sandy Kamanda beach which stretched very far out to the sea.<br><br>For some reasons, his children felt disturbed by the changing tide which for one moment receded completely and the next rising up swiftly.<br><br>Because of his children complaints and his concern for their comfort or safety, the father decided to bring them back to the hotel.<br><br>From the hotel, he observed for some moments the swaying of the tide one moment receding completely into the distance and the next rising up quickly to nearly engulf many beach goers.<br><br>No one seems to notice such telltale little signs of something calamitous which was about to happen.<br><br>Somehow, he felt uncomfortable and decided to leave the hotel early. Hours later, back in Singapore airport, he heard the Tsunami calamity that claimed many lives. Luckily for him, he had not ignored the telltale sign or the pleading of his children.<br><br></div>

Now the worse has caused the big tsunami.<br><br>From a TV documentary, there is a likelihood of big and deep crevices or ravines down in the deep sea due to past erosions. These may be waiting for collapse over time. The many after-shocks should tell us something about this kind of crevices existing below the deep blue sea there off the coast of Sumatra. Was the one that collapsed on 26.12.2004 the worse or most dangerous or are there some bigger ones. If there are, I fear there might be more tsunami or bigger ones.

Yes!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>tsunami.... depends on the tallnest of the tidal waves leh. SOme reach shores just few inches where some are 10++ metres highs. If you are talking about useless the early warning system... then i guess u are talking about those 100metres!!! waves which is pratically not possible and never before.  The problem with Indonesia and India is that all those houses are located just beside the seas and are wooden built.<br>If it is really that deadly... the whole phuket will be gone instead of only those near the sea side.<br><br>Spore is not a 100% flat lands.</div>

However, the situation would be different if the earthquake had occurred somewhere to the west of the Philippines.<br><br>The Philippines has its share of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes (the resort town of Baguio was hit by an earthquake some years ago).<br><br>Should a major undersea earthquake strike, say, west of Luzon Island, the resultant tsunami waves would race down the South China Sea, like the North-east Monsoon, to hit the east coast of West Malaysia and Singapore shores. The subsequent destruction of Changi and the East Coast seafronts would be unimaginable.<br><br>Can the Civil Defence authorities let us know whether they have now included this scenario in their disaster planning?<br><br>Phoon Boon Pin<br><br></div>
