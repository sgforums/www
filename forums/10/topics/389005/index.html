            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>There is an interesting debate in Singapore’s blogosphere lately on civil disobedience in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Prominent socio-political blogger Alex Au argued that Singaporeans are not ready for it and blamed the Singapore Democratic Party, a strong advocate of civil disobedience in Singapore for “letting itself down” for its frequent brushes with the law.</p>
              <p>The conventional thinking is that Singaporeans are too obedient, orderly and timid to express their displeasure against the ruling party publicly in the form of rallies, protests and marches.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the SDP’s supposedly decline over the years is often attributed to its association with civil disobedience against the ruling party which lacks mass popular appeal.</p>
              <p>SDP’s Secretary-General Dr Chee Soon Juan stood firm and defended all it takes is a “few good man” to spark off a mass civil movement to topple the ruling party, quoting the examples of India’s Mahatma Gandhi and U.S.A’s Martin Luther King.</p>
              <p>The reality on the ground lies somewhat in between.</p>
              <p>While Singaporeans are still not ready for the organized movement envisioned by Dr Chee, the concept of “civil disobedience” is becoming more palatable to them with each passing day as evident by the public display of online “protest” against the ruling party.</p>
              <p>10 years ago, it would be unimaginable to read any critical comments/posts by netizens about the ruling party and its leaders.</p>
              <p>Today, they are ubiquitous everywhere even in forums owned by the government. The majority of Singapore’s socio-political bloggers adopt a clear stance against the establishment and the few pro-PAP blogs suffer from a dearth of readership.</p>
              <p>There is far greater political awareness and openness now compared to the past and with more and more young Singaporeans being hooked up to the internet, it will serve as a catalyst to political awakening in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the past, young Singaporeans are mostly concerned about their studies, careers and futures.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, an increasing numbers are expressing concerns about the governance of the nation, the absence of political competition in Singapore and the lack of accountability and transparency in the system.</p>
              <p>Online activism is becoming more prevalent in Singapore cyberspace with netizens having no qualms making use of social media tools to organize themselves and get their message across.</p>
              <p>Petitions are a popular tool to garner public opinion and to feedback to the authorities though their actual impact is suspected.</p>
              <p>In last year alone, there are a dozen petitions set up on a variety of issues from calling HDB to reduce the prices of public housing to the Romanian embassy to make ex-gratia payments to the families of the victims of a hit-and-run accident involving their vehicle.</p>
              <p>Facebooks are set up to campaign various causes from helping the homeless in Singapore to advocating for a repeal of the death penalty.</p>
              <p>The most notable Facebook was set up by a 22 year old Mr Alex Tan to vote the PAP out of power.</p>
              <p>Within a week, it attracted more than members than the YPAP Facebook itself and now has nearly 3,000 members.</p>
              <p>Such an overwhelming response from Singaporeans will be unthinkable a few years ago.</p>
              <p>One can infer from its success as an indication that Singaporeans have slowly shed their perennial inhibitions and fears of speaking out against the ruling party.</p>
              <p>They have become more aware of their civil and political rights as citizens of Singapore and they are not afraid to assert them.</p>
              <p>The key question to ask is: when will Singaporeans be ready to make the gigantic leap from online disobedience to civil disobedience in real life?</p>
              <p>Having 2,000 netizens signing on a petition to call for the resignation of a minister is quite different from having 2,000 Singaporeans doing so at Hong Lim Park.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, all forms of public dissent are quickly covered up to prevent “loss of face” for the ruling party which prides itself as having the popular “mandate” of Singaporeans to govern the nation.</p>
              <p>It will be a major PR disaster for the PAP if 2,000 young Singaporeans turn up at Hong Lim Park one day demanding free and fair elections for it will shatter the myth that they enjoy wide support from Singaporeans once and for all.</p>
              <p>Right now, the ruling party can only depend on draconian and repressive laws like the Public Order Act to keep prospective “protesters” at bay, but even then, its oft-cited propaganda to maintain social security and order is fast wearing thin.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have witnessed for themselves what civil disobedience can achieve in other countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan and they know this may be the last resort to toss out the dictatorial regime.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there is a huge gulf between “thinking” and “doing”. Most Singaporeans still prefer to agitate for change anonymously behind the screen than to do the dirty work on the ground like what Dr Chee and his colleagues have done.</p>
              <p>Despite the odds stacked against them, there is a silver lining over the horizon for Singapore civil activists who have been struggling to attract fellow Singaporeans to join them.</p>
              <p>With frustration, resentment and anger rising on the ground against the ruling party, an increasing number of Singaporeans are gradually accepting the idea of civil disobedience.</p>
              <p>Though it may not resemble the mass civil movements we see in other parts of Asia, the fundamental principles and goals will remain essentially the same.</p>
              <p>What we need now is more brave souls to step forward to lead the way to spark an avalanche of support for the movement.</p>
              <p>The police may be able to arrest and charge a few civil activists easily, but if we have more than a thousand, two thousand and three thousand of them in the streets, they will surely be overwhelmed.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are fast running out of options and time to rid themselves of this despotic regime which was lampooned as a “textbook example of a repressive state” by Human Rights Watch lately.</p>
              <p>With the ruling party mass importing foreigners into Singapore to become citizens, our voting rights are being diluted as each day passes.</p>
              <p>Perhaps only when Singaporeans finally wake up from their slumber and realize one day that civil disobedience is the only way out for them that they will throw caution against the wind and lend their full support to it.</p>

              <p><br>In a natural process of human revolution, peoples will automatically rebel if peace and harmony of their life is at stake, as an opposition or supporters, talking about justice and equal footing is never going to work on a peaceful platform, as the saying goes, Heroes and founder are form from chaos and wars, never in peacetime ya.</p>
              <p>You put the agendas down to change this country on the table, and most singaporeans will tell you to F off our life, because there is never a life and death at stake in Singapore. You can't change people mind when people are in peace and living happily. What is 20% suffering in peace against 60% not that suffering and yet gained and the rest 20% not suffering at all but instead prosper on it.  You people got to understand that ya, dun kid yourself ya... you are just wasting your time and effort.</p>
              <p>People dun mind to suffer for the sake of peace, that is the most important, because in peace, thing can get done ya. Opposition egoism, dignity or courage and integrity is not name of the game.</p>

              <p><br>In a natural process of human revolution, peoples will automatically rebel if peace and harmony of their life is at stake, as an opposition or supporters, talking about justice and equal footing is never going to work on a peaceful platform, as the saying goes, Heroes and founder are form from chaos and wars, never in peacetime ya.</p>
              <p>You put the agendas down to change this country on the table, and most singaporeans will tell you to F off our life, because there is never a life and death at stake in Singapore. You can't change people mind when people are in peace and living happily. What is 20% suffering in peace against 60% not that suffering and yet gained and the rest 20% not suffering at all but instead prosper on it.  You people got to understand that ya, dun kid yourself ya... you are just wasting your time and effort.</p>
              <p>People dun mind to suffer for the sake of peace, that is the most important, because in peace, thing can get done ya. Opposition egoism, dignity or courage and integrity is not name of the game.</p>
