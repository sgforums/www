            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm. But Chinese currency is UNDERVALUED because of their policy. This is not to say that the sole reason for them being cost-efficient is this "artificial" currency valuation, as i can imagine some yanky politicians crying out to the fickle 'new Roman' mob in the land of the free.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Most of all, the world owes a debt of gratitude to China for its commitment to dismantling its state-owned economy. For China, this is the only avenue to sustained prosperity. For other nations, it is an opportunity to tap an enormous market. "</span><br><br>****ing AYE!!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Nor do we in the West have to worry that China will play unfairly on the road to reform. China's willing accession to the World Trade Organization guarantees that it will be held accountable to a system based on Western rules. "</span><br><br>HAHAH, the fact that the rules are Western is alone worrying. Well basic economic theory is based on selfish desire of economic players.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"No one said globalization would be easy. But in the end, it sure beats the alternatives. Thank you, China, for showing the way. "</span><br><br>I just hope the Chinese won't be like the japs, both in artwork, teenage youth and music; *gasp*<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Lost in the handwringing are the extraordinary benefits that a rapidly changing Chinese economy is bringing to the world - benefits that an ungrateful world should give thanks for. That's especially the case for the U.S. Yes, China accounted for the largest portion of America's record $540 billion trade deficit in 2003. But this deficit was not made in Beijing - it was made in Washington. That's right - courtesy of a runaway federal budget deficit, America has all but depleted its national savings. In order to fund the investment necessary for economic growth, that shortfall of domestic savings must be offset by surplus savings from abroad. The U.S. has no choice other than to run massive balance-of-payments and trade deficits in order to attract foreign capital." </span><br><br>YES! China is aiding the world in its evolutionary move of "De-Westernisation-*cough*-Whitesation" by fighting the profiteering- imperialist-descendent-white-arrogant-sly westerners economically.<br><br>Aye. China is good. I love their wet n dry abrasive products and their cheap electronics, their pretty girls, good food (if its not too greasy). But Chinese toy remote control tanks SUCK!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I wonder how is it that China and its influence can grow so much in just 25 years? The rest of the asian countries rely so heavily on the Chinese market for economic growth. For example: Japan. In the year 2003, 50% of japanese exports were bought by China. It is the strong demand from Chinese consumers that is driving Japanese growth. As China becomes more affluent, Chinese tourists are now wooed by virtually every country on earth. in France, locals working in branded shops like LV are eagerly learning Mandarin to communicate with Chinese tourists. I wonder what will happen to asia if let say war breaks out between the PRC and ROC. Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian seem hell bent on declaring Taiwan independence.<br></div>

And one of reason contributing towards that which is beyond our span of control was that the Chinese knew too much about the operations, about the plans, and about the progress of the park as a whole.<br><br>They were able to analyse, make plans, and capitalize.<br></div>
