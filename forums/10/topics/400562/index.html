              <h1>Why we shouldn’t  believe everything that we are told</h1>
              <div id="byline">By Roger Mitton<br> May 17 - 23, 2010</div>
              <p>BANGKOK – Earlier this month, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in 
              Vietnam said that his nation must hit 7 percent economic growth in the 
              second half of this year to meet its full-year target of 6.5pc.</p>
              <p>His remark reminded me of two things. One was an article 
              just days earlier in The New York Times about false claims and shameless
               boosterism.</p>
              <p>It related how the American company making Keds brand 
              canvas shoes with rubber soles, first introduced in 1917, claimed they 
              were so comfortable and quiet you could “sneak” up on your boyfriend – 
              and hence were the first shoes called “sneakers”.</p>
              <p>Minimal research by The New York Times reporter, however, 
              showed that the name sneakers had been in use for similar footwear since
               1887.</p>
              <p>The article also noted that the Haggar clothing company 
              claimed it invented the term “slacks” in the 1940s for its casual 
              trousers, which were to be worn during “slack time”.</p>
              <p>Yet a simple dictionary check showed that the term slacks 
              had been used in this context almost a century earlier.<br> Of course, it’s not only unscrupulous companies seeking to 
              embellish the pedigree of their products that engage in such 
              shenanigans. Many governments do the same.</p>
              <p>Which brings me to the second thing Dung’s comment reminded
               me about. It was a claim, fed to me soon after I arrived in Hanoi as 
              the bureau chief for The Straits Times of Singapore in 2006, that 
              Vietnam was the new Asian Tiger – so much so that it had “the second 
              fastest-growing economy in Asia after China”.</p>
              <p>This mantra was regurgitated in articles about Vietnam, and
               in official government statements, and it peppered lunch chitchat and 
              the banter at diplomatic receptions.</p>
              <p>It was so universally accepted that I took it to be true. 
              Then one day, an article in the business section of The Straits Times 
              revealed that Singapore’s GDP growth for 2006 was 8.4pc.</p>
              <p>I was stunned. Vietnam’s growth rate at that time was 
              8.2pc. So how could it be the second fastest in Asia after China, if 
              even highly-developed Singapore had a faster rate?</p>
              <p>A check of World Bank and IMF figures soon revealed that 
              Vietnam’s growth rate was below that of China, Myanmar, Cambodia, 
              Singapore, Laos and India. Yet the Keds-like canard continued to be 
              repeated, as it is to this day, appearing in articles by foreign 
              correspondents and even spouted in speeches by visiting Singapore 
              leaders.</p>
              <p>But then, like other regional governments, Singapore 
              itself, despite a somewhat exaggerated reputation for rectitude, is not 
              averse to making similar false claims.</p>
              <p>Consider the notion, oft-repeated, especially at election 
              time, that in its British colonial days, Singapore was a backward 
              settlement of shacks in a mosquito-ridden swamp with no natural 
              resources.</p>
              <p>Then, hey presto, Lee Kuan Yew led his People’s Action 
              Party to power in 1959 and transformed the place into the gleaming, 
              ultra-efficient metropolis it is today.</p>
              <p>It’s a good line, almost as sneaky and spurious as the one 
              about Keds or Vietnam’s growth rate.</p>
              <p>Actually, Singapore was highly developed long before Lee 
              and the PAP took over. Indeed, called “Gibraltar of the East”, it was 
              the real crown jewel of the British Empire.</p>
              <p>Winston Churchill himself wrote that during the Second 
              World War, “the worst disaster” of all was not Dunkirk or Dieppe or the 
              blitz of London, it was the fall of Singapore in 1942. Look at photos of
               the victorious Japanese marching through Fullerton Square between the 
              elegant colonnaded buildings that look like Regent Street in London.</p>
              <p>Some swamp, some shacks.</p>
              <p>This latterday PAP hyperbole does not alter the fact that 
              Singapore developed fantastically well under Lee and has become a 
              successful city state.</p>
              <p>But it does reconfirm that when we are fed official guff, 
              as we were on May 6 when it was announced that despite economic 
              downturns due to the global financial crisis, trade between Cambodia and
               Vietnam rose 30pc last year and is up 127pc this year, we must treat it
               with caution.</p>
              <p>Indeed, whenever leading politicians make similar high 
              falutin’ claims, it pays to check them out, for it’s a good bet that 
              they are speaking through the backside of their slacks.</p>
