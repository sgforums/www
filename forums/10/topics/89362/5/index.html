Whether it is a masked monopoly in the form of 'privatisation' or not is not the crux of the matter. The intention is to let ppl have this perception that the market is not being monopolised, even though it may have been, due to the natural monopoly market structure. I believe this is the 2nd time that i have tried to explain this simple concept to you. But like i said, a program can be irritatingly rigid and uncompromising at times. It's either 100% correct or 100% wrong for you.<br><br>And u seem to contradict yourself by firstly urging me to rebutt what u have countered, and then going on to request that i respond to accusations of gloatings and what not.
