            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Singapore has been welcoming foreigners to be PR or citizens.<br><br>I must say these PRs are well treated and their privilege is so good it appears not much difference between citizen and PR.  Luckily, singaporeans get to serve NS whereas PRs no need and their children need not also for any generation in the future as long as they dun take up citizenship as their papa did. Meaning they can live here as dependents or PR but no need serve. as long as this way they do, I am not sure can I say their future generations from papa onwards never will need to serve as long as they choose to do so? based on current system, how true is this?<br><br>since there is welcoming of foreigners, I want to know where can singaproeans go to  , to ALSO enjoy the privilege of being a PR with the same level of privileges and enjoy best of both worlds? I mean foreigners are enjoying the system, how can we also enjoy the same? I mean singaporeans dun want to miss lobang right? keep the citizenship but enjoy another country as PR.<br><br>Please advise which countries can offer choices for singaporeans. I mean foreigners can are having advantages of both countries. Why can't singaporeans do the same?<br><br>I kiasu leh, I want to have as many 'membership' as possible leh. shiok shiok enjoy member privileges mah.  Is it allowed that singaproeans apply to be PR of x-country while keeping sg cert?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean, altho PR of x-counry, we still citizen of SG meaning we still LOYAL right? No conflict of interest right? My PR friends all no conflict of interest wan. They loyal to sg wan. Like this sg got future wan.  More new 'recruits' more loyalty wan. Steady until boon bi bi wan. 1 million foreigners for every 4.5 residents here. Solid siah. their loyalty will be with sg once they convert to citizen right? even tho their children can all continue to be PR here or live anywhere overseas  like study long long overseas lor. need to serve national duty meh if PR status tho his papa is new citizen?  No need right?  so, no problem lah. I mean sg is good for the papa to earn money and enjoy the modern facilities and infrstructure and they can sleep in peace since local boys will do NS to protect all RESIDENTS what. Good hor? Like this I wan. So , now the question is, which country can go and enjoy in addition to sg?</div>
