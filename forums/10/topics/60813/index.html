The new PM will be able to get advice from PM Goh and SM Lee which might be in the government, thus preventing any wrong decsion being make by the new PM.<br><br>As for the second question, i think that Singapore is able to strive and win the challenges being make by Malaysia. This might be due to the fact that Singapore has our own knowlege base workers which provide a good source of workers for the company willing to invest in here. This will thus be able to overcome our disadvantage as a small country. However, being small might not be a disadvantage as we can take Finnland for example, it is a small country like Singapore, but it is able to produce a a well- known company like Nokia which is a handphone company.<br><br>Hope my starting is enough and reasonable, please help to answer my post.<br>Thanx you</div>

However, think about it again, will the people want a leader who has got great abiltiy to continue leading the country to success or a leader who does not know much and lead the country to a great fall and destory it. My answer and mine will always be the same which is a leader who is able to continue to lead us to success. Now the problem lies on whether who the leader is. He is the son of SM Lee but he might be able to continue on the success which we have been achieving and allowing us to live our life in comfort.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If SM Lee were want to have this thing like the consolidation of power, why did he have to step down as the PM 13 years ago and allow Goh take overover? Isn's this opposing the idea of consolidation which people think he is trying to create? If he were to create such a consolidation, what harm will this cause the country as i don see any.<br><br>Lastly, I don think that the consolidation might not even last long even if it exist as there will always comes to a time whereby one of the Lee isn't a suitable leader. Thus, we should not have look upon DPM Lee as SM Lee son but as an individual in order for us to judge him from our view without any unfairness. However, all the leaders who might taking over from DPM Lee in the future as PM will definitely have one and single aim which is to continue the success we have now into the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If SM Lee were want to have this thing like the consolidation of power, why did he have to step down as the PM 13 years ago and allow Goh take overover? Isn's this opposing the idea of consolidation which people think he is trying to create? If he were to create such a consolidation, what harm will this cause the country as i don see any.<br><br>Lastly, I don think that the consolidation might not even last long even if it exist as there will always comes to a time whereby one of the Lee isn't a suitable leader. Thus, we should not have look upon DPM Lee as SM Lee son but as an individual in order for us to judge him from our view without any unfairness. However, all the leaders who might taking over from DPM Lee in the future as PM will definitely have one and single aim which is to continue the success we have now into the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote></div>
