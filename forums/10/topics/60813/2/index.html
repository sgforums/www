            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion , Singapore would be able to survive for quite some time. From the debate between Bear and Hocklez , we can see that Bear thinks that SM Lee should be stepping down and should not be making decision for Singapore while Hocklez thinks that SM Lee is giving advice to his son. I will stand with Hocklez in this case as SM Lee has years of experience and could give constructive advices and suggestion to his son.</div>

These influence might be from SM Lee and PM Goh which only he might have it.

No one on Earth will want to have his own success which he have built for so long to be destroy after handling to the next successor. The answer will most likely be yes for the majority. His age might be old but like an old book, the cover might be torn and dusty, but if it can still provide the author for information to write a newer version, why not?<br><br>He might be old and you can say that he still call the shot now but he cannot always do it as he should know that he is ageing. I think that he is always trying to eductae the future leaders about the various things he have learnt. For example, the recent case of his wife being hit by stroke in London, he told us what he have learnt from the real life experience he encount. He could have kept this experience to himself but he wanted to update us and to learn from our mistake and and encounter.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly i don't trust Lee Hsien Long one bit, in my opinion he's an idiot and nowhere as capable as Goh or his father. How in the world did he raise up to the rank of Brigadier General AND DPM if he wasn't LKY's son? I don't recall him doing anything significant besides being interviewed or making speeches on important issues<br><br>I don't recall him doing anything worth noticing besides constantly saying some stupid things (Trying to encourage entrepreneurship by using the example of a person who studies in Raffles and whose father is a rich fella? How dumb is that?).<br><br>Because he's well educated? Well how many professors and PHD holders are there in Singapore? I don't see any of them holding so important a position and rank. He's only depending on his father's prestige and frankly is very undeserving of the PM position.<br><br></div>

With CPF, money that they earn will not be used all away, and saved for the raining days when they needs it.<br><br>Think of what will happen if there is no CPF, the people who do not know about managing their own wealth will be on the losing end as there will not be enough to last them thoughout their retirement. And of course, the smart alex who are more educated and have more planning with thus use the money to invest and grow their money in a risky way.<br><br>To me, CPF has its own advantage and disadvantage as i am just a young git, do not know much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Just look at how many shares they hold in those companies.  They know it time for them to withdraw and retire in other countries with all the assets. It more than enough for them to last for 3x lifetimes.<br><br></div>
