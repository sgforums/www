I can understand why some passerbys would hesitate to help her because they are worried for their safety . However statements such as yours are unwarranted.  If you can mock her situation in the forum , in my opinion- you are equally depraved as her killer.<br><br>Doesn't matter if that woman is from China or Singapore or Malaysia or somewhere - she is still a human being - she feels pain and the blood is the same color as the rest of us - RED. She is someone's child , just like all of us . Think of it if it was ur daughter. It can also happen to fellow Singaporeans , when I was young (around 7 years old) ,  I remember my mom being robbed at knifepoint in Singapore ...pushed to the ground and two passerby just stopped at look without even bothering to call the police. Not even when I was crying for help because I was hit by the robber as well.<br><br>I saw the video and the guy in blue was the first to run up and help and I think it is very courageous of him to do something.<br><br>As for those who want to turn it into a political blaming game - ask yourselves who let them in first to find jobs in Singapore.</div>
