People like you don't even dare attend opposition rallies, and secretly vote for the PAP before coming here online to bash the PAP.  Let me tell you one thing, anyone in the young PAP would have stepped forward and stopped the guy regardless of the danger.

In fact, knowing that 66.6% of the people vote for the PAP, I would like to think that 66.6% of the people there will step forward to help the poor girl.<br><br>Wouldn't you think it funny if he was to vote for the PAP and starts bashing the PAP online? Would it also mean that 66.6% of singaporeans are doing the same? For the fear of losing the goodies and fear and getting identified as a pro-opposition supporter (even though voting is so-called secret). Does it say something about the way elections are being run? Why would he want to do that if he has nothing to fear?<br><br>I am in fact quite intrigued with your strong support of the government.
