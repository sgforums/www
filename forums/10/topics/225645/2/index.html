People like you don't even dare attend opposition rallies, and secretly vote for the PAP before coming here online to bash the PAP.

Ambiguity of situation - two people are struggling in a knife fight. Who is the assailant? If you are just a passerby you have no idea what is going on.<br><br>What if you restrain the guy, and the lady stands up and stabs him dead right in front of you?<br><br>2. Bystander Effect - discovered by US researchers, this effect occurs when too many people are witnessing a violent crime. Everyone expects somebody else to help, so nobody helps.<br><br>To avoid the bystander effect, if you stumble upon a violent scene and you cannot call the police directly, do not hesitate to INSTRUCT any one to do so. This is also helpful to save people who have suffered from heart attacks.<br><br>3. Danger to your own safety - in the struggle, these two people are not only hurting each other, they can also hurt any people who intervene. There are previous cases of hapless bystanders slashed to death during a gang fight when they try to help.<br><br>In a situation like this, the best thing to do is to call the police and calmly tell them what is happening and where the location is. They are better trained to deal with this.<br><br>As for the comment about "dogs eating dogs", may I remind the TS that everyone in Singapore whether foreign-born or local-born have the same rights to personal safety.<br><br>I don't know and don't care what happens in China, and I am not interested in the disagreement between these two individuals, but when the struggle begins, I firmly believe that the intervention of the 55 year old uncle, while rash, deserves our admiration. The people standing idly by are not reflective of a civil society.<br><br></div>

Ambiguity of situation - two people are struggling in a knife fight. Who is the assailant? If you are just a passerby you have no idea what is going on.<br><br>What if you restrain the guy, and the lady stands up and stabs him dead right in front of you?<br><br><span style="color: red;">2. Bystander Effect - discovered by US researchers, this effect occurs when too many people are witnessing a violent crime. Everyone expects somebody else to help, so nobody helps.<br><br>To avoid the bystander effect, if you stumble upon a violent scene and you cannot call the police directly, do not hesitate to INSTRUCT any one to do so. This is also helpful to save people who have suffered from heart attacks.</span><br>3. Danger to your own safety - in the struggle, these two people are not only hurting each other, they can also hurt any people who intervene. There are previous cases of hapless bystanders slashed to death during a gang fight when they try to help.<br><br>In a situation like this, the best thing to do is to call the police and calmly tell them what is happening and where the location is. They are better trained to deal with this.<br><br>As for the comment about "dogs eating dogs", may I remind the TS that everyone in Singapore whether foreign-born or local-born have the same rights to personal safety.<br><br>I don't know and don't care what happens in China, and I am not interested in the disagreement between these two individuals, but when the struggle begins, I firmly believe that the intervention of the 55 year old uncle, while rash, deserves our admiration. The people standing idly by are not reflective of a civil society.<br><br></div></blockquote>Some years ago I was in an accident in which the SBS transit bus I was on was sandwiched by two other buses. How do you explain that nearly all the passengers (most were poly students) left immediately to catch another bus to their destination while the bus driver was pinned to his seat and bleeding at the head? Bystander effect or plain just bo-chap attitude? Most of us won't bother to do anything except when it's someone dear to us who is involved. That's a sad fact of life.</div>
