              <p>I have to thank the person who post this question and the many insights I gathered from the replies. I was just reading this piece of news today on yahoo.</p>
              <p>Quote: "Farouk Osman, an Undergraduate, said: "It’s regarding a
                                      statement made by the Minister Mentor that if 
              the opposition wins
                                      in a GRC contest then Singaporeans should better
               sell their flat
                                      because they would no longer be of any value. I 
              think that’s bad.
                                      He’s basically saying don’t vote the opposition 
              and my feeling is
                                      that most Singaporeans don’t like being told 
              what to do, especially
                                      regarding political stuff and this is especially
               so for people like
                                      us, the younger generation."</p>
              <p>It is a console to hear Singapore young adult voicing out their concerns. I strongly share with Farouk Osman's plight. It is not right for Minister Mentor to impose on their personal standpoint on young adult. A good mentor should see to it that a student is exposed to all knowledge, real life cases, experiences, and let the student decides for himself which position he wants to take. Telling the student "don't vote the opposition" downright unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Track back a bit on Singapore's past. Our country started off as a fishing village, and the majority of the population then were not educated. Therefore, people need to be led by the government. The progress Singapore has achieved from being a third world country to a developed nation over just 44 years is applaudable. However, times have changed. Majority of the population now are well-educated, and most of them have been around the world, or even received good education from abroad (due to limited university intake here). With internet, many young adults here are exposed to all sort of information. The downside is, some people take in the bad influence, such as excessive consumption, wasteful life-styles, and extreme viewpoints without critical thinking. What we need to caution is that information on the internet is not all true.You need to have a critical mind and read widely to make any comment on issues.</p>
              <p>For example, the case with current PAP is that they do not know how to present themselves to a new generation. In my opinion, many times PAP members give inappropriate speeches. Also, PAP is not listening to its people, although it hears what people have to say. In other words, they still treat Singaporeans as ignorant, uneducated people who need to be led.</p>
              <p>I think Singaporeans are ready for multi-party systems, as long as we keep to our core values and common goal of making our environment a better place to live. These are just my opinion, now you make your own :)</p>

              <p>When the PAP leadership start talking in an alarmist way - then it is a sure sign that they have no confidence nor trust the ability of Singaporeans to perform when it comes to exercising our responsiblity at the poll station during Election Day.</p>
              <p>It is a sad reflection to the level of rapport that was supposed to have existed between the political leadership and the citizens - who had supposedly given their consistent overwhelming mandate to the political leaders through all the elections over the last 53 years.</p>
              <p>Still it is troubling to note that the incumbent political leaders will lose confidence towards Singaporeans prior to each election and will resort to either gerrymeandering or outright bullying with scare tactics, scolding, and alarmist strategies to win the election.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the young be expected to be confident of their future - when the incumbent leadership has no confidence in the young to exercise their own judgment ?</p>

              <p><br>When the govt set out to make this place a rich and prosper country so that inclusively, all its citizens across a broad base can have a slice of the bigger and richer pies, they did not expect some of them refused to move up the prosperity ladder with them, leading to a low of 10 to 15% still hovering a third world beggar stage. And certain this group of people will feel the disparity of wealth to too much for them to handle leading to them blaming the govt and the society at large.</p>
              <p>Now with the govt encouraging them take up higher skill jobs thru almost free training and payroll included, they still refuse to come forward to embrace the second chance of their life, all these end up jobless not because of no job, but rather refused to accept what the society offered them.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">OPEN statement to all participant in this Forum</span> - to resist and ignore the idiocy of this 'angel7030' and not to indulge this 'hum' from Taiwan in useless exchanges that stretch into multiple pages to drive the thread off-track.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The persistence of the Taiwanese 'hum' to post its irrelevant and irreverent idiocy is to drive the thread off-track.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Its declared agenda is to draw the attention of any participant to engage with its idiocy - so as to pile up the pages in the thread with nonsensical exchange with itself - and the thread being ignored.</span></strong></p>
