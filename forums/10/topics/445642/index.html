            <div class='col-md body'>All top job usually comes with some perks. For example  if you are the CEO of a MNC  you have the use of a company car whilst in the office  and when performing your business duties  as CEO.  However you do not have a personal driver who also fetches your son to school.  So a company car with a driver to drive you to a meeting on company business  is also a perk (non taxable perhaps)  But  if your appointment comes with a paid driver and a car at your absolute disposal and for you family's use as well, now that perk  surely is taxable right? So which perk is better?   If  a  Minister  gets to travel business class, but somehow always the airline manages to upgrades him to first class on State business. (so surely this is not taxable as a perk) and the Ministry concerned picks up the airfare bill. Is that a perk? Surely some perks are taxable  and other not.</div>

              <p>Actually all those clean wages system reasoning is bullshit... For example, guess which family is running Temasek Holdings and taking home millions of dollars every year? Guess which family used to be head of Singtel?</p>

              <p>Ms. Ho, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (CEO of Temasek Holdings)</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Yang (ex SingTel CEO)</p>
              <p>Transparent? Cool, these perks nice hor?</p>
              <p>And then about the fraud cases, the ones in the news are like those famous LTA guys who siphoned millions of dollars... there are so many other fraud cases not in the news and nobody knows of except those who are involved... how are these part of the clean wage concept?</p>
              <p>guys guys... please don't be easily manipulated by the highly paid ministers said... they are smart, but some singaporeans are smarter.</p>

              <p>Agree. Cannot compare. Our leaders say that Singapore is so mini-size (a pimple according to Indonesia in the past) that governing it becomes a monumental effort.</p>
              <p>With that similar argument, governing China or USA becomes easy because China and USA are very large countries <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It is not too difficult actually, in America, the difficult part is to get elected, to run the country, you leave it to the big guns in Wall Street to run your economy, don't have to pay them much, they know how to pay themselves; when they have domestic problem, start a war somewhere. In Russia, if you can't run such a big country, you break it down into smaller ones. In China, if Mao ( a farmer's son) can run, so can you.

              <p>Actually.....</p>
              <p>Personally I am not opposed to perks.....because in my opinion some perks is good as a type of moral support and a form of entertainment or incentive to the employee.</p>
              <p>For example,</p>
              <p>Some companies have "team pantry fund"....this is extra money and is a perk......so around monthly or so, a team would go out and buy snacks, cup noodles, candies, instant coffee etc........and then put them in the pantry........then during breaks or anytime they like, they can go and eat those food......</p>
              <p>Not only that, but some companies also have lounge room nearby......which contain table soccer, sofa, etc..........and sometimes some guys can go in and have fun.......</p>
              <p>In my opinion perks are actually good......</p>
              <p>If they are concerned about excesses and corruption.........then maybe they should just remove the perks which are costing a lot of money.....but some little ones actually are good to have.....it is a form of moral support and encouragement....</p>
              <p>Specifically, things such as company car and driver.....I believe is Ok to have....</p>

              <p>All top job usually comes with some perks. For example if you
              are the <span>CEO</span> of a <span>MNC</span> you have the use of a company car whilst in the office and when
              performing your business duties as <span>CEO</span>.
              However you do not have a personal driver who also fetches your son
              to school. So a company car with a driver to drive you to a meeting
              on company business is also a perk (non taxable perhaps) But if
              your appointment comes with a paid driver and a car at your
              absolute disposal and for you family’s use as well, now that perk
              surely is taxable right? So which perk is better? If a Minister
              gets to travel business class, but somehow always the airline
              manages to upgrades him to first class on State business. (so
              surely this is not taxable as a perk) and the Ministry concerned
              picks up the airfare bill. Is that a perk? Surely some perks are
              taxable and other not.</p>
