              <p>China already people's republic.</p>
              <p>Plato is totalitarian republic.</p>
              <p>So we can argue that China is Plato republic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In time the ruling class of Russia became acquainted with
              Byzantine culture. They were dazzled by it, and sought to import it
              into their wilderness domains in the north. In this way they imposed on
              the Slav peoples many of the accessories of the Byzantine Empire, such
              as Orthodox Christianity, the Byzantine alphabet, the Byzantine
              calendar, the used of domed ecclesiastical architecture, the name Czar
              (Caesar) for their ruler, and innumerable other traits.</p>
              <p>Most important
              of all, they imported the Byzantine totalitarian autocracy, <strong>under which
              all aspects of life, including political, economic, intellectual, and
              religious, were regarded as departments of government, under the
              control of an autocratic ruler.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>These beliefs were part of the Greek
              tradition, and were based ultimately on Greek inability to distinguish
              between state and society. Since society includes all human activities,
              the Greeks had assumed that the state must include all human
              activities. </strong></p>
              <p>In the days of Classical Greece this all-inclusive entity
              was called the <em>polis</em>, a term which meant both society and state; in the later Roman period this all-inclusive entity was called the<em> imperium</em>. The only difference was that the <em>polis</em> was sometimes (as in Pericles's Athens about 450 B.C.) democratic, while the <em>imperium</em> was always a military autocracy. Both were totalitarian, so that
              religion and economic life were regarded as spheres of governmental
              activity.</p>
              <p>This totalitarian autocratic tradition was carried on to the
              Byzantine Empire and passed from it to the Russian state in the north
              and to the later Ottoman Empire in the south. In the north this
              Byzantine tradition combined with the experience of the Northmen to
              intensify the two-class structure of Slav society. In the new Slav (or
              Orthodox) Civilization this fusion, fitting together the Byzantine
              tradition and the Viking tradition, created Russia.</p>
              <p>From Byzantium came
              autocracy and the idea of the state as an absolute power and as a
              totalitarian power, as well as such important applications of these
              principles<strong> as the idea that the state should control thought and
              religion, that the Church should be a branch of the government, that
              law is an enactment of the state, and that the ruler is semi-divine.</strong></p>
              <p>From the Vikings came the idea that the state is a foreign importation,
              based on militarism and supported by booty and tribute, that economic
              innovations are the function of the government, that power rather than
              law is the basis of social life, and that society, with its people and
              its property, is the private property of a foreign ruler.</p>

                                      ways</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Japan was controlled by a small clique of people during that period, their democracy like ours exists only as a facade.</p>
              <p>You don't hold too many romantic thoughts about democracy.</p>
              <p>Most of it is only a charade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These leaders, organized in a shadowy group known as the Meiji
              oligarchy, had obtained complete domination of Japan by 1889. To cover
              this fact with camouflage, they unleashed a vigorous propaganda of
              revived Shintoism and of abject submission to the emperor which
              culminated in the extreme emperor worship of 1941-1945.</p>
              <p>To provide an
              administrative basis for their rule, the oligarchy created an extensive
              governmental bureaucracy recruited from their supporters and inferior
              members.</p>
              <p>To provide an economic basis for their rule, this oligarchy
              used their political influence to pay themselves extensive pensions and
              governmental grants (presumably as compensation for the ending of their
              feudal incomes) and to engage in corrupt business relationships with
              their allies in the commercial classes (like Mitsui or Mitsubishi).</p>
              <p>To
              provide a military basis for their rule, the oligarchy created a new
              imperial army and navy and penetrated the upper ranks of these so that
              they were able to dominate these forces as they dominated the civil
              bureaucracy.</p>
              <p>To provide a social basis for their rule, the oligarchy
              created an entirely new peerage of five ranks of nobility recruited
              from their own members and supporters.</p>
              <p>Having thus assured their dominant position in the administrative,
              economic, military, and social life of Japan, the oligarchy in 1889
              drew up a constitution which would assure, and yet conceal, their
              political domination of the country...</p>
