            <div class='col-md body'>I have highlighted this in the Cars Forum before, so thought I might as well post it here too...<br><br>If you have not noticed, read the news quite some time ago, LTA is coming down hard on Fog lamp offenders. Fog Lamps can only be used when (technically speaking) there is fog or poor visibility. Due to numerous complaints by the public on the misuse of them, LTA has decided to clamp down on its usage.<br><br>From the time the news came out till now, only warning letters are being issued. But I heard that LTA will soon go all out to enforce this and fine offenders. So, if you drive, please take note...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, indeed.<br><br>Fog Lamps are meant to be turned ON during heavy downpours at night, or in the day when sunlight is not bright enough during a heavy rain. But often and usually, there are a lot of motorists who turn on their fog lamps, on clear nights in addition to their glaring white or blue headlamps!!<br><br>I hope LTA start being harsh on these recalcitrant motorists and impose stiff and steep FINES for inconsiderate use of BLUE headlamps and fog lamps!<br><br>Mentalities of motorists in Singapore are embarrasing; must faster, flashier, and brightest. What the frig! Primitive attitude.<br><br></div>

I think you are referring to the High intensity discharge lights aka HID. These are factory fitted in most german made cars and Lexus. HID is useful if you drive at night on North South highway, as it lights up the road in front like as if it is day light, good visibility.<br><br>But these HID lights are fast becoming a status related fixtures on normal cars. With aftermarket HID lights at cheap prices, even KIA cars have them now.<br><br>These are really not necessary in Singapore city driving, since our roads are always well lighted. For me, I am sticking to the original "yellow" lights as I feel that they provide better visibility under street lighting conditions.</div>
