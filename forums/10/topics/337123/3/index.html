              <p>andrew, you finally come to this thread, thought you are not in today.   That certain man called ching eng going to go after you for saying the above (unless he is lenient with you today)..  See below in red on what he posted to me.   </p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This man Ching Eng, firstly claimed he is neither for PAP or oppositions and now if you read his posts you will know how fast he shows his displeasure to  people who dare voice out about the PAP.</span></p>
              <p>If the JC's scholarship is not given by PAP, supported and approved by the lees, then he means the oppositions are giving these scholarship?   He is fast to find fault and nailing people down.  He is like the masters he defend practising double standard.</p>

              <p>but the scholarship without bonds... this means that we seriously don't expect them to stay in singapore after ecompleting their studies. they left early, so we saved more money?</p>
