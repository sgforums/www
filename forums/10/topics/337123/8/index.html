              <p>Well, why is the government taking such high risk investments in Ah Tiong.  Sponsoring them so many things when they have such high chance of bailing compared to Singaporean students?  I'm not in Engine / Science or Computing Faculty, so my interaction with them is minimal.  But from what I understand, they are not being competitive here. They just mess up the Bell Curve, reducing Singaporean students' chances of attaining upper class honors.  Best part, they hop away to other countries where the pasture is greener.</p>
              <p>Are they ostracized in school?  I can't say.  They form such tight circles of friends among their "Tong Xiangs" anyway.  Not all Singaporean students are that anal or hardworking to go about actively ostracizing them.  The few ah tiongs are know and on good terms with, are fairly sociable guys n girls who make an effort to bridge the divide.  The Singaporean's in our club don't reject them at all.</p>
              <p>It is unfair to pin the blame on Singaporean students for their lack of desire for socializing.  The less Singaporean friends they make, the easier, it is for biased and mythical views of Chinamen to form, eg, they are smelly, they talk loudly and arrogantly, etc.</p>

              <p>Actually, bond-free scholarships are not uncommon elsewhere. Corporations, universities and other institutions would pay for or subsidise an individual's education if they deem them to have plenty of potential, as long as they maintain a minimum grade or produce outstanding projects.</p>

              <p>Ar. Uncle Andrew is always angry.. Im sure everyone here is used
              to it by now. </p>
              <p>I understand where you are coming from. I sorta faced/may face
              the same situation as you did. That is why I said the government
              has to invest more on it's people! But we do need foreign scholars
              coming in, but at the same time we do not want these scholars just
              using as a stepping stone to other things, as such we have to beef
              up the liberal nature of the current policy, the anybody just come
              mentality just would not do. But that said, think abt it, most of
              these scholars who leave their country are ppl who aspire for
              greater things, right? So by that, every scholar we sponsor is a
              risk we take. But a risk we need to take, given our situation. I
              haven't been in singapore schools in a while, but what I hear from
              my friends, these china ppl are being outwardly ostracized in
              school, and made to be unwelcomed. I know I'll be shot by Uncle
              Andrew for saying this. But how we expect to keep the very best,
              when we don't even welcome them as one of our own. That is the
              struggle for our government, there can pour in millions into this,
              but if Singaporeans are not supportive of this influx, it just
              wouldnt work out. Which is why they need to do more for
              Singaporeans to make them feel that they are not being ignored at
              the expense of these foreign scholars. To this, I think the
              administration has not done well.  </p>

              <p>it wasn't always like this, when i was in primary to secondary school, we had an ocassional addition from china every now and then and back then being ostracized was rare especially against PRCs. you don't even hear people talking about who's from china. no one cares, if anything we see them as people who did poorly for eng and great for mother tongue.come to think about it, i don't even hear about pei du mamas. we thought it was great to have a PRC student in our class, it made us feel special.</p>
              <p> its different nowdays, they're streaming in at a rate like our Town council fund going out and bringing all sorts of habits/behaviours we don't agree with. we're not saints, not saying we don't have  faults or anything but that doesn't mean we have to tolerate them and their habits. if they're getting ostracized, its not for no reason.</p>
              <p>while theres a need to be understanding, it stops after a certain point, you don't go to another person's house and behave badly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway I don't hate them, i just don't like large numbers of them, not to the point i feel like a foreigner in my own country. i understand the need for talents but not to the point when i can walk down the streets with 2-300 people and it seems like only 50 and singaporeans.</p>
