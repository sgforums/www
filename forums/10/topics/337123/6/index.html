              <p>Wait a sce, these tiongs are studying in a JC, which means that they have not finished their Uni yet. Also explains why they can run away cause they dont have any Uni cert to be with hold. and also</p>

They only loyal to china... they will never be loyal to singapore... its always the same.. take a look at the table tennis issue.. Dont know why Singapore government of all places wanna give these stupid bonds to china people.. Are china people really this smart?? i doubt so...</p>

              <p>In the initial investment, NTUC invested some Taxis in China,
              it's on a lease basis, these taxis have GPS system installed on
              them.</p>
              <p> </p>
