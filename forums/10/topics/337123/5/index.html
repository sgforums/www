              <p>one thing you are good at, fantagf, is avoiding my questions.</p>

              <p><br> you are with pure motive of finding fault with me in this thread.    If you have a bad day, do not come here to vent frustrations on people.    Speakers' Corner is for discussion not fault finding, it is a general forum for discussion.  This website is not an anti PAP forum does not mean people cannot voice their negative views, comments about the ruling party.  If you are so damn bloody unhappy people are talking negatively about PAP, like I said earlier you can jolly well go request the owner of the website to ban people from it.</p>

              <p>did you ALSO not enter without the objective to DISCUSS, but merely to vent?</p>
              <p>.... and can i ever hope to have some answers to those questions that i'd posted? or do you intend to brush them aside because you have no answer.</p>

              <p><br>let me put it this way..... speakers' corner is full of anti-garmen folks, and then there are a couple of pro-garmen nuts....</p>
              <p>a thread can start totally anti-garmen, eg poh's stuff.... i rarely pay attention to that, maybe occasionally add a naughty remark here and there (but rarely)</p>
              <p>a thread can start praise PAP, eg lionnoisy's stuff ... i also pay little attention to that, and i have never ever written anything that praises PAP unless I can prove it.</p>
              <p>my reason: what's the point....? kpkb in a faceless forum? got balls go out and stand beside chee, or sylvia, or support chaim or low. DO SOMETHING!!!</p>
              <p>so we end up back at speaker's corner, ranting and whining... and call names....</p>
              <p>.... but for those perfectly neutral thread, such as this one.... look again at page one... before even ONE constructive opinion was offered, garmen name calling starts.... (which is ok, by speaker's corner standard) but to top it off, the next post, is let's not forget the topic.. all from the same individual.... so what does it mean..??? he can write crap, but others can't? he can whine and rant but others can't? he can criticise blindly, but even a suggestion of being objective, he tells you go to visit pap website?</p>

              <p>Wait a sec, these tiongs are studying in a JC, which means that they have not finished their Uni yet. Also explains why they can run away cause they dont have any Uni cert to be with hold. and also</p>
              <p><em><strong>Apparently these 'smart' students found out that they don't need A level results to gain entry into US universities </strong></em></p>
              <p>Which means these tiongs did not gain that much of a value since they knew they dont need their current certificate.</p>
              <p>But they gained in another way, Visa clearance from Singapore to US.</p>
              <p>But also tells me something that these tiongs hated life in s'pore. If else why would they sacrifice free education and go to US where they will have to pay?</p>

              <p><br>back to topic....</p>
              <p>actually I think we are probably attracting 8 out of 10..... my company is full of PRCs with doctorate.... the fact that i don't understand, sometimes, what they are trying to say is immaterial.</p>
              <p>we need to get away from the mindset that your country's boundary is the only definition of citizenship. if we encourage our local folks to globalise, we need to understand that everyone else will also globalise.</p>
              <p>note too, that these 2 students is probably an anomaly. our service industry is full of foreigners, and many of these are providing better services that the local folks.</p>
              <p>those who want to go, will eventually go, be it singaporeans or foreigners.... it does not matter.</p>
              <p>what matters is that the those who remain, need to ensure that our livelihood is assured, whining about it does not help. learn, upgrade, improve and enhance. that's what we need to do to continue to have a good job.</p>
