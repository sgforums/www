All I can say is that I have been there done that and i am still doing it. Middle Eastern arabs really hate the american, they even sell slippers that looks like the american flag so that you can use your feet to step on it.<br><br>All I can say is that I dont believe any arab or muslim country in the ME will like the US to rule their country.
