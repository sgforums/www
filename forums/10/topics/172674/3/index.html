            <div class='col-md body'>Ariel Sharon is a LEADER, a person whose vision and ability cuts through mind boggling issues and get effective results.<br><br>During the Yom Kippur War, when Egypt made a surprise attack on the Holiest Day of the Jewish Calendar when all Israelis were celebrating - (much like our own Lunar New Year mood).<br><br>The Egyptian launched a surprise attack from the west of Suez, pushed Israel almost half way into the Sinai Peninsula, and with Syria launching a simultaneous surprise attack that saw them regaining the Golan Heights, allowing the Syrians to overlook half way into Israel with their artillery.<br><br>Israel was pushed critically against the wall.<br><br>Sharon was the Commander of a Tank Division in the Southern Region of the Sinai Peninisula, and was constantly probing Egyptian lines for a weak spot.<br><br>Having found one, and assessing the general situation of the war front, he ignored direct orders to hold his position, but went ahead to cross to the west bank of the Suez Canal, and made a flanking attack that took him behind Egyptian lines, driving his tank division all the way up the Suez Canal, nearly reaching Cairo.<br><br>His bold move cut off and trapped almost two third of the Egyptian Army on the East Side of the Suez and on the Sinai Peninsula; and brought the entire Egyptian attack into a halt.<br><br>After the war, despite his insubordination, Ariel Sharon's action made him a hero, and he was quietly moved out of the Israeli Armed Force.<br><br>He became a right-wing Nationalist pushing for the Jew settlements on occupied land, which he intended to be a buffer between the Palestinian areas and Israel.<br><br>Unfortunately, the settlements became the festering reason that made a bad situation even worse for the security of Israel - it resulted in the Palestinian Intifada uprising, timed bombs turned into suicide bombings, and constantly new recruits who are enthusiastic to die for the Palestinian cause.<br><br>It took courage and vision for Ariel Sharon to see through the smoke of the war, and found a weak side in this entire battle lines between the Jews and the Palestinians.<br><br>He build concrete walls along questionable new arbitrarily and unilatterally decided territorial lines for the wall to be built; and then decided to pull out all the settlements on questionably seized land even against the wishes of his own political supporters.<br><br>It allowed world opinion to change in support of Israel's new vision, it allowed Palestinians to have a sense of being in charge of their own affairs and political future, it brought a sense of new hope to the entire process of finding new way to handle relations between the Jews and the Palestinians.<br><br>Is there another man who has a mind and vision to be able to penetrate the smoke of all complicated issues, to find the simplest action that help to cut into the weakest point of the issues, so as to have a new line of action into the future ?<br><br>Ariel Sharon is a leader, who realise the futility of his original plans for the settlement on occupied land, and made a U-Turn to his own long held vision.<br><br>For his age, it is surprising that his wisdom tell him to be honest about the situation and make a U-Turn.<br><br>Can we say the same for our own 'ELITE LEADERSHIP' ?<br><br></div>
