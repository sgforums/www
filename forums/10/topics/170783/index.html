Other forums that debate about freewill repeat the same arguments over and over again but sometimes  there are fresh perpectives.<br><br>While there are no rules to deny what can be posted, but the fact that the current arrangement stifles new discussion cannot be denied. I know quite a few IT friends who believe technology should change people's habits but i believe technology should change to suit peoples habits. End of the day, if users find that they are stifled by technologies or rules, they would simply migrate to better alternatives.<br></div>

We should not stand behind burecratic rules and merely tell others to accept them. This post was to ask what is the rationale of the policy and discuss on alternatives.</div>

That anology applies to ANY human ideology, arguments or opinons as expressed in any fashion, including a forum itself. And if a moderator isn't capable of handling all these "dieases", than isn't that a manifastation of a weak immunity and tolerance to existing differing views and except the diversity of diease ?</span><br><br><blockquote>Mind you it's not about policing breakaway factions who love to spam differing views but simply to avoid repetitions.</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">No. This is the role of forumite to decide what is a spam or repetitions, not moderator's.</span><br><br><blockquote>Too much of the same food is never good, so the line must be drawn.
