              <p>Anyone can join politics, it just depends on the party whether they wanna accept you and worse to worse, you can form your own party.</p>
              <p>But I do wish to see more qualified and credible people joining the opposition. People who are professionals, people who have been in politics for a long time, people who are respected in the society, people whose views are being sought after. We need credible people to join the opposition party to give PAP a better run for their money. Shouting loudly and insulting PAP in the forum and the hawker centre is not going to help. People who garner alot of respect like Sylvia, Jeyer, Chiam are the kind of people who will make the opposition stronger.</p>

              <p>If you are of the profile of Ms. Sylvia Lim or Low Thia Khiang or Chiam See Tong you are at best only the moderates or middle-path politicians who could merely make some noise not effective enough to expose wrong doings or providing effective alternatives to lead the masses to stay ahead in the new age.</p>
              <p>If indeed the ruling party is so interested in cultivating and maturing our own oppositions alternative political successions for the good of all, they should have welcome and cultivated people such as Tang Liang Hong or even allowing some of their own old blood like Tan Soo Khoon or Ong Teng Cheong to have their ways and mature a different multi-functional more creative democracy to bring us higher.</p>
              <p>So to me it is full of hypocrisy to try to run down CSJ or give praises to Low Thia Khiang or Sylvia Lim as this is still part and parcel of the devilry to divide and rule by selective comparison as was constantly done to deny problems by comparing our situations to worse-case scenarios to stay in power and control for the selfish motives of the few in power.</p>
              <p>A system which runs on top-down and arrogant agendas of this type will not last and even if we are materially and economically successful due to over-exploitations of the people, there is still no future and that is why we are having many problems from perpetual over-taxing and hoarding of monies causing struggling of the ordinary people just to survive the economic race.</p>
              <p>Do not be deceived by propagandas and hypocrisy. What we need is a open and consultative political environment allowing all and the best to take part in political renewal and evolution to a true democracy one which will bring out the best of our citizens for only on such a base will we produce the best form of government and only that will assure us of highest qualities of leadership and talent.</p>

              <p><br>high growth rate?</p>
              <p>are you referring to this year's growth?</p>
              <p>after you remove the price inflation from the GDP, will probably have 1-3 % real GDP growth per capita, which is the norm for mature economies.</p>

              <p>A man worked hard, found a good wife, and had 2 sons. After many years of sheer hardwork and a lot of sacrifices, he grew successful and rich, and could provide security and wealth for his family.</p>
              <p>His son Tom soon grew up, educated and well taken care of.</p>
              <p>One day he saw sports car, heard his friends raved about it, and he wanted one as well. He went to his father and ask for it, as he was still studying and could never afford one on his own.</p>
              <p>His father, who loved his child, and feared for his safety, being only 18years old, refused. Tom turned petulant and rebellious. He accused his father for being a miser, not loving him, and plenty of other hurtful things. His father, hurt, but turned to stone and continued to refuse such wilful belligrancy even after explaining his reasons. The friction grew, and Tom never did reconcile with his father.</p>
              <p>The second son Micheal, was much responsible. When he turned 18, he too wanted a sports car. But he knew and understood his father's concerns for a son's safety - years of grooming and hard work, surely he doesn't want the son to be injured or incapicitated in an accident.</p>
              <p>So he did his best to prove to his father that he is a responsible 18 year old. He took his driving licence, clean his father's car, and undertook to drive his dad's car for short nearby errands at the Mamashop to buy bread, sent his mother for medical check-ups. In time, the father grew to trust him, and Micheal himself learn about responsibilities as well.</p>
              <p>Within a year, his father bought him a better european sports model on his own initiative, to the delight of a by then 19 year old NS man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is more to politics than one can possibly gained from books or exported models. Singapore politics are very much different and unique. For the opposition and the politically bitter ones who chosed to live in rose-tinted delusions, they must wake up to reality. To get a credible opposition party into the political foreground, one must understand MM Lee himself.</p>
              <p>MM Lee sacrificed much and fought titanic battles to gain our independence, which was a mistake served on a plate. Even though our previous generation played a huge part in its eventual success of a nation of today, no one can deny it was policies and enforcements 'forced down' by MM Lee and his team on a largely uneducated population that do not understand what 'freedom' really entails, even as some present generation do no equally understand.</p>
              <p>He is no dictator, nor seek to have pedestal made after him, which infact, he banned such proposals. All he wanted, like a father, is the safety and well being of the nation in good hands.</p>
              <p>Thus, if one wants a credible opposition in government, then the opposition must show they are better than the ones MM Lee had groomed, equally as responsible, capable, and one whom will not take the populist path that will ultimately lead to doom. Someone who is caring and not afraid to to make hard and hated decisions that may hurt some, but will ensure the survivability of million others.</p>
              <p>Behave like a responsible son, and not the wilful child, and change may be on the way. The best way to prove it is to manage the town council well, with surpluses and smiling constituents.</p>
              <p>As usual, only my 2 cents worth.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well, in my opinion, politics is a war of words, a true display of the phrase “Doing everything to win” even by unscrupulous means. Being honest will work to a certain extent, but that doesn’t stop the opposition from defaming you and win. Even WITH honesty, how can one determine if you are truly a man of integrity or simply a two faced snake, hungry for power? The fact is, we cannot, we’re not able to do so, but one thing for sure is, a defamatory attack on the other party is bound to work. Look at Malaysia, despite Anwar(pardon my spelling) being popular and all, he got screwed by his political adversary when he published that book which in included 50 reasons why Anwar should not be PM. <br><br>Singapore doesn’t really have a political scene IMO, it’s dominated by our “great and beloved fatherly emperor figure O’ great Lee” (/sarcasm) That’s now, but before, it was really epic, but hey, look at Singapore now, we’re doing great……..right? </span></p></div>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>A man worked hard, found a good wife, and had 2 sons. After many
              years of sheer hardwork and a lot of sacrifices, he grew successful
              and rich, and could provide security and wealth for his family.</p>
              <p>His son Tom soon grew up, educated and well taken care
              of.</p>
              <p>One day he saw sports car, heard his friends raved about
              it, and he wanted one as well. He went to his father and ask for
              it, as he was still studying and could never afford one on his
              own.</p>
              <p>His father, who loved his child, and feared for his safety,
              being only 18years old, refused. Tom turned petulant and
              rebellious. He accused his father for being a miser, not
              loving him, and plenty of other hurtful things. His father, hurt,
              but turned to stone and continued to refuse such wilful belligrancy
              even after explaining his reasons. The friction grew, and Tom never
              did reconcile with his father.</p>
              <p>The second son Micheal, was much responsible. When he turned 18,
              he too wanted a sports car. But he knew and understood his father's
              concerns for a son's safety - years of grooming and hard work,
              surely he doesn't want the son to be injured or incapicitated in an
              accident.</p>
              <p>So he did his best to prove to his father that he is a
              responsible 18 year old. He took his driving licence, clean his
              father's car, and undertook to drive his dad's car for short nearby
              errands at the Mamashop to buy bread, sent his mother for medical
              check-ups. In time, the father grew to trust him, and Micheal
              himself learn about responsibilities as well.</p>
              <p>Within a year, his father bought him a better european sports
              model on his own initiative, to the delight of a by then 19 year
              old NS man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is more to politics than one can possibly gained from
              books or exported models. Singapore politics are very much
              different and unique. For the opposition and the politically
              bitter ones who chosed to live in rose-tinted delusions, they
              must wake up to reality. To get a credible opposition party
              into the political foreground, one must understand MM Lee
              himself.</p>
              <p>MM Lee sacrificed much and fought titanic battles to gain our
              independence, which was a mistake served on a plate. Even though
              our previous generation played a huge part in its eventual success
              of a nation of today, no one can deny it was policies and
              enforcements 'forced down' by MM Lee and his team on a largely
              uneducated population that do not understand what 'freedom' really
              entails, even as some present generation do no equally
              understand.</p>
              <p>He is no dictator, nor seek to have pedestal made after him,
              which infact, he banned such proposals. All he wanted, like a
              father, is the safety and well being of the nation in good
              hands.</p>
              <p>Thus, if one wants a credible opposition in government, then the
              opposition must show they are better than the ones MM Lee had
              groomed, equally as responsible, capable, and one whom will not
              take the populist path that will ultimately lead to doom. Someone
              who is caring and not afraid to to make hard and hated decisions
              that may hurt some, but will ensure the survivability of million
              others.</p>
              <p>Behave like a responsible son, and not the wilful child, and
              change may be on the way. The best way to prove it is to manage the
              town council well, with surpluses and smiling constituents.</p>
              <p>As usual, only my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p><br>Once a PM retired, he will not be pay anymore, that happen in most countries, they will stand down and perhap get some compensation in a pension system. But our is funny, after PM, got SM, after SM, got MM, then later after MM got SMM...wow! and all are paid more than a PM, cos promoted mah. So instead of paying one PM, we have to pay SM, MM and so on...till they die. Fair or not?</p>
