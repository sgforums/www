              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>Since a 52 year old relief cabby was charged in court two weeks ago
              for offending his ”higher mortal” holier-than-thou and
              whiter-than-white PAP MP Lee Yi-Shyan during his Meet-the-People
              session at Bedok, we have received a deluge of letters from concerned
              readers expressing their worries and fears that they may end up in the
              same predicament if they had an unfortunate slip of tongue when meeting
              their PAP MPs.</p>
              <p>For the welfare of our readers, we have compiled a simple guide for
              you to follow if you need to meet your PAP MP at his/her
              Meet-the-People sessions in the future.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Prepare yourself mentally: Have ZERO expectations</strong></p>
              <p>Before you meet your PAP MP, you should prepare yourself mentally
              that whatever request you asked for is unlikely to be granted. Contrary
              to popular belief, your PAP MP is not there to “serve” you at all.
              He/she is only the “Tua Pek Kong” of your constituency. In other words,
              he/she is just there for the purpose of formality only and is NOT
              obliged to help you in anything. Do not expect any help from your PAP
              MP. You are just there to try your luck, get it?</p>
              <p><strong>2. Jot down your requests on a piece of paper</strong></p>
              <p>Please do not overwhelm your PAP MP with endless questions,
              complaints and requests for assistance. Jot them down in point form one
              by one so that you will know exactly what to say when you meet him/her.
              Please share some thought for your poor PAP MP who still have to meet
              countless lesser mortals like you after a long day work. He/she is
              probably too tired to remember the details of your complaints, so keep
              whatever you have to say short and sweet.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Bring along your NRIC and a book:</strong></p>
              <p>Registration for most Meet-the-People sessions begin at 7pm. Please
              bring your NRIC along for registration and any other relevant
              documents. Your PAP MP will usually arrive only one to two hours later
              and so bring along a book or newspaper to spend the time there when
              waiting. Patience is not a virtue of many Singaporeans, but please bear
              in mind that you are there because you are in need of your PAP MP’s
              help and not the other way round.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Do not expect to meet your PAP MP</strong></p>
              <p>Do not be surprised or angry if your PAP MP is not on duty or he/she
              is unable to make it for the session in the last minute and is replaced
              by a senior grassroots leader. If you die-die have to meet the MP, then
              return another day or otherwise you can reflect your concerns to the
              grassroots leader. After all, the typing of the letters and liaison
              with other government agencies are usually done by the grassroots
              leaders. All the PAP MP does it to sign his/her name on the paper.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Basic etiquette when you meet the MP</strong></p>
              <p>Do not kowtow to your ultra-sensitive PAP MP in case he/she thinks
              you are up to something funny. On entering the room, give a deep bow
              and greet him/her before taking your seat.</p>
              <p>Try to avoid eye contact when in front of the MP. Some people have a
              fierce gaze and the MP may mistake that as a sign of intimidation.</p>
              <p>Your PAP MP may sound curt, rude or even downright callous in
              his/her tone. Regardless of what he/she says, you should nod your head
              in agreement and not respond. </p>
              <p>The session will usually end in a few minutes and you should stand up and bow to your MP again before taking your leave.</p>
              <p>Remember: don’t open your mouth unless it is really necessary or your MP may misinterpret your intention and feel threatened.</p>
              <p>Lastly, please keep in mind (print it out if you have to) the three
              PAP mantras before you decide to jeopardize your livelihood by meeting
              your PAP MP:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Singaporeans are champion grumblers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. You die your business!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3. We are deaf to all criticisms!</strong></p>
