            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 30, 2006<br>Time to weave a stronger net<br>We need to do two things: redistribute economic gains better, and put in place a form of social insurance<br><br>By For The Straits Times, Eddie Lee<br><br>THE tragic suicide of Mr Tan Jee Suan, 46, and subsequent revelations of his family's plight prompted their Member of Parliament Ho Geok Choo to ask: 'The Government has all these (social assistance) packages in place, but why are people missing out on them?'<br><br>There are 51 schemes available to help Singaporeans in need. But overall, social transfers, including public health expenditure, amount to just about 2 per cent of gross domestic product.<br><br>This compares with about 13 per cent in the US and an average of 25 per cent in Scandinavian countries.<br><br>Welfarism is a dirty word in Singapore. Why we have adopted such a harsh approach rests on the belief that welfarism breeds dependency and requires such a high rate of taxation that it would ultimately undermine a country's economic competitiveness.<br><br>But just how unmotivated will our workforce become if we build a better social safety net? How uncompetitive our economy? These cannot be determined by ideology. They are empirical issues.<br><br>So what is the evidence?<br><br>Consider the Scandinavian countries. They spend more than any other region in the world on welfare and, as a result, have top marginal personal income tax rates that rise to as high as 50 per cent.<br><br>Still, the latest 2006 World Economic Forum's global competitiveness survey ranks three Scandinavian economies - Finland, Sweden and Denmark - as more competitive than Singapore.<br><br>How can that be?<br><br>Mr Augusto Lopez-Claros, chief economist and director of the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness programme, argues that, in terms of competitiveness, what matters is how well government revenue is spent rather than the overall tax burden itself.<br><br>The Scandinavian countries, he contends, have 'high levels of government tax revenue (that) deliver world-class educational establishments, an extensive safety net and a highly motivated and skilled labour force'.<br><br>The most remarkable feature of their economies is the low rate of poverty. Using the common measure of poverty as less than 50 per cent of median household income, the poor in Sweden and Finland account for around 6 per cent of households, compared with 25 per cent of Singaporean households living on less than half the median income.<br><br>The Nordic countries are not without their faults, of course. They have higher unemployment rates (averaging 5.5 per cent) than we do (3.1 per cent). And their super-generous welfare systems are probably too costly to carry in the long run, given their ageing populations.<br><br>This seems to be the message in Sweden, where a centre-right alliance led by Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt recently edged out 12 years of Social Democrat rule.<br><br>Still, Mr Reinfeldt's plan to stimulate job growth is through fine-tuning, not dismantling, the welfare system. He argues that changes are necessary now to preserve the welfare state for the future.<br><br>So while the Nordic experience points to the limits of providing an excessive welfare state, it also suggests that we can build a better social safety net without sinking our economic competitiveness.<br><br>This is particularly urgent, as our ageing population will face more hazards ahead.<br><br>A recent US study gives some clues. Labour economist Richard Johnson, of the Urban Institute in Washington, found that seven in 10 adults aged 51 to 61 in 1992 developed a health problem, lost a spouse to death or divorce or became unemployed during the 10 years ending in 2002.<br><br>Note that all these took place even as the United States enjoyed its longest economic expansion in history.<br><br>With our baby boomer cohort hitting a median age of 50 this year, and only one in four working Singaporeans able to meet the CPF minimum sum requirement at age 55, it is not just the bottom-rung workers who are at risk, but the average Singaporean too.<br><br>These sobering statistics should ring an alarm bell - our philosophy of self-reliance based on individual savings accounts and family support is simply inadequate for many households to withstand an economic crisis.<br><br>Mr Tan Jee Suan and his wife have a total of 18 siblings, but the fact of the matter is, poor families tend to have poor relatives. What of future generations with reduced family network?<br><br>We need to do two things better. First, we need to re-distribute economic gains better. This is what social assistance schemes should aim at, rather than being offered reluctantly as a last-resort form of state charity, which is the case now.<br><br>We should recognise that while it is important to retain our flexible labour market policies, the benefits derived are being distributed unevenly.<br><br>Technology increasingly creates a 'winner-takes-all' effect. TV, for example, rendered the talent of many local performers obsolete and, as a popular song goes, 'video killed the radio star'.<br><br>Many other jobs will go in the future. Sharing the gains and pains of opportunities from new technology will ease the job transitions required in a dynamic economy.<br><br>Second, we need to provide better protection of living standards. This requires social insurance. And it should be comprehensive - covering not just health, but unemployment and retirement needs.<br><br>Insurance, together with the power of the state to require participation, can transform individual misfortunes into social costs that are distributed broadly across the population.<br><br>For example, people saving for their retirement must save enough to sustain themselves in case they live a long life or incur huge health-care costs. But individuals can achieve the same goal with a smaller amount of savings, if everyone pooled their funds. Each person then needs to contribute just enough to support the average life and health expectancy of the group.<br><br>The stakes are high, especially in the face of our rapidly ageing population. If we prepare adequately for the immense challenges ahead, we could save many from destitution in their old age.<br><br>The writer is a former Straits Times economics reporter.</div>
