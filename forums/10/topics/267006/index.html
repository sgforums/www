            <div class='col-md body'>WITH the increase in the goods and services tax (GST) rate, I have become more conscious about the cost of this tax. So when I received my latest utilities bill recently, I pored over it to see how GST is levied. Two issues bother me.<br><br>First, there is a Water Conservancy Tax of 30 per cent which is levied on the full cost of water consumed. By its name, I would have thought the purpose of this tax, and acceptably so, is to penalise consumers who use water excessively. However, the tax is levied on every dollar of water consumed regardless of the quantity used, even though a consumer's usage is well below the national average stated in the bill as is in my case. Hence it is no more than a disguised additional 30 per cent increase in the published water rate of $1.17 per cu m. Water is an essential item and conservancy from absolutely no usage is not an option. To serve the conservancy cause, shouldn't the tax kick in only if usage is excessive?<br><br>Second, the Water Conservancy Tax, which is by no stretch of imagination an item of goods or services, is also subject to GST. It is unreasonable as a matter of fundamental principle that a tax is imposed on a tax payment.<br><br>I asked SP Services, the service provider, about this and was told the charges are made on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance to whom I should refer my questions.<br><br>I am also concerned that there are other similar situations. We consumers are already burdened by a wide-<br><br>ranging escalation in cost of living, as well as indirect taxes, and should be spared from having to pay taxes on taxes.<br><br>Quek Soo Beng<br><br>extracted from straits time forum.<br></div>

Eventhough you may be using less water then the national level, you are still regarded you as a wastage of their water in their eyes..So don't grumble and talk about water conservation should only be applied after you have reached a certain quantity of usages. Just pay the additional 30-40% of water conservation taxes. And on top of that, pls pay another 7% for taking the time to address to ppl like you enquires.<br><br>It is call water conservation tax, if you dare talk somemore, we will just changed the name to water tax.
