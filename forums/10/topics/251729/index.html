"Things are complicated," she said with her head buried in her pillow on the bottom bunk of a rickety metal bunk bed.<br>When Ser went to the toilet to wash his hands after raping her, she did not flee but instead hid her valuables for fear they might be stolen.<br><br>It suggests finances may have played a part in delaying her departure for China.<br>When asked what she thought of Ser's sentence - 28 years behind bars and 24 strokes of the cane - she said: "I don't know. I don't want to know."<br>The woman, who lived with her mum before corning here, did not say if she had told her divorced parents of the rape.<br>Ser's two other victims have left the flat where they were attacked but the incident still haunts them.<br>A report by consultant psychiatrist Joshua Kua found that the 20-year-old woman, a virgin at the time, avoids using the toilet alone and is startled if someone suddenly opens the door.<br>The third victim, a 22-year-old student, frequently locks her room for fear of intruders: and is afraid to take the lift alone.<br>She once saw a man with tinted hair in a crowd and fled, fearing it was Ser.<br>And while the 18-year-old was non-committal in her answers, once left alone, she expressed her anguish in another way - a piercing, fearful scream.<br>Melissa Sim.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings.
