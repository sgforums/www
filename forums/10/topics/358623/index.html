              <p>04 May, 2009</p>
              <p>The world economy is not only showing few signs of recovery, but we are
              also looking at the end of the American century, according to German
              author and economist William Engdahl.</p>
              <p>In an exclusive interview with RT, he highlights the different ways
              in which the crisis has affected America and Europe and their
              subsequent responses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>RT: Recently we have seen several American banks beat the
              forecast and record an increase in profit. So, is the worst now over
              for the world's economy?</em></p>
              <p>William Engdahl: This is by no means the sign of the end of the
              crisis. I estimate that we are perhaps 40% into the losses alone in the
              US real estate sector and these banks.</p>
              <p>When we talk about banks we really talk at most about seven or eight
              huge institutions that are in the center of the crisis and not about
              tens of thousands of smaller banks in the US.</p>
              <p><em>RT: So, in your opinion, do you think it is too soon to be optimistic?</em></p>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">
              <p>W.E.: Absolutely too soon to be optimistic in the US. The US is the
              heart of a global problem, the core of the problem. And US financial
              and banking deregulations since the end of the 1990s are the proximate
              cause of the problem.</p>
              <p>And that is a process now which is going to put the US into what I
              called ten years of hell. It is going to be worse in some respect than
              the Great Depression of the 1930s for most Americans, and everything
              that the current administration and the previous administration have
              done about the problem is merely going to make it worse for the actual
              economy.</p>
              <p><em>RT: So now let's shift to Eastern Europe. Could you perhaps
              paint us a picture about the situation there at the moment? Which
              countries are the most affected?</em></p>
              <p>W.E.: The problem in Eastern Europe is a derivative problem of cheap
              credit coming out of Wall Street for the last seven years. And as the
              [Federal Reserve] lowered its interest rates after 2002, partly to
              create this real estate bubble and to feed the Wall Street banks’
              securitization process, the interest rates worldwide came down: the
              European interest rates, and so forth. So, banks in Europe were able to
              borrow money very cheaply and lend it out to Eastern European countries
              that were in the EU, like Poland, or Hungary, or the Czech Republic.</p>
              <p>I don't see it as the same kind of crisis as the derivatives crisis
              in the US banks, because there is a real housing deficit after 50 years
              of the controlled economy command economy of the Warsaw Pact Soviet
              era. And people do have jobs there. This is not derivative speculation
              off the books. This is simply normal banking loans. And what EU
              governments have done in one form or another is to step in with IMF
              funds – I am not a fan of IMF in any way – but the purpose of the funds
              was to stabilize the currency so that it does not become a speculative
              target and make the crisis worse. I think for the moment that it's,
              quote-on-quote, “under control.” It does not have the leverage
              potential that the American crisis has.</p>
              <p><em>RT: And Russia is currently in the similar situation with rumors
              that many banks will soon go bust if more negotiation does not happen
              with the West sometime soon. So what doe you think is the best option
              available to Russia?</em></p>
              <p>W.E.: Russia has to, and this is I think one thing that the current
              government and when Vladimir Putin was president tried very much to do,
              is to bring the crucial elements of the sovereign nation back under
              state control.</p>
              <p>That does not say going back to the era of central planning
              communism, but certainly to control your currency, to control your
              credit system – these are things that every sovereign system should
              rightly have. And in terms of the banking crisis perhaps there are some
              banks that would do better if nationalized if the losses are too great.
              At least nationalized so that they could be then cleaned up from the
              toxic waste and the bad investments and that the real economy comes out
              of this as a healthy factor and not pure financial speculation for the
              good of a few oligarchs at the expense of the Russian economy and
              Russian people.</p>
              <p><em>RT: So how long do you think it is going to take before we see the end of this recession?</em></p>
              <p>W.E.: The point is we are at an epochal change. This is something
              that happens perhaps every four or five hundred years. This is not a
              once a decade recession we are living through. And I call it in my new
              book the ‘Decline of the American century’. This is a terminal decline
              as you had with the British Empire after WWI. It would not matter if
              Jesus Christ was the President of the US today. There would be nothing
              he could do to reverse that decline process. We would almost have to
              reorganize and start from scratch, because the cancer of this financial
              system has embedded so deeply that they’ve destroyed the industrial
              technology in the US.</p>
              <p>They outsourced manufacturing over the past 25-30 years to Asia, to
              Eastern Europe, all over the world. The American elite have rotted
              itself from the inside out over the past 30-40 years since the early
              1970s.</p>
              <p>So Europe, very much including Russia or let's say Eurasia… Eurasia
              is a vast continent which has every resource man could imagine for
              everything we would want to build economically. It has the brainpower,
              it has the scientific talents, and we have not totally destroyed that
              as in the case of the US. And that is all we need. It has the raw
              materials, Russia has unlimited resources of natural gas and oil. The
              Russian geology is likely years ahead of American and Western geology,
              geophysics let's say, because it is based on real physics science and
              not on hocus-pocus to hide the fact of how much oil the world has.
              There is nothing that is lacking.</p>
              <p>The decision in the Western Europe, the EU is, for many European
              elites, I know this from discussions here in Germany in the recent
              years – they have to make a choice, and they’re schizophrenic about
              that choice right now: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>either strengthen the Atlantic alliance with
              Washington and go down with the sinking Titanic called the American
              century, or carefully try to reorient the supertanker called the EU and
              build bridges of cooperation with Russia above all, with China above
              all for economic markets and whatnot.</strong></span></p>
              <p><em>RT: What are your thoughts on US President Barack Obama? Do you think he is the man to control the situation?</em></p>
              <p>E.W.: No. To my mind, and I said this in print a year before Barack
              Obama became president, the American power establishment since the time
              at least of Abraham Lincoln, with the possible exception of John F.
              Kennedy, has never allowed any candidate to get near White House who
              they do not totally control.</p>
              <p>We see that in the case of president Obama, so there is nothing that
              the Obama administration is doing to rock the boat. He is merely, if
              you will, a cosmetic change. How do you say – ‘old wine in a new
              bottle’? That’s Barack Obama. He is simply an attempt to deceive, to
              put the rest of the world off balance, but I think it is certainly
              wearing thin on the American public. They realize he has not done
              anything fundamental to improve the situation. He has, I think, perhaps
              another two or three months before he becomes, like George Bush, the
              most hated man in America.</p>
              <p><em>RT: You touched upon George Bush there. In one of your books you
              wrote about the hidden history of oil and money, and how that it is
              hidden cause, the underlying cause, behind a lot of conflicts since
              WWII. So, if we consider the US agenda in Iraq – was it about oil?</em></p>
              <p>W.E.: Very much it was about oil but not in the sense that many journalists speculated at the time.</p>
              <p>The question of oil for the United States’ elite – first of all
              let's look at the Bush-Cheney presidency. Institutionally, the
              Bush-Cheney presidency represented the geopolitical power of the
              American military industry complex combined with big oil. They are
              inseparable.</p>
              <p>Halliburton is this poster child for this. Halliburton is at one and
              the same time the largest construction company building military bases
              around the world for the Pentagon, and Halliburton is also the largest
              oil field geophysical services company around the world.</p>
              <p>So they’re in every country where there is suspected to be oil,
              onshore or offshore. So that is a massive intelligence capability. But
              the point about controlling Iraq and militarizing the Middle East goes
              back to something that US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in
              the 70s. If you control the oil you control whole nations, or groups of
              nations.</p>
              <p>Who was in Iraq before the war? China, Russia, and France. Who
              howled with protest in the UN Security Council and refused to sanction
              the US war against Saddam Hussein? China, Russia, and France – for a
              very good reason. The control of Iraq militarily means that the
              emerging powers of Eurasia lose the ability to have an independent
              supply line of oil. Look around Africa. Where are the hot spots in
              Africa? Darfur. Ask yourself why after 2004 does genocide in Darfur
              suddenly become such a human concern for George W. Bush that he is
              crying crocodile tears or George Clooney the actor who is going on
              stage pleading to stop genocide in Africa? It just so happens if you
              look beneath the surface – Darfur has huge untapped oil recourses.</p>
              <p><em>RT: And continuing then on the subject of oil, many people
              forecasted that the price of oil will be stable for years to come, for
              decades actually. Do you think that Russia was perhaps wrong in
              concentrating all of its attention on oil?</em></p>
              <p>W.E.: No, I don't. I think the strategy of then president Putin, and
              now president Medvedev’s government to use Russia's vast recourses of
              natural gas and oil is highly intelligent and absolutely crucial part
              of trying to counterweight the military power of Washington by creating
              networks of economic cooperation with Western Europe, especially
              Germany. I think I would do the same myself, were I sitting in Moscow.</p>

              Gary: He said to me at the lift lobby 90% of the exact words - â€�Mr Tan,if you walk out of here tomorrow,you might get killed.You might meet with a mysterious accident,you might disappear and nobody will know what happened to you! Mr Tan, some things and people in this country you cannot offend! Some people are above all things! You better make sure you know this! Mr Tan,we can arrange for things to happen to you.You understand or not!â€�
