            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: Some 3,600 people became citizens of Singapore on Saturday at citizenship ceremonies held islandwide. <br><br>The ceremonies took place at Group Representative Constituencies (GRCs), while the National Citizenship Ceremony was held in the Supreme Court Auditorium. <br><br>Ministers and Members of Parliament officiating at the ceremonies have called on both new and existing citizens to get to know one another better. <br><br>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Lim Swee Say, also urged them to learn more than one language. <br><br>Many of the new citizens, who are of different ages and come from various countries, said they want to become Singapore citizens because the country is safe and secure, and they will not face discrimination. <br><br>Arevalo Sheila Marie Paloma, one the new citizens, said: "I feel very welcomed. My children have Chinese, Indian, Filipino friends and they get along well with them." <br><br>The status of being a citizen also comes with responsibilities to the country, like National Service. <br><br>Muthappan Krishnan, another new citizen, said: "I did chat (about National Service) with quite a few friends and what they said, I recall, is that it is a transition phase from boyhood to manhood, so I thought it's a good method to go through the process and I am happy about it." <br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean emphasised that building a strong and closely knit community is a greater challenge during these difficult economic times. <br><br>"A number of us would have come from countries which are much more mono-ethnic and mono-religious, where most of the people are of one race or one religion. In some cases, you have come from countries where there may be tensions or conflicts amongst people of different races and religions. <br><br>"But when we come here to Singapore, we must commit ourselves to putting those things aside and commit ourselves to learning to live in peace and harmony, and understanding with our neighbours and fellow Singaporeans," he said. <br><br>A key theme during this year's National Day celebrations is the importance of integration between old and new citizens. New citizens are encouraged to be active citizens by joining various community activities in their constituencies. <br><br>The National Citizenship Ceremony is held in August to coincide with the National Day celebrations. <br></span></p></div>

              <p>As far as I'm concern, new / old citizen, even PR makes no difference..... all will 'RUN' the moment S'pores in trouble. Just ask any S'porean would they stay to defend S'pore and you'll know it to be true. </p>
              <p>If that is the case...... New Citizen or PR might be better for S'pore than 'Old' Citizen.... at least they didn't get benefit from young and yet bad mouth their own country whenever they can......</p>

              <p>Immigrants are good for diversifying our gene pool.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a very small island with only a few million locals. And to add to the inbreding woe, the multi races don't inter-marry. Making inbreeding a big problem.</p>
              <p>What will be interesting is to see how many of the new immigrants are willing to mix their genetics into ours ?</p>

              <p>I can't deny that we are immigrants too, many years ago, but at
                      such rate of recruiting New citizens, Singapore is just going to
                      lose its support of Past Hard working Singaporeans who had
                      sacrificed for this place. What's the point of fighting for? Can I
                      enjoy my piece of wonderful pie here as more people come to compete
                      for space. What is my Children's future? Who can guaratee there
                      will be enough for everyone... Just take EDUCATION for instance,
                      they are taking away our Children's space!</p>

              <p>birthrate is only 8.99 babies per thousand citizens, comparing to 2003, 12.7 / thousand citizens. Both figures are totally diseaster for Singapore population in near future, with a recent 3,600 new citizenships, we are still far far below the ability to take over this generation. So what to do, the govt just anyhow rush people in, hoping that they give births more to help singapore..at the end of the day, the ideology of foreign import is totally vague, to help our economy or to help our birthrate production line.</p>

              <p>well, sista, Singapore got too many ugly guys and gals too, unlike my taiwanese gene and look, therefore it is good and right for them to mix with baba, ang moh, bangala, PRC n vietcong gals to provide more sharp noses and nice feature peoples. Now are mostly small eyes, big mouth, flat nose, yogi ears and somehow very small and lame.</p>
