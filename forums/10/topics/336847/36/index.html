              <p><strong>Economic theory and practice are two different things. Prices are falling worldwide and countries like Singapore where despots have self interests to keep prices up, so entities like Temasek looks good even after losing so much public money in foreign countries, at the expense of everyone else and the country.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The people therefore must do it.</strong></p>

              <p>i am saying that today we youngs are spending tomollo earn money, so called as accrued expenditure, they have yet to earn what is enuf to equal their spending, so instead of talking about saving, we are talking about credits. Intangible will turn tangible one day...nothing escape the books, just a matter of time.</p>
