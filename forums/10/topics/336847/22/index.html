              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singaporeans are now attempting to lower the cost of living here by stopping all spending and cutting down on spending on essentials.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It will benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls significantly. You will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>

                                      take heart that you are not alone; many will be in the same
                                      situation.</p>

                                      benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.
                                      It would be highly unlikely, in my expert insight, that they are
                                      most likely to benefit from it and withstand longer than you since
                                      they have less commitment. If that's the case, we'll just hope that
                                      enough of us will die to help them decide to leave this
                                      country.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if
                                      you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do
                                      yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls
                                      significantly and hope that you're not bankrupt by then. If you
                                      survive, you will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your
                                      spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Don't believe in the
                                      economist and they noble prize winners.. even though their studies
                                      have span several recessions, it cannot be always true. This time,
                                      I will be right! Our recession will be
                                      unique. Hoarding money will not cause a recession.. trust

              found in the internet and I am forwarding it to you and forward it
              to as many people you know as possible:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Quote:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">'Some Singaporeans
              are now attempting to lower the cost of living here by stopping all
              spending and cutting down on spending on essentials. Do not worry
              if businesses will fail and employers will switch to low cost
              foreign labors, the worst that can happen is that you will lose
              your job. But don't worry, be strong because dignity will fill your
              stomach. If there is massive personal defaults because of this,
              take heart that you are not alone; many will be in the same
              situation.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Hopefully , it will
              benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.
              It would be highly unlikely, in my expert insight, that they are
              most likely to benefit from it and withstand longer than you since
              they have less commitment. If that's the case, we'll just hope that
              enough of us will die to help them decide to leave this
              country.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if
              you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do
              yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls
              significantly and hope that you're not bankrupt by then. If you
              survive, you will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your
              spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Don't believe in the
              economist and they noble prize winners.. even though their studies
              have span several recessions, it cannot be always true. This time,
              I will be right! Our recession will be
              unique. Hoarding money will not cause a recession.. trust
              Andrew for now. Of course he will not take any responsibility but
              you can curse him later if he is wrong.</p>

              <p>Dumbass, I really tired of trying to convince you otherwise. let me reiterate that if you want to try to insult me, please improve your vocabulary. You have since added the word 'stupid' but that's not going to be enough.. okay, now be a good boy and go buy a dictionary... however, I must compliment your effort to stop using 'dog licking ass'.</p>
              <p>Now.. a Math lesson for you.</p>
              <p>1) A quarter is equal to 3 three months.. that's 1..2..3, hold up your fingers okay? good..</p>
              <p>2) July, August and September.. equals? Yes, 3 months.</p>
              <p>3) Now, to make it two consecutive quarters.. so bring up your other hand and count.. October, November, Decemeber. Yes, that makes two consecutive quarters.</p>
              <p>4) So, what's the date today? December 13th. right... so smart. I shall reward you with a biscuit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A news headline does not constitute an official announcement unless it is release by the agency involved. If the headlines says that 'Andrew is screwed', will you take it that it meant you were literally screwed? insane? or physically abused? read the contents... none of your quotes gave facts that Singapore is in recession.. only assumption that if our GDP continues to decline, we'll be in recession. Of course, if you can also argue that we're technically in recession; I will not argue with that.</p>
              <p>The behavior you exhibit now is like Wan Bao, posting saucy headlines to mislead the readers, and have the reputation of a hot dog.</p>
              <p>Now please, you can post facts that Singapore has posted two consecutive quarters of negative growth or you can continue to rant about this without supported facts.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you are right. No one will consider the opinion of a fool. Thankfully, Singaporeans are spending wisely and not hoarding their money.</p>

              <p><br>I can understand why you are saying all these, it's because you do not have any confident about the future.</p>
              <p>The reason why you do not have confidence about your future is because you don't have any faith in GOD.</p>
              <p>It's true that nobody can see or read into the future and their own future. But as long as people have faith in GOD, they will have the confidence and will be confident in their future as they knows that GOD will prepare them for their future and take care of them and continue to love them endlessly and eternally into their future.</p>
              <p>Your present is merely a single frame out of many multiple millions of frames that forms your life from the beginning till the end.</p>
              <p>If you only believes in your present, you will also believed that one day your life will end and all the frames that made up your life will stop rendering. But if you believes in GOD and have faith in GOD, you will be able to see and realise that there is actually no end to the number of frames that will made up from your life...because people are born with the desire to exist and live forever.</p>
              <p>Nobody is born to see their own ends and nobody in this world will even have the desire or even know when and how their lives are going to end.</p>
              <p>People desires the future, and I'm sure that even you too at one time also desired for the future.</p>
              <p>It's never too late for you to return to GOD. GOD is forever waiting, if you are willing. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>1) Your insult about laughing at people.. it's getting old too. Learn to use new insults. I've told you that repeating the same insult will only make it sound old and retarded as your truly are. Pick up new words and remember to breath between your laughs.</p>
              <p>2) Your comprehension is really deplorable. Go buy a few books and read up.</p>

              <p>Now.. enough of quotes and bullshit.. just show me the GDP posting for Singapore ending 31st Decemeber 2008 to prove that we have two quarters of consecutive negative growth.</p>
