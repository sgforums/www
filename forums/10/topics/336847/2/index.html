              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singaporeans are now attempting to lower the cost of living here by stopping all spending and cutting down on spending on essentials.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It will benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls significantly. You will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>

              <p>Let's enlighten you a little bit, Thailand's the biggest supplier of the world's rice. Of course they do not have to rely on the foreign MNCs, 49% of their labour force is engaged in Agriculture.</p>
              <p>Plus they actually have natural gas and coal reserves of their own.</p>
              <p>Thaksin sought to strengthen his country by not relying on foreign trade and investment and wanted to build a national energy company to compete in the world market. He also privatized the media.</p>
              <p>He tried to alleviate rural poverty and introduced universal healthcare.</p>
              <p>So far all i can see is that Thaksin's has been doing good for Thailand.</p>
              <p> But unfortunately the US is Thailand's largest export market and second largest supplier after Japan. And they would never accept a leader who wants to create a state energy supplier to compete with them.</p>

The Korean government does not have the money unlike the despots because the government of Korea is not so dishonorable as the despots to take the people's money and then lose billions and billions to foreigners bailing out the foreign banks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You might have some delusions but it is obvious to any casual observer that the economy in Singapore is dominated by the GLCs, the despots run companies that are good at siphoning money from Singaporeans and then promptly lose it to foreigners like Singtel and Optus. </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is more important to open up the country to the best instead of being ruled by as-licking dogs hand picked by the cursed despot and his cronies. Supporting Dr Chee's cause will do that.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What rubbish are you selling? Sony is foreign owned? The Korean government does not have the money unlike the despots because the government of Korea is not so dishonorable as the despots to take the people's money and then lose billions and billions to foreigners bailing out the foreign banks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You might have some delusions but it is obvious to any casual observer that the economy in Singapore is dominated by the GLCs, the despots run companies that are good at siphoning money from Singaporeans and then promptly lose it to foreigners like Singtel and Optus.</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>........And where do you think Sony got the money to start up in the first place? Where in the world do you think the Japanese bank that lent Sony the money got its money from?  Especially after the ravages of World War 2? Japan isn't exactly full of natural resources.</p>
              <p>But the government of Korea allowed its banks to overborrow, crippling their economy when the Won slided against the dollar. How much more "honorable" is being irresponsible?</p>
              <p>I view the economy being dominated by the GLC as a healthy thing, at least they aren't inclined to burn up their source of income.  </p>
