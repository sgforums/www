              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singaporeans are now attempting to lower the cost of living here by stopping all spending and cutting down on spending on essentials.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It will benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls significantly. You will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>

              <p>Andrew, in reply to your locked thread on 'having vison' of the market bottoming out,  you are a shameless charlettan! Do you intend to set yourself up as a soothsayer, inorder to lend credibility to your other theories? You are only using forcasted and natural progression market analysis, and in hindsight at that, to fool simpletons here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact is that the financial markets had long recovered upon national leaders' swift responses in adopting keynesian principles to uphold the market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What had happened in the past month 'see-sawing' market was only natural progression as people invested, (where else to park their money?) and others withdraw to make payouts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There will be no 'V" shape recovery, but rather, a series of 'hill' type progression on the uptrend, a rally rise, then a fall, but each 'hill' higher than the previous ones, as confidence and rationality returns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take Iceland for example - it is a bankrupt state now, but</p>
              <p>fortunately, it could still loan money to pay creditors/investors, with leftovers for social spending and research on its domestic production for better yields to pay off such loans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In time, Iceland will bounce back, just as the world will. The only time we will be in deep shit is when Earth has no more resources or is unhabitable. We will all be dead to worry anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whatever recession or depression occurs, it is only man made, and what man can make, man can rectify and improve. Proven for centuries, when the lessons of history was heeded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT all these is scant comfort for the man earning $10k a month, and now, retrenched, living on $300/mth with bills to pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The markets will recover, but will he survived to see its recovery? This is a question that lingers in many worried minds now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the truth is - Earth still has resources, mankind still has needs, and markets will continue on as usual, abiet slower. It also means that even with 10% get unemployed, there are still 90% of the population that still have jobs, with salaries to pay bills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And these bills in part pays for other's employment. Thus we cannot hoard money at home but to keep it circulated to help others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you see your house collapsing into the ground during an earthquake, would you run inside to retrieve your gold bars in the safe deposit box or run far and quickly away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will most definately run away quick. Point is, you will have to assess what are your liabilities and what are your assets. Throw, sell and get rid of your liabilities such as TV, hi-fi, even wedding rings and even declare yourself bankrupt, so that you may put food on the table ( NOT for the gambling table) and money to pay for transport to look for a better paying job than $300/mth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your only asset is yourself, so long as you are willing to work and not sit at home for months to wait for a dream job. Hard times are a reality now, but like good times, hard times dont last.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our grads of the 90's recession became waiters, cleaners, and taxi drivers instead of becoming doctors, lawyers or engineers, in order to survive. They didn't mind because they too know, hard times wont last.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better yet, when good times return, employers were more than happy to hire them, for they had shown resilence, humility and many other good character traits any employer would desperately desire, rather than to even look at a loafer's resume no matter how star studded it may be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure many already know and even doing what i had simply written. I know because they are Singaporeans, whose forefathers came from China with only a shirt on their backs, from India on crowded dhows, and javanese peasants who were sick of groveling before capricious rulers and their princelings/petty cronies whom sold out their rich countries to western and eastern potentates for mere trinklets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hand in hand, brick by brick, they built Singapore to what it is today. A Republic. Founded on meritocracy, equality and resilance against all odds of wars, colonnialism, imperialism and man-made 0r natural disasters. OUr citizens are sons and daughters of such men.</p>

              <p>Andrew, in reply to your locked thread on 'having vison' of the
              market bottoming out,  you are a shameless charlettan! Do
              you intend to set yourself up as a soothsayer, inorder to lend
              credibility to your other theories? You are only using forcasted
              and natural progression market analysis, and in hindsight at that,
              to fool simpletons here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact is that the financial markets had long recovered upon
              national leaders' swift responses in adopting keynesian principles
              to uphold the market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What had happened in the past month 'see-sawing' market was only
              natural progression as people invested, (where else to park their
              money?) and others withdraw to make payouts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There will be no 'V" shape recovery, but rather, a series of
              'hill' type progression on the uptrend, a rally rise, then a fall,
              but each 'hill' higher than the previous ones, as confidence and
              rationality returns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take Iceland for example - it is a bankrupt state now, but</p>
              <p>fortunately, it could still loan money to pay
              creditors/investors, with leftovers for social spending and
              research on its domestic production for better yields to pay off
              such loans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In time, Iceland will bounce back, just as the world will. The
              only time we will be in deep shit is when Earth has no more
              resources or is unhabitable. We will all be dead to worry
              anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whatever recession or depression occurs, it is only man made,
              and what man can make, man can rectify and improve. Proven for
              centuries, when the lessons of history was heeded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT all these is scant comfort for the man earning $10k a month,
              and now, retrenched, living on $300/mth with bills to pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The markets will recover, but will he survived to see its
              recovery? This is a question that lingers in many worried minds
              now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the truth is - Earth still has resources, mankind still has
              needs, and markets will continue on as usual, abiet slower. It also
              means that even with 10% get unemployed, there are still 90% of the
              population that still have jobs, with salaries to pay bills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And these bills in part pays for other's employment. Thus we
              cannot hoard money at home but to keep it circulated to help
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you see your house collapsing into the ground during an
              earthquake, would you run inside to retrieve your gold bars in the
              safe deposit box or run far and quickly away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will most definately run away quick. Point is, you will have
              to assess what are your liabilities and what are your assets.
              Throw, sell and get rid of your liabilities such as TV, hi-fi, even
              wedding rings and even declare yourself bankrupt, so that you may
              put food on the table ( NOT for the gambling table) and money to
              pay for transport to look for a better paying job than
              $300/mth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your only asset is yourself, so long as you are willing to work
              and not sit at home for months to wait for a dream job. Hard times
              are a reality now, but like good times, hard times dont last.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our grads of the 90's recession became waiters, cleaners, and
              taxi drivers instead of becoming doctors, lawyers or engineers, in
              order to survive. They didn't mind because they too know, hard
              times wont last.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better yet, when good times return, employers were more than
              happy to hire them, for they had shown resilence, humility and many
              other good character traits any employer would desperately desire,
              rather than to even look at a loafer's resume no matter how star
              studded it may be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure many already know and even doing what i had simply
              written. I know because they are Singaporeans, whose forefathers
              came from China with only a shirt on their backs, from India on
              crowded dhows, and javanese peasants who were sick of groveling
              before capricious rulers and their princelings/petty cronies whom
              sold out their rich countries to western and eastern potentates for
              mere trinklets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hand in hand, brick by brick, they built Singapore to what it is
              today. A Republic. Founded on meritocracy, equality and resilance
              against all odds of wars, colonnialism, imperialism and man-made 0r
              natural disasters. OUr citizens are sons and daughters of such
              men.</p>

              <p>Andrew Andrew ha ha you never cease to amaze me with your silliness remarkS. Most of your topic and if not all are purely nonsensical and such bleakness at your thinking. You gave loads of "facts" (so called??) and provided lots of information but most of that were mainly from copy-n-paste stuff. (And by that I do not mean by clicking copy-n-paste, i hope u get what i actually mean by that) When you start ranting on other states or even of your own, You sounded just like other morons who made up their own assumptions based on the what's gathered from the media. Let me broaden you abit here. Do u moronically (Im really sorry for sounding this way but you really know nuts) think that Thaksin or the Squre-face man was ousted purely because he sold out?? I thought u could actually do better then that and provided with a rather MORE then that BUT what I read CAN literally BE FOUND over the net. (Do you have any idea of what im saying?? You just lack a sense of originality there. Maybe that is why most of the thread you started were attacked by other members) Now, if you really wish to know the "truth" (since you always seem to be the only one in this forum who carrys the weight of the world issue every minute of his life on your back) or sought of close-to-the truth, BLEND in with the community; hang around bangkok or philipines if you are going to bring them up, u follow me? Maybe by doing so you could gain MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT insights. And for goodness sake, I know your english is good but please provide which really comes from "YOU". You are really nothing but a copy-boy there. And please do not have to reply cuz I can predict whatever you are going to shoot back, the next minute of your life will be a waste of time just as i am probably wasting my time here. Spend your time wisely and at least if you are going to reply, be it more constuctive n concise all right n' just stick to the topic yea?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S nothing personal here n' I apologize if you'r offended by my remark but i hope you not interpreted it as crossing over the limit cuz its just sad to see one with vast knowledge indulging himself on one topic and yet losing control of himself.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singaporeans are now attempting to lower the cost of living here by stopping all spending and cutting down on spending on essentials.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It will benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls significantly. You will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>

I did wondered, how could a businessperson be doing all this? And in times of recession like now, this man can have all the free time to post on forums? I came up with only 2 conclusions to it, is that he is either a failure or really a very successful person in life. But Im skeptical to the latter as myself cannot believe just when I had stated he does not even have to reply unless he wants to say something constructive and guess what (HE BITE IT)</span></p>
              <p>What i don't get is why he will even bother to reply to me when he felt my comment were gibberish?? Something which he does not even have to be bothered by, for all i know he could just shrug it off and treated me as a transparency, BUT he wasted probably 5-10 secs of his life on that just to write down the letter G I B B E R I S H n post so as to prove a point even if its not the point?? Which sums up that regardless of whoever makes a comment or whatever was being written, he will just say something to prove a point even when it is not the point.</p>
              <p>I know it is difficult to convince someone that you are just being frank with them and hold nothing personal while on the other hand hoping they could be more open-minded but i guess its futile. It doesn't matter anyway. As much as there's more to say but i felt bad enough to hijack the thread and digress the topic; thereof i guess thats it then.</p>
