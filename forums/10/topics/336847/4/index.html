              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singaporeans are now attempting to lower the cost of living here by stopping all spending and cutting down on spending on essentials.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It will benefit the country and Singaporeans at the expense of foreigners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Do not spend even if you can, hoard your money in this time of uncertainty and do yourself a favour as well. Do this until the cost of living falls significantly. You will benefit from the lower prices if you delay your spending, you will be able to buy more for less later.</p>

              <p>if you read about a person who openly declare a love for thai massages, have mentioned he visits thailand often, want to stay there more often even after 5 years, can speak thai and also prosess a cert which is in thai</p>
              <p>do you think</p>
              <p>1.that particular person is likely to know thailand well?</p>
              <p>2.if you don't think so,(assuming what he said is true) then do you he got his cert by holding himself up somewhere and applied through the internet and at the same time hire massagers to come up to where he's staying at most of the time instead of leaving his room and avoiding contact to learn anything about the country?</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>3.do you think this person is a chronic liar?</p>
              <p>if you think its (1), don't you feel its very interesting to see this particular person commenting negatively on thai politics, rejecting the views of others then declare there's no reason to believe he knows thailand well?</p>
              <p>if (2), do you think there's something wrong with this person if he likes thailand speaks its language but claims he don't know a country he spends 5 years in?</p>
              <p>if by any chance you think its (3), does that mean he's been lying all this while?</p>
              <p>as for the prostitutes part, i've never visited, i dare not vouch for the future but at least i do not foresee it soon. you on the other hand have shown so much interest in other people's tongues and arses, is it surprising to have people thinking you have an abundance of contact with prostitutes especially when it comes to people with a low opinion of you??</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Their savings to fund their little sole proprietor biz will run out, and their next month rent and overheads, which they have little say over the matter, will be the final blow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the humble kopi stall run by an apek in the food centre to the printing shops in Shenton way, they will become unemployed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They will not be able to pay for electricity, even for meals and many will be running to CDCs for help. Our society's coffers are only limited, and there is so much needed to give money to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some will be forced to sell the home, some even at a loss, so as not to incur more heavy debts. Some will take to drinking, some to stealing and robbing, some to prostitution and the vices as times get desperate and this vicious cycle is repeated into the other 2/3 sectors of our economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our domestic economy would be first to be in ruin. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And the ones who will benefit will be the elites and rich, who hoard the most money to buy stuff cheap.</span></p>

              <p>1. Energy costs must be lowered. Fortunately it is within the control of our govt. In another 2 months, it will drop at least 50%, due to current oil prices which it is pegged to.</p>

              <p>Our govt can 'subsidize' it temporary. Either they do this or biz will go bust.</p>

              <p><strong>2.</strong> This is the time our toothless tiger - Case - to step in and stop cartel-like pricing in food and essential items pricings by associations and distributors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prices of raw materials had drop significantly and yet finished products had not drop in tandem. A bun costing 30Cts last year is now 1.20Cts, even with cheap China labour and lower ingredient costs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> Landlords must be brought to bear and realize that if they do not reduce rents, they will face excessive stocks on hands and pay even more for their investments and loans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better to have some money than none at all. This is a crisis now, and not a boom time period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> Banks will have to re-adjust their loan portfolios, perhaps extend the repayment periods of existing biz and property owners, or lower their interest rates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defaults will kill banks. Owe a thousand, the purchaser will be in trouble, but if the purchaser owes the bank millions, the bank is in trouble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5. The most critical of all, is you - the consumer.</strong> If you are not willing to spend, only to hide your pathetic savings under the pillow, then all measures are useless. Lets all die together then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That rainy day to spend has come and is today. Only by saving its own domestic economy will there be funds to save the world if each country practise this.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The way to stop the relentless rise in Singapore's cost of living is to stop spending. Now is a good time for it to work. There is an economic downturn and this is the best time to exercise Singapore's People Power - stop spending, except for essentials (and cut down on essentials as well).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">You will benefit from the lower prices. You lose out if you buy now and the prices drop later. When everyone cooperates and stop buying the prices will come down and those that refuses to cooperate lose out, buying at higher prices now instead of waiting for lower prices later.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Save your money. Hoard it! Don't just complain about the 21% rise in electricity and the erection of more ERP gantries. The power is in the hands of the people but individuals cannot achieve much and only the People Power of a massive number of Singaporeans can do the trick. You will see costs coming down! STOP spending for two months until the end of the year. Then we see again after that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let the year 2008 be the year that Singaporeans exercise our uniquely Singapore style people's power!</span></p>

Instead of biting off their balls,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you continue to lick their as-holes and say that they are "our" representatives... ass-licking dog. I am human, you are not, you are an as-licking dog. So how does the sh!t of your representatives taste?</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But in order that you can pay lower prices later on, the people must do their part and co-operate. Copy and email the post quoted below to all the people in you email address book.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The HDB will lower the rental of the shops and stalls and JTC will lower the rental of the properties under their control. Good for you, good for the businesses.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The way to stop the relentless rise in Singapore's cost of living is to stop spending. Now is a good time for it to work. There is an economic downturn and this is the best time to exercise Singapore's People Power - stop spending, except for essentials (and cut down on essentials as well).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">You will benefit from the lower prices. You lose out if you buy now and the prices drop later. When everyone cooperates and stop buying the prices will come down and those that refuses to cooperate lose out, buying at higher prices now instead of waiting for lower prices later.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Save your money. Hoard it! Don't just complain about the 21% rise in electricity and the erection of more ERP gantries. The power is in the hands of the people but individuals cannot achieve much and only the People Power of a massive number of Singaporeans can do the trick. You will see costs coming down! STOP spending for two months until the end of the year. Then we see again after that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let the year 2008 be the year that Singaporeans exercise our uniquely Singapore style people's power!</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are other things the sane and rational people can do.</span> They can stop spending and clear all their debts as fast as possible. Just imagine you owe $20,000 in credit card debts today and in the near future, car prices drop to $20,000, you owe the amount equivalent to buy a car!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Similarly, do not take any loans. You might think that taking a $20,000 loan is nothing. But when the price of cars drop to $20,000, what you borrowed today, you will have to pay back with a car in the future! The equivalent of the cost of a car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">So remember, hoard your money, clear your debts and do not borrow!</span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you fail to see further than your nose and look at the BIGGER WORLD PERSPECTIVE, and others follow you, then too bad. You, your kind and people like you will only start a <strong>chain reaction</strong> that will dig a grave deeper for us all.</p>

              <p>One last word from me for you to bear in mind: the govt doesnt collect money for themselves. Every dollar it can receive is meant for social spending, for this and the next generations. Screw that up, we will have no future, not just for you only, but for the rest of us as well.</p>
