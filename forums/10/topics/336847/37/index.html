              <p>I just couldn't stand this amazing diatribe that forumers here put up.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Ordinary people like ask aren't concerned over the garguantuan paranoma view of a fantastic economic growth potential. We call it 'heck care'. What we are more concern, is, our tangible and intangible wellbeing such as stress levels and quality leisure time. What's sats and suns? crowded and noisy. is it really quality leisure?</p>
              <p>2. In my opinion, CPF has lost its primordial functionality as a tool for saving for old age. It has been relegated into a tool of the diabolical government, who deprive us the right from the freedom of the use of our salary and also deprives the employers of additional private investment they can undertake to help combat their so-called macroeconomic ills of unemployment and others. Abolish it! Save the administrative hassle and the trouble of remembering so many darn policies that the man on the street wouldn't even bother remembering. The contribution rates vary each year and it has become another stupid textbook subject for the people of the land. </p>
              <p>3. Why then, hoarding money, according to AndrewPKYap, would not work? For one, what's the proportion of money we can hoard (let's assume 100% of us will) to the amount the international financing can offer? It doesn't work. Besides, with the CPF system reserves and our foreign exchange reserves, the demand could be easily supplied. Basically, it wouldn't work. Second, if hoarding money is for political ends, the government could easily counter the effects by flooding the market with cash, causing inflation and reducing the value of your money. Although other macroeconomic ills could arise. They would effectively crush your political motives via such a policy.</p>
              <p>4. I do not profess a religion but I do believe in God. Religion is simply a form of theology per se, in my opinion and a functional group for social activities. I am quite disturbed on the rise of many Christians groups, with a sole purpose of profit-making. Some even engage with groups like Capitaland to construct mega projects of half a billion in some places. Question to the religious: is your token to God a token to Him or the lesser mortals?</p>
              <p>5. If our exports fall, we most probably have a consequent fall in our imports. More of importance is 'net exports'. Not exports.</p>
              <p>6. The stock market fluctuates. There's no such thing as 'news' or 'events' that will gravely shock the stock market. It is a totally random market. However, there're exceptions like 9/11 which may cause some 'panic' of war or something.</p>
              <p>7. Foreign workers are indeed a huge competition to local employment. They suppress your wages (wage ceiling) by distorting market signals. But one good outcome is companies will stay here due to relative lower wages. Instead of retraining and all the crap and nonsense. Extend a wage subsidy to all Singaporeans. Use the additional income procured from the foreigners we allow in to be used as a wage subsidy. The lower income Singaporean can get let's say $300/mth wage subsidy. With income of $1000, that's a 30% boost to their incomes. Highly paid locals would not bother much, but this will reduce the xenophobic tendencies we tend to exhibit here. We call Chinese Nationals 'cina, zhong guo' and most South Asian workers 'bangla'. Such excluding and derogative tone, in my opinion, would not do well for the nations.</p>
              <p>8. In my opinion, I find Lee Kwan Yew one of the most astute politicians of all time. He survived much vissicitudes. He establish the law and order of the land. Our water is the best in the world, no doubt about it. In fact, Malaysia's facing drought. Ironic. Conversely, Singapore has adequate reserves of water and might even sell water to many parts of Malaysia in the future! Our shit water goes there! Don't forget we aren't in some arid environment. We're in a tropical environment where water's supposed to be plentiful. Under Lee, we had no GST! The beautifying of our urban landscape is a huge contrast with other nations where rubbish and ugly concrete is ubiquitous.</p>
              <p>8a.To be fair, the current administration is more slack and Straits Times even reported of people eating in MRTs. Litter is acceptable now. Where's the CWO? Why rubbish's ok? Where's the police patrols? They seemed to have disappeared. We aren't overly reliant on the government! They're overly reliant on us for their salaries!</p>

              <p>Financial planing is not necessary to focus on America, Temasek had learned their lesson..in no doubts we must spend, and in no doubt we must also save, as this place so call singapore is not a kind of balik kampong and tamebak jagong or makan jagong like our malaysia or indonesia or even others nations, they come, make the best of it, if failed, just go back kampongs, we got no kampong to go back to...where?? Tekong also army occupied. Therefore the only option is saving.</p>

              <p>Money is equivalent to goods exchange, in older days, you give me a pig, i give you my vegetables, but today, we just use money as a mode of exchange, however, these greedy fat business people just use paper to con your money with nothing in return or exchange.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gold was used in ancient times as a mode of exchange, it is nothing special to buy or use gold again, so is silver and bronze.</p>

              <p>Haording your money only depreciate your money, you can alway divert your investment into india or china equity, it does not mean that you need to spend in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Financial planing is not necessary to focus on America, Temasek
              had learned their lesson..in no doubts we must spend, and in no
              doubt we must also save, as this place so call singapore is not a
              kind of balik kampong and tamebak jagong or makan jagong like our
              malaysia or indonesia or even others nations, they come, make the
              best of it, if failed, just go back kampongs, we got no kampong to
              go back to...where?? Tekong also army occupied. Therefore the only
              option is saving.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In whatever you do, be it spending or saving, spend smartly and
