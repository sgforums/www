              <br> AsiaOne 
              <br> <br> AN increased number of households now own cars, said Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong. There are now 430,000 households who own cars, as compared
              to 320,000 households in 2000. This is due to lower vehicle taxes, a
              move made possible by the increase in ERP charges, he said.
              <br> <br>In his National Day Rally speech on Sunday night, PM Lee explained
              that government taxes on cars have been reduced despite the increased
              ERP charges - a move that saves commuters money because they pay less
              road tax. "The trouble is," said PM Lee, "people may not realise or
              remember how much road tax they are paying, or even worse, how much
              road tax they paid last year."
              <br> <br> PM Lee elaborates on the ERP charges in the transcript below:
              <br> <br>"In 2000, how much do you think it costs to buy a Toyota Corolla
              all in? $110,000. This year, same car, in fact the salesman will tell
              you it's a better car, the price has gone down to $64,000. And this is
              mainly because the government taxes have come down, because the OMV has
              remained about the same. It's about $19,000 before, now it's $16,000
              now. So basically, the government taxes have made the cars a lot more
              affordable. So the result of this is that there are more cars around
              us. You can see it, HDB car parks getting more crowded. You can see it
              on the roads. And therefore because of this, this year we've had to
              increase ERP charges.
              <br> <br>"I know many people are upset by these ERP charges but we have to
              see the bigger picture because in fact, the ERP charges are enabling us
              to benefit Singaporeans so as to reduce the burden on you and to enable
              more Singaporeans to own cars. So when we have to make the adjustment
              this year, we considered it very carefully, how should we do this
              without increasing the burden on Singaporeans? And we worked out an ERP
              package, not just raising the ERP or putting more gantries but reducing
              road tax at the same time so as to offset it and overall to bring down
              the cost.
              <br> <br>"Let me show you how this works. Before the package, let's take the
              1.6L car again. Probably a Toyota but could be another one. Before the
              package, the ERP was $122, after the package, it's gone up, nearly
              $200. So it looks very frightening but in fact if you consider the road
              tax which you have to pay and which we have adjusted, you used to pay
              $874 of the road tax and now it's come down to $744. So the net effect
              is that you have a saving, in fact you are saving money rather than
              out-of-pocket because of the ERP changes. How much? Let's do the sums.
              <br> <br>"ERP increase, $76. Road tax reduction, $130. Net savings, $54. So
              overall, there's a net saving from this package. So we have not
              increased the burden on Singaporeans, we've actually reduced the burden
              on Singaporeans by some. The trouble is people may not realise or
              remember how much road tax they are paying, or even worse, how much
              road tax they paid last year. And sometimes they may not be the one to
              pay it.
              <br> <br>"I asked one driver how much road tax she paid because she was
              complaining about the gantries she went through and the beeps which she
              heard. So she thought a while and then she said to me, I'm not sure, I
              have to ask my husband. Because she didn't pay the bill, her husband
              paid the bill and I'm not sure even when the husband paid the bill, he
              noticed that it was smaller this year. And furthermore, when the
              husband pays the bill, there's no beep, beep. But when the wife drives
              the car, each gantry, one beep. So, that is a problem and I think
              that's part of the reason why people are not happy. And so we have to
              draw the connections and get people to understand that actually the
              middle-income Singaporeans have benefited from government policies." </span></p>
