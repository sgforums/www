            <div class='col-md body'>All these protesting against Thaksin are politically driven. The opposition politicians are just taking this opportunity to over throw him. Thaksin had been gaining power over the years of rule and he had won many supporters especially the farmers and villagers. If the opposition don't take this opportunity to bring him down, they won't have any chance later. It was reported that he still had about 70% of Thai support.<br><br>Too bad, S'pore's money driven Temasek became part of the Thai opposition's scape goat.</div>

However, in my opinion, your second assertion is completely false. People and the nation-state are inseparable. What is the concept of a nation state? It is a group of people of whom share the same national conciousness. In our case, Singaporeans share a common Singaporean identity.<br><br>Now I don't mind the Thais burning pictures of certain people (you know who), since those two are political figures and are therefore not embodiments of our country, but to burn our national icons is tantamount to spitting in the face of all Singaporeans- imagine if we burned a picture of King Bhumibol like the Cambodians did over the Angkor Wat incident back in 2003. I doubt that our embassy in Bangkok would remain standing should we foolishly try desecrating a revered national symbol of Thailand in that fashion.<br><br>Granted, I feel no sense of attachment to the fish-lion mutant that Abhisit and his harem of cross-dressers are currently roasting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> However, let's not forget their intent- they are destroying our national symbols (yes, I'm still proud of SIA despite its service or lack of it) simply to spite us. As distasteful as it sounds, we should rally behind Temasek on this matter- its high time that foreigners who think they can get away with pushing Singapore and Singaporeans around be brought to account.<br><br>NO to the Thai elitist opposition, support Thaksin!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we can kiss our $3billion investment in Shin Corp goodbye. Once you have a company that is tainted politically; its market value gradually starts to erode. So who is going to be responsible for the eventual singapore tax payers loss on the investment?<br><br>From the outset, any smart investment banker would have seen right through the potential political fallout as the original owners of Shin Corp were closed linked politically. For example for Thaksin to push the level of foreign ownership up overnight, prior to the sale, would have been a clear sign that the potential of a Thai political fallout was high from the start.</div>
