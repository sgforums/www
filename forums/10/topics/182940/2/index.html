Once you have a company that is tainted politically; its market value gradually starts to erode. So who is going to be responsible for the eventual singapore tax payers loss on the investment?<br><br>From the outset, any smart investment banker would have seen right through the potential political fallout as the original owners of Shin Corp were closed linked politically. For example for Thaksin to push the level of foreign ownership up overnight, prior to the sale, would have been a clear sign that the potential of a Thai political fallout was high from the start.</blockquote>You got a point here. Temasek holdings is too blinded by greed and profit mindsets, and failed to see the political consequences of the Shin Corp purchase. They underestimated the national pride of the Thais and now they have burned their fingers. No wonder they are keeping tight lipped about this... bet they are feeling really paiseh.<br><br>$3 Billion gone on this screwed up business transaction!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I think I slog my whole lifetime cannot even earn 3 Million lor! Somemore most of them from our taxpayers money. I seriously think right, Temasek Syndicate really too much money in their hands le, splash it on it anyway like nothing liddat. The opposition should speak up on this!<br><br>I know this sounds bad, but I have to admit that I don't feel anything much with pictures of LHL and HC are burned, unless the Thais start attacking Singaporeans in Thailand orburning our embassies, then I would get started. My brother is working in Bangkok and his office is right next to the Singapore embassy, and I fear for his safety. May the crisis defuse peacefully soon.</div>

Never has it been part of their agenda to win the support of the Singaporean people. All dialouge conducted so far has been between the protestors, the embassy staff, Temasek Holdings, and the govt.

Shin corp political connections were clear. Thaksin should have been paid in stages instead of having the entire lump sum of $3billion handed over at one go.<br><br>It surprises me that no MP has raised any question on Temaseks investment in Shin Corp during parliment.

If your prime minister did this i think you would be rather upset. The main problem seems to be that the opposition parties are trying to use it to gain power in an unconstitutional way.<br><br>Date : Mar 14, 2006 12:04 PM<br>Author : Southerner<br>Subject : Let the South Muslim to be the PM<br>The Muslims from the South should be appointed as PM. They have had already over hundreds in Bangkok to build up the situation. Thaksin gives strong political support to the Military and Police at the South. To remove Thaksin from the PM office, people at the border can come back to take over the battle field. The Democrats can never do anything about it. Because they won't have enough votes on the first place. Secondly, Democracy is Democrats' bible. They must agree to the demand of the South to be independent. Also, the Southern PM could work with the Malaysian govt for development. And so, with the global Islamic World support, the Democrat can become a big party afterall.<br><br>Date : Mar 15, 2006 02:08 PM<br>Author : kyototan<br>Subject : RE: Let the South Muslim to be the PM<br>If Taksin in no good his would not majority support from the Thai.

The Shin sale is just the tipping point; many people have had enough of his rampant corruption, handling of the problems in the South and the vigilante drug killings that shocked the international media.
