The wealth is there for your next generation and they can always return home to escape from the city life. Maintain healthy living and you don't have to retire at the age of 65. How about you?

              Well, that was exactly what I had in mind 20 years ago and I never thought I as a Singaporean, would go into semi-retirement or into fully retirement in the near future in neighbouring country and it happen because situation in Singapore has changed and as I age. All the best to you in your future retirement in the City and lets hope your plan remain the same eventhough your parents are not near you anymore and your children have grown up with their own families.

              <p>When my father left China he never thought he would end up in a small city that became a country, he always like to retire in a farm land in China, but he ended up happily farm for fun in the little garden with his neighbor in this red dot. He thought big countries gave you more space but later he realized that space means nothing if you are afraid to go there because of potential crime risk or because your presence is not treated the same because of your skin colour, your religion or where you were born.</p>
              <p>My parents will always be near to me because I always move to where they are. I can't say much for my children and their families, as they are free to live their life, but if my presence is of any value to them, they won't want to be very far away from me.</p>
              <p>One thing never change in life, that is the need to change, hopefully for the better.</p>

              I understand. My maternal grandparents too were from Guangdong, China. They migrated to Singapore before the outbreak of WW2. Every parents would like to have filial children. Yes, change is the word, it is a choice and hopefully for the better.
