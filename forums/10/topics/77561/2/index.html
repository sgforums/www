            <div class='col-md body'>Thailand hero, I think you are missing the point. The point is some people have the experience and the expertise but due to their age they are discriminated from that job. They are looked down by employers who want to pay less, make more profit, and not to have to worry about medical expenses etc.<br><br>I agree with shutterbug that the government is not doing anything much to help those that already inhabit this land. But I think the government has hit the nail on the head by concentrating also on birth rates. However, I think there is a greater need to help those already here, so that they will not be left behind. We cannot always just think about the future and not care about the present.<br><br>I know some people, like shutterbug that wants to leave ASAP, but others here have family, memories, and a bond with this country. So what should be done? Those that have they mind set on leaving do not care for this country anymore, maybe dealing with this discrimination might help stir some people to work harder for the better of society.<br><br>I think it is wrong for the government to leave employment issues to the hands of employers, if what one reader said is correct, where there has already been an issue and the gov said that it is up to the companies. I think there is a limit on how much any government should leave companies to their own devices, government control and intervention is always needed. So what can we do? dealing with this is crucial to our future as singaporeans, and people who work in Singapore.<br><br>What should we do? lets deliberate further. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is very sad in Spore, to see old folks struggling out to find a job!<br>They shld be enjoying retirement instead of worrying abt finding a job!<br><br>Of cors, some of the folks work because they've got nuttin to do in the day, at least work a few hrs in the day, get some "allowance" and cheong karaoke at RC centres in the night, that's how many snr citizens spend their old age, provided they no need to worry about health and money or cors.<br><br>However, there're folks who need to slog it out in kopitiam, factories or companies as cleaners, dishwasher, etc to earn a living becos they've got no money to enjoy retirement!<br><br>For Malaysians, it's different. The young ones will piah like crazy, earn OTs in factories, work in 12/16 hr shifts, 5-7 days a week. Earn enuf money, then they go back malaysia and do business until they grow old, hit 50 and they can start retiring. You seldom see old folks working in msia you know...<br><br>Why is this so? Coz it's the standard of living in spore is higher than msia. If you want quality of life, look across the causeway, young people start driving cars and living in semi-Ds aleady!<br>Look at spore youths, struggling with low pay jobs or never ending education!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>age discrmination in working place is already instill in singapore culture. who causes that? we singaporea are setting the trend for ourselves. unresponsible employers are everywhere. taking care of their own interest is more important than employee esp older workers.<br>i feel sad to hear some older workers being retrench and feel helpless under the merciless society we are in.  he some employer wage freeze your dad for 3 years due to poor performace of company, i have no complain on that but if company is doing well and wage freeze, obviously discrimination and abusing the helpless older workers. "take it or leave it", if employer say this by paying $900 salary. the only reason i can think of because he has a cheaper source, where ? from neighbouring country where cheaper worker are abundance. Our singapore do not have strict laws to protect fellow singaporean workforce.<br><br>final point to note, our tripatite is too harmonous. sometimes i cant distinguish what role our NTUC are holding. they seem to merge with PAP. all top position in NTUC are MP. whether is this Lim passing baton to another Lim is no difference, coz all are party member of PAP. isnt they wearing 2 hats? unionist doesn exist here. we do not have a strong union to protect their members not to mention non unionist.<br><br>we will be old somedays, even at 30 i feel some pressure and demoralise looking 10 years ahead. im university educated, but do not have highly specialise skill that cannot be replace. i think youngster around my age feel the same way, educated but with bleak future looking ahead.<br>what can we do? nothing.<br>im locally breed but getting disappointed with our society and country.<br><br></div>

And perhaps you can agree with me that such is most suitably left for bosses to evaluate based on its needs, hopefully in a nondiscriminatory manner.<br><br>If industrial needs shift, experiences may be rendered irrelevant tho not useless. Allow me to pose in return, are SM and Mr. Wee retaining their position only because of their wealth of experience?</blockquote>Old age brings about many disadvantages compared with a young chap. There will be certainly some discrimination in it. Lets say companies can employ 2 person. One is a 50+ chap with weath of experiences. The other is a 30+ chap with 10 years experiences. Just by looking at the resume at their past acheivements, u find tat the older chap deserve 90 points while the 30+ chap get 85. Who will u employ ? I will employ the younger one since he is young, fit, can learn easier, can remember better and state of mind improves as they goes along. The performance of the older folks probably will go downhill as time went by. It is a fact of life.<br><br>For your second question, my answer is... not really so... Wat does tat just proves then ? Even people like SM Lee grow old and have to take a back seat. They r just there because they have made great contribution in the past or they owned the company. The problems tat old age bring is real. I mean isn't tis is biologically proven...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
