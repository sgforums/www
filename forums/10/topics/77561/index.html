            <div class='col-md body'>I just had a conversation with a friend, who is 50 and trying to find a job.<br><br>She said that it is really hard to find a job now in Singapore due to her age. And that people have been turning her down, even though she has had much experience in her field. Some have even gone so far as to ask for the age, and when she told them she was 50, they said she was 'too old'.<br><br>I do not think that companies have the right to use age as an excuse to refuse employment or terminating an employee. There are people who are over 50 and have excellent health and can perform as well as a 30 year old.<br><br>I think there should be laws to stop this age discrimination. An older person does not make him/her an inefficient worker. A lazy worker makes an inefficient worker! There are going to be many older people in Singapore in years to come, we could need the extra workers due to the poor birth rates. Furthermore, labeling the older people as disfunctioned, useless, and inefficient by discriminating aginst them based on their age has backlashes too.<br><br>If society makes you feel old and tells you that you are not wanted and you have nothing else to contribute how would you feel? I think there could be a rise in physicological truma, and how about suicide, they might feel so unwanted by society that they could end up thinking about it. If credit card debts keep on rising, discriminating against the old will make it harder for them to pay back what they owe.<br><br>I think there needs to be laws regulating how companies hire their employees. I am not asking to control every single move a company makes but to make sure that it is done fairly and appropriately. Maybe it could be like Canada, where no companies can ask for a person's age when interviewing them.<br><br>So what do you all think?<br><br>Do you think that there is age discrimination in Singapore?<br><br>If there is, how should we stop this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some have replied and said the only few jobs for the older people in Singapore is to work in Macdonalds and cleaners.<br><br>So do you think that older people with degrees and education should also work at macdonalds when they grow older? If they have the knowledge and experience in their field, why do they have to resort to such jobs as being a cleaner? How do we know that they are fragile and brittle, if we do not give them a chance of an interview to even prove that they are not weak and are capable of doing the job?<br><br>How should the government support the older people in society?<br><br>So tell me what do you all think! How should we stop this. As a younger person, I do not want to have to go through this when I grow older. With my education that I have now, I want to be able to use it even when I grow older.<br><br>Do all of you think it is important to stop this age discrimination that is happening right now?

[/quote]<br><br>Yes agreed that this is a widely practiced HR doctrine... BUT, there should be valid reasons for retrenchment or dismissal, and it should not be based on age. Reasons based on better shareholder profits, to me, is not a good enough reason. Any retrenchment and dismissals should take the welfare of all stakeholders in mind. Furthermore, retrenchment should be accompanied by helping the laid off employee survive after being retrenched, examples such as retraining etc. I also think there are effective ways of putting a stop to this widely practiced doctrine. If there is a law that stops this age discrimination and an effective way to police this law, it will work. An seperate ministry could be set up to assist people who have been wrongly dismissed could work too.

It does not change the fact that the route Singapore is taking is not sustaining the lives of its people. If it is reality, it does not mean that we should stand by it if it is not going to work out in the long run. Should age be a factor if the person is older, but have the 'right mix of education, pratical experience and exposure'? Is a company responsible if they practice age discrimination?<br><br>It is also widely understood that now a days, there is no such thing as lifetime employment with one company. People come and go, they use companies as stepping stones to better theirselves. But again, if age is going to be a major factor why people cannot find jobs. It makes no difference if there is lifetime employment or not.<br><br>What kind of spaces are you talking about, working in Macdonalds? even with the qulifications that one might have? If the birth rates in SG is going to remain low, and older people are not going to get the jobs they are well qualified to do, Companies here will hire more overseas people to do the job, older people will get frustrated, younger ones will feel that they have to compete against overseas people, and the cycle begins. If there were no age requirements/barriers for job placements, then there will be less reasons for people to feel frustrated. it will be fairer, because overseas people that come to SG to work will be here because they have the qualifications not just because they are younger.<br><br>[quote]<br>There will be hell of a lot more changes to the employment trends and practices in time to come.

I think one of the fundamentals of contract based jobs is to select the best person to do the job within a set amount of time, however, that is beside the point.  if you add the barrier of old age into the picture, it will affect everyone in due time, because everyone grows old. I am not against contract work but I am against barriers that are institutionalised, and ideologies that prevent hardworking people from finding a job.<br><br>I think stoping age discrimination, and focusing on the most productive and capable person is a better route to take. eliminating older workers, I think, is not a sustainable way of thinking. By eliminating older workers too, we are just throwing away valuable workers that can perform.<br><br>I think the government should put out a set of rules to govern how people are able to be dismissed, so that the dismissal will be fair and just. It is widely known that in order to get companies act justly and correctly,  the government have to play a big role in making them act.<br><br>I understand the reality of things, but if you are going to accept it and not do anything about it, then you have no reason to complain ( I am speaking about the general public not about u specfically).<br>To get things done, we need to speak up.

            <div class='col-md body'>This thing with age discrimination is a crying shame of SIngapore's employment scene.

But employers, don't forget, younger people DO NOT have staying power. They are opportunistic, and will not think twice of hopping around. I know most employers here do not employ older people because of the prosepect of paying for their medicals ( as most people who grow old do come up with some form of ailment ) and medical costs in Singapore is indeed costly.<br><br>So what's left for Singaporeans when they grow old?
