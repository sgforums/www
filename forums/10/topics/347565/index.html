              <p class="header"><span class="update"><span>SINGAPORE : The budget for the ComCare programme, which currently helps some 24,000 needy Singaporeans, will be raised to S$77 million - a boost of 54 per cent. <br><br>Announcing this in Parliament on Wednesday, Community Development Youth and Sports Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan gave the assurance that in these difficult times, social help will be administered flexibly to best cushion the impact of the downturn on the most vulnerable groups. <br><br>20-year-old "Geraldine" has had a tough childhood. Growing up in a broken home, she joined a gang, dropped out of school at 10 and was eventually placed at the Singapore Girls' Home after she was caught stealing. That was five years ago. <br><br>Today, through a mentorship programme, counselling and her own desire to better her skills, Geraldine has a stable job as a mechanic. Ties with her parents and grandmother have also improved. <br><br>During this downturn, dysfunctional families like Geraldine's are expected to come under even more stress. They could be experiencing multiple or severe problems that affect the family's well-being, such as family violence, addiction and trouble with the law. <br><br>"We have in Singapore, our estimate, about 7,500 such families. These are families with multiple social, personal relationship problems, which makes them stuck in a hole which they cannot climb out of," said Dr Balakrishnan. <br><br>To help such families, the government will set aside S$25 million a year, over the next five years. <br><br>Measures include identifying touch points like polyclinics, schools and police for families seeking help. An identification aid to help identify families in distress will also be developed. <br><br>There will also be a new mentoring plan for 150 youths from high-risk families. This initiative will provide strong individual support for youths who lack role models at home. <br><br>An intensive case management plan will be piloted, where one senior social worker oversees a maximum of 10 families at a time, instead of the usual case load of up to 50. <br><br>There will also be another slew of measures for the needy. Those on Public Assistance will get a higher payout of between S$30 and S$120, depending on household type. <br><br>Each of their children will also get up to S$130 a month to ensure they stay in school. This additional money can be used for the child's incidental school expenses, hygiene and nutritional needs. <br><br>As more Singaporeans may lose their jobs, the government will enhance the flexibility of the ComCare Work Support scheme which offers temporary financial help to those seeking work. <br><br>There are currently some 2,400 cases on ComCare Work Support. Help under the scheme will be extended from six to 12 months. <br><br>Families who have trouble coping with basic living expenses, but fall just outside the eligibility criteria will also be helped, while those with very young children will get more childcare and kindergarten subsidies. <br><br>In delivering the initiatives, Dr Balakrishnan stressed that Singapore cannot offer a permanent needs-based welfare system despite its alluring simplicity. <br><br>"We need to make sure we keep on track and maintain a system that emphasises empowerment and not entitlement, a system that encourages dignity, not dependence, and a system that emphasises self-reliance, and not state reliance," said Dr Balakrishnan. <br><br>He added that the system is supported by Singapore's unique "Many Helping Hands" approach where everyone from the government, grassroots organisations and charities play a role to ensure no needy Singaporeans fall through the social safety net. - CNA /ls <br></span></span></p>

              <p>Will just see and watch.   How sincere they are in helping.     Heard of cases whereby they just simply refuse to help (for eg, a man the only son with low wage looking after sick father).   </p>
