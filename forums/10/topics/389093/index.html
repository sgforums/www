                 <p>** My apology. We have made an error in our interpretation on the
                          statistical table. The occupancy rate refers to the average number of
                          people in a single cabin carriage at any one time. But the conclusion
                          is intact.<br><br>The following is a Table compiled to show the contrast of population growth vs MRT development.</p>

                      <p>Total Population and Resident Population from Table 3.1 of the Yearbook of Statistics 2009</p>
                      <p>MRT Statistics from SMRT Annual Report 2007/2008</p>
                      <p>From
                          the table above, we can gather the following facts (from 2003 to 2008
                          as the population figures for 2009 is not available yet):</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Total Population Growth 17.6%</p>
                      <p>Resident Population Growth 8.2%</p>
                      <p>SMRT Total Number of Passenger Trips (Million) Growth  19.0%</p>
                      <p>SMRT Car Kilometres Operated (Million) Growth  -13.0%</p>
                      <p>SMRT Average Operating Car Occupancy Rate Growth 31.6%</p>
                      <p>What do the above statistics tell us? <br><br>It
                          is quite puzzling to me actually. The public transport companies like
                          SMRT has been increasing their fares for the past 7 years but it seems
                          that their service standards have dropped with respect to the
                          population growth. <br><br>It is very disturbing to note that while
                          demand on MRT has increased steadily for the pass 7 years (We are
                          unable to get the 2009 figures for population growth yet) in tandem
                          with the increase in population growth, SMRT has actually DECREASE
                          their train service frequencies by as much as 13%! <br><br>An increase
                          of 19% of demand couple with a decrease in supply of 13% will naturally
                          result in packing the MRT cabins with more people! This is reflected in
                          the increase of occupancy rate from 56 persons in a carriage to 76! <br><br>It
                          means that on average, Singaporeans will find the MRT 35% more crowded
                          than 2003! I guess the LTA is sleeping on this development while
                          agreeing to PTC and public transport companies' demand in increasing
                          their fares! <br><br>I hope this is not another "Caught Off Guard"
                          situation for the Ministry of Transport as it is for Ministry of
                          National Development. Someone up there have to be accountable for
                          mismanaging the whole situation for Singapore. <br><br>WP NCMP Sylvia
                          Lim has categorically questioned the PAP government on whether they are
                          doing enough to cater to their aggressive FT policy which has
                          artificially increase the population by 17.6% from 2003 to 2008. <br><br>Yet,
                          the PAP has continued to sleep on this important issue. We have seen
                          how Ministry of National Development under Mah Bow Tan has totally
                          mismanaged the housing needs in view of the expected increase of
                          housing demand due to influx of FT. Now it seems that the Ministry of
                          Transport has also totally mismanaged the transportation sector. <br><br>There
                          is no silly excuse of "Caught Off Guard" as the opposition party has
                          already raised the alarm as early as 2006! Singaporeans have to see
                          clearly that we are paying TOP WORLD CLASS salaries for these ministers
                          but yet, we are having them mismanaging the situation here. <br><br>The
                          Ministry of Transport and LTA are only concerned about setting up more
                          ERPs all over Singapore because that is the SACRED CASH COWS that will
                          make money. Who cares about the general welfare of Singaporeans in
                          squeezing in MRTs and Buses (yes, I believe we can show the same
                          inadequacy if we build the statistical table for buses) everyday due to
                          their mismanagement. The Ministers have hardly experience the
                          frustrations of normal Singaporeans who take public transport daily.
                          The MRT train frequency is really third world standards! <br><br>It is
                          about time Singaporeans should give PAP the wake up call! Vote the
                          respective ministers out, give a clear signal to the PAP government
                          that we want accountability! <br><br>We want ministers who put
                          Singaporeans' welfare as their top priority, not how much money their
                          ministries could save or make as their top priorities. <br><br>If the above analysis is not convincing enough for you, then please take a look at the following table:</p>

                      <p><br><br>For the period from 2003 to 2008, SMRT profits have increased <span style="font-weight: bold;">107.9%</span> from $72.1m to $149.9m!<br><br>What
                          does this mean. There is an increase in demand, increase in fare but
                          SMRT continues to reduce supply by a drastic reduction in 2004. While
                          the demand continues to increase, it suppressed the corresponding
                          supply while continued its demand of fare increase. The so call
                          "improve in services" is just lip service. Service standards has
                          dropped while SMRT just let the trains get more cramp!<br><br>LTA under
                          the Ministry of Transport, kept both of its eyes closed for all this
                          while! This is totally unacceptable for a world class government with
                          top pay! It seems that our PAP government only takes good care of
                          corporate profits while neglecting the welfare of Singaporeans,
                          allowing them to be reaped off by suffering sub standard services with
                          increased prices. <br><br>Do we continue to let them be or give them a wake up call? The choice is yours.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng <br><br>*
                          I have added the figures of the SMRT side without the figures of
                          population data here. The increase in the car operated per kilometer is
                          partly due to the opening of circle line. This means that frequency of
                          trains in other older lines might not have improved at all. Besides,
                          this is offset by the increase in the demand, partly due to the
                          increase in population (estimated about 3% plus if total population is
                          to reach 4.99 million). As the result, the occupancy rate is just about
                          the same. This result doesn't change the main point that since 2003,
                          the trains are getting very cramped, about 35% cramped.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My gripe is with the wheelchair-accessible buses that SBS Transit has deployed.  I am *all for* the disabled being able to get around easily but it doesn't make sense to buy a thousand modified buses(*) in order to serve a few dozen passenger trips made by disabled people per day.  The cynical side of me thinks that these buses have been deployed in order to squeeze in more passengers.  I often find myself jammed in one of the new buses on a Sunday, whereas in the past there would be ample seating room on double deckers.</p>
