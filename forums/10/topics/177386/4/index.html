If he does not want to serve danes because he does not approve of the danish government, who are we to tell him that he is wrong? He is not really harming anyone is he?<br><br>That does not mean I agree with what he is doing. Personally I think what he has done is repugnant and frankly stupid. I would boycott his shop and encourage my friends to do the same. Yet, just because I find it repugnant does not mean I want it to be banned.

As long as no one is harmed and no property is destroyed, I will grit my teeth (or rant) and get on with my life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since young our parents taught us not to pick a fight at school and not to beat up a person for nothing, right? And when a fight broke out between two person, the teacher will always demand to know who started it first right? So in general the initiation of force is wrong. Now take this logic and apply to this situation, lets say this man made a bomb. Did he initiated force upon us? No. And you wanted to put him in jail? Yes (based on your "prediction" that he will use the bomb to harm somebody) Did you initiated force on him? Yes (Restricting his freedom to move freely, forcing him to stay in the cell) So who initiated force first? So who is wrong? By punishing him first you are essentially "beating up a person for nothing". A bomb is not a concrete evidence to show he is guilty. The bomb is just a tool. He can even bring the bomb to a crowded place and still not guilty as he can choose not to press the trigger at the last moment.<br><br>I understand that your whole idea is based on pre-emptive strike, to take him out before he takes us out. But without concrete evidence that he will take us out we can't just take him out. Its just like the Iraq war where bush believed that Iraq have WMD and they are going to use them in the end not even a single WMD was found. Is it justified?

Yes, I can't bring a knife more that is more than 3 inches to school because the school is not my property and i don't set the rules. You cannot force him to tell you why he has a bomb sitting in his house. But you can set a rule on your property making him declare what's the bomb for or banning bombs entirelly from your property if he don't comply, you can force him out from your property.</div>
