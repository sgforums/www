The sign was posted on Friday afternoon.<br><br>"The matter is not over yet. The inspector is waiting to meet the owner of the cafe," Bahari said.<br><br>The police confirmed that they had requested the removal of the sign.<br><br>"On Feb 4th, at about 10.30 pm, the police received several calls informing them that a cafe at Kandahar Street had displayed a notice indicating that persons of a certain nationality were not welcome. The police are looking into it," a police spokeswoman told Reuters.<br><br></div>
