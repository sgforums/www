It implies Islam is the root cause of it all. I beg to differ, and really it doesnt resolve the issue of a minority who use violence to achieve their ends.<br><br>Do you really think the Iranians, who are of Aryan descent and not Semitic people,  are really fighting for Palestinian/ Muslim cause? Are Syrians fighting a Jewish/ Muslim war, or will getting rid of Israel help them achieve their dream of Greater Syria, which include Lebanon, pre Israeli Palestine,  Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait?<br><br>Frankly, they had the ability to see the root cause of this terrorism does not neccessarily lie in the Palestinian conflict, but the nationalism or fundamentalism of few maniacs. So, while the cartoons are done in bad taste, its also done without much reflection.<br><br></div>

The owner is a bigot and blindly follows the actions of his overseas muslim brethens.  He has no regards for the fact that we are a multi-racial, multi-religious society and must be made aware of this. He must be made an example of...... otherwise others like him may follow suit.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is sad that mainstream muslims don't do enough to curb extreme views. when the 9/11 event happened, the west were quick to point out christians have the kkk. however the difference is that mainstream christianity condemned them and even took action against them. someone mentioned jewish orthodox settlers are also extremists, but the isreali govt do act against them and forcibly remove them. but with the muslim terroists, muslim governments basically just roll over...shame on them...<br><br>it must be give and take, you want to be respected, then you must also respect others...</div>
