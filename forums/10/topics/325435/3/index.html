              <p>You know after reading this topic,i suddenly remember an incident in the parliament.When LKY n his son were questioned in the parliament by some PAP members about they secretly buy discounted condominium from the market,this Goh Chok Tong(at that time he was Prime Minister) suddenly speak up n warn the rest of the members  in the parliament that if they continue to question the Lees,they will have to bear the consequences of being sued by the Lees themselves.</p>
              <p>When i read this news,i was like "What The Fuk".Becoz once GCT say out these words,it immediately make him seem like a "Dwarf" n was in control by the Lees.I mean in Singapore,theorically speaking,Prime Minister is "supposed" to be the most powerful feature in the parliament.And yet,Lou Goh seem to be under control by the Lees n act like a "powerless" PM.I mean his comrades must be very disappointed by his action.</p>
              <p>And also,if GCT really want to help out Lou Lee,he shouldnt let these issue be discussed in the parliament in the first place.Since the issue was disclosed,he shouldnt bring himself down n "side" the Lee family so obviously,i mean ppl will despise him as a PM n yet seem powerless.This kind of PM post is meaningless lol.</p>

              <p>When Goh was Pm and now that he is no longer pm, he continues to be defensive over the lees.   I don't see him as someone impartial when he said things to shut the mouths of those present in parliament.    Of late, he has been uttering rubbish like any of his members in PAP, no respect for people like that.  </p>
              <p>His latest project is badmouthing the oppositions, lky did it a couple of weeks back, now he follows suit.    Hopeless.  Sad that we people in Singapore have all these hopeless ministers, mps.   </p>
