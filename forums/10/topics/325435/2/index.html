              <p><br>did pap prioritize that in that order? pls do not make sweeping statement.</p>
              <p>if you recall, gct was task in the last election to take back the oppo wards. the $m `bribe' didn't work in either constituents. i reckon this is still gct's pet project within pap. he has no other option but to sing the same tune.</p>
              <p>cowbay got it right becos gct did not put a timeframe to it. it may be well after gct expired. the occasion he made the speech was the national day dinner or something like that. in a oppo ward, gct has little leverage of what to say there, other than `we can win back'.</p>
              <p>in fact, i think we can dismiss this as nothing but mere rhetorics.</p>

              You think he dare to challenge the opposition there?  In the last election, the big PAP guns went to help campaign at Hougang, dangled carrots in front of the voters and still lost!  At the last election, they also revealed Potong Pasir Town Council's finances and queried Chiam on accounting.  Now SM Goh again brought up the accounting at oppostion wards Town Councils.  So much talk but have they shown us the accounts at the Town Councils in PAP Wards!

              <p>Dear Forumers,</p>
              <p>SM Goh is quite a nice person actuali,to be honest.</p>
              <p>But somehow everything in Singapore has changed so much and we are kind of hard to adapt. I really hope the present goverment will do more things to ease burden of the Singapore citizen and not increasing their personal income.</p>
              <p>I think we got enough reserves in the bank and this should be use to assist the people and i see no point saving so much and dont put it to use. Prices of everything is increasing every single day, and this will constitute to the anger and the suffering of the people.If PAP only think of getting back a constitution and foregoing the suffering of the whole nation. This is definitely a wrong message sent out to the people.</p>
              <p>Come next election, i will still be hoping for the ang pows, but i know that will not be enough, coz the living standard nowadays really pushing alot of people to the limit.</p>
              <p>Pls be wise PAP.</p>

              <p><strong>Goh Chok Tong’s remarks on role of opposition raises many alarm bells</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 27 July 2008</strong></p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong’s recent remarks on the role of the
              opposition in Singapore are certainly thought-provoking. But in my
              mind, they also raise many alarm bells which concern me deeply.</p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong was speaking about the role of the opposition at a
              National Day dinner in Hougang SMC on Saturday night (26 July). The
              following excerpts are taken from a CNA report entitled “<span style="color: #0000ff;">SM Goh confident PAP will eventually win back Hougang</span>” published online on the same night as well as a Straits Times article entitled “<span style="color: #0000ff;">SM: Tweaks to system yes, but the core must remain</span>” published on 27 July. My own comments follow each excerpt.</p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong said that Singapore’s political system must change to
              keep pace with an evolving society, yet there are certain things that
              must not change. “<strong>Whatever the refinements we may make to our political system down the road, some core principles must remain the same,</strong>” he said.</p>
              <p>So what are those core principles that must remain constant? Goh Chok Tong said, “<strong>One,
              any changes must be fair to all parties and give them an equal chance
              to contest and win; two, they must not lead to democratic chaos and
              politics of division; and three, they must not put Singapore’s unity
              and harmony, growth and prosperity and long-term interests at risk.</strong>”</p>
              <p>On the surface, Goh Chok Tong’s statement appears very reasonable. But let’s dig slightly deeper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, is the current political system fair to the opposition? My
              answer is a firm NO. While the GRC system is ostensibly created to give
              minority candidates a level playing field, in reality it has put the
              opposition at a disadvantage because the opposition does not have the
              same kind of access to resources and manpower as the PAP. Over the
              years we have seen the GRCs get bigger and bigger, and now there are
              even monster 6-member GRCs. This is blatantly unfair for the opposition.</p>
              <p>The Elections Department is still under the Prime Minister’s Office,
              and the PAP can redraw electoral boundaries at their own discretion.
              Electoral deposits have also increased to as high as $13,500 per
              candidate, which imposes a financial burden on opposition candidates
              who have to raise large amounts of funds just to contest in elections.</p>
              <p>If the electoral system is to be made fair to all parties, then it must undergo serious reform.</p>
              <p>Secondly, what does Goh Chok Tong mean when he says that political
              changes must not lead to chaos and politics of division? That to me is
              a very loaded statement.</p>
              <p>Who defines what is chaos and politics of division? Is it the PAP
              themselves? If Singapore is to become a real democracy, then there must
              be open debate about political issues, and opposition parties must be
              free to contest and free to provide a robust challenge to the ruling
              party. Who decides what is fair debate, and what is divisive politics?
              It cannot be the ruling party that decides. It must be the people who
              decide through the ballot box as well as by speaking up individually.</p>
              <p>It is high time that the PAP stops insinuating that free debate and
              competition has the tendency to degenerate into chaos and divisive
              politics.</p>
              <p>More importantly, we should recognize that some amount of conflict
              will arise in an open society where people are free to debate on any
              issue, and this is not necessarily bad for the nation. If Singapore is
              to be a mature democracy, it must learn to handle such conflicts as
              they arise in a manner that does not involve repression or
              discrimination. <strong><span style="color: #008000;">The PAP
              must stop babysitting the nation if we are to grow up politically. More
              pertinently, the PAP must stop using babysitting as an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excuse</span> to further entrench its monopoly on political ideology.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong noted that the opposition parliamentarian for Hougang
              SMC since 1991, Low Thia Khiang, believes his job is just to ask
              questions and check the ruling party, but not to offer solutions to
              problems. The Senior Minister said this is a rather narrow view of the
              role of an opposition.</p>
              <p>He also said, “<strong>Ideally, our political system should
              facilitate the emergence of a strong, effective government after every
              election and a responsible, constructive opposition. But no matter how
              you design it … there is no guarantee because it depends on whether
              good, honest and competent people come forward to stand for elections
              and the wisdom of the electorate when they cast their ballot.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Again, this statement looks reasonable on the surface, but the question remains: Has the PAP been walking its talk?</p>
              <p>There has been a gradual de-politicization of the electorate since
              Singapore’s independence, no thanks to the PAP’s repressive and
              authoritarian style of government that discourages free and unfettered
              dialogue about political issues and criticism of the PAP. To this day,
              the PAP Government is still winning defamation suits against political
              opponents, has a monopoly on the mainstream media which it uses to its
              advantage, and uses repressive laws that restrict the freedom of the
              people to assemble in public or speak freely. In this oppressive
              culture, the growth of the opposition is hampered, and people entering
              opposition politics sometimes have to pay a heavy price.</p>
              <p>A responsible, constructive opposition is necessary if there is to
              be political plurality in Singapore. But the PAP’s definition of what
              is responsible and constuctive opposition is at odds with my own. The
              PAP’s notion of a constructive opposition is one that works within the
              system and always speaks with a moderate voice. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>This to me is not a constructive opposition, but a sham opposition.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A constructive opposition to me is one that dares to challenge the
              system where the system is flawed, and speak out vociferously against
              laws and rules that are manifestly unjust. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>An opposition that merely works within the system is one that will support the system rather than change it.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The sad reality is that the PAP Government has been slowly
              indoctrinating in the people its own notion of what constitutes a good
              opposition. But the PAP’s own idea of a good opposition is one that
              will merely provide token resistance to its policies, and further
              entrench its own power and preserve its political hegemony. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Singapore needs political opposition that will challenge, not preserve, the PAP’s grip on power.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong also warned that democracy does not guarantee an
              effective Parliament. Citing Taiwan as an example to bolster his point,
              he said, “<strong>Taiwan’s democracy is more liberal than ours. But it has divided the society.</strong>”</p>
              <p>My view is that Singapore has been economically successful, not
              because of the lack of liberal democracy, but in spite of it. There is
              no guarantee that state of affairs will last forever, and that is why
              liberal democracy has to be advanced in Singapore, so as to give
              Singapore citizens the right to self-determination and the ability to
              peacefully vote out an incompetent incumbent.</p>
              <p>Democracy in itself will not bring economic success or cultural
              maturity to a nation. But we should stop attempting to pursue these at
              the expense of democracy, because it is unjustified in principle and
              increasingly untenable in practice in the age of the Internet.</p>

              <p>First of all, we have to acknowledge the fact that LKY had brought SG this far. Though enpowerment and richness, he had lost the good government that all had been enjoying and the reign had became more and more like a tyrant reign.</p>
              <p>What he did, does not constitute to the amount that the gahmen body is drawing each month. The money that they drew are so much higher than even the biggest developed country in the world. Such money can be placed in better use for the benefit of the society.</p>
              <p>Controlling media is a good thing to filter out what the public should learn about but to turn the media into garbage and hiding their secrets is another thing. They should know in the modern age, the yound adult no longer base their knowledge on the local media itself but have a wider source, like the internet.</p>
              <p>It is time for PAP to step down or maybe not. SG need new blood and nothing of the old and corrupted blood... Seriously, I would take my chance with a gahmen like SG did when it broke free from british ruling... And wasn't it by public display and riots that brought the british down? That is why opposition were not given a chance in doing so...</p>
