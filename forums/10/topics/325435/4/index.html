              <p>yes i do agree that the majority may not really mind, because they are unaware of the evils that the ruling party is doing. try asking your friends or colleagues who do not talk politics, they only care about their 3 meals, house, car and job.</p>

              <p>when i took a walk down blk 5 banda st in chinatown where alot of poor elderly stayed, i don't see how their estate is being improved. i saw dark walkways, most of their flats are really in poor condition. look, i am thankful for the covered walkways in my estate, i don't need a revamped letterbox.. if its funds you are lacking (i don't see how).. then prioritise it! and that area is not even in the opp ward. what? are they forgotten or what? they are old they are poor, the least we can do is to help make living conditions better for them.. its not too tough to look into these areas. i cannot never understand what the mp in that area is doing...</p>

              <p>Signapore has many 'solutions'.</p>
              <p>Basically, all of them uses money to solve the problem:</p>

              <p>HG TC got enough funding the same size as the other TC or not?</p>
              <p>Funding is money$$$.  Can a TC implement solutions that cost money without enough money?  Money no enough ?</p>

              Oh really?  Since when?  Then why have they have done everything they could to make the people pay for voting in the opposition?  Goh needs a reality check.

              <p><br>Actually, to me, the root cause is not talent no enough but where the talent chose to go to instead due to pragmatic or personal reasons.</p>
              <p>An organization is nothing without its people.</p>
              <p>I believe that basically, all topics can become politically-related topics. I am a bit unable to comprehend why people are apathetic when things really do affect them, if only they can see.</p>
              <p>for example, sex can be a political issue. Lets say people somehow do not have to much sex or enjoy sex less. This could lead to less babies born and thus a political issue.</p>
              <p>Trust can be a political issue. Lets say you used to donate to the old nkf and trusted it completely because you never hear anything bad about it until the gold plating of the tap incident that led to opening of the box full of worms. Trust then becomes a political issue.  Trust can be dangerous word.</p>
              <p>Transparency  can be  a political issue.  Lets say people trust that the old nkf is transparent and accountable. What happened? Transparency became a political issue.</p>
              <p>Mee siam also can be a political issue.  Lets say mee siam actually is harmful but no one believe it is. then one day, a scientist study found evidence of harm. Then, mee siam becomes a political issue and food sellers need to adhere to certain new health rules and regulations introduced to address the harm. Of course this harm is hypothetical but also we cannot rule out the possibility of this happening in future. To be safe for now, I avoid eating mee siam with harmful appearance.</p>
              <p>Thus, I fail to understand why 1st world singaporeans especially the highly educated and young generation are apathetic.</p>
              <p>But this shall be overcome with time as a young nation matures more and more.</p>
              <p>The fireball of Truth cannot be contained forever.</p>
