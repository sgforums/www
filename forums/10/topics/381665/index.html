              <p><span class="date">13/11/2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>Q:  “What does the first-ever visit of the Russian President to the Republic of Singapore mean for your state?”</strong><br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “It is a very significant milestone for our relationship.  We
              have cultivated our relations with Russia over many years. There have
              been many exchanges of visits at different levels, including ministers’
              visits, but this is the first time that the President of Russia is
              visiting Singapore. So, we are very much looking forward to it.”</p>
              <p><strong>Q:  “The Russian Federation and the Republic of Singapore seem
              to be very different in almost every aspect.  One is the largest
              country in the world and the other one is one of the smallest ones, one
              is cold and snowy and the other one is hot and humid, etc. And yet,
              relations between our two countries lately seem to be developing very
              fast.  Could it be because Russia and the Republic of Singapore are
              mutually complementary to each other?”</strong><br><br>Mr Lee:  “I
              think there are opportunities for us to work together.  We may be very
              different in scale and size and location, even in outlook on the world,
              but there is opportunity to work together because we welcome Russia to
              come to Asia, to our part of the world, to trade, to invest, to visit,
              do business. We think that through Singapore Russian companies, Russian
              tourists, Russian business people can gain an entry into the Asian
              region because we are an environment which you will be comfortable to
              operate in and you can use us as a base to operate throughout Asia.  <br><br>“On
              the other side, there are opportunities in Russia for Singaporean
              companies: to invest, to do business with, to trade with.  There are
              infrastructure projects like airports, there are other projects like
              special economic zones.  There are also cooperation opportunities
              outside of business, for example, research and development, for
              example, cultural links, for example, links with your business schools,
              like the Skolkovo School, which are our Minister Mentor is on the Board
              of Advisers of.  So, I think that being different does not mean we
              cannot work together.  In fact, it means there are more opportunities
              where we can complement one another’s different characteristics.”<br><strong><br>Q:  “Can you give some examples of the latest developments in the mutually beneficent cooperation between our two countries?”</strong><br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “We have a double-tax agreement which has been signed, I think it
              has now been ratified.  Recently, we had a Russian business forum in
              Singapore which had several hundred Russian business people come here
              and network with Singaporean business people as well as people from the
              region - Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and that was a great
              success. As I said earlier, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has just
              visited Moscow and he was at the Skolkovo School again and also, we
              have relationships between Keppel and Sembawang, which are our oil rig
              builders, supporting and supplying Russian oil exploration companies. 
              So, I think there is quite a broad-based relationship.”<br><br><strong>Q: 
              “Can you give us more details, such as general trade, investment and
              finance, tourists, transport and specifically, air transport, logistics
              and infrastructure and science and technology?”</strong><br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “We have items on all those areas. I think what we would like to
              see is that Russia enhances its links, not just with Singapore, but
              through Singapore, its links with Asean, and more broadly with the
              Asia-Pacific region, but I think Asean is a good focus and Singapore is
              a natural centre for that.”<br><br><strong>Q:  “Singapore is also
              acting as a consultant for special economic zones for Russia.  What can
              your government teach us in this area?</strong>  <br><br>Mr Lee:  “Our
              circumstances are very different.  So, we would be hesitant to say we
              can teach another country, but we have some experience building special
              economic zones, building industrial infrastructure, industrial estates,
              in fact, townships, not just the hardware of the city layout and the
              services and utilities and the factory buildings, but also the
              software, the governance of the industrial park, how you can attract
              investments in, how you have to manage the investments so that they
              will have a good experience and they will continue to invest and
              continue to create jobs for your people in the country.  <br>So, on
              that basis, we have an MOU with Russia and I think under this MOU, we
              have had quite a number of Russian officials come to Singapore for
              exposure, for attachments to understand how we operate in these key
              areas, investment promotion, estate management of the industrial park,
              development of the industrial park and we hope that something of what
              we do will be relevant in Russia’s very different circumstances.  <br>But
              it is up to the Russian officials and the Russian Government to decide
              what you think is relevant and how perhaps what we have might be
              adapted to your circumstances.”<br><br>Q:  “What about political cooperation between our countries?”<br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “Political cooperation – we work together in Apec, of course, and
              we have bilateral visits, our Minister Mentor has visited, Senior
              Minister Goh Chok Tong has also visited Russia.  Foreign Minister
              George Yeo has also visited Russia, I think, just this year and on the
              other side, your Foreign Minister has visited and your President is
              coming.  So, I think that there are exchanges and we should continue to
              intensify and deepen them.”<br><br>Q:  The head of the Russian Orthodox
              Church has recently expressed his gratitude to Singapore authorities
              for their help to a Russian Orthodox church in Singapore. Is there any
              other religious cooperation between our countries?<br><br>Mr Lee: 
              “Well, I think the Russian Orthodox Church would very much like to
              build a church in Singapore and we would like to welcome that because
              it would be marvellous if in Singapore, in the middle of the tropics,
              we have an Orthodox church with golden onion domes, like you have in St
              Basil’s Cathedral and in the Red Square and all over the Russian
              countryside. We have told the Russian Government we would like to be
              helpful and we will do our best to see what we can do to make this
              happen.”<br><br><br>Q:  “One of the few instances where Russia and
              Singapore are similar is that both countries are are multiethnic and
              multicultural. So what about cultural cooperation between us? <br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “We have visits.  I think we have got visits from your
              orchestras, from your ballets, from your performing groups.  It has
              been a long time since a Russian circus has visited recently, but we
              also would like to have cooperation between our institutes of higher
              learning, our educational centres and in research and development and I
              think that our institutions are in touch with yours and there are
              certain projects which are already under way.”<br><br>Q:  “Prime
              Minister, you mentioned just now a recent visit of Minister Mentor to
              Russia when he agreed to become a member or the trustees of the
              Business School of Management at Skolkovo.  But are there any Russians
              currently studying in Singapore universities - and vice versa?”<br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “There are a few dozen students in the universities and a few
              even in our schools.  We hope that as the Russian population here
              grows, the number of students who are here will also increase because
              the families will grow.  But we also hope that we will have more
              exchange visitors, students who are coming to spend a semester or two
              in our universities and our students can also spend a term or two in
              your universities and we get to know each other and we enrich each
              other’s educational experience.”<br><br>Q:  “First of all maybe there is something you  yourself would like to tell to Russian people?”<br><br>Mr
              Lee:  “Well, we would like Russia to pay an active interest in the
              Asia-Pacific region and particularly in the Southeast Asian region.  I
              think your main population mass is in Europe.  A lot of your
              preoccupation is your relations with European countries, near abroad,
              of course, but also with EU and NATO. </p>
              <p>But in the Far East, there
              are many opportunities for trade, for visits for exchanges and the Far
              East is prospering.  We used to have  bananas and lemon trees. </p>
              <p>We
              still try and keep Singapore a clean and green and beautiful garden
              city with waters and plants, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but at the same time, it’s a vibrant
              cosmopolitan city which has people from all over the world and which is
              constantly transforming itself because the whole region is doing so and
              so are we.</strong></span></span> And we would like Russians also to come and to visit.  Right
              now, we have maybe about 50,000 Russian visitors a year, but
              considering your population, I think even ten times that number would
              not be too many.”<br><br>By RIA Novosti's Mikhail Tsyganov in Istana (Singapore Presidential Palace)</p>

              <p>It is not a surprise that with your intimate knowledge about "shit" that you will dedicate your intelligence to "whitewashing" - when even your PAPa has no interest in.</p>
              <p>It is not a pity that your remarkable intelligence is used to develop your creativity in the art of plagiarizing PAP's "bull" and to mix it to your infatuation with "shit".</p>
              <p>Should anyone be surprised that you will crave for the opportunities to make your grand standing performance with your "bullshit" about your ideas and that which you think is the PAP's ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, you have continued to ignore History, and still have no clue about the essentials of Sun Tzu's 'Art of War' - when you cannot even decide the gender that you will want to debate with.</p>
              <p>It had been a "him" for quite a few months until you got your ego deflated and to hit back with your wild assumption with "her"; and of late your egoistic credibility has been grounded so badly that you are not sure if you have become the confused piece of "whitewashed shit" - not knowing if your wits got trashed by a "her / him".</p>

              <p>If the article is to be read on its face value, the simple conclusion was that LKY and LHL would prefer Singaporean Businesses to be in Russia then for Russians to be in Singapore and pose a threat to ourselves ?</p>
              <p>Do seriously believe that the "Alexias, Katarinas and Sashias" hanging around your Bar - are the type of Russians that LKY and LHL are interest in attracting to visit Singapore ?</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">What a sad individual. Cancer of the anus. Cursed despot for a father. Zombie for a mother. First wife killed herself. First son is a mongoloid. Now wondering how far the curses will fall on his other children from all the public money grabbing and gambling of the country's reserves by his Ho Jinxed of a wife.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No wonder he is trying so hard to boost his ego but can he wash away the curses on him. He is already so cursed and yet he sued Dr Chee Soon Juan.... bringing more curses on himself.</span></strong></p>
