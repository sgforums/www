              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">(Adapted from Insights-asia.blogspot.com)</h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">
              <div style="text-align: justify;">There has been some discussion recently on the need for a Citizenship Test for new Singaporeans. While this is not a novel idea, with Citizenship Tests being employed in many Western societies, including the US, as a criteria for being accepted as a citizen, it is probably the first time this idea has been discussed as widely in Singapore. <br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">The discussions that have emerged thus far have largely focused on the need for a General Knowledge/Current Affairs Test on all things Singapore. Critics of this proposal have, however, questioned if this was a fair assessment, their rationale being that many Singaporeans are also ignorant of the history and general knowledge regarding the country. There is some validity in their argument though, but a discussion on the criteria of who gets to be a Singaporean begs a more detailed analysis than pointing out the obvious neglects of our society. The things we have to ask ourselves are: Why the test and what do we intend to achieve out of it? Who should take this test?<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">The answer to these questions are related, of course. Let us first trace the underlying issue that acted as a catalyst for this debate evolving in the public domain. There has been some concern within society regarding the poor grasp of English some of the foreign workers, particularly those working in the service industry as shop assistants, waiters and coffeeshop attendants etc., have. As a result, irate members of society have been voicing out the need for a quality check on the qualification of foreigners we bring in. This concern also drew light to the ability and willingness of foreigners to contribute to the shared values central to the society here. While initial discussion focused on the use of English as a medium of communication here (perhaps a spillover from the discussion surrounding the inadequate command of the language by a certain beauty pageant winner), and how certain foreign groups of employees coming in may be less able to or comfortable in contributing towards that, this analysis soon engulfed other values that Singaporeans held close to their heart, such as multiracialism. Lo and behold, suddenly we all started asking ourselves if the next foreigner queueing to apply for Citizenship thought the same way as us, took an interest in the same things as us or stood for the same values and principles as us. It is a valid concern nonetheless, especially since there was a rapidly growing rate of foreigners in Singapore and that many of these values being discussed formed the bedrock of our economic and social development ever since the country was given independence. The point is, will a Citizenship Test be the answer to these questions being thrown up. The answer, as disturbing as it may sound, is that we will never be able to guarantee that every single new citizen is able to assimiliate into our body of values and way of life, just as we cannot guarantee that every Singapore-born and bred would do so. However, we can certainly put procedures in place to improve the chances of this happening. Let us look at the process that may help us achieve this.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">Since most of the foreign expats who are granted citizenship here are well-educated and fluent in English, then an English test is perhaps less relevant to them than it would be for a foreign worker applying for a work permit to be employed in the service sector. Why the discrimination between the work sectors, you may ask? Well, it is actually not disrimination, but a work requirement. Just as the electrical technician applying to work here needs to prove that he has the requisite qualifications for being employed in the technical position, and thus being granted the work permit, a service worker being brought in should display a requisite level of proficiency in the English language since it is the mode of communication here. So, English tests should be made mandatory for workers in the service industry.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">What about the foreign expats coming in though? The ideas proposed thus far focus on the current affairs test, which would probably include questions on the history and geography of the country. What is the objective of such a test though? If we are looking for new citizens who are able to memorize a bunch of facts about the country and then able to regurgitate this information in a 2 or 3 hour test, then this would be an ideal tool. I am not downplaying  the power of memory but I am sure that is not the sole criteria we are looking for when selecting our fellow citizens. The Singapore current affairs test could be a part of the whole process but there should be other more focused and complementary mechanisms. Well, an interview is always a useful way to gain an insight into an applicant's opinions and thinking. Just like a job interview, the Citizenship interview should provide an opportunity for both sides to gain a better understanding of what to expect and then to decide if there is a suitability match. To make it an even more objective and calculated process, the interview panel could consist of community representatives and other stakeholders of our society. This should result in a fair and objective assessment.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the interview, there should be a mechanism to help the new citizen assimilate into society here and perhaps help him to internalize some of Singapore's more important values. For those of you who have taken language courses in college/university, you may remember that many educational institutions use an immersion program as an effective learning method. The rationale behind this is that if you want to learn the language of a particular land and people, then the best way to pick it up is to throw you in so that you are surrounded by these people and are left with no choice but to adopt the language of the majority. As a result, you are forced to drop your inhibitions and replace your normal mode of communication with this less familiar language. I do not have evidence of the success rate of such programs, but I do feel strongly that we can adopt this system to suit the needs of our citizenship assimilation preferences. So, the question is, how do we conceptualize and operationalize an immersion program for new citizens here? The diversity within our society actually does not allow us to structure a program where a new citizen will be immersed in a particular community and pick up a specific language or culture. Nor is it useful to take new citizens on a cultural tour of Chinatown, Little India, Geylang Serai and iconic destinations as it would add little value to his assimilation needs. If we leave the new citizen alone, there is a high probability that he or she would contact other new immigrants in Singapore from his country/city/province/religious/ethnic/linguistic background and as a result, stick to these newly formed cliques. This is of course a rather broad generalization as there are new immigrants who contribute tirelessly towards strengthening the social fabric of our nation. However, we should not take it for granted that each new immigrant coming in would do the same. My suggestion then is to make it mandatory that all new citizens, who are granted their citizenship, be required to complete x hours of community service each year for a period of say, 5 years. I firmly believe that community service is a great platform to bring people from diverse backgrounds together and as they work together for a common purpose, it helps them to develop and strengthen bonds. So, if say, a new citizen is required to complete 80 hours of community service a year, then that works out to be about 1 and a half hours per week for a period of 5 years. Whether this would actually help a new citizen incorporate and believe in the broad values that our society holds dear is indefinite. However, 400 hours of community service over 5 years would definitely go a long way in helping a new citizen assimilate with others here. Even if after 400 hours of community service, a new citizen is able to develop a network of, say, 20 people (which is a conservative figure of 4 people a year) from different segments of community, I think that is a valuable contribution towards strengthening the bonds of our society. Of course the interests and passions of a new citizen play an important role here and therefore the community service definition should be kept broad to include work in various facets of society so as to better suit the aspirations and interests of every individual. This will benefit locals as well, as they get to broaden their horizons during their interactions with the new citizens, who may have different world views and experiences to share.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">With this 3 part selection process of a Singapore-knowledge test, an interview and a community service requirement, there is a greater chance that the new citizen is able to understand Singapore, Singaporeans, its values and our way of life better and is able to contribute towards pursuing the common goals of preserving economic and social growth. It may appear as a long and tedious process, but we are selecting a new citizen and therefore, it is our duty to ensure that we give them every chance to embrace us as much as we welcome them as one of us.  <br></div>

Lo and behold, suddenly we all started asking ourselves if the next foreigner queueing to apply for Citizenship thought the same way as us, took an interest in the same things as us or stood for the same values and principles as us. It is a valid concern nonetheless, especially since there was a rapidly growing rate of foreigners in Singapore and that many of these values being discussed formed the bedrock of our economic and social development ever since the country was given independence. The point is, will a Citizenship Test be the answer to these questions being thrown up. The answer, as disturbing as it may sound, is that we will never be able to guarantee that every single new citizen is able to assimiliate into our body of values and way of life, just as we cannot guarantee that every Singapore-born and bred would do so. However, we can certainly put procedures in place to improve the chances of this happening. Let us look at the process that may help us achieve this.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">Since most of the foreign expats who are granted citizenship here are well-educated and fluent in English, then an English test is perhaps less relevant to them than it would be for a foreign worker applying for a work permit to be employed in the service sector. Why the discrimination between the work sectors, you may ask? Well, it is actually not disrimination, but a work requirement. Just as the electrical technician applying to work here needs to prove that he has the requisite qualifications for being employed in the technical position, and thus being granted the work permit, a service worker being brought in should display a requisite level of proficiency in the English language since it is the mode of communication here. So, English tests should be made mandatory for workers in the service industry.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">What about the foreign expats coming in though? The ideas proposed thus far focus on the current affairs test, which would probably include questions on the history and geography of the country. What is the objective of such a test though? If we are looking for new citizens who are able to memorize a bunch of facts about the country and then able to regurgitate this information in a 2 or 3 hour test, then this would be an ideal tool. I am not downplaying  the power of memory but I am sure that is not the sole criteria we are looking for when selecting our fellow citizens. The Singapore current affairs test could be a part of the whole process but there should be other more focused and complementary mechanisms. Well, an interview is always a useful way to gain an insight into an applicant's opinions and thinking. Just like a job interview, the Citizenship interview should provide an opportunity for both sides to gain a better understanding of what to expect and then to decide if there is a suitability match. To make it an even more objective and calculated process, the interview panel could consist of community representatives and other stakeholders of our society. This should result in a fair and objective assessment.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the interview, there should be a mechanism to help the new citizen assimilate into society here and perhaps help him to internalize some of Singapore's more important values. For those of you who have taken language courses in college/university, you may remember that many educational institutions use an immersion program as an effective learning method. The rationale behind this is that if you want to learn the language of a particular land and people, then the best way to pick it up is to throw you in so that you are surrounded by these people and are left with no choice but to adopt the language of the majority. As a result, you are forced to drop your inhibitions and replace your normal mode of communication with this less familiar language. I do not have evidence of the success rate of such programs, but I do feel strongly that we can adopt this system to suit the needs of our citizenship assimilation preferences. So, the question is, how do we conceptualize and operationalize an immersion program for new citizens here? The diversity within our society actually does not allow us to structure a program where a new citizen will be immersed in a particular community and pick up a specific language or culture. Nor is it useful to take new citizens on a cultural tour of Chinatown, Little India, Geylang Serai and iconic destinations as it would add little value to his assimilation needs. If we leave the new citizen alone, there is a high probability that he or she would contact other new immigrants in Singapore from his country/city/province/religious/ethnic/linguistic background and as a result, stick to these newly formed cliques. This is of course a rather broad generalization as there are new immigrants who contribute tirelessly towards strengthening the social fabric of our nation. However, we should not take it for granted that each new immigrant coming in would do the same. My suggestion then is to make it mandatory that all new citizens, who are granted their citizenship, be required to complete x hours of community service each year for a period of say, 5 years. I firmly believe that community service is a great platform to bring people from diverse backgrounds together and as they work together for a common purpose, it helps them to develop and strengthen bonds. So, if say, a new citizen is required to complete 80 hours of community service a year, then that works out to be about 1 and a half hours per week for a period of 5 years. Whether this would actually help a new citizen incorporate and believe in the broad values that our society holds dear is indefinite. However, 400 hours of community service over 5 years would definitely go a long way in helping a new citizen assimilate with others here. Even if after 400 hours of community service, a new citizen is able to develop a network of, say, 20 people (which is a conservative figure of 4 people a year) from different segments of community, I think that is a valuable contribution towards strengthening the bonds of our society. Of course the interests and passions of a new citizen play an important role here and therefore the community service definition should be kept broad to include work in various facets of society so as to better suit the aspirations and interests of every individual. This will benefit locals as well, as they get to broaden their horizons during their interactions with the new citizens, who may have different world views and experiences to share.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">With this 3 part selection process of a Singapore-knowledge test, an interview and a community service requirement, there is a greater chance that the new citizen is able to understand Singapore, Singaporeans, its values and our way of life better and is able to contribute towards pursuing the common goals of preserving economic and social growth. It may appear as a long and tedious process, but we are selecting a new citizen and therefore, it is our duty to ensure that we give them every chance to embrace us as much as we welcome them as one of us.  <br></div>

              <p>You want to teach new citizens on how to wear turban or not?? Why give so many suggestion when the process of intergrating new citizens is already in full force and running smoothly, as the author to stop wasting time, we paid millions to our top scholars, thinkers and Ministers for nothing ar??? who is he to suggest anything?</p>
