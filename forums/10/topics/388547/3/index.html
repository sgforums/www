              <p>Recently I saw a chinese characters leasing advertising , it said that the house is situated near a temple, the temple provides free vegetarian food at everyday.</p>
              <p>They should feel that their behavior are shameful, because the vegetarian food provided by the temple are for the poor people or devotees, they have the ability to immigrant to here why still cannot find 3 meals?</p>
              <p>If you want to say that they are poor foreigner workers then why they don't want to ask for higher pay? If our govt want to say that they can survive with low pay and ask why Singaporean can't then why these foreigners need to go to beg foods from temple?</p>
              <p>No wonder one of the temple stop providing free vegetarian foods, the poor and old people there said that was because many foreigners always bring their whole family go there to eat, after the temple stop providing free vegetarian foods these poor and old people got no food to eat, so I am curious that these foreigners come here is for helping us or for what?</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Hah!! Interesting point - why they can afford to immigrate but can't afford to pay for their meals?? Not only that they don't come "educated" enough to integrate into our society. Majority of them speaks English with their own twangs or not at all.</p>
              <p>Interesting. PAP (Paniful Asses Pandemic) had better take note of this point.</p>
              <p>However having said that, there are many categories of foreign freeloaders, like my office (MNC) we usually have quite a majority of foreigners here either on SP/ EP or on exchange programs.</p>
              <p>Over at my office, these freeloaders (mostly the Pinoys) can sniff the office guy replenshing the nuts at the pantry. Year lor!! They are that "kian peng" even cashew nuts/ macadamia/ almonds - once it's refilled. We will see those "vultures" at the pantry area, filling their cups with the nuts!!</p>
              <p>They are also always the 1st to RSVP if there is any lunch invitee to welcome new comers.It's free mah!</p>
              <p>See?? Let's not laugh at our fellow Singaporeans for being kiasu, these foreign can be even more irritating!!!</p>
              <p>Just a quote from my Secretary, "Those "P" hor, too much, leh. Uncle just fill up the nuts. Now I want to put some on the meeting table for your meeting later also don't have!!! Left back mostly raisins!!".</p>
              <p>This outburst normally solicit a laughter from me &amp; my reply?? "NO worries. We are not monkeys, we don't need nuts to stimulate our brains. Just get us some kopi will do"</p>
              <p>If you asked me. These Dy-nastic minions can spin any fairy tale &amp; excuse they want. The bottom line is these greedy minions really greed after the levies that they collect from all these foreign. Just our Corporation alone - we "donate" a cool 5 figure (in lower end) for levies to MOM monthly. Where did these sums go to???</p>
              <p>You have really raised a valid point - if you don't have the means - why immigrate??? Is Singapore really that lacking in people willing to take that lesser job??? Not really, looking at the statistics of unemplyed 40's or 50's in our society. There are many Administrative jobs that could be "given" to our locals in that age group.</p>
              <p>Or is the Government that desperate that they do not mind having people who need to take up huge loans in their home country to come over to eke out a living.</p>
              <p>These group of people may end up sucking on our social welfare and become a liability rather than an asset.</p>
              <p>They will also turn to crimes if desperate and they can't make ends meet with their low pay. This will in turn make Singapore a less favourable place to live &amp; invest. Just like a snowball effect.</p>
              <p>They can now glorify their greed however time will tell if Singapore will sink to be one of the world's highest crime rates.</p>
              <p>Let's face it - how important is letter writing in the business wrold??? Very important, indeed. However these nationals can never write any proper letters. Their writing are often lacing in substance, grammar and totally illogical without any sequence of thoughts.</p>
              <p>It's really that bad. I could go on &amp; on with a few quotes. However my point is whilst we can (hope it's not too late now with the huge influx of new citizens) voice our displeasure. Is there really an angst amongst us strong enough to see us marching in the streets demanding for "a listening ear".</p>
              <p>If it really comes to the crunch, it's been quite indicative that GE will be this year. Let's all go all the way out this time, they can manipulate the votes. We should be united and in their rally speeches, raise our hands and asked loud &amp; clear , "Is it really true that Government are letting in the foreigners more for the levies and to cater to short sighted Employers who wants cheap inferior labour??".</p>
              <p>We want answers, we want assurance that our citizens rights are not being over ruled as if it's their lawful mandate to do so.</p>
              <p>We want opposition - yes but will these greedy minions really relinquished their Dy-nastic rule???</p>
              <p>Will they cling on to power and push their last "living ouppet" (read President) to say that he feels it does not warrant opening up of the reserves to other more appropriate uses like better elder day care????? etc.</p>
              <p>It's never going to be an easy task to uproot these minions as trust me no matter how many opposition parties we vote in; they will use their Meanisters puppets to thumb them down.</p>
              <p>Hence we want change?? Then we need to change our mindset. Protests, upraising, scream for foreign media attention etc; we need to be heard.</p>
              <p>Why foreign media??? These minions are "face loving" people - let's tear down their mask in the foreign media.</p>
              <p>Then we will really see changes. We need it in order to survive and mantain our sanity.</p>
              <p>At the rate these minions escalate the cost of living, supress wages to compete in the global world (at best a short term solution) - we will never be able to live a dignified life unless we do the extreme!!</p>
              <p>Just my thoughts.</p>
