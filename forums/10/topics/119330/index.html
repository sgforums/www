            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this in singaland.blogspot.com:<br><br>&lt;<br>..........<br><br>The believers in a theocratic state live in a tight regime of truth. Higher truths become unattainable because the free will and freedom to philosophise is weakened and slowly destroyed.<br><br>..............<br><br>In a theocracy, people become afraid to think. Because, to question and to think means to subvert one's belief system. It is better to have all of the answers than some of the questions, say these people.<br><br>There is the fear of being drawn into polemics as well as into the complexities of things that make authoritarianism the best alternative. It is this feeling that makes those in power produce more and more Â‘truth-policesÂ’.<br><br>We must begin to become scientists and philosophers that will inquire into the practice and the future of theocratic states. We must engineer a Â‘renaissanceÂ’ in the practice of statehood.&gt;&gt;<br><br>The above passage seems to reflect the condition of some forummers here<br><br></div>

With free flow of info our vision and knowledge will open up tremendously. With the info of others, the child will learn of the many ways to prevent failure and when he still fails will know how to pick himself up again.<br><br>One of the main reason for brainwashing to take effect is cos ppl don't think and question what they are told.<br><br>Ppl who blame others for their problems tend to be those not exposed to multi-dimensional discussion and questioning. They therefore lack the practice to do critical thinking. They become trapped in their own logic bubbles.<br><br>Critical thinking isn't difficult, just start to think and to question!<br><br>To question is not to find fault with others or to intimidate but to contribute to the progress of human race.</div>

You see you are not indoctrinated and you are countering me all the ways with your own reasoning or beliefs.<br><br>The state can indoctrinate the masses by repeated media messages and its chosen ways in presenting news and information. The scope of indoctrination is such that many citizens are already saying that they are happy with whatever its performance or lack of performance. The 7 points of democracy will help all citizens to ask government for greater accountability and transparency if nothing else in whatever it is doing.<br><br>By the way, do you realize government is still increasing fees and charges even though it is making more and more monies and making more and more surpluses.
