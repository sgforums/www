            <div class='col-md body'>Testing the limits in Singapore<br><br>By Alex Au<br><br>SINGAPORE - When the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) open their week-long annual conferences in Singapore on September 12, the events will not be attended by the usual anti-globalization street protests, burning effigies or other anti-establishment antics. Singapore's authoritarian government guarantees that.<br><br>Police chief of staff Soh Wai Wah announced late last month that "outdoor demonstrations and processions will not be allowed, in keeping with current rules" and that "a private secured area will be set up at the lobby of the conference venue" for "accredited" persons and groups to conduct their activities.<br><br>The Straits Times, Singapore's government-influenced main English-language newspaper, obediently reported the following day that this decision was "in keeping with the tradition of these meetings". However, "they must stick to the police rules, which include bans on wooden or metal poles to hold up placards".<br><br>With the streets around the convention area forcibly closed and accreditation nearly impossible to obtain for activists and advocates, allowing for a select few state-sanctioned civil-society folks to conduct indoor activities will, to the government's approval, ensure a polite and peaceful event.<br><br>To justify the restrictions, Singaporean police officials have repeatedly invoked the fear of international terrorism and the domestic need not to "disrupt our compact, multi-ethnic and multi-religious community". At the same time, by agreeing to hold their meetings under such severe restrictions, the World Bank and IMF are granting a de facto endorsement of Singapore's mix of capitalism, authoritarian governance and limited civil liberties.<br><br>Peter Stephens, the World Bank's representative to Singapore, has publicly voiced his alleged disappointment with the ban. He recently told local reporters, "The bank's preference is that civil-society groups should be able to peacefully express their views outside of the conference facility in a way that doesn't cause disruption."<br><br>The conflicting positions of the World Bank and Singapore on freedom of assembly have led to some speculation about what implicit or explicit promises Singapore may have offered when pitching to serve as the event's host, which the government later possibly reneged upon after securing the contract. Singapore's business-minded government is now bidding to win a larger share of the lucrative global conventions and conference market - though notably without compromising on its laws restricting freedom of association and assembly.<br><br>The World Bank/IMF meeting is bringing those seemingly contradictory perceptions into sharp view - though neither of the multilateral institutions, which are currently promoting greater transparency and inclusiveness as part of their new vision, has threatened to pull out of the event over the restrictions.<br><br>In June, Stephens wrote a public reply to a broad coalition of activists that the World Bank was "working closely with the IMF and with the Singapore government - and [has] been for many months - to ensure that diverse civil-society voices are very much heard before, during and after the annual meetings'.' Singaporean leaders have so far remained tight-lipped about the controversy.<br><br>Read more here..<br><br><a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HI01Ae01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HI01Ae01.html</a><br><br></div>
