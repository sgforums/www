Such shylock-liking governing system is stifling the growth of our economy and scuttling our jobs.<br><br>Is the targeted building of 10-30 years reserves as what NKF has done with the support of the government the right policy when patients are dying only getting 10 cents in a dollar of donation supposed collected to save their lives.<br><br>At the end, reserve will be used to benefit some Durais for purchase of golden taps and 1st class airfares or building of 7 wonders.<br><br>What is the point of having so many scholar ministers who only know how to condone NKF wrong doings by pretending Durai had done nothing illegal. What is legality? Should wrong doings be shielded by harsh legality.<br><br>If legality are prone to wrong doings or laws are unfair there is always the equity o make them fairer....haven't our scholars at least understood what they have learned in colleges and universities about equity so as to govern the country with more equitability and fairness.<br><br>The present system of government is too self-centred and self-serving and leaders have forgotten their original passions to serve the people. They have failed to realize their terrible mistakes in sucking away too much monies to the government coffers.<br><br>It is morally irresponsible even if they have legal basis to do so. They should not govern the country with some futuristic assumptions or fallacies that have already been proven wrongful as found in NKF case.<br><br>They should be more balanced so that monies will continue to go around to spin the economy and enhance property values.<br><br>It is totally absurd to say that reserves are needed for raining days when it rains so many times with hardly any leaders caring to help the jobless with reserves - at least as endowments fund to cushion off worse effects of temporary unemployments or downgrading of economy as has been happening since 1997.</div>
