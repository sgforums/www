            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, you may think there is no connection with NKF and the government. As posted in my other posts, I think the core values of NKF's and Durai are the same as the core beliefs and assumptions of the government. The government is where Durai drew inspirations from. That is why I don't think Durai will be punished or seriously punished for infringements of company acts or corruptions act as he surely will be allowed to push to someone in the board or say that the patron knew about all his high salaries and what he has done. Of ocurse one does not expect Khaw Boon Wan to admit such sensitive connection.<br><br>Let us now take a pause and try to understand what the government's beliefs and core values are all these years.<br><br>I am sure there is no problem for many of us to agree that in any society individuals collectively finally decide what they want for the society or success or failure of any endeavour.<br><br>Democracy of the west have triumphed over all autocracy, dictatorship, authoritarianism and communism over the past centuries that is a well known and well-accepted fact because in such a system, individuals are the centre of progress. Through exercise of individual flairs there will be creativity and entrepreneurship and competitiveness and advances in every field.<br><br>However in our system, individuals are being trampled upon by autocracy which sets all the policies and assumptions that there is nothing anyone can do to change our self-indulgent authoritarian rule currently riding on a certain wave ..<br><br>Apart from some initial success like achievements of independence and minor industrialism, our first-generation have yet to prove his ideas and assumptions about their own leadership and talents ..has actually worked.<br><br>Why is our autocracy so persistent if it is inept. Well in one short word, it is the man nature that man in power enjoy feeling the triumph of manhood and nobody is going to stop him to prove others wrong at a price to society of course. It has been like this some kind of ding.dong for the past 40 years.<br><br>Nothing will stop a man on the rise from giving up his power and let others have their say. He will want to prove his worth first. It is only after what the leaders have proved their manliness and ego that they will admit some "free market" or "free choice" as a better driving force to move ahead.<br><br>It will take a long long time to reach that stage where the individuals will be respected for the free wills to determine what are the bests.<br><br>Adam Smith no matter how good is his belief will not be liked by politicians in power.<br><br>Powerful men will regard such beliefs as weakling theory for it is in the nature of man that man is egoistic and self-centred and that will not change.<br><br>Neither will the free will that can be exercised by the one-man-one-vote system be allowed to take its course in the mind of such dictatorship.<br><br>In our case, the autocratic mind is that the younger ones do not know or are not mature to know who to vote or how to vote.<br><br>So the one-man-one-vote system has been doctored to yield to the fancy of the man and his ideas. He wants to prove his point and no one else will tell him not to do it, however wrong he may be in the eyes of others.</div></blockquote>Your reasoning very crooked. NKF and government very different. Besides, there are other factors which lead to the situation that NKF is in now.</div>

With her as the patron, who will refuse cooperation with NKF or Durai. Which board of directors or which directors will dare to bare any wrongs committed by Durai. If we look at the press revelations, it would be clear that there are very powerful personages who behaved like emperors or empresses in NKF. Is this the result of following top-down governing system of our government? If that has been the case whether through copying or condoning, has anyone discover such power-play and done the right thing to stop any potential abuse at the higher level, the board, the regulators, ministers or patron.<br><br>The major problem, seems to be this has been going on for years and no one has been able to put right a big problem. Is this how the government department is being run as well? Is there any wrong doings going on in any other departments where no one dared to reveal any wrong doings.</blockquote>As you said, no board of directors will dare to bare the wrongs committed by Durai. It still has nothing to do with PAP. The only wrong which I see here is the top down governing system of our government.<br><br><blockquote><br>(2) Ministry of Health not doing their regulatory jobs efficiently accountably or transparently.</blockquote>MOH although have to do regulatory jobs, but this job is usually leave to the charity department (I don't know what it is called, it oversees all charities). If something wrong is being discovered, MOH will then be notified. For example, independent auditors discover something is wrong with the accounts. They will then inform charity department who will conduct the investigation. If it cannot be done, MOH will then be called in. For NKF case, since it went to court, one could see how serious the case is.<br><br><blockquote><br>(3) Has Durai or NKF been given the direct, indirect or tacit support of any of the ministers, rgulatory authorities or patron despite the wrongs being committed for so many years. Is the oversight caused by powerful direct or indirect or tacit support or ignorance?<br><br>In any event, the wrong doings have now been clearly established in the SPH/NKF court case.<br><br>Will these wrongs be considered seriously with accountability and transparency or will they be grossed over by some denials or legal shields with underlying causes conveniently forgotten or condoned.<br><br>Are these wrongs being questioned and examined by CPIB, CAD and regulatory authorities.<br><br>In the light of the above-mentioned facts and circumstances, what is wrong with citizens asking basic questions whether (1), (2) and (3) are the results of government practising the same set of core values and policies that resulted in NKF problems.<br><br>If KPMG, CPIB, CAD, Ministers cannot look into these queries and allow the root causes of the problems to be overlooked, that will be a bigger disservice to the citizens.</blockquote>It's not easy to solve to root causes. Just like an illness. What doctors can do is to lessen your symptoms. As for PAP, I believe it will be the same. They will be introducing policies to lessen the impact of the NKF incident as well as introduce laws to prevent another NKF incident. Treating root causes will require a total change, of which may be disastrous because nobody is leading. Policies have to be debated all the time and be changed within a few days or weeks of implementing. It is too chaotic.</div>

With or without her, Durai maybe will be less cocky. However, the auditors and health ministry may not do their job properly.<br><br>If he can come up with such creative practices such that the previous auditors did not notice it, do you think if time is reversed and the same auditors audit again, will they notice it?
