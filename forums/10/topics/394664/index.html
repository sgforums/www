              RSF tells Singapore leaders</span></span> <br> <br> AFP - Friday, March 26
              <br> <br> SINGAPORE (AFP) - – Media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders has 
              urged Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, his father Lee Kuan Yew 
              and other top officials to stop taking "libel actions" against 
              journalists.
              <br> <br> RSF secretary general Jean-Francois Julliard wrote an "open letter" to 
              the Singapore leader Thursday asking for a meeting about the group's 
              observations and proposals "for guaranteeing press freedom" in the 
              affluent city-state.
              <br> <br> His letter followed an apology and payment of damages by the New York 
              Times Company to the Lees and former prime minister Goh Chok Tong over 
              an allegedly defamatory article.
              <br> <br> "A foreign news organisation has yet again been forced to apologise to 
              you and your father and pay you a large sum of money for publishing an 
              article you did not like," Julliard said.
              <br> <br> He urged the government to "put a stop to the libel actions" being taken
               against journalists.
              <br> <br> The New York Times Company on Wednesday issued an apology to the Lees 
              and Goh over an article about political dynasties it published in 
              February in its global edition, the International Herald Tribune (IHT).
              <br> <br> The article, entitled "All In The Family", was written by Hong 
              Kong-based columnist Philip Bowring.
              <br> <br> Davinder Singh, a lawyer for the three men, said the New York Times 
              Company and Bowring would pay damages totalling 160,000 Singapore 
              dollars (114,000 US) to the leaders, who said their reputations had been
               sullied by the article.
              <br> <br> An apology that appeared in the IHT's Wednesday edition said the article
               may have implied that the younger Lee did not get his job on merit.
              <br> <br> Singapore's leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages
               in defamation cases against critics and foreign publications.
              <br> <br> The leaders have defended their actions as necessary to protect their 
              reputations from unfounded attacks.
              <br> <br> "Freedom of expression is not a source of political unrest. Quite the 
              contrary," said Julliard, who proposed a meeting with the prime 
              minister.
              <br> <br> "We have no comment," the prime minister's press secretary Chen Huai 
              Liang said in response to an AFP query.
              <br> <br> Last year, Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review and its editor 
              paid more than 400,000 dollars to settle a defamation suit filed by 
              Prime Minister Lee and the elder Lee, the founding father of modern 
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> A Wall Street Journal senior editor was fined 10,000 Singapore dollars 
              in March 2009 for contempt of court over three articles that were ruled 
              to have insulted the city-state's judiciary. </span></p>

              <p>the problem is international court agree with them, they won many cases, and that set the precedences, therefore, any freedom fighter out there should ask the international court and not LKY and Sons pte Ltd, this is a wrong focus.</p>
              <p>Again and again international court gives the verdict against the defender, and award LKY his rights. So, LKY will repeat his way doing thing. Therefore, the problem lies in the international court that advocate to freedom but yet award LKY his rights. I find this very awkward, just by refusing or dismiss the case of court, LKY can do nothing, and when he can do nothing, he cannot repeat his method of sueing, and this in turn, make journalism more free to advocate themselves to free press.</p>

              <p>Well, if it is singapore court, those international journals dun even need to foot a single cent, you need to get the right court to present your case, even our lighthouse dispute with malaysia goes into international tribunal, you must joking if a such cases are just merely solve at our court yard. But if those stupid journal editors are willing to pay so as to escape further harassment from LKY, then i hv no say, however, they can alway bring the case up to the international level.</p>
              <p>There are many out of court agreement in between, for that matters, we do not know, simply said, if an editor admit his/her mistake, paying is another issue, LKY just want people to admit their mistake and apologise so that he views as alway right and righteous, money to him is secondary...anyway, he needs money meh??? what is $400000 to him?? he can draw out from GIC or treasure chest and put it  under exordinary expenses. But why he needs it, everything is provided, from car to house to maid to servants to bodyguards to travelling all fully paid, by who??? u should know better...</p>

              <p>Because "defamation" is really hard for the defendants.....they are sure to lose.....</p>
              <p>So all those magazines and publications.....they are hard to win in a lawsuit....</p>
              <p>Singapore's leaders moreover can hire top lawyers who are skilled....</p>
              <p>And the courts........well....shall we say.......ahem.....</p>
              <p>However, I do believe Singapore should close the door for foreign intervention.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, foreign countries can pull their strings through indirect proxies.....set the agenda and do some sabotages.....</p>
              <p>Singapore is a small country so it should cherish its independence and sovereingty.</p>
              <p>Any movement towards greater press freedom should be pushed from the inside and from the local roots.</p>

                  editors are willing to pay so as to escape further harassment from
                  LKY, then i hv no say, however, they can alway bring the case up to
                  the international level.</p>
              <p>There are many out of court agreement in between, for that
                  matters, we do not know, simply said, if an editor admit his/her
                  mistake, paying is another issue, LKY just want people to admit
                  their mistake and apologise so that he views as alway right and
                  righteous, money to him is secondary...anyway, he needs money
                  meh??? what is $400000 to him?? he can draw out from GIC
                  or treasure chest and put it  under exordinary expenses.
