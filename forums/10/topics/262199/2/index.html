Was with the subject about all opposition being locked up, well its highy probable that the Singapore Govt has to maintain some semblence of being fair and just, due it Singapore having a much higher visibility in the international arena. Imagine what will the Govt look like if it locked up all the anti PAP challengers.<br><br>There were some lower profile targets like Robert Ho(I think is his name). Then again all the detainees under ISA have not have the evidence agianst them <strong>independently</strong> verifed. Which brings me to the system of government, again there are no checks on the Government that are by <strong>independent</strong> from the government.<br><br>How does the fact that <strong>EDB was not audited in 46 years</strong>, sit with you? How about GIC? Temasek? When was the last time these organisations were audited by external auditors, or even the AGO, with the audit findings made public? They shoud be made public, due to the fact that they are using public funds.</div>
