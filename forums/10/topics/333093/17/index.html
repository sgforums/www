              <p>Angel, Isn't it obvious to you that fantagf, poh ah pok are all clones from SDP/Wayang Party blog losers? The same group of Kangaroo jailbird losers who suck your IMH uncle's stumpy stunted deformed dick.</p>
              <p>All your poor uncle and his clones do all day is spend their time in forum cursing PAP leaders while they dun even bother to go to forums Hahahhaha what a bunch of LOSERS in life.. Better off dead really. Hahahhahah!!!</p>
              <p>I dun see LHL or LKY cursing IMH Yap's family, going after his wife as well!! It's ok to be impoverished and insane, but at least retain some grace so you exit the world in peace.</p>
              <p>Just to spite the clones AND the kangaroo convicts in jail from Wayang Party, i will purposely vote for PAP in ALL the elections from now on. And not only that unlike they poor people we shall have many children cos we can afford to and indoctrinate them from young to vote for PAP too. SONG BOH? BOH LAM PAR JEE UNCLE!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>Hi uncle hv u ever bought shares or property? You only make a "LOSS" when you sell. If you dun sell, how can you make a loss??! Can pls explain the logical impossibility of the alleged act of a "loss" made when there is no sale? Hello its common sense to most Singaporeans above age 18 with any asset at all and many rich savvy teens nowadays also confirm know, they even buy shares in sec school like my sec 4 cousin trade shares online after getting his elder cousin to open the account for him!!! The only reason shit-for-brains like IMH long term patient Yap is yakking abt it all day long yak yak yak is cos he is so stupid thus mentally pliant and has nothing to his name thus nothing to lose. He is easy to manipulate and has nuthin, nada, thats why Chee bye could easily turn him into his ball-licking douchebag to run into the flames for him. But it seems his online behavior is of concern and will aggravate Chee Bye's already hopeless reputation as a mentally unsound and challenged faggot, together with their clones kangaroo t-shirts jailbirds fantagf and poh ah pak,. it's so damn obvious good grief hahahaah!</p>

              <p>If my assets are liquid and have a market price, eg public equity, then it is hard to justify not to mark to market, under accounting rule (I think). For certain type of assets, eg property, private equity, the valuation of those assets will be some what subjective. Of course if accounting rule changes, then things change.</p>

              <p>Hi uncle hv u ever bought shares or property? You only make a "LOSS" when you sell. If you dun sell, how can you make a loss??! Can pls explain the logical impossibility of the alleged act of a "loss" made when there is no sale? Hello its common sense to most Singaporeans above age 18 with any asset at all and many rich savvy teens nowadays also confirm know, they even buy shares in sec school like my sec 4 cousin trade shares online after getting his elder cousin to open the account for him!!! The only reason shit-for-brains like IMH long term patient Yap is yakking abt it all day long yak yak yak is cos he is so stupid thus mentally pliant and has nothing to his name thus nothing to lose. He is easy to manipulate and has nuthin, nada, thats why Chee bye could easily turn him into his ball-licking douchebag to run into the flames for him. But it seems his online behavior is of concern and will aggravate Chee Bye's already hopeless reputation as a mentally unsound and challenged faggot, together with their clones kangaroo t-shirts jailbirds fantagf and poh ah pak,. it's so damn obvious good grief hahahaah!</p>

              <p>unless you r not taking a loan on your property, the bank will assess the value of your property. if your loan exceed the present market value, the bank will ask you to make good the difference. if you r unable to fork out the difference in time then the bank will force sale your property</p>
              <p>the paper loss is only with you and not with the bank - same as if you mortgage your shares</p>
