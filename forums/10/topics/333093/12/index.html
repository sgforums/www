              by them then I can understand that you are not
              affected.    By making it compulsory forcing people
              to buy annuity with effect from 2013 will afffect you and us who
              are still living here.   So you think they will leave you

              <p>actually i intend to make sure what i have aside from my cpf is enough for my retirement so i'm not too concern about it. have never considered cpf touchable anyway, i don't like the idea but i see the point. i'm unhappy with gst but the ones who are really affect isn't me.</p>
              <p>like i said, i'm not a far sighted person, i can't see too far from bread and butter issues. i cannot even take care of my own life.</p>

              <p><br>It is a person's responsibility to take care of himself and exercise caution.  When one is not robbed has nothing to do with PAP.     Umm, British was governing this tiny dot before PAP took over.   It is a fact that LKY did in his words praising Brits for some good stuff Brits left with Singapore.</p>

              <p>Talk Big?Talk big is better than talking rubbish like what LKY,LHL and GCT usually do.</p>
              <p>And besides,talk big is also better than boot-licking.And in this case,you are having an easy role here.Hmm....maybe next time i will have a simple boot-licking job also.</p>
              <p>LOL!!!</p>
