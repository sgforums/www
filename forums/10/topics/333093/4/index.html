              <p>You guys keep saying money is being stolen from you, i don't dispute that fact, but instead of sitting around and whining on sgforums do something about it, but i'm afraid most of you don't have the balls to. Its as simple as voting the opposition. Go ahead, i'd really like to see what will happen to Singapore when Dr Chee takes over. Stop whining, who gives a shit whether the government is stealing your money or not as long as they're doing a good job. Oh and if you've been to hong kong, you'll know that the  living conditions there are no where near as good as Singapore. the streets are narrow and choked with cars thanks too the lack of ERP. And the air there is smoky. Do you really wanna compare? don't just look at the rich peoples houses, don't forget, many chinese millionaires and movie stars stay there. If you're poor, and you live in Hong Kong, good luck to you cause over there, the government does'nt give a shit about the people</p>

              <p>you got HK for holiday or work?</p>
              <p>i spent sometime in HK for work. the roads are narrow because HK is mountainous region and it is densely population as compare to singapore dispite singapore being smaller.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the roads are narrow and maybe sometime choke with cars not because there are no ERP.it is because, it is peak hours, car is cheap, no COE. and generally there isnt much car park space around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The air is smoky depends on wind direction. is the wind blowing from shenzhen, dongguan, then air is smoky and bad. if not, it is generally good. Isnt it the same when the wind start blowing the forest fire smoke from indonesian and can we blame singapore govt?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what i can agree is that the public housing condition is generally worse off then singapore. Dont forget the rental housing in singapore has already start to overtake HK generally.</p>

              <p>I'm a victim of grave abuses from people in power in Singapore with access to telepathic person(s). They have friends here too. All abuses are to convince people I'm mentally ill to cover their grave evil. Telepathy is not a far off fiction. It's a fact. I've realized I'm fighting a 12 year old.</p>

              <p>i am merely giving you an analogy on your earlier rant on how we ought to put up and shut up; just because we are shoved a couple of hundred dollars down our throat, we should be a grateful lot.</p>
              <p>of cos you can be dismissive and delinquent in taking this, but what i am trying to say is you missed the forest for the trees.</p>
              <p>and dun see things in just black and white. i am not questioning every single pap policy; nor am i advocating a complete u-turn of governance. singapore can loosen up (a lot) and still thrive.</p>
              <p>whiskers is right is saying that LKY especially, is way past his sell-by date. to continue his draconian ways is harming singapore than doing her good. </p>

              <p><strong>Taiwan tycoon Wang Yung-ching dies</strong></p>
              <p><span>TAIPEI, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yung-ching,
                  founder of Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group, has died in the United
                  States, the group announced here on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Wang died early on Wednesday morning in his
                  sleep during a business tour to the United States, the group said in a
                  statement.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He was 91.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span>The second richest man in Taiwan
                  with a personal fortune of 6.8billion U.S. dollars, set up the Formosa
                  Plastics Corporation in 1954. The conglomerate covers biotechnology,
                  petrochemical processing and electronic components production. </span></p>
              <p><span>The group has more than 40 companies employing nearly 100,000. </span></p>
              <p><span>The father of 10 not only made
                  significant contribution to Taiwan's economic prosperity, but attached
                  great importance to the exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan
                  Strait. He had repeatedly called for the acceleration and expansion of
                  trade and economic cooperation with the Chinese mainland in recent
                  years. </span></p>
              <p><span>Formosa Group has set up a number
                  of petrochemical and plastic enterprises on the mainland. Wang himself
                  also offered to help build 10,000 primary schools on the mainland. The
                  project is now in progress. </span></p>
              <p><span>Soon after the 8.0-magnitude
                  earthquake struck the southwestern Sichuan Province on May 12, his
                  group donated 100 million yuan (14.6 million U.S. dollars) to the
                  victims. </span></p>
              <p><span>Known as the "God of Management" in Taiwan, Wang started his business by selling rice in 1932.</span></p>

              <p><span>The father of 10 not only made significant contribution to
              Taiwan's economic prosperity, but attached great importance to the
              exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait. He had
              repeatedly called for the acceleration and expansion of trade and
              economic cooperation with the Chinese mainland in recent
              years.</span></p>
              <p><span>Formosa Group has set up a number of petrochemical and
              plastic enterprises on the mainland. Wang himself also offered to
              help build 10,000 primary schools on the mainland. The project is
              now in progress.</span></p>
              <p><span>Soon after the 8.0-magnitude earthquake struck the
              southwestern Sichuan Province on May 12, his group donated 100
              million yuan (14.6 million U.S. dollars) to the victims.</span></p>
              <p><span>Known as the "God of Management" in Taiwan, Wang started
              his business by selling rice in 1932.</span></p>

He can continue to take public money and continue to persecute dissidents and opposition with his power that is supposed to be used for the greater good and so, he can continue, go ahead, and people will just curse him until his grandchildren and relatives are aflicted with cancer and die a slow lingering suffering death like his wife at the moment.</span></span></p>
