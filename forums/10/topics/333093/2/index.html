You quote Thailand, let me ask you, can you walk around in Thailand at night without the fear of bing robbed, rapped or even murdered? Use your brains, you and Mr Poh seem to think that alot of Singaporeans are brainwashed, i think you're the ones brainwashed. And whats more, you're brainwashed by men who can't even run in the elections. to be honest, i don't give a damn who rules my country as long as i live in a safe, secure community. And as for giving my money to them, they do a relativel good job, so why should i complain? Its not as if i, you or even chee soon juan can do a better job. Whats Chee Soon Juan gonna do once he's in power? Lower all the ministers salaries? Abolish ERP and CPF?

              <p>The impetus to commit crime is weighed against the benefits of escape and punishment of capture, if punishment is very high, it acts as a deterrent to commit crime as compared to a country or system that values civil liberties.</p>
              <p>Compare a system which values civil liberties with jail sentences of 1 year for theft as compared to a system with 10 years jail for theft, both countries having same efficiency in the police force. Citizens of which country would be more liable to commit crime? If the former country wishes to decrease the level of crime, all it needs to do is impose 20 years jail term for theft and consequently crime rates will fall.</p>
              <p>An error committed at the spur of the moment should not in anyway condemn a person to perpetual damnation, if the person knows the error of his ways. We are not perfect beings as such we are prone to errors and mistakes, it's only when we learn from our mistakes that we become better persons.</p>
              <p>Obviously this concept of civil liberties has obscured many Singaporeans with a limited view of the world, as such, to them a draconian form of punishment is the only way to go. Don't we need to discover the plight and intentions of the criminal and apply a little compassion for our fellow human beings. Thievery could be due to financial circumstances, afterall who would commit such acts unless driven to the edge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you don't know already, Singapore has one of the largest prison inmate population in the world, comparable to prison inmates in the USA. Why is that so? Is it due to the lengthy jail sentence by the courts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree crime rates are lower in Singapore, but it's only slightly better than Hong Kong, both being small cities, makes better comparison. But compare the level of civil liberties, I think Hong Kong will outrank Singapore, though being a satelite of the Communist China, but it has a long historical British past, unlike Singapore, where human rights and civil liberties were demolished by LKY to further his personal political machinations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>In authoritarian, totalitarian regimes, the deterrent is much higher than in any Western country and crime rates are indeed lower.</em></p>

Its as simple as voting the opposition. Go ahead, i'd really like to see what will happen to Singapore when Dr Chee takes over. Stop whining, who gives a shit whether the government is stealing your money or not as long as they're doing a good job. Oh and if you've been to hong kong, you'll know that the  living conditions there are no where near as good as Singapore. the streets are narrow and choked with cars thanks too the lack of ERP. And the air there is smoky. Do you really wanna compare? don't just look at the rich peoples houses, don't forget, many chinese millionaires and movie stars stay there. If you're poor, and you live in Hong Kong, good luck to you cause over there, the government does'nt give a shit about the people</p></div>

              <p>In Singapore, the government only cares about their salaries, how to fleece more from the sheeps, keep friends and relatives in high positions in GLCs and GICs.</p>
