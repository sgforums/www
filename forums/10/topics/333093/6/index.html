              “people’s war” on the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. <br><br>With

              his organisation, the Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist),
              was ready to start killing for its cause. He also warned that his
              faction would step up attacks on thousands of Bhutanese refugees who
              are leaving the camps in Nepal to start new lives abroad. <br><br>“There
              will be a lot of casualties and destruction but we cannot shy away from
              fighting for justice,” said Chettri, one of around 100,000 Bhutanese of

Its as simple as voting the opposition. Go ahead, i'd really like to see what will happen to Singapore when Dr Chee takes over. Stop whining, who gives a shit whether the government is stealing your money or not as long as they're doing a good job. Oh and if you've been to hong kong, you'll know that the  living conditions there are no where near as good as Singapore. the streets are narrow and choked with cars thanks too the lack of ERP. And the air there is smoky. Do you really wanna compare? don't just look at the rich peoples houses, don't forget, many chinese millionaires and movie stars stay there. If you're poor, and you live in Hong Kong, good luck to you cause over there, the government does'nt give a shit about the people</p>

              <p>But you have to know what cause people to come out with words like panty sniffers, despots and so on in order to know the reason.  I don't deny Andrew sometimes can be a pain and very unreasonable, I understand where he is coming from so I just leave him alone.   YOU will be surprised that I was once upon a time attacked furiously by andrew.    But that is the past, i have let bygone be bygone.</p>
