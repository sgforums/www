              <p><br>Yaw did was wrong from the perspective that he is a member of the WP <strong>and </strong>that he was a member of AMK GRC competing against PAP. There already exist a conflict of intererst.</p>
              <p>Not many people are truly card waving members of any political party. I don't belong to any political party, so I choose to be objective. If PAP needs defending I will do it, if Chiam needs defending I will, if Sylvia needs defending, I will.</p>
              <p>I will even go as far as saying if Chee needs defending, I will.... but chee, nah, nothing he has done needed defending.</p>
              <p>So having said all that, are you a card waving member of the opposition? Unless you are, you should be objective..... but I think many have realised that being objective is not not one of your strong points.</p>

              <p>I am doing my part as a citizen who disagrees with the ways of the ruling party within my own capacity.   I am not blind to support any ruling party when we know that they are more self serving than anything.   Support should not be given bllindly.   Just because they are the ruling party, I must agree and support them, no way!  I am not blind and dumb.</p>

              <p>U very naive, how can it be possible that they leave you alone???!! OMG!@!!!    By increasing the living costs you are already affected unless your living expenses are paid by them then I can understand that you are not affected.    By making it compulsory forcing people to buy annuity with effect from 2013 will afffect you and us who are still living here.   So you think they will leave you alone????  Fat hope!  </p>
