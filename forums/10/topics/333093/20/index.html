              <p>Andrew Yap, a question for you. Are You Too Bored With Your Life OR What? can you just stop all this rubbish of yours? First of all, you are in no position to question/comment/give remarks on Mr LKY. Secondly, respectable figures like him don't get respect from people just OUT OF THE BLUE or MAGICALLY. It's all based from their actions and their words. If Mr LKY was like what you said, no one in the world will respect him anymore. FYI, his talks, his reviews, his interviews are published and read worldwide, leaders from foreign countries give him their respect, but surely NOT TO YOU. Thirdly, if you so damn good and is able to comment and pin point Mr LKY here, why didn't you ran for the election earlier on? WHY DIDN'T YOU? if you are so bloody good, go try for election then. No sorry, you DONT even need to try, the results are obvious, you are in NO POSITION to get winning votes. And what is it that you said about bootlicking? This is not called bootlicking, this is call stating the fact right in your face. And what you doing is called nonsensical crap. I have to say this out, because im sure lots of people are starting to doubt your mentality.</p>
              <p>Another piece of info for you, just in case you DONT know. Singapore is one of the least corrupted countries and, one of the most fair countries which upholds equality, around in the world. Without good leaders like Mr LKY and the following successors through the years, such good results might not be able to attain in such a short time.</p>
              <p>Mr LKY brought us, brought Singapore to where we are today, he helped us and devoted his time into developing this once-not-so-developed and laid back land into one of the few leading developing nations today. and what have you done, other than living in this own universe of yours and thinking that everything you think is right?</p>
              <p>Didn't you ever heard of the phrase, THINK OF YOUR ROOTS? you are living in where you are today because Mr LKY helped made it to, together with the other forefathers and people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>THINK, THINK, THINK before you start commenting like this. Do you have the right to, in the first place. Don't disgrace yourself as a citizen here. and don't disgrace the race of Chinese, because we are UPRIGHT and HONEST people who know how to stand up for the right things, the right stuffs and the right theories, definitely not bootlickers or what like you have said. Shame on you.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1) The independence of the judiciary (Page 8)</strong><br><em>"Singapore
                          is bound by international and domestic laws requiring the independence
                          of the judiciary. Despite this, there are concerns about the objective
                          and subjective independence and impartiality of Singapore judges. Such
                          concerns include the rotation of judges with legal service positions,
                          the lack of tenure for many judges and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the extension of contracts beyond the age of 65 at the Prime Minister’s pleasure</strong></span>.<br> <br> To examine the situation in practice, various cases are considered,
                          including the transfer of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo; the trend
                          of the court in defamation cases to decide in favour of PAP officials
                          and to award disproportionately high damages; and the court in the
                          Jeyaretnam appeal."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>2) Defamation laws (Page 29-30)</strong><br><em>"The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has stated:                            ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore’s
                          Leadership has a longstanding reputation for using defamation actions
                          as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore
                          parliament</strong></span>: far from tolerating critical remarks (not even
                          those spoken or written in the heat of an election campaign), Messrs
                          Goh and Lee have been swift to commence actions, to succeed with them,
                          and to obtain such unconscionably high damages (and costs) as to
                          bankrupt their opponents.’"</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"Dissenting political opinion is further deterred by reports that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no PAP leader has ever lost a defamation suit against an opposition figure in court</span></strong>.
                          This has raised further questions about the independence of the
                          judiciary in Singapore when considering free expression cases."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3) Defamation cases in Singapore 1959-1997 (Page 60-61)</strong><br><em>"In
                          the information above, it is evident that in just six cases, PAP
                          officials have been awarded over S$9 million in damages. This excludes
                          those cases, such as the one discussed above regarding the Financial
                          Times, which were settled out of court. Meanwhile, the total for all
                          seven non-PAP litigant cases is just S$307,350. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This disparity is of serious concern for the independence of the judiciary.</strong></span>"</em></span></p>
              <p>Mr LKY brought us, brought Singapore to where we are today, he
                          helped us and devoted his time into developing this
                          once-not-so-developed and laid back land into one of the few
                          leading developing nations today. and what have you done, other
                          than living in this own universe of yours and thinking that
                          everything you think is right?</p>

                  years ago, Mr Ong Teng Cheong pushed for the implementation of the MRT
                  despite strong opposing views to solve the problem of road congestion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fast
                  foward now, Mr Raymond Lim implements ERP to solve the problem of road
                  congestion. Has the problem been solved? The fact that ERPs are still
                  being erected up to now shows that ERPs are NOT solving the problem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh and did I mention their peanuts pay?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes I have the right to comment, for I'm a citizen of Singapore and I'm the one who will cast the vote at the election.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I
                  don't understand the rationale of bringing in the Chinese race and
                  saying we are upright and honest. Racial remarks like this are
                  redundant and sensitive.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes
                  I'm sure you are not a bootlicker, hence, do read up on the articles
                  mentioned above, especially the IBA 72 page report the the 45 minute
                  video.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I
                  sincerely hope you are just an average ordinary Singapore, I would be
                  pissed if I'm talking to one of the comittee members of PAP new media
                  comittee.</span></p>

              <p>Andrew Yap, a question for you. Are You Too Bored With Your Life OR What? can you just stop all this rubbish of yours? First of all, you are in no position to question/comment/give remarks on Mr LKY. Secondly, respectable figures like him don't get respect from people just OUT OF THE BLUE or MAGICALLY. It's all based from their actions and their words. If Mr LKY was like what you said, no one in the world will respect him anymore. FYI, his talks, his reviews, his interviews are published and read worldwide, leaders from foreign countries give him their respect, but surely NOT TO YOU. Thirdly, if you so damn good and is able to comment and pin point Mr LKY here, why didn't you ran for the election earlier on? WHY DIDN'T YOU? if you are so bloody good, go try for election then. No sorry, you DONT even need to try, the results are obvious, you are in NO POSITION to get winning votes. And what is it that you said about bootlicking? This is not called bootlicking, this is call stating the fact right in your face. And what you doing is called nonsensical crap. I have to say this out, because im sure lots of people are starting to doubt your mentality.</p>
              <p>Another piece of info for you, just in case you DONT know. Singapore is one of the least corrupted countries and, one of the most fair countries which upholds equality, around in the world. Without good leaders like Mr LKY and the following successors through the years, such good results might not be able to attain in such a short time.</p>
              <p>Mr LKY brought us, brought Singapore to where we are today, he helped us and devoted his time into developing this once-not-so-developed and laid back land into one of the few leading developing nations today. and what have you done, other than living in this own universe of yours and thinking that everything you think is right?</p>
              <p>Didn't you ever heard of the phrase, THINK OF YOUR ROOTS? you are living in where you are today because Mr LKY helped made it to, together with the other forefathers and people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>THINK, THINK, THINK before you start commenting like this. Do you have the right to, in the first place. Don't disgrace yourself as a citizen here. and don't disgrace the race of Chinese, because we are UPRIGHT and HONEST people who know how to stand up for the right things, the right stuffs and the right theories, definitely not bootlickers or what like you have said. Shame on you.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Starseven, i do here apologise to you, because I indeed missed out your posting earlier on and missed out the several points you raised, which leaves the impression of me avoiding the issue. I do respect you for your usage of words, because at the very least that you raised issues along with facts and spoke with care, for that, I thank you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">You may be right, points you raised that are definitely valid points that substantiate your stand. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">First of all, in your post u stated that PAP won the elections because of gerrymandering. First thing first, the piece of info was pluck off from Wikipedia. Although it’s a widely used form of search engine, however it has not been regarded as a very trustworthy source of information. Moreover, if that is how the way PAP won the elections, will you think the rest of the world will watch in silence and mention nothing about it? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Carrying on, you asked how do I define respect. First of all, Mr Lee has been onto much interviews and reviews, books, autobiography were out about him. Guess what? Many people have been reading up and recognizing him for his efforts and his time spent into building </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">. Interviews on him were considered seriously by many high ranking and powerful figures. Then again, if you do not respect the person, will you even take into account of what he said?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Onto your issue of Mr Lee not being considered as a world leader by Mr Obama, ever notice those big news of Mr Lee visiting foreign countries to strengthen our ties with them? Moreover, as mention, the 9 countries in which US President-Elect Mr Obama expressed his thanks to, how many were not in the western or </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Europe</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> region? How many from SEA? </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Japan</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">, </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">South Korea</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">, and both of these countries, which one haven’t had an issue with </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">USA</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> before, either be it good or bad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Then again, yes, our ministers are indeed one of, or maybe the highest paid in the world, but can you deny the fact that we are the least corrupted? And if the government body were really as bad as you mentioned, then surely much more money would have been siphoned off our, or maybe your pockets by now. Remember the SARS event? Who was the one who wanted to issue thermometers and health-checking aids to the kids in school? Those money that were off the tax, it was put to good use. <span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Also, yes the donations of 7-million which was matched dollar-to-dollar by the government to 14-million, were donated to the </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">China</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> students. But did you not read the reason behind for that action? If you haven’t realized, that was a way to put </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> at an advantage of others. </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">China</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> is a place whereby the kids are taught the traditional moral values since young, which includes remembering your roots. If you were to achieve off because of someone, will you repay back that someone or spend it on another person? Personally, I will repay. I will remember, and think of my roots.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">
              </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Indeed you have the right to comment precisely because you are Singaporean. I did not mention much to your comments and to your facts is because you used your words kindly, with enough facts that substantiate your stand, as I mentioned ealier. What Andrew Yap mentioned earlier on wasn’t the way you have mentioned, it looks more like it went into a personal attack. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Of cause you don’t understand me bringing in the topic of being in the race Chinese. However if you were to look back on the previous page and look at what Andrew Yap mentioned, he defamed us the Chinese race and accused us as “</span><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Chinese people are supposed to be dogs licking and tasting sh!t of despots to get ahead in life?” </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Now how does that sound? Thus I felt that it was a right to stop this defamation act of him, which brings down not only the honor and the reputation of his own, but on the whole Chinese race. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; ">To add on, I am definitely not running away from the situation. If I were able to talk sense and maturely with people like how you are, will there even be a need for me to stop putting in my reply? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Also, a note for you to take note of. Those evidences you took to show me, or maybe show the rest of the forum chatters, it came from a website which is obviously against the current system of </span><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; ">. Just by the web address one can tell, even though they had a nice cover for it. Coming from a website that is totally against an issue, will that add point to it’s level truth, level of integrity and fact, or will it just make it worse? I am sure that’s obvious. <span> </span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Everything in the website is against the system, between the lines are information added by oppositions who don’t see on the same side as the system. Now how can you expect people, or at least me, to believe 100% in it? If another website were to set up to mention all the credits about the system, the same way I can pluck it out to show you. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I stop precisely because I know this will not be productive or effective. You have your point, I have my point, each and everyone of us out there will stand up for their views and reasons. I started posting because of the rude and crude words used by Andrew Yap, which shows no respect for Mr Lee. We all know that at the very least, only when you show respect to others, they will then respect you back. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

                      you are in no position to question/comment/give remarks on Mr LKY.
                      Secondly, respectable figures like him don't get respect from
                      people just OUT OF THE BLUE or MAGICALLY. It's all based from
                      their actions and their words. If Mr LKY was like what you said, no
                      one in the world will respect him anymore. FYI, his talks, his
                      reviews, his interviews are published and read worldwide, leaders
                      from foreign countries give him their respect, but surely NOT TO
                      YOU. Thirdly, if you so damn good and is able to comment and pin
                      point Mr LKY here, why didn't you ran for the election earlier on?
                      WHY DIDN'T YOU? if you are so bloody good, go try for election
                      then. No sorry, you DONT even need to try, the results are obvious,
                      you are in NO POSITION to get winning votes. And what is it that
                      you said about bootlicking? This is not called bootlicking,
                      this is call stating the fact right in your face. And what you
                      doing is called nonsensical crap. I have to say this out, because
                      im sure lots of people are starting to doubt your mentality.</p>
              <p>Another piece of info for you, just in case you DONT know.
                      Singapore is one of the least corrupted countries and, one of the
                      most fair countries which upholds equality, around in the
                      world. Without good leaders like Mr LKY and the following
                      successors through the years, such good results might not be able
                      to attain in such a short time.</p>
              <p>Mr LKY brought us, brought Singapore to where we are today, he
                      helped us and devoted his time into developing this
                      once-not-so-developed and laid back land into one of the few
                      leading developing nations today. and what have you done, other
                      than living in this own universe of yours and thinking that
                      everything you think is right?</p>
              <p>Didn't you ever heard of the phrase, THINK OF YOUR ROOTS? you
                      are living in where you are today because Mr LKY helped made it to,
                      together with the other forefathers and people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>THINK, THINK, THINK before you start commenting like this. Do
                      you have the right to, in the first place. Don't disgrace yourself
                      as a citizen here. and don't disgrace the race of Chinese, because
                      we are UPRIGHT and HONEST people who know how to stand up for the
                      right things, the right stuffs and the right theories, definitely
                      not bootlickers or what like you have said. Shame on you.</p>
