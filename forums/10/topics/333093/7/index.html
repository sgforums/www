              <p>andrew is here to oppose and attack anyone who does not agree with him, so how?</p>
              <p>beyond that, he will use rude names on people that disagree with him, so how?</p>
              <p>why should I want andrew banned? afterall if he wants to be stupid, I will help him on his way, so how? you want to stop me?</p>

              <p>we are all here to try to have intelligent discussion..... if all discussion starts with calling people despots, panty sniffers, liar, delusional, what's there to discuss, fantagf?</p>

              <p><br>Sigh, now that you explained it, I understand.   May be I have seen many worse people than Andrew.  Have you not read the posts by a transexual called parn, it is much much worse than Andrew?</p>
              <p>But you have to know what cause people to come out with words like panty sniffers, despots and so on in order to know the reason.  I don't deny Andrew sometimes can be a pain and very unreasonable, I understand where he is coming from so I just leave him alone.   YOU will be surprised that I was once upon a time attacked furiously by andrew.    But that is the past, i have let bygone be bygone.</p>
