              <p>his son who is the current prime minister is seen as not so capable, in fact my personal opinion sees him as downright useless except for making stupid food jokes. and you think LKY's death would make life better? don't you think the death of an experienced elderly statesman trusted by investors would hurt singapore badly especially when the one left in control is viewed as "impotent"</p>
              <p>that being said i'm actually quite scared when i think LKY's going to die.</p>
