              <p>Singapore already had all the inherent attributes to be
                              successful, just like Hong Kong, LKY was just a facilitator whose
                              presence made little or no consequence. Hong Kong was under the
                              British and didn't have a LKY, look where it is today.</p>
              <p>Why do you think Sir Stamford Raffles chose to purchase
                              Singapore instead of the thousand of islands in Asia?</p>
              <p>Singapore was in a strategic shipping hub, paired with a
                              hardworking Indian &amp; Chinese workforce, the results are
                              astounding.</p>

              <p>You fucking fuckface! Now i know why PAP kept winning and never lost before cos its 'rivals' are fucking idiots from IDIOTSVILLE!!!</p>
              <p>HK was under the auspices of the British thats why it got to where it is today! SG was NOT, you retard. The British, you cocksucking fuckface, is considered by many as the 2nd biggest power of influence in the world still and certainly more so 40 years ago. Does HK have a fucking army? Have you ever heard the HK national anthem? HK was under the auspices of the Brit ALL THE FUCKING LONG till 97 and now got another Superpower backing it! You fuckwit retard son of two down syndrome's retards. HK was never sovereign. They went from being under one master to another. Singapore was supposed to be under the same programme and fate. Supposed to go from under the control thus auspices of Brit then Malaysia but the Tungku kicked it out and it was sovereign since 43 yrs ago you FUCKING RETARD!</p>
              <p>Why don't you say China did not have the British that's why it took so many yrs to play catch up and is still behind HK and SG, you cumdrinking retard and son of two bigger retards?</p>
              <p>Even a 6 yr old boy knows that HK was controlled by the Brit all through until 97 then handed over to China in 1997 handover, you fuckface. You don't know? No wonder someone dumber than a sack of shit is only able to talk THROUGH HIS SORE FUCKED ANUS ANONYMOUSLY on the Internet!</p>
              <p>Sri Lanka is a more direct comparison since it was freed from the Brit and sovereign since the late 40s. Dumb fuck son of two dogs. I hate retards!</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">interestingly, whenever LKY has a minor heart problem, the symptoms of which can't be felt by a person normally, they're always discovered immediately. and surgery can be conducted at the soonest possible moment (of course).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">what i'm wondering is, to discover an invisible problem like his, you'll probably need to be checked thrice a day or something. does that mean there're forever doctors stationed on oxley road who check on him every few hours every day?</p>

              <p>First, do you lowlife piece of cowdung pay income tax? Do you
                  know that less than 15% of SG citizens pay income tax? <span style="color: #888888;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #ef0f37;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Finally, <span style="color: #888888;">civil
                  servants also pay income tax. So how can they freaking be their own
                  paymasters?!?! </span></span></span></span></span></strong></span></p>

              <p>it depends on how you see it, on one hand i'm pretty happy with a system where i don't expect anything much like welfare from the govt and not much income tax. on the other hand i need to pay all sorts of ridiculous fees for things i don't need but have to be paid for if i want to stay here. even the line of work i'm in requests that i pay hundreds of dollars a year for a license. and thats on top of other such licenses i pay for. and all these adds to the operating costs which in turn have business owners increasing their fees and passing it on to people like us who are consumers. an indirect form of taxation which affects all levels of the society.</p>

              <p>weird that you would think this way because what i'm seeing now seems to suggest LKY and his family having a blessed life and your CSJ living a cursed one.</p>
              <p>is your version dealing with types of "blessed" or "cursed" we can't recognize?</p>
