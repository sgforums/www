              <p>Anyway I hope you dont have to wait for too long for the day of reckoning to come, not so much for your thinking that your curses are effective but more so for your peace of mind &amp; contentment with the demise of DH.  And with no more that big axe (DH)  to grind, hopefully you'll use less expletives<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I absolutely agree with you.   Dictator evil LKY only picks those who are willing to obey him to join his party.    There aren't enough people who are firm to act on what they disagree to vote them out.   </p>

              <p>why? why should anyone vote for opposition? any good reasons? if its just for the sake of opposing then thats counter productive isn't it? shouldn't we vote for an opposition party only if they have values and ideas we believe in?</p>

              <p>That is correct, if you are commited to opposition course and has taken a stand on politics, you have to be careful; defending PAP would carry risks.</p>

              <p>how? by giving out "carrots"? or by governing sg well? PAP cannot be threaten as long as the oppostition remain weak. giving them more seats would not make the opposition stronger, it is only going to set them for a fall from greater heights. if you want the opposition to take control you should consider their foundations first. you can't expect something to be strong outside when its rotten inside.</p>
