              <p>i am merely giving you an analogy on your earlier rant on how we ought to put up and shut up; just because we are shoved a couple of hundred dollars down our throat, we should be a grateful lot.</p>
              <p>of cos you can be dismissive and delinquent in taking this, but what i am trying to say is you missed the forest for the trees.</p>
              <p>and dun see things in just black and white. i am not questioning every single pap policy; nor am i advocating a complete u-turn of governance. singapore can loosen up (a lot) and still thrive.</p>
              <p>whiskers is right is saying that LKY especially, is way past his sell-by date. to continue his draconian ways is harming singapore than doing her good. </p>
              <p>you can continue to `keep bending', i am sure one of his deputies will enjoy ravaging and ravishing your black ass.</p>
              <p>am i doing something about it? sure, one of the ways is exercising my vote.</p>
