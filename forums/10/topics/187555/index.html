            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: indigo;">Before anybody critcise Chee soon juan,have you read the articles that the pap claimed was defamatory...?????Did you base your judgement just based on what the pro-pap straits times wrote...?????The straits times did not even publish the articles so what makes you think Chee is as bad as you think he is..???Why not have an open mind and read it yourself so that you get both sides of the storey before you jump into conclusion and judge Chee pre-maturely...?????<br><br>I read it and my conclusions was that it was a really beautiful and intelligently written article .Just FANTASTIC...!!!!!! I read it on the SDP newspaper and was amazed that I could not find anything defamatory at all in the articles regarding NKF and there was almost no mention of Lee Kuan yew except for 1 sentence and zero mention of Lee hsien Loong so how could these 2 have been defamed...?????Really ridiculous.<br><br>You can also read these 2 articles at this USA website:<br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages </a>Check under the coffee shop talk under the topic:the NKF articles defamatory????<br><br>_________________<br>LEARN ABOUT THE EVILS OF FEMINISM AT :<br><br><a href="http://www.angryharry.com&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.hisside.com/&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.mens-network.org/" rel="nofollow">www.angryharry.com<br><br>http://www.hisside.com/<br><br>http://www.mens-network.org/ </a><br></span></span>[http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages<br><br>][/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">In the end I came to the conclusion that perhaps the Pap just want to put Chee in a bad light so they say they want to sue him for this and for that but in the end after reading it myself,my impression of Chee Soon Juan instead improved dramatically .All that he said in the articles were what many of us Singaporeans had wanted to ask the Pap and they were matters of public interest.And the fact that the pap so desperately wanted to stop him from speaking up and even told people not to pass around the newspapers to others after reading just show how frightened the pap is about Singaporeans reading the article.If the Pap has done nothing wrong then they should not get excited or frightened but just let the people read what they ought to read.Don't censor.This is a matter of great public concern</span></span></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;">I believe most Singapore citizens like the SDP want the Pap to be transparent and to keep them informed of matters directly affecting them and their future and so they want the Pap to:<br><br>1)Tell us how the Government investment Corporation uses our savings for investment<br><br>2)Disclose the details regarding the costs and profits of building HDB flats and how the profits are being used.<br><br>3)Disclose the salaries of the top executives of Temasek Holdings and other GLCs.<br><br>4)Declare the assets and incomes of all the Ministers.<br><br>5)Reform the election system to ensure it is free and fair.<br><br>All these are very reasonable and fair questions.If the pap is frightened by such questions and resort to sueing for defamation it means that something is really wrong so please, for the good of the nation stop all these nonsense defamation suits and answer to the people</span></span></div>
