Both Parties agree to review developments in the air transport<br>sector at the first review of this Agreement under Article 3 (Review) of<br>Chapter 17 (Final Provisions), or at any other time agreed<br>between the Parties, with a view to including these<br>developments in this Agreement.<br><br>5. While both Parties affirm their rights and obligations under<br>the Agreement between the Government of the<br>Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of<br>the Republic of Singapore relating to Air Services, signed<br><br>on 3 November 1967 and any subsequent amendments<br>thereto, both Parties agree to work towards an Open<br>Skies Air Services Agreement and to review that work<br>in accordance with the provisions of Article 22.4.<br><br>6. The Parties affirm, mutatis  mutandis, their rights and obligations<br>under the GATS, including the Annex on Air Transport Services.</blockquote>3.Outgoing Sg Transport Minister Yeo said in his last interview,<br>that Aussie so far had not given their official refusal of<br>Sydney--LA route request.This is not responsible.Is Aussie<br>distracted and thought thay have done so,like Gomez?<br><br>4.31.05.2006 news Minister Yeo expressed the same view.<br><br>5.<strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/BUSINESS/Singapore-seeks-open-skies-review-in-FTA/2006/05/30/1148754962287.html" rel="nofollow"></a></strong><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/BUSINESS/Singapore-seeks-open-skies-review-in-FTA/2006/05/30/1148754962287.html" rel="nofollow"><br>But the Singapore campaign may be assisted by the release of a letter - obtained by the Review under freedom of information laws</a></strong> - in which former deputy prime minister John Anderson wrote to Singapore in the lead-up to the original FTA talks saying he had asked his department to resume consultations, hoping it would lead to a "state of the art open skies agreement".<br><br>The Singapore Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), signed in July 2003, is up for two-yearly review in coming months.<br><br>Singapore Airlines was excluded in February from the lucrative trans-Pacific route, reportedly in favour of Qantas and Virgin Blue.<br><br>Singaporean sources say the FTA review will be reliant on progress of the open skies issue.</blockquote></div>

At least the Aussies are PROTECTING  their  VERY own Qantas' INTERESTS unlike our dear country who prefers foreign talents to their own Singaporeans.

As far as I know, Australians will pay to support fellow aussie companies as long as it helps their economy.   Protectionism and patriotism to their own ensures that Australians will have a job, especially the hardworkers, to pay for their air fares. Keeping the money in the country for the country is the key point.<br><br>I don't even mind a few cents more to buy a fresh australian product in Australia than pay cheaply for some crappy imported pesticide loaded product which will have a direct impact on my personal health. Heck I am an organic food supporter but that isn't the point.<br><br>Look at Singapore- protectionism is a key area they have to look into other than giving jobs to foreigners when singaporeans can do the job. I also note that protectionism can go both ways - look at our government and a particular stranglehold on power.<br><br>Well that is not the protectionism that works in Australia - protectionism of Australia  is for the country , for its economy and for the people , not for the government diplomacy.<br><br></div>
