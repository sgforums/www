              <p>I can't help thinking in this that the HDB market will collapse without PR.</p>
              <p>Why? Now Singaporeans buy cheap HDB from gov, after 5 years sell off to PR, fetch good price.</p>
              <p>PR can't buy new HDB, so no choice to buy in resale market. If one day there is no PR in the resale market. You can imagine the whole HDB will collapse because there is no buyers!</p>
              <p>Those Singaporeans who still think that PRs are not important. You're wrong. Wake up. Your wealth, big part of it your HDB, is supported by PR. You are dependent on PR.</p>
              <p>I hope more PR to come into Singapore, then the housing market will be tight, and then my HDB will become very expensive, and then I will be very rich.</p>

              <p>4) PRs were imported to Singapore for the general purpose of decreasing the wage level of Singaporeans, as wages are generally sticky downwards, not many employees would want to reduce their wage rates. So the government imported lots of cheap labours to make the wages of ordinary Singaporeans fall.</p>

              <p>i was just thinking about this.</p>
              <p>there were many people who bought expensive HDB flats just a few months ago, especially young couples. Assume a young couple bought a $500k HDB flat and took a 30 yr loan, it would mean that their average monthly instalment would be about $2k. (i have assumed they put little or no downpayment).</p>
              <p>Now the problem is, to be able to pay a $2k instalment from CPF, it would mean that they have to earn about $6k between them to be able to afford the instalment. That works out to be about $3k per person.</p>
              <p>Now with all the job cuts, what happens if one person gets retrenched? Would they still be able to afford a $2k monthly instalment? It will probably mean that instead of forking out the instalment thru CPF, they might have to use cash instead.</p>
              <p>Not a good sign...</p>

              <p>Can the young couple actually afford to sign up for a housing loan, when during the last economic downturn in 2003-2004 - this Government and the NTUC had pushed retrenched Singaporeans to be employed again under new SHORT TERM 3-YEAR contract ?</p>
              <p>With Singaporeans being employed on Short Term 3-Year Contract that is to be re-negotiated or renewable every 3 Years, leaving the Employers the option to hire and fire according to the Economic Cycle of bust and boom - can anyone commit themselves to a long term housing loan ?</p>
              <p>The 3-Year Short Term Employment Contract will result in Singaporeans losing their jobs without any retrenchment benefits - as they were employed on short term, and they are not "technically retrenched".</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have yet to wake-up and realise the full blown effect of such Short Term Employment Contract that was only implemented from the last economic downturn.</p>
              <p>Since it was implemented four years ago, it will be interesting to see the number of homes being repossessed, when home loans can no longer be serviced in the current recession - {the term is supposedly worst then the economic downturn in 2003}.</p>
              <p>This Singapore Government has created a Singapore version of the "US home mortgage sub-prime problem".</p>

              <p>There's something i don't understand though.</p>
              <div class="quote_from">Our government has recently stopped the sale of land in the next few quarters to developers; essentially they are trying to quell the supply side of the housing market, while at the same time trying to prop up demand by importing more FTs to boost rental prices.</div>
              <div class="quote_from"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Also, given that our country's (housing) property prices are dictated by the prices of HDB flats, would our property prices suffer a massive devaluation?</p>
              <p>This artificial prop up can be seen by the perenial over-demand vs limited supply. i.e. the recent jurong west half yearly ballot was 21 times oversubscribed. (i was looking for the link at the HDB website but couldnt find it).</p>

              sticky downwards, not many employees would want to reduce their
              wage rates. So the government imported lots of cheap labours to
              make the wages of ordinary Singaporeans fall.</p>

It happens to be the one factor that is directly under the Singapore Government's control.
