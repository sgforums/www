              <p><strong>People's Daily Online, 21 May 2009 </strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Suzhou Industrial Park becomes model of China-Singapore cooperation</strong></span><br> <br> As an important cooperation project between the two governments of
              China and Singapore, the accomplishments of Suzhou Industrial Park in
              last 15 years have caught worldwide attention: the annual revenue
              increased from 30 million yuan in the beginning, to nearly 10 billion
              yuan now. The gross regional product exceeded 100 billion yuan,
              increasing nearly 100 times compared to the early days of exploration. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The level of per capita GDP in the park is close to that of Singapore.<br> </strong></span></span> <br> In the past 15 years, the annual increase of major economic indicators
              of Suzhou Industrial Park reached 30%. It handed in a total of more
              than 100 billion yuan in tax revenues, and utilized foreign funds of
              nearly 16 billion U.S. dollars. Its registered capital was more than
              130 billion yuan, and <span style="color: red;"><strong>created 500,000 job opportunities.</strong></span> The comprehensive Development Index of Suzhou Industrial park has taken
              up the leading position among the national level development zones for
              many years. Now, the Suzhou Industrial park has already become an
              important window for China's opening to the world and also a successful
              example of Sino-foreign economic and technical cooperation.<br> <br> As China's "experimental field, for reform and opening-up and
              demonstration zone for international cooperation", Suzhou Industrial
              Park learned advanced techniques from developed countries such as
              Singapore, and initially finalized the construction of ten systems such
              as planning and construction management, environmental protection,
              investment, logistics services and so on.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>From the beginning of April 1994, the Suzhou Industrial Park organized more than 2000 people to go to Singapore for training</strong></span> and worked out more than 80 regional management approaches in line with
              the direction of China's reform and conforming to international
              conventions. In the meantime, a large number of experts, officials and
              entrepreneurs from Singapore have come to the park to understand
              China's national conditions, nurturing a great many talented people.<br> <br> At present, the Suzhou Industrial Park has become a model for many
              areas of China. The China Development Association held two seminars
              here, training more than 200 cadres from domestic development zones. In
              recent years, more than 30,000 people have come here to study annually.
              The high standard of urban planning, the efficient services for the
              concept of pro-business and the high threshold of environmental
              protection measures of Suzhou Industrial Park have now spread to all
              parts of the country.<br> <br> In Jiangsu Province, the City of Suqian planned to spend 10 years
              cloning a Suzhou Industrial Park. Recently, the Sino-Singapore Suzhou
              Industrial Park Development Company Limited signed a letter of intent
              with the Nantong Economic Development Zone, planning to spend 10-15
              years building an international technology New District and an
              ecological business Park on the north wing of Sutong Bridge.<br> <br> The most significant symbol was the birth of "Sino-Singapore Tianjin
              Eco-City" project, the second major cooperation project between China
              and Singapore. Adopting the practice of Suzhou Industrial Park, it
              forms a Joint Coordination Council and separates the management body
              and development body. A number of responsible officers from Singapore
              in the Tianjin Eco-city project have already worked in the Suzhou
              Industrial Park for a long time. In this regard, the Singapore side
              expressed that the park was not only a brand for Suzhou and China, but
              also a worldwide brand. <br> <br> ------------------------------<br> <strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>That is because Singaporean policy makers were too navie at the planning and assumption stage. Were wrong,  unanticipated, and unprepared. We are only good at doing things, but seldom questions the benefit.  </p>
              <p>Instead of Singapore riping the reward of a Singapore Brand Industrial Park. Now they rip the reward of owning Singapore Brand industrial Park. What happen to the interlectual property rights of the Brand?</p>
              <p>The main issue is what lesson did we learned? Or did SG Govt learn anything? You can come up of this excerise and learned the wrong lesson and continue to make the same mistake over and over again.</p>
