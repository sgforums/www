            <div class='col-md body'>I am going to be objective...<br><br>As I have the chance to pursue an overseas education and also life overseas.  I have had made very good friendships with (Malaysians, chinese and MAlays) and discover that We have a LOT MORE IN COMMON when compared to other asians ( mainland/HK/JPN/India/PAKIs)<br><br>I think all these anger are misplaced.. and playing into the hands of hot heads( within and outside the government) in both countries. who use these feelings and calling it "patriotism" or whatever<br><br>Sure there are many things and policies that are not right and entirely wise or draconian/discrimintaory in both countries. Yes it is sad but true. lets take a step back , I have a feeling that countless years of being no1 in everything , has made singaporeans arrogant and underestimating their nieghbours..lets not forget that despite all the bad policies that exists in Malaysia, they have done remarkably well, ( just not as fast) , but nonetherless Quite fast compared to the rest of asia ,africa /s. america. Malaysia has come a long way, and looking at the present trends ( if the HOT heads and the Islamic crazies are kept in check) , the rest of Malaysia will catch up and be as developed as SG in a  decade or less. Perhaps , this could be the reason why, some hot heads in our little red dot are worried, cos a developed and forward looking Malaysia would negate SG's advantages in the region.<br><br>Hey some of my friends , mentioned, who knows Singapore and malaysia might be joined again ( maybe more in EU kind of common market thingy) which was an idea far ahead of its times, when proposed in the 60's. I dont see why not, once we set aside our differences, the way i see it we have more in common with each other than say Mainlanders and us.<br><br>I would just like to see one fine day, the two countries join up ( a common market),<br><br></div>

Always trying to put each other down to look good as it's easier than trying to proof their worth. Some polish apples, ride along the boss power and victimize others. Some even threaten others rice bowl cus of vested power, very irritating. Ugly Singaporean who cut into peoples lane and don't give way or even signal. I've of course seen good ones of course but generally, Singaporean is long way from being a gracious society. Sadly....</div>

I know this is not an ideal world, but at least we should have a go at it.  First , pple in the little red dot , should STOP underestimating our northern neighbours ( sure We may be no1 in the ARmy, No1 airport, No1 education yada yadayayada) but hey them malaysians too have come a long way since merdeka too<br><br>Sure the malaysians have big issues with thier affirmative action policies,race relations ( still better than a lot of other multiethnic countries) and also they need to keep the Islamic hardliners in check., That is not to say singapore has got NO Issues, ( GLCs,government attempts at social engineering, the Nanny state)<br>..No one is perfect!!!,<br><br></div>
