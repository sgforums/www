              <p>Wished that PAP regime had taken note of the warnings of several economists that the U.S. housing bubble was heading for collapse soon:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Is a USA Economic collapse due in 2005?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="Titel"><strong>By William Engdahl (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 26, 2004</span>)</strong></p>
              <p class="Lauftext"> The
                      US Senate just reconfirmed 78-year-old Alan Greenspan to an
                      unprecedented fifth term as chairman of the world‘s most powerful
                      central bank, the Federal Reserve, or Fed as it is known . The fact
                      that President Bush re-nominated Greenspan underscores how vulnerable
                      the global financial edifice is, and not how excellent a central banker
                      Greenspan is.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">On
                      the surface, world growth appears to be expanding finally, after severe
                      recession and the 60% fall of the US stock market in 2000-2001. The
                      Federal Reserve says it is so confident that growth in the US economy
                      is taking firm hold, that it raised its key interest rate from a record
                      low 1% to 1.25% last month, signalling it would slowly bring rates up
                      to „neutral“ levels of 3.5 -4.5% over coming months. Around the world,
                      strong growth of exports are being reported from Brazil to Mexico to
                      South Korea. Growth in China is so strong the government is worried it
                      is overheating. In Europe, the UK is expanding at the fastest pace in
                      15 years. France expects GDP to grow by 2.5%, and even Germany is
                      talking about stronger export growth. The driver is US economic growth.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                      problem with this optimistic picture is the fact it is entirely based
                      on the dollar and unprecedented creation of cheap dollar credit by
                      Greenspan and the Bush Administration. </strong></span>Their only short-term goal has
                      been to keep the US economy strong enough to assure re-election for
                      George Bush in November. Washington reports are that Bush made a deal
                      to re-appoint Greenspan on the promise Greenspan would keep the economy
                      growing until the elections. They have done this by a combination of
                      historic low interest rates, rates only seen before in times of war or
                      depression, and by stimulating the economy by record budget deficit
                      spending, issuing government bonds to finance it. The world has been
                      flooded with cheap dollars as a result.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">What
                      is clear now is that this unsustainable effort is likely to come to an
                      end sometime in 2005, just after the elections, regardless of who is
                      President. Given the scale of the money -printing by the Fed and the US
                      Treasury since 2001, it is pre-programmed that the „correction“ of the
                      latest Greenspan credit binge will impact the entire global financial
                      and economic system. Some economists fear a new Great Depression like
                      the 1930‘s. The world today depends on cheap US dollar credit. When US
                      interest rates are finally forced higher, dramatic shocks will hit
                      Europe, Asia and the entire global economy, unlike any seen since the
                      1930‘s. Debts that now appear manageable will suddenly become
                      un-payable. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defaults and bankruptcies will spread as they did in the
                      wake of the 1931 Creditanstalt collapse.</strong></span><br><br><br><strong>The US home bubble</strong><br><br>The
                      official US myth is that the recession of 2000-2001 ended in November
                      2001 and „recovery“ has been underway ever since. The reality is not so
                      positive. Using record low interest rates,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the Fed has lured American
                      families into debt at record rates, creating what might be called a
                      „virtual recovery,“ financed by record amounts of new consumer debt. </strong></span>There has never been a recovery before in which debt levels increase,
                      rather the opposite.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">The
                      American dream of owning an own home has been the source of the record
                      lending, helped by the lowest interest rates in 43 years. Greenspan has
                      often boasted this has been what has propped the US economy since 2001.
                      When families buy a home, they need furniture, they employ construction
                      workers, electricians, engineers, and the economy grows. Record low
                      interest rates have made it very easy for families to get a bank loan,
                      using their home equity as collateral or guarantee. These loans, tied
                      to the rising real estate prices, allowed American families to finance
                      new furniture, cars, and countless more. In 2003 banks made a record
                      $324 billion in such home equity loans, on top of $1 trillion in new
                      mortgage loans.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">All
                      this economic consumption has created the illusion of a recovering
                      economy. Behind the surface, a huge debt burden has built up. Since
                      1997, the total of home mortgage debt for Americans has risen 94% to a
                      colossal $7.4 trillion, a debt of some $120,000 for a family of four.
                      Bank loans for real estate purchases have risen since 1997 by 200%, to
                      $2.4 trillion. Average US home prices have risen by 50% in the period
                      since 1998. In 2003 alone a record total of $1 trillion in new mortgage
                      loans were made. In 1997 mortgages totalled $202 billion.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">In
                      many parts of the US, home price inflation has become alarming. An
                      apartment in Manhattan is now above $1 million. Home prices in Boston
                      have risen by 64% in five years. California real estate prices are
                      soaring. On average US home prices have risen 50% in six years, an
                      unprecedented rise, driven by Greenspan‘s easy credit. In seven years
                      to 2004, prices of US homes had risen on paper by $7 trillion to a
                      total of $15 trillion, the highest in US history. The problem is so
                      obviously dangerous, that Greenspan recently was forced to deny
                      existence of any real estate „bubble,“ much as he denied a dot.com
                      stock bubble in 2000.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But
                      that is exactly what he has created with his low interest rates. The
                      dot.com bubble has been transformed into a larger and more threatening
                      real estate bubble. Families have been convinced to invest in a home as
                      an alternative to buying stocks for their pension years.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext">The
                      rise in home prices has been driven by cheap interest rates and banks
                      rushing to lend with abandon. Because two semi-government agencies, the
                      Federal National Mortgage Association, known as FannieMae, and the
                      Government National Mortgage Association, or GinnieMae buy up the
                      bank‘s mortgage contracts, taking the risk from the local banks, so the
                      local lending bank has less pressure to guarantee that he lends to
                      low-risk credit-worthy families likely to repay the loan.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">The
                      US Congress has passed new laws making it even easier for families to
                      buy homes with no penny of their own money required initially as „down
                      payment.“ This has meant a huge rise in mortgage loans to economically
                      marginal or risky families. The number of such risky or „sub-prime“
                      mortgage loans has risen by 70% this year alone, and now makes up 18%
                      of all US mortgages. Many of these risky mortgages are made under
                      „adjustable rate mortgages“. Today adjustable rates are low, just above
                      4%. Because of this some 35% of all new mortgages are adjustable today.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">So
                      long as rates stay low, the roulette wheel of debt rolls on. The
                      problem begins when interest rates rise and families, lured into buying
                      a home with variable interest rate payments, suddenly find their
                      monthly cost of paying the mortgage has exploded as interest rates
                      rise. At that point, US banks will face a serious bad loan problem, far
                      worse than that of 1990-92 when several of the largest US banks were on
                      the brink of failure. US rates began to rise significantly in May, and
                      the Fed was forced to raise its official rate on June 30 for the first
                      time in four years. Many banks have loans written in adjustable
                      mortgage rates. As US interest rates continue to rise over the next
                      twelve months or so, that will trigger a wave of mortgage defaults.
                      Some industry experts fear a „bloodbath“ in 2005.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">The
                      American family is highly indebted, not just for their home. The
                      Federal Reserve data show a total US debt level now above $35
                      trillions, or some $ 450,000 for a typical family of four. Average
                      consumer debt for credit cards, autos and such is at record highs.
                      Carmakers continue to offer car loans, with loans for up to six or even
                      seven years. Many Americans owe more on their car than it is worth. The
                      debt grows. As long as Fed rates are at 43 year lows, the debt is
                      manageable. When US rates rise, it becomes unmanageable for many. The
                      rise has begun. There are two ways rates are likely to rise from here.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">First,
                      the Fed itself has been forced to act, raising its Fed funds rate the
                      first time since four years, to 1.25% from 1% on June 30 . It had no
                      choice. Greenspan has claimed for months that the US recovery was
                      „strong“ and that rates would return to „normal“ soon. It was a
                      calculated bluff. Had he not acted as US jobs data convinced investors
                      recovery might be real, he faced a major crisis of confidence in the
                      dollar. The Bush Administration reportedly manipulated employment
                      statistics to show better job growth for the election.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Ever
                      since raising rates, Greenspan has calmed nervous markets by stating
                      that future rises will be ever so gradual. In other words: don‘t worry,
                      speculators. But if he is to keep the confidence of the large bond
                      markets, he must convince them that he is still vigilant against
                      inflation. That is tough when prices for everything from copper to oil
                      to lumber to soybeans and scrap steel are rising from 50% to 110% over
                      recent months. His only anti-inflation tool is higher interest rates,
                      or promise of same. The longer he fails to raise rates as prices rise,
                      the greater the risk of a dollar crisis, as foreign investors fear the
                      worst, namely that the US economy is in far worse shape than officials
                      admit. The Fed is in a trap.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Yet
                      higher interest rates threaten to explode the trillion dollar home
                      mortgage debt bubble, where home values are estimated to be at least
                      20% overvalued nationally, or $3 trillion.<br> When private bond
                      investors such as major pension funds and banks lose confidence in
                      Greenspan‘s inflation commitment, the only other source of support for
                      low interest rates would be the willingness of Japan and China above
                      all, to pour billions more of their dollars into buying US bonds.<br><br><br><strong>Keeping the Bush Goverment afloat</strong><br><br> The largest buyers of US government debt have been the central banks of
                      the Asia-Pacific. The central banks of Japan and China alone hold more
                      than $1 trillion of US Treasury bonds as foreign currency reserves.
                      Worldwide foreign central banks hold some $1.3 trillion of US
                      government debt. If private debt is added, the United States is the
                      world‘s largest debtor, with some $3.7 in net foreign debt, as of the
                      start of this year, likely well over $4 trillions by now. In 1980 when
                      Ronald Reagan was elected the US was the world‘s creditor with a plus
                      of $1 trillion.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Nations
                      depending on the large US export market, recycle their trade surplus
                      dollars back into buying US Treasury debt, to keep their currency fixed
                      to the dollar. Because Japan and China and others continue to buy
                      record sums of US debt, paying with their hard-earned trade dollars, US
                      interest rates can remain far lower than otherwise. Were foreign buying
                      of US bonds to reverse or even slow, the US Treasury would have to
                      offer higher interest rates to lure investors to buy the debt. That
                      would make interest rates on homes more expensive very fast. Millions
                      of homeowners would face default. Prices would collapse in many
                      regions, leading to higher unemployment.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">This
                      will not be like the dot.com crash, which was a deliberate crash caused
                      by the Fed raising rates to deflate that bubble. In 2000 interest rates
                      were 6.5% and the Fed had room to lower to 1% and create the housing
                      bubble alternative for money to keep the economy afloat on a sea of
                      debt. This time, rates are at historic lows, debt at historic highs,
                      dependency on continued foreign capital inflows is unprecedented.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Speculation
                      has become global as never before. The cheap credit in the dollar world
                      has led to cheaper credit worldwide. The economies of Brazil, Mexico
                      and even Argentina benefit from banks and speculators like George Soros
                      who borrow at the super low US or Japanese interest rates to invest in
                      bonds in high interest rate lands like Brazil or Turkey or Argentina.
                      These so-called emerging markets have been booming in the past year on
                      Greenspan‘s promise to keep US rates so low. That now is beginning to
                      look very risky. As well, Bush Administration talk of possible terror
                      attacks around election-time, is making many major investors fear
                      risking investing in US stocks or bonds. They are instead beginning to
                      cash in their recent profits from the Greenspan stock boom of 2003-04,
                      and holding it in safe cash.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">That
                      is a major reason the US stock and other markets have been in steady
                      fall in recent weeks. The US debt bubble depends on maintaining the
                      myth of a US recovery to lure foreign capital to invest, helping keep
                      the dollar from collapse. Should foreign pension funds of the central
                      banks of China and Japan be convinced the US recovery is in danger,
                      there could be a major shift of funds out of dollars.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">Yet
                      China and Japan, fearing the dollar crisis, have recently begun heavy
                      buying of commodities, from oil to iron ore to copper to gold. They are
                      using their trade dollars to buy real commodities, instead of US
                      Treasury debt, which is mere paper. Chinese panic buying of oil for
                      stockpiling reserves is a major factor pushing oil prices again to
                      record levels of $42 barrels despite two major OPEC quota rises. Steel
                      prices have exploded due to China demand.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">When
                      Bush became President he inherited a Federal budget in surplus. Since
                      then he has created the largest deficits in US history, near $500 in
                      2004 and estimated to reach $600 billion in 2005. In 1971, when Nixon
                      took the dollar off the gold standard, the Federal budget deficit was
                      an „alarming“ $23 billions.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">These
                      huge deficits are financed by the US Treasury selling government bonds
                      or similar paper to investors. Since 2001, the central banks of Asia,
                      led by Japan and China, have bought huge sums, some 43% of all US
                      Government debt. They in effect recycled their trade dollars gained
                      from exporting cars, electronics, textiles and other goods to the US
                      consumer. In the 12 month period to this April, the Bank of Japan spent
                      a record $200 billions to buy US dollar bonds or, in effect, to finance
                      the cost of Bush‘s Iraq war. The Banks of China, South Korea and Taiwan
                      bought almost as much dollar bonds.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">They
                      did this for clear reasons: Their currencies are linked to the dollar,
                      and were the dollar to fall against the Yen or the Yuan, Asian exports
                      would suffer a decline, endangering their economic growth and leading
                      to explosive rises in unemployment across Asia. By recycling their
                      trade dollar surplus into buying US Treasury debt, they argue they are
                      looking after their own needs. A dollar crisis in early 2005 could
                      signal the next global crisis. The whole world is hostage to the misconceived economic 
                                                          policies of a dollar standard out of control.</p>
