              <p>even if  lee kuan yew died today,nothing will change much  as the system is having biodegradable  or weak pillars in place.as lky will be considered as justr one of those almost useless engineers in a factory where jobs and problems are mainly fixed by assistant engineers etc.he only says yes and no and if he cant make a correct decision,,,,his assistants in the past would  probably do it all and get problems fixed without any issues or losses or any illegal moves.</p>
              <p>in the past spore had dr winsemius and those that treasured money and made wise use of them.now spore having lost billions in investments overseas just keeps mum bout holes in a ship...prettysoon ship will end up as a submarine.</p>
              <p>who do we have as pillars in spore parliament now???</p>
              <p>1)goh chok tong??the one who introduced everyone the stock exchange?</p>
              <p>2)lee hsien loong who ended up cryin at werk and desperately hatch out a plan to make casinos in spore ??</p>
              <p>3)lee hsien loongs's wife who is commander director supreme chairwoman of singapore financial banking mechanism???how many billions of US$$$$ has she lost in temasek since she was left in charge of it?</p>
              <p>4)dr vivian balakrishnan???what the hell did he do except become some kid prefect?</p>
              <p>5)dr ng eng hen???the one who dun seem to be doing much of a job since he was left in charge of spore work labour system and salary issues caused by his policies in the past as a result of past policies he made.he might even be the one responsible for the mass exodus of skilled sporeans out of spore due to the easy influx of foreign skilled workers.</p>
              <p>6)???mah bow tan????i wouldnt even buy a second hand bicycle from that dude for what he's worth so far with his past policies.</p>
              <p>7)admiral teo???what did he do so far??he even has a hard time keeping himself awake in parliament !!!!!some admiral he would make in a real war!!!!sleeping while piloting his ship and into some coral reef!!!i wouldnt even have him as my nco medic even in case he falls asleep while injecting something or selecting wrong stuff to be injected into me whilst he is half asleep.</p>
              <p>8)??????????no more pillars in spore as the other PAP members are considered as merely collecting $$$$ and not doing much in return for future of spore.</p>
              <p>there u have it!!!the Top Ten in spore  to propel spore into the 21st century and beyond!actually from looks of it i think spore will not go far with the these 7 people as its pillars.....it would get worse in fact at your cost.sure they will have new spanking merc and ferraris and drive on new spotless roads and with new buildings,casinos.....more likely all of u would be the ones ULTIMATELY paying for it frm now till the end of eternity!</p>

              <p>Make life simple, Go work, get paid, stay healthy, visit less pubs and patronise less gals or guys,  get married, have a kid or 2, paid your bills, know your strenght and weakenss, be gracious and  make proper decision by yourself and not listen to those stupid cats and dogs advices, you will lead a wonderful life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Everyday complain about govt paid high, foreigner coming here and cost of living getting higher and higher is only going to make your life more and more miserable here, put all these aside, see where you are, work from there, anything other things you cannot change, bear with it,  endure it and let move on. And life will be more happier and lovely everafter.</p>
