Calories too can be controlled vz effective supply and demand adjustments: more non-digestible vegetable matter, complex foods: unprocessed natural fat and protein can lengthen the duration of digestion (satiety) and thus reduce between meal hunger pangs whilst increased exercise and measurable volumetric increase in muscle mass can increase baseline metabolic rate to allow unsaturated adipose cells to do their rightful job in responding to insulin and absorb glucose from blood.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">A high glucose level due to supply + demand imbalances is like a road jam-packed with cars causing road damage (excessive start-stop vehicle motions) and environmental damage due to air pollution due to excessive vehicle volume and travel duration).</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Diabetes is a disease of chronic caloric excess and sedentary life resulting in fully saturated adipose Cells and atrophied fat saturated muscle tissue: insensate to insulin due to physical limits in caloric storage being exceeded/ reached resulting in insulin resistance and consequent blood glucose excess which is self-destructive and in the long run, the cause of many diabetes related complications like blindness, cancer, kidney failure, impotence, heart failure, amputations, frequent infections and stroke (/dementia).</span></p></div>

              <p>Just my 2 cents' worth.. you should differentiate the different types of diabetes:</p>
              <p>Type 1 Diabetics: insulin deficiency from the pancreas cells, resulting in cells not being able to absorb the glucose in the blood stream, leading to higher than normal levels of blood sugar aka 'diabetes'. In Type 1 DM, calorie intake does not affect blood sugar levels because the body cannot produce enough insulin for cells to take in the glucose. Type 1 DM is sometimes also known as child-onset diabetes (because it usually occurs in children, and requires a lifetime injection of insulin to control blood sugar levels).</p>
              <p>Type 2 Diabetes: cell signaling regulation problem. In Type 2 diabetes, usually what happens in that the muscle and liver cells, become "resistant", or faulty to insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels. In Type 2 DM, yes it is partly true that excess caloric intake is a contributing factor to the onset of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of blood sugar disorder in the world.</p>
              <p>Actually, there are other sub-sets of diabetes. For instance, Gestational diabetes (GDM), adult onset diabetes etc with different causes. Therefore, not all diabetes are due to excess caloric intake (though over eating does contribute to the risks of getting diabetesÂ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png">)</p>

              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Â </p>

Too much glucose can lead to serious health problems.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes â when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes â and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered.</p>
              <h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 12px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.6rem; color: #111111;">Symptoms</h2>

Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not experience symptoms initially. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are:</p>

              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;">The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;">The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;">Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;">As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.</li>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;">Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;">Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;">Your liver stores and makes glucose.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;">When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Causes of type 1 diabetes</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system â which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses â attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what many of those factors are is still unclear.</p>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">In prediabetes â which can lead to type 2 diabetes â and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight.</p>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Causes of gestational diabetes</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">God bless giorson parsey... amen...</p>

              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Family history.</strong>Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Environmental factors.</strong>Â Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>The presence of damaging immune system cells (autoantibodies).</strong>Â Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Dietary factors.</strong>Â These include low vitamin D consumption, early exposure to cow's milk or cow's milk formula, and exposure to cereals before 4 months of age. None of these factors has been shown to directly cause type 1 diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Geography.</strong>Â Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Weight.</strong>Â The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Inactivity.</strong>Â The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Family history.</strong>Â Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Race.</strong>Â Although it's unclear why, people of certain races â including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans â are at higher risk.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Age.</strong>Â Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Gestational diabetes.</strong>Â If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome.</strong>Â For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome â a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity â increases the risk of diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>High blood pressure.</strong>Â Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</strong>Â If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Risk factors for gestational diabetes</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Any pregnant woman can develop gestational diabetes, but some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Age.</strong>Â Women older than age 25 are at increased risk.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Family or personal history.</strong>Â Your risk increases if you have prediabetes â a precursor to type 2 diabetes â or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Weight.</strong>Â Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Race.</strong>Â For reasons that aren't clear, women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 12px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.6rem; color: #111111;">Complications</h2>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes â and the less controlled your blood sugar â the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Cardiovascular disease.</strong>Â Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you are more likely to have heart disease or stroke.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Nerve damage (neuropathy).</strong>Â Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Kidney damage (nephropathy).</strong>Â The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Eye damage (retinopathy).</strong>Â Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Foot damage.</strong>Â Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Skin conditions.</strong>Â Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Hearing impairment.</strong>Â Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Alzheimer's disease.</strong>Â Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Complications of gestational diabetes</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;"><strong>Complications in your baby</strong>Â can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Excess growth.</strong>Â Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large (macrosomia). Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Low blood sugar.</strong>Â Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Type 2 diabetes later in life.</strong>Â Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Death.</strong>Â Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;"><strong>Complications in the mother</strong>Â can also occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Preeclampsia.</strong>This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Subsequent gestational diabetes.</strong>Â Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes â typically type 2 diabetes â as you get older.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-size: 2.1rem; color: #111111;">Complications of prediabetes</h3>

              <h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 12px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.6rem; color: #111111;">Prevention</h2>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 0px 36px; padding: 0px 0px 24px; color: #111111;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong>Â Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Get more physical activity.</strong>Â Aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride your bike. Swim laps. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions spread throughout the day.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Lose excess pounds.</strong>Â If you're overweight, losing even 7 percent of your body weight â for example, 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (90.9 kilograms) â can reduce the risk of diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others) may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes â but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; color: #111111;">Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.</p>
