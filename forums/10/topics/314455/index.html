              <p> <strong>US push for new security mechanism irks Southeast Asia</strong></p>
              <p>Monday, April 14, 2008</p>
              <p><br> WASHINGTON: US-led moves<strong> to
              turn a forum grappling with the North Korean nuclear crisis into a
              permanent security mechanism are frustrating Southeast Asia’s bid to
              become a key player in regional security</strong>, experts say. <br><br>The
              United States is pushing for the six-party nuclear talks, also
              involving China, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas, <strong>to be transformed
              into a permanent Northeast Asian mechanism for resolution of regional
              security issues. </strong><br><br>A Russia-led working group on a “Northeast
              Asia Peace and Security Mechanism” was established following a landmark
              agreement by the six parties in February 2007, in which North Korea
              agreed to close its key nuclear plant. <br><br>But officials in the
              Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) are worried such a
              mechanism could <strong>undermine its role in regional security management. </strong><br><br>Asean
              hosts the biggest official security umbrella grouping in the
              Asia-Pacific - the 14-year-old Asean Regional Forum or ARF comprising
              the 10 Asean states together with 17 others, including the United
              States, Russia, China, the European Union, North Korea, Australia,
              India and Pakistan. “There is a concern in Southeast Asia that such a
              Northeast Asia forum would actually undermine the ARF,” Muthiah
              Alagappa, an Asian expert at the Hawaii-based East West Centre told a
              conference in Washington on Friday. <br><br><strong>“The belief is that if the big powers all get together in another forum, then ARF would be sidelined,”</strong> he said.	   <br><br>But
              Alagappa felt the fears might be misplaced. “I don’t think Southeast
              Asia should delude itself that ARF is the overall (security) umbrella.
              The US is a global power, China is rising power, Japan is the second
              largest economy, they are going to deal with the issues.” <br><br>Aside
              from the ARF, the Asean group has two other key forums where security
              is often discussed - an annual summit with China, Japan and South
              Korea, known as the Asean plus Three process, and an East Asian Summit
              involving the 13 countries as well as India, Australia and New Zealand.
              <br><br>“ARF is only part of the regional security architecture, which
              also consists of the Asean plus Three as well as the East Asian
              Summit,” one Asean diplomat in Washington stressed. <strong><br><br>Some in
              Asean perceive that the United States is promoting the Northeast Asian
              security forum because it is not a participant in the East Asian
              Summit. </strong><br><br>The United States was not invited to the summit
              because it has <strong>refused to sign an Asean non-aggression pact</strong>, a
              prerequisite for membership in the 16-nation grouping. <br><br>US
              suggestions to expand the six-party forum, all of whose members are in
              the ARF, <strong>to include other ARF countries as well such as Australia are
              also viewed with suspicion by some in Asean. </strong><br><strong><br>“Any bid to
              undermine Asean would be dangerous, considering its role so far as a
              bulwark against aggression by big powers,” </strong>said one Asean official.</p>

              <p><em>...In contrast, North Korea has not only the military power but also the political
              will to wage total war against the United States. </em></p>
              <p><em>North Korea has made it clear
              that it will strike all US targets with all means,  if the US
              mounted military attacks on North Korea.  </em></p>
              <p><em>That North Korea's threat is no
              bluff can be seen from the aggressive actions taken by North Korea since the
              Korean War armistice, most recent of which is North Korea's attempt to capture
              an American spy plane. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>In the morning of March 1, 2003, an American RC-132S spy
              plane, Cobra Ball,  took off from a US airbase in Okinawa, and cruised along the East coast of North Korea collecting electronic signals.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The
              US intelligence suspected that North Korea was about to test a long-range
              missile and the plane was there to monitor the suspected missile launch. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>When the US plane reached a point about 193 km from the coast of North Korea,
              two MiG-29 and two MiG-21 fighter planes showed up unexpectedly. </strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The North Korean planes approached
              within 16 m and signaled the US plane to follow them. </em></p>
              <p><em>The US pilot refused
              to follow the command and left the scene posthaste. The US plane was tailed by
              the hostiles for about 22 min but let the US spy plane go.  </em></p>
              <p><em>There are two key points to be
              observed here.</em></p>
              <p><em>First, the hostile planes waited for the US plane at the Uhrang airbase,
              located about 200 km from the point of air encounter.  </em></p>
              <p><em>They knew that the
              US plane was coming.  </em></p>
              <p><em>The North Korean planes flew 200 km to intercept the
              US plane. Did the US plane see them coming? </em></p>
              <p><em> If it did, why no
              evasive action?  After intercepting the US plane, the hostile planes dogged
              it for 22 min.  <strong>Why no American planes for the rescue? </strong> The US crew
              must have informed the base of the danger they were in, but no action was taken
              by the base. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong> If Kim Jong Il had given the command, the MiGs would have
              shot down the US plane and returned to their base before the US could have
              scrambled war planes. </strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Second, North Korea intercepted an American spy plane flying 200 km from its
              coast. </em></p>
              <p><em> According to the international norm, a nation's territorial air
              space extends 19 km from its coast line.  The US is the exception and
              claims air space of 370 km from its coast line; any foreign airplane violating
              this extended air space is challenged or shot down by the US military...</em></p>

              April 16, 2008   
              UN agency warns of looming N. Korea food crisis  
              SEOUL - TIME is running out to avert a humanitarian tragedy in North Korea due to acute food shortages, a United Nations (UN) agency warned on Wednesday. 
              'The food security situation...is clearly bad and getting worse,' said Tony Banbury, the World Food Programme's (WFP) Asia director. 
              
              'It is increasingly likely that external assistance will be urgently required to avert a serious tragedy,' he said in a statement. 
              
              The WFP estimates that over 6.5 million people, out of a population of 23 million, do not have enough to eat. It said the figure would rise unless urgent action is taken. 
              
              Mr Banbury called on international donors to increase aid, and urged North Korea to allow aid agencies to check that food is reaching the needy. 
              
              South Korean officials said in February that some of Seoul's rice aid intended for hungry civilians had been diverted to frontline army units. 
              
              The hardline communist state suffered famine in the mid- to late 1990s which killed hundreds of thousands. -- AFP

            <div class='col-md body'>Any aid sent to North Korea will probably only benefit it's military. While the common people go hungry. Until North Korea has less soldiers and more farmers. I do not advocate sending them one solitary grain of rice. A country that cannot feed itself or even produce it's own electricity. But squanders it's very limited resources developing nuclear weapons is beyond help. Helping North Korea is like buying food for a drug addict. So that he can spend his money on more drugs.</div>
