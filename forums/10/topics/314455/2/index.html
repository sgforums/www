              As long as they stay on the shitty side of the 38th parallel. Why would the US want to attack North Korea?
              Let the North Koreans bask in their plentiful communist paradise. Uncle Kim has done more damage to his country than any invading army could ever do.

              <p>Nah, Kim Jong II isn't stupid, he has kept his own people and even his own military in a idealogical vacuum. Any attempt to invade South Korea will instantly expose the lie of his regime as the "most advanced and prosperous in the world" to his own people and remove a lot of his own support on the ground. His only option then will then be to be even harsher controls which is just a vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>To get an idea of how deluded his people, even his troops are, during their own national day they will broadcast with loudspeakers across the DMZ to South Korean soldiers that they had meat, encouraging them to defect. Apparently they think that South Korea is so poor that they are in an even worse state then them!</p>
              <p>Hence he's not dumb, as much as he rattles his sabers he knows that any war will ultimately be his undoing. After all he's comfy now as he is but his regime is really held together with bubblegum and wrapping tape, and it is in his own best interest to keep it that way. North Korean soceity is somewhat like a runaway train, where the entire country is simply made to support the existence of one regime, spending all its resources on the military and the like, but this certainly cannot last forever.</p>

              <p>Pratically can the US fight a two front war? They did such a thing in WW2.</p>
              <p>Note that the forces bidded to attack Iraq were a very small portion of their entire military might, and Iraq didn't put up much of a fight at all. It is the current insurgency that is costing them pin pricks of damage. The actual war and invasion actually resulted in very few losses for the Yanks. It is politics, and not the military that is unable to conclude this mess.</p>
              <p>But a conventional war  caused by a clear enemy with a conventional structure is a lot clearer in terms of politics, and unfortnately for North Korea it is the war that the US Military is best at fighting.</p>
              <p>In terms of resources, you must consider that you are not only pitting NK against the Yanks, but SK as well. And unlike the South Vietnamese army, South Korea's military is no slouch and it really remains to be seen if North Korean, facing its own internal issues with famine and the like really want to mess around with the notion of war.</p>
              <p>It is in their regime's best interest to cooperate (even if they do so with a lot of reluctance and saber-rattling), and not really to fight.</p>
              <p>And pratically as well, it is not in NK's interest to play the nuclear card, because they lack the amount of nukes (if they even have any operational to begin with) to reach MAD with the US, and I seriously think nuking a US city will make the American public scared and call for a pullout, if anything 9/11 proved, is it that the Yanks take things personally, and instead rally behind a cause if they see it's worth it. It's not that they lack the heart for a fight in Iraq, but they see no point in it. But they'll certainly see a NK nuke as a very big point to rally behind.</p>

              exercises being staged by the U.S. and the South Korean warhawks have
              created such a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that a nuclear

              that the DPRK targeted saber-rattling is being staged in real earnest,
              timed to coincide with the U.S. attack on Iraq... </em></p>
              <p><em>There is a growing danger of the Foal Eagle and Rsoi joint military
              exercises as the U.S. hurled unusually huge combat forces equipped with
              sophisticated weapons into the exercises. </em></p>
              <p><em><br>They involve hundreds of thousands of troops and various types of
              modern combat hardware enough to wage a war.</em></p>
              <p><em> The U.S. has already
              transferred 24 B-52 and B-1 fighter-bombers to the west pacific region,
              deployed 6 F-117 stealth fighters, which were in an airforce base in
              New Mexico state, in South Korea on March 13 and, at the same time,
              mobilized a wing of F-15 fighters, a backbone of its air force. </em></p>
              <p><em>What is most serious is that it brought super-size carrier Carl Vinson

              Korean port on March 14. </em></p>
              <p><em>The U.S. dispatch of the carrier, the third largest in the U.S. navy,
              to the Foal Eagle and Rsoi to play a major role there lays bare its
