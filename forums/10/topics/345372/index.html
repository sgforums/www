              <p>Wednesday, 21 January 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/items/luggage.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="right"><em>Leo Lewis<br>Times online<br></em><br>Singapore
              faces an exodus of 200,000 foreigners as the financial services and
              manufacturing industries scythe through their workforces and the
              city-state grinds towards the worst recession in its 43-year history.<br><br>The
              expected exodus, predict analysts at Credit Suisse, could see the
              number of people living in the tiny but economically powerful island<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> shrink more than 3 per cent to just 4.68 million by 2010 in a shift
              that would severely undermine the government’s 22-year efforts to boost
              the population through immigration.</strong></span></p>
              <p><br>A broad rule of thumb, said analysts
              at UBS in Singapore, is that nearly every new job created over the last
              few years went to a foreigner. The economic policies of the city state
              have overtly relied on its ability to attract talent and skills from
              abroad.<br><br>The departure of thousands of ex-pat bankers, lawyers
              and accountants between now and 2010 is expected to lead a secondary
              exodus of manufacturing, construction and service sector foreign
              workers.<br><br>Job losses will hit Singapore hard, said Credit Suisse
              economist Cem Karacadag, “because they affect more highly paid workers
              and could result in a semi-permanent drip in the population”. He added
              that the potential drop “would have far-reaching implications for the
              economy” including a possible sharp contraction in private consumption.<br><br>The
              knock-on effects of a Singapore exodus, some real estate analysts
              believe, could also see property prices fall by as much as 30 per cent
              from their current levels.<br><br>Credit Suisse’s grim population
              forecast comes amid warnings that among non-Japan Asian countries,
              Singapore’s open economy may be hit hardest by the global downturn.
              Consumption growth, said the report, could fall to almost zero.<br><br>Analysts
              at believe that the country’s GDP may contract by 2.8 per cent in 2009
              as rising unemployment hammers domestic growth and the collapse of
              consumer confidence around the world hits exports.<br><br>Mr Karacadag
              raised a further red flag for Singapore’s economy by warning that there
              was a risk that forecasts were still underestimating the effects of a
              broad Asian downturn and further terrible news from the financial
              sector.<br><br>Singapore – the world’s busiest port by tonnage handled
              and the home of some of the world’s largest shipping companies - is
              already feeling the pain of an alarming slump in global trade.<br><br>With
              the credit crunch still affecting trade finance and the demand for
              Asian manufactured goods in acute decline, hundreds of container and
              dry-bulk ships now sit unneeded and at anchor outside Singapore. The
              stagnation, say brokers, is matched onshore.<br><br>In tandem with the
              warnings over a possible population crunch, concerns are growing among
              investors over the health of Singapore’s domestic banks. The “benign
              asset quality” environment in which Singapore banks have thrived, say
              analysts, has now reached an inflection point.<br><br>The ratio of non-
              performing loans is expected to rise sharply as the construction boom
              that has filled the Singapore skyline with towers and cranes begins to
              deflate.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Between 2003 and 2008, the population of the city state
              soared nearly 18 per cent in an increase driven predominantly by
              foreigners hired to meet Singapore’s endemic shortage of workers during
              the good times.</strong></span><br><br>When global trade, investment banking and Asian
              stock markets were booming, Singapore successfully fashioned itself as
              a financial hub to rival Tokyo and Hong Kong and the expatriates
              flooded in – around 200,000 jobs were created in the financial and
              business services sector over the last four years.<br><br>A large number of jobs are expected 		to be lost in manufacturing, which accounts for about a quarter of 		Singapore’s GDP.</p>
