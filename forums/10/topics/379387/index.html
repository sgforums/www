                  Communications and the Arts (MICA), reminds one of the Italian joke
                  that goes: why does an Italian tank have 5 reverse gears and 1 forward
                  gear? Answer: the forward gear is for when the enemy attacks from
                  behind. The last time we visited the subject, the Competition
                  Commission of Singapore (CSS) said the Media Development Authority
                  (MDA) is the party responsible for the SCV-Singtel screw-up in the EPL
                  bid. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lui
                  is now saying, “Consumers will have to send their own signals to
                  service providers as to whether they want to continue with the
                  arrangement we have today.” </strong></span> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Translation: don’t bother me, I’m too busy being a million dollar minister.</strong></span></span><br> <br> The real joke, if we are to believe Lui, is that MDA actually
                  commissioned a study last year on “competition issues” (we are not told
                  how much of taxpayers’ money was wasted for this) and is looking at
                  “short term and long term regulatory options”. We hope he did not plan
                  to outdo Mah Bow Tan who splurged $400,000 to rename Marina Bay. <span style="color: red;"><strong>For
                  all the “studying” and “looking”, EPL is richer by about $200 million,
                  and Singaporeans are still not sure they will be watching football the
                  way it was delivered by cable.</strong></span> The 3 parliamentarians were
                  being polite in expressing doubt if competition for rights between the
                  pay TV operators has been detrimental to consumers.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The bitter truth is that there is
                  only one operator supplying cable TV, and one operator supplying IPTV.
                  Thanks to MDA, Singaporeans are forced to choose between two monopolies.</strong></span></span> The solution is up in the skies: with satellite dishes, we won’t be fettered with the Hobson’s choice.<br> <br> But don’t expect too much from the Rear-Admiral, the guy can’t even add.  <span style="color: red;"><strong>The
                  data he presented to parliament revealed that the Esplanade Operating
                  Expenditure for 2008 was $63m while Earned Income was $24m (2007
                  figures are $61 m and $27m respectively).</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong> Yet Lui is maintaining that “the Esplanade has not incurred any shortfalls.</strong></span></span>”  <span style="color: red;"><strong>Taxpayers’
                  monies, under their accounting term of “Government Grants”, were blown
                  in 2008 to the tune of $40m (2007 number was $37m) to cover the
                  shortfall. Money that could have been used for the jobless and needy,
                  instead of staging high falutin’ concerts for the expatriate community
                  and the elites. </strong></span>From the perspective of the lesser mortals, the spikes on the “durian” are not the only thorns in the Singapore flesh.<br> <br> .</div>

              <p>Another simpleton... why is it that all our one-start general minister are so incompetent? Despite having risen through the ranks and gone through a stringent selection for political office?? Is this the best that the government can produce? Tier 1?? My admin can do a better job than him.</p>
              <p>These scholars are given an accelerated path in the military and thinks that they are Gods because of how fast they rise.. what a joke. Put them in a corporate environment and they fail instantly.</p>
              <p>How many have we had already.. past Chief of Army/Navy/Airforce that failed in NOL, MRT, ST etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gosh.. stop grooming these goons. Hire people with REAL experience and REAL talent please!</p>

              <p>I think those ministers,including LHL,LKY n GCT are losing control over those Government-link companies CEOs.In foreign countries,Ministers have total control over government sectors or companies CEOs.</p>
              <p>This is to ensure those CEOs dont anyhow manipulate the markets n overprice their products n services,as this will piss off the general public n affect the General Election result,which will overthrow their party in the election.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore,the situation is different.Due to the monopoly of PAP,the PAP ministers simply give those GLC CEOs orders to earn money for them.And these CEOs,due to the fact that they dont participate in General Election,thus,they use every single means,even if thats mean by exploiting money from Singaporeans,to achieve their targets.</p>
              <p>Thus,who will get screwed in the end?Of coz is those PAP ministers,LKY,LHL n GCT.Becoz they didnt control their CEOs well,thats why Singaporeans will screw those stupid PAP ministers.There is a saying"When u are in command,Command!!!".Obviously,those PAP ministers dont know how to command n manage this country.They only know how to bully n exploiting money from their own countrymen n women.PUI!!!</p>

              <p>I am sure some of these retired generals are "talented" in their own right and they probably did well serving in the military.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But how much of their military experience (real or otherwise) is actually relevant to the real corporate world? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
