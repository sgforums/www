            <div class='col-md body'>Given the unhappiness with foreign talent and outsourcing of local services to cheaper economies, would Singaporeans support local businesses and services to keep them local?<br><br>UK customers have managed to pull back some call centre business from India by boycotting banks and businesses that outsource such services. Will you be prepared to pay more for local products rather than one just as good that is made in India or China? Will Singaporeans be prepared to pay more to hire a  local person instead of a foreigner? Will you be prepared to pay higher hospital charges for local nurses and doctors instead of Filippino nurses and doctors from Myanmar? Will you pay higher fees for lecturers from Singapore instead of those from China and India?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think on the contrary, paying MORE to local businesses/industries and services rendered by locals may even help society survive better. Because then locally jobs are available and salaries commensurates with living costs. Still, this isn't a solution because general costs in business operations and public living, will still go up.<br><br>Currently, even though we're paying less, people aren't surviving any better.<br><br>The only concern are that foreign investors may likely take their operations elsewhere for cheaper labour. But then again, with the way things are increasing, even foreign labor here may not be cheap for long.<br><br>The problem I feel has NO solutions. It is because of the way our government is piloting our economy.<br><br>As an example; you putting out a fire by splashing buckets of water at the fire, but they (our gov) are in turn splashing buckets of petroleum at the fire you are trying to put out.<br><br>What they are doing is healthy for the economy and businesses that comes here generating revenues for themselves, while general population toils on and some could merely crawl along in the Rat Race they started.<br><br>It's a snowball effect. It rolls downhill gathering momentum and size, and will only end when it crashes into something and breaks apart. This is what is happening to SIngapore, and will also be happening to China really soon.</div>
