            <div class='col-md body'>"Stamp duty is a tax levied on instruments relating to the purchase or gift of immovable property, mortgages, tenancy or lease of immovable property, and transfer or gift of shares. It contributes towards the government's tax revenue, which is used for spending on Singapore's economic and social development.<br><br>A number of reliefs are available to businesses and individuals. For example, stamp duty relief is currently granted for both transfers of assets between associated companies and amalgamation of companies. In Budget 2005, PM and Minister for Finance announced that the stamp duty above $50 will be remitted so as to provide relief for bona fide aborted transactions. In Budget 2003, it was announced that leases with annual rents not exceeding $1,000 would be exempted from stamp duty from 1 Apr 2003.<br><br>We try to make the collection of stamp duty as convenient as possible, and will be glad to receive feedback on how we can improve the service. The stamp duty on the different instruments are also reviewed and adjusted periodically where necessary."<br><br>MINISTRY OF FINANCE<br></div>
