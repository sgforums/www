Did I tell u to go and die?<br><br>I was merely replying based on what you posted, I merely am just taking your words and throwing back at you.<br><br>It is true that well-educated people don't resort to baseless remarks to win an argument, such as cursing at others to go to their deaths. I was merely just knocking you back to earth since you wanted to take a higher moral ground but your statements said otherwise of you.<br><br>I don't like the elitist attitude, such as yours. You seemed to think that others' pain is just plain whining. That was why I never joined the university's Talent Development Programme, coz I dislike the elitist treatment they got. In my mind, that was the exact thing about the govt. Elitist. Think they are the best, other people are all whiners. And this 'whiner' here refused to join the silly Talent programme though I was invited to, coz I wanted to prove that us common 'whiners' can beat the 'elites' too.<br><br>And hey, you havent' replied to my previous post.<br>I said we should be grateful to our parents. You said you are only grateful to the govt and not to your parents. So dear 'elite', what has happened to your filial piety?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter what, Many voters do not vote against PAP for the sake of anguish. But to recognise their integrity for Chiam and LTK who spent a big part of their lives to serve the people. Therefore if they are to be won over, money is the worst tactic. They must be won by the hearts.<br><br>I still remember hearing that last time UK hospitals tried to recruit local nurses over to work. But none of them left Singapore. To show that the education we have in Singapore is a sucess. Skills can be learnt, but integrity is cultivated.<br><br>I got friends telling me that follow the flow, if don't vote PAP will kena marked etc etc. These are groundless remarks. Anyway, our people are more interested in improving their lives than to dulan some politicians or elites.<br><br>If there're any elites reading around, they must know that to be an elite, they must shoulder the responsibilities. With great power comes great responsibilities. They are not higher than the people they serve but equal. They are not here to be served but to serve.<br><br>The election is over, we should focus on the present government which the majority has choosen and lend them our support. Of course, if the government has done anything wrong, as fellow singaporeans, we must voice out fearlessly and keep an open mind for improvements. There is no perfect government in the world so the government must be open to recognise their mistakes and improve like what Chiam See Tong said 'to find out what's the reason why some people never vote for him and improve himself'. If our present government practices this, our government will be stronger and more bonded with the people.</div>
