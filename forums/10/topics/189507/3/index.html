We should tap and engage this for the good of Singapore." </strong><br><br>This is a far cry from MM LKY's insistence and continued harping by SM GCT that Singapore has a dearth of talented people.<br><br>Unfortunately, PM LKY continued to harp on having a strong mandate - when the percentage of his own votes had dropped despite the prestige of his position as a Leader of the Ruling Party, the Leader of Singapore and leading his GRC Team; and comparing the increase in percentage of ballots received by the corresponding Leaders of the WP and SDA.<br><br>It is totally DIS-INGENIOUS in his <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/207081/1/.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>continued justification</strong></a> of his strong mandate by comparing with - "In other countries, this would be landslide victory. In Singapore, because the government got 66.6 percent nationwide -- well, it is only 55 percent (in Aljunied) but it is quite decisive. It's not like 200 votes or down to counting chads. Because while the American presidency was down to counting a few hundred voters in Florida, here we have out of 160,000, 10 percent is 16,000 -- that's about the number -- I think it's quite decisive."<br><br>This argument is dis-ingenious for the simple fact that DESPITE ALL THE ODDS - with all broadcast and print media under the control of the Ruling Party, and with the political playing field being set up as unlevel as it was during the recent 2006 Elections - the Opposition was able and succeeded to increase votes, took away large chunks of votes from the incumbent party, and struck the imagination of Singaporeans.<br><br>Can this Election be a strong mandate with 37 other Election Wards being UN-CONTESTED and merely WALK-OVERS for the incumbent Parties ?<br></span></div><div class="quote_body">Should we allow 'Walk-over' Constituencies to exist ?<br><br><strong>Why the persistence with this line of crowing ?</strong><br><br>Are we to expect them to push through even more draconian legislations that impinge on the Lives and Rights of Singaporeans ?<br><br>Does a SELF-PROCLAIMED strong mandate allow them a FREE HAND to do as they please in Parliament ?<br><blockquote>Originally posted by tiggersgd:<strong><br>....... in the first place, do u know WP has prior dealings with communism or rather communistic people? and how much do u understand of communism? </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Workers Party had prior dealings with Communism ?<br><br>Where on earth did you dig this part from Singapore's History ?<br><br>If one is to look back at Singapore's political landscape, it was LKY who betted his political future with known Communist Idealists when the PAP was first set up.<br><br>If one is to deride CSJ for usurping the chair of SDP from CST - without even knowing the facts of the situation behind the <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/singapore-democratic-party" rel="nofollow"><strong>SDP incident</strong></a> - then should one deride LKY for ursurping the leadership of the country from one whom he had introduced to David Marshall as the Future Prime Minister of Singapore ?<br><br>For information concerning LKY's introduction of the Future Prime Minister of Singapore to David Marshall, you may wish to re-visit the thread <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183403" rel="nofollow"><strong>Comet in Our Sky ?</strong></a></span><br>[quote]<strong><br>and seriously, ur FEAR voting saying should be thrashed out in ur litter bins. i FEAR more of voting for the likes of CSJ, JBJ, JG etc than in my FEAR of ur saying of PAP's FEAR. </strong><span style="color: darkred;">We should not FEAR anyone or any political party, but we should FEAR the fact that we are surrendering our Singaporean sovereignty to the POWER OF ONE, allowing them to pass legislations that place Singaporean in adverse positions, while advancing their own cause and benefits without further reference to Singaporeans who had placed them in Power.<br><br>If Switzerland had been our model, why did we not follow Swiss manner of National REFERENDUM on important issues that affect the Swiss Agenda ?<br><br>The Swiss Federal Government had diligently and conscientiously referred important national issues to the Swiss Citizens for their approval instead of taking it upon themselves to decide for the nation - on the basis of taking it upon themselves as KNOWING WHAT IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY.<br><br>Do our Leaders seriously know what is best for Singaporeans ?<br><br>The Family Planning of the 1960s is now acknowledged as a disastrous decision by MM LKY, and has resulted in a shrinking population, birth rate that do not replace current numbers, a large ageing population that cannot depend on the Young, Legislations having to be passed to force the Young to look after the Aged.<br><br>Do we need to FEAR individuals, or should we FEAR MORE towards those whom we have elected into Office but now take it upon themselves as having the MANDATE to do as they please ?<br><br>Is this the reason for pushing the false reality of a 'strong mandate' ? </span><br><br></strong></div>

You missed what the original poster was trying to say. He is saying that if graduates behave like that, it is way too embarassing.<br><br>Which is what I am getting at.<br><br>So my post is not targetted at you, but back to the original attitude of "if you vote for opposition, terrorist will attack Singapore, etc". Who ever knows what will happen? Perhaps the opposition can do better?<br><br>Much I understand of communism. Chinese history is something I am very interested of, and yes, I know WP had prior dealings with communism. But anyway, that's besides the point.<br><br>I summarize again.<br>1. Just coz we here support the opposition doesn't mean we are against the govt.<br>2. If opposition gets more seats in parliament, doesn't equal increased risk of terrorism or lapses in security of Singapore. That is already out of the point argument.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

why am i not surprised?<br></strong><br><br>you must be joking, cash or otherwise, how much can the average Russian afford compared to his American counterpart?  apart from the rich oil barons, most Russians, especially those living outside of Moscow are poor peasants.  the per capita GDP of Russians is merely a quarter those of the Americans.  surely you know that?<br><br><strong><br>on land masses - it is ultra important. why do u think singapore reclaim most of the land in the east, north-east and some parts of the west and also islands outside of mainland singapore?<br></strong><br><br>depends on your purpose.  it is important only when you don't have enough of it and that you are not content with what you already have ...<br><br><strong><br>dreaming? don't let me stop ur sweet dreams then. dream on...<br></strong><br><br>strange isn't it?  talking to you in my dreams?  are we in the same dream?<br><br><strong><br>my logic is that you can't compare population sizes to land mass sizes.<br></strong><br><br>i quote what you wrote earlier:<br><br>"above all countries u have stated still have bigger land masses than singapore. ... population sizes for them will be larger than singapore, if given time for procreation from their own people."<br><br>so you are indeed comparing population sizes to land masses.<br><br><strong><br>we're limited in land mass and so how much can we squeeze in singapore? take a look at jakarta...they're overcrowding there and yet more people are flooding into that city. if you don't know my logic behind, just ask. don't have to assume and make more mistakes. didn't you learn this in school?<br></strong><br><br>why in the first place would we have the desire to squeeze so many people in our small island?  as it is, it is already quite densely populated.  indonesians are not only flocking to jarkarta.  they are finding ways and means to get to singapore, malaysia, japan ... to find a better living.  the flow of people from countryside to the cities happens everywhere where there is poverty, like China.<br><br><strong><br>if alot of people in this forum is from overseas, then are you the representatives or the president of this people to speak up for them? duh...speak for yourself.<br></strong><br><br>i may not be their president, that does not mean i cannot refer to their comments.  speaking for myself doesn't mean i have to restrict to my own experiences.<br><br><strong><br>for taiwan to have more melons, well, all i can say is that they can eat more, produce more and export more? they're already talking about exporting to mainland china with their fruits...only. is this not an addition to their GDP? even if its minimal?<br></strong><br><br>"even if its minimal" - that's the thing, it is merely minimal and if taiwanese were to have to depend on their melons for a living they would not have become the rich nation they are today.<br><br><strong><br>your past post states your kind of reaction. maybe you want to read again? if you think i have reacted strongly then there's nothing i can say. because my replies to you is in no way unfair...they're truth and facts. a matter of whether you can accept it or otherwise. face value or otherwise, let me repeat, if you can't take it with facts and truth then what's it called? face value? yeah, right. and may i ask what facts and truths you have presented? i have stated and countered most of your so-call facts and truth with real life experiences. you? melons in taiwan? hahaha...<br></strong><br><br>if you refer back to my history, you would realise that i have had long debates with many people.  i broadly categorise them into two types.  one type are the real gentlemen, who acknowledge a good rebuttal when they see one.  the other type is the sore loser type who resorts to name calling or silly taunts like "are you dreaming?".  so reacting strongly really is a mirror on yourself.  for you can't instigate a fight without desiring to fight can you?<br><br>despite being based on truths and facts, the logic that you're trying to support with these truths and facts are a little bit weak and that was what i was trying to point out.  you have presented facts like taiwan is bigger than singapore, but it doesn't explain why our per capita GDPs are pretty similar.  i have no problems with you presenting facts, but if the facts don't support your argument, i don't see why i can't point them out to you.  the "hahaha" again points to the latter category of people i was referring to ...<br><br><strong><br>regarding JG's case, if the taxi driver tells you he doesn't believe and thinks its over-rated and you take it...is that called face value? hmmm...facts and footage has been shown on TV. he is caught red-handed and what more is there to say?<br></strong><br><br>yes you have presented facts, but where is the interpretation of those facts?  PM Lee mentioned during his election that he is out to "fix" the opposition.  captured on TV as well.  fact as well.  what do we make of it?  he is a hooligan?  his primary concern is to "fix" his opponents?  is the JG case a good example of his "fixing" the opposition?<br><br>the facts are:<br>1) he demanded his document from the elections department<br>2) he says if his document is not found, they are going to be in trouble<br>3) he was talking to three persons<br><br>1) there is nothing wrong with (1) in and of itself.  he thought he submitted his form.  he asked for it.  they don't have it.  oops, he made a mistake.  why insist he is doing it deliberately when he has already said he forgot?  how do you prove that he knew he still had the document with him at the time when he asked for it?  if you can't, you cannot make the case that he deliberately tried to fool the elections department and in doing so, tried to smear the latter.<br><br>2) again this in and of itself is a general statement.  it is indeed true that if the elections department did lose his document, they are going to have some explanation to make.  now can we therefore infer that this is a threat?  was his tone of voice loud?  was he very angwee?  did he shout?  who is to say he said it as a threat and not as it is?  PM Lee said he had to "fix" his opponents.  was that a threat?  so if i have the mandate from heaven i can threaten in whatever i like and be given the benefit of doubt?  if i don't have the mandate from heaven, that benefit of doubt is taken away from me?  if i have the mandate from heaven, even if i uttered words that might be construed to be threatening, a simple sorry is enough to clear me of any doubts.  but if i don't have the mandate from heaven, sorry no cure?<br><br>3) he was speaking to three persons.  he could be referring to these three persons as being in trouble.  on what basis do we extrapolate that conversation to the whole elections department and on what basis do we extrapolate to the entire election process?  takes stretching imagination a little too far for common sense isn't it?<br><br><strong><br>coming from someone who says he believes in facts and truths and thought about what is being told...seriously, i am having other views of you and especially your integrity.<br></strong><br><br>for someone who interprets facts skewedly, you have no right to comment about integrity.<br><br><strong><br>"virtual slave in singapore?" well, put it this way, i am free to enter and leave singapore as i wish. am i a slave to the country? i don't think so.<br></strong><br><br>i am born here, this is my country, i have a vested interest here.  there are certain freedoms that i deserve not only as a citizen but as someone borne and bred here.  you take that away from me, or make it difficult for me to pursue what i want, then you are subjecting me to slavery in that sense.<br><br><strong><br>and with your kind of thinking, no wonder we can be a "slave" country.<br></strong><br><br>the worst kind of slave is one who doesn't know he is one ...<br><br><strong><br>as for Li Ao's sayings...you are still subscribing to that? hahaha. i don't and never will. stupid is he who thinks he is and being told he is. face value indeed.<br></strong><br><br>he has yet to clarify what he meant exactly, but i have a feeling he is referring to people like you.<br><br><strong><br>as a man thinks (in his heart and mind), so is he (in that state of heart and mind).<br></strong><br><br>so too as a man speaks ...<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your comments are fair enough.<br><br>I do wish to see credible opposition in parliament, not jokers like CSJ. However, I guess you have to also remember that given the way PAP snuffs out opposition, it is real difficult for an opposition party member to make much headways.<br><br>Coupled with a biased press, limited resources, etc, their job is made much tougher.<br><br>What I can't tolerate is that PAP seems to think PAP  = govt. Therefore, they can dangle the govt's money during elections and tempt people to vote for them.<br><br>In the first place, PAP is NOT the govt. I look upon such dangling of govt's money as abuse of the people's money.<br><br>The other thing is, our govt has outsourced transport, education (moving towards that), healthcare, etc. So what else are they doing? Where is our money going to? There is limited transparency to where I Can see our expenditure is.<br><br>I don't want such a govt. Remember the NKF saga, if the entire govt is controlled by one party, sooner or later, the corruption will spread. What I wish for is for someone outside the family (PAP), such as in corporations where it is a rule you must hire external auditors to audit your accounts.<br><br>This is then truly a check on the govt, not silly SM Goh's idea of asking internal MPs to check themselves (that CANNOT work)<br><br>Give the opposition a chance. People like Low Thia Kiang and Sylvia are impressive.
