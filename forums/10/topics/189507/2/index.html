But to recognise their integrity for Chiam and LTK who spent a big part of their lives to serve the people. Therefore if they are to be won over, money is the worst tactic. They must be won by the hearts.<br><br>I still remember hearing that last time UK hospitals tried to recruit local nurses over to work. But none of them left Singapore. To show that the education we have in Singapore is a sucess. Skills can be learnt, but integrity is cultivated.<br><br>I got friends telling me that follow the flow, if don't vote PAP will kena marked etc etc. These are groundless remarks. Anyway, our people are more interested in improving their lives than to dulan some politicians or elites.<br><br>If there're any elites reading around, they must know that to be an elite, they must shoulder the responsibilities. With great power comes great responsibilities. They are not higher than the people they serve but equal. They are not here to be served but to serve.<br><br>The election is over, we should focus on the present government which the majority has choosen and lend them our support. Of course, if the government has done anything wrong, as fellow singaporeans, we must voice out fearlessly and keep an open mind for improvements. There is no perfect government in the world so the government must be open to recognise their mistakes and improve like what Chiam See Tong said 'to find out what's the reason why some people never vote for him and improve himself'. If our present government practices this, our government will be stronger and more bonded with the people.</div></blockquote>clap clap...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one more thing, she said we who support opposition often nitpick at other people's words. Instead of focusing on the issues, we nitpick on words used by the govt.<br><br>In the 1st place, when we elect someone to represent us, obviously, whatever words he or she uses during speeches, etc, IS IMPORTANT. imagine, getting someone up there, who sprouts vulgarities at others. Diplomacy is all about using the right words.<br><br>Coming back to her statement, I believe PAP also nitpicks at the opposition parties words. So why din she see this?<br><br>Anyway, I may not be that objective a person, but I believe I am more objective than you burgerqueen, and I never go around cursing at others to go to their deaths.<br><br>Once again, I say this with heavy hitting words.

PAP had grabed most of the businesses in Singapore.  I believe this was part of their strategy in politics to control singaporeans.  If you were to be working in gov sectors or directly in GLC or GIC or tomasick.....or indirectly with all the above.  Would you vote against PAP?</div>
