            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, attended a talk given by Sylvia Lim, Chairwomen of WP in NTU yesterday. Just want to share my personal opinion of her based on it.<br><br>I think among the oppositions speech that I have attended so far, she is one of the more practical and witty one. However, I do feel that she is a bit of a slow warmer, as in the first ten minutes or so of her talk, she appears to be uneasy and is even a bit repelling in terms of her body language. But once the mingle starts and the setting becomes more informal, she becomes a lot more friendly and charismatic. I think this might let her down in election campaign because I feel that she is still unable to handle large formal crowds. And also, being a slow warmer, she might lose the precious first impression when she steps onto a stage. She might do better if she engage one of those image consultants that specialise in packaging politicians and teach them the "correct" body languages. Not sure if we have those in Singapore though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must say that she is one hell of a character. Not many people are willing to stand up for their believes in this country and amongst those who are willing to, only a handful possess the pragmatism and sensibility of Sylvia Lim. Of course it might take her a while to go head to head in terms of political articulation with the likes of the MM and the SM (who are political bulwarks in their own right), but from watching her speak, the simplicity and clarity of her message certainly rubs off on her audience. I think she knows, they know, it is going to be a slow and mutable process, but I believe they are realist in the Burkian tradition to understand that all which needs to be done, has to be done - in a slow yet pragmatic fashion.</div>

So their lecturers don't go tru MOE. Chee case, I think more likely to be the dean want to unkan bolla rather than he receive order lar. Cause NUS independent too. In fact both NUS and NTU invited quite a few people affiliated with the opposition to teach too. You try coming to my school, I tell you, some of my lecturers will make Atobe and Maurizo13 look like MIW supporter in comparison.</div>
