              <p>SINGAPORE - The worst of the global financial crisis is yet to come and<br> a<br>large US bank will fail in the next few months as the world's biggest<br>economy hits further troubles, former IMF chief economist Kenneth<br> Rogoff<br>said on Tuesday.<br><br><br>'The US is not out of the woods. I think the financial crisis is at the<br>halfway point, perhaps. I would even go further to say 'the worst is to<br>come',' he told a financial conference.<br><br><br>'We're not just going to see mid-sized banks go under in the next few<br>months, we're going to see a whopper, we're going to see a big one, one<br> of<br>the big investment banks or big banks,' said Rogoff, who is an<br> economics<br>professor at Harvard University and was the International Monetary<br> Fund's<br>chief economist from 2001 to 2004.<br><br><br>'We have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this<br> is<br>over,' he said, when asked for early signs of an end to the crisis.<br><br><br>'Probably Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - despite what US Treasury<br> Secretary<br>Hank Paulson said - these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not<br> going<br>to exist in their present form in a few years.'<br><br><br>Mr Rogoff's comments come as investors dumped shares of the largest US<br> home<br>funding companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Monday after a<br> newspaper<br>report said government officials may have no choice but to effectively<br>nationalise the US housing finance titans.<br><br><br>A government move to recapitalise the two companies by injecting funds<br>could wipe out existing common stock holders, the weekend Barron's<br> story<br>said. Preferred shareholders and even holders of the two<br>government-sponsored entities' US$19 billion of subordinated debt would<br>also suffer losses.<br><br><br>Mr Rogoff said multi-billion dollar investments by sovereign wealth<br> funds<br>from Asia and the Middle East in western financial firms may not<br>necessarily result in large profits because they had not taken into<br> account<br>the broader market conditions that the industry faces.<br><br><br>'There was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds<br>could save everybody. Investment banks did something stupid, they lost<br>money in the sub-prime, they're great buys, sovereign wealth funds come<br> in<br>and make a lot of money by buying them.<br><br><br>'That view neglects the point that the financial system has become very<br>bloated in size and needed to shrink,' Mr Rogoff told the conference in<br>Singapore, whose wealth funds GIC and Temasek have invested billions in<br>Merrill Lynch and Citigroup In response to the sharp US housing<br>retrenchment and turmoil in credit markets, the US Federal Reserve has<br>reduced interest rates by a cumulative 3.25 percentage points to 2 per<br> cent<br>since mid-September.<br><br><br>Mr Rogoff said the US Federal Reserve was wrong to cut interest rates<br> as<br>'dramatically' as it did.<br><br><br>'Cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the<br> next<br>few years in the United States.'</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Chee Soon Juan is fighting among other things, for this, by demonstrating peacefully on the streets because the other avenues, like the mass media is not available for criticising the despots.</span></strong></p>

              if you ask me, i rather support Potong Pasir's Mr. Chiam See Tong or Hougang's Low Thia Khiang. (all my life i've been living in the opposition territory. living in Potong Pasir Blk 115 for 18 years and shifted to Hougang till now) 
                      
              At least they don't get themselves into trouble with the government and expect us to bail them out with our hard earned money. they have already squeezed us so dry, you want us to donate to Dr. Chee? i know you will say support him to get our money back but i don't see how it is possible. 
                      
              he will never become a MP, don't say Prime Minister like Anwar who have SO MANY SUPPORTERS that really supports him. he has a political party that supports him, he has political power because he was so close to become PM of Malaysia. He has experience and he knows how to play. Dr. Chee on the other hand, has no such experience. how is he going to lessen our load and burden and "get our money back"
              
              i have nothing against him. i do feel for him, really... that he has to bear the brute of the government's oppression but he should have played it wisely first. the screaming and name calling should not happen. even if he becomes a certain MP, what can he do? the numbers do not favour him. a bill will pass even without his support or his objection. he cannot change anything. so why are we donating to him when we should donate more to those who really needs it.
                      
              the poor, the oppressed, the orphans, the cancer patients, the charities (yes yes, they all embezzle money but still better right?), even the zoos need donations. Wildlife conservations need your donations to keep the Pandas, tigers, sharks and bees in healthy numbers! (it is theoried that without bees, our eco-system cannot survive more than 2 years for they are the very backbone of plants and agriculture reproduction. SAVE THE BEES! not kidding, read up on bees conservation efforts)

              <p>as long as they are not broke, these investment are not write off, just paper lost. frankly, i am not sure what kind of conditions when temasek, GIC invested in merril lynch. if i dont remember wrongly, it is not tied to the fix share price at time of purchase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my concern is what if they are broke? i think temasek and GIC jump at the opportunity too soon. the koreans and Chinese have recently rejected to buy some shit from lehmann. that pretty smart. wait and see attitude. would rather make less then to lose everything!.</p>
