              <p>With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to blame Temasek for being reckless and blowing a big hole. To be fair, Temasek bought heavily into heavily discounted foreign bank shares when the financial crisis was happening. The situation was very fluid at that time and the crisis could go either way i.e recover or continue worsening. It is reasonable to assume at that time that with massive US and European government bank bailouts and support, the problem could be contained and turned around.  Unfortunately it got worse.</p>
              <p>If you look at history of financial crisis, they all recover eventually. It's a matter of when. I think Temasek made the wrong call by thinking that the subprime crisis was temporary and underestimated the severity of the problem. It turned out that the subprime crisis is  the tip of the iceberg - it triggered a tsunami of global financial meltdowns that was unprecedented in recent history. The fund managers at Temasek probably never experienced such a financial meltdown in their lifetimes ( they are grew up in the boom years).    </p>

              <p>The portfolio mix is determined by Temasek's investment policy. If every sector is going down, then even if Temasek invest 10% in financials and 90% in other sectors, the loss will be just as great. I can give two reasons why Temasek is overweight in financials.</p>
              <p>1. The shares they bought were once blue chip high quality banking stocks. They are also protected and supported by foreign governments. So the chances of these companies going bust are slim. ie. the risk is of losing it all is actually less compared to companies like ABC learning which shares are worthless now.</p>
              <p>2. The prices of the banking shares are selling at huge discounts. Never have the prices plunged to these low levels in recent history and it is a window of opportunity to pick up these shares for a song. Temasek is taking a huge gamble but it is a calculated risk. Warren Buffet, one of the world most successful investor once said, "When everyone is greedy, be fearful. When everyone is fearful, be greedy". Temasek is following that doctrine and I think they will be vindicated when the markets eventually recover, maybe in a few years time.</p>
              <p>About admitting mistakes, it is very hard for  Ho Ching to do it. You see the PAP and govt related companies are run by very intellegent and highly educated people.But they suffer from one big weakness. That is, they cannot accept the fact that they can be wrong because all their lives, they have used their intelligence to solve and overcome complex problems. This gave them the illusion that by using logic, they can figure out the markets and beat the system. Unfortunately the markets are very often illogical and that is where they will be caught flat footed. Which also explains why they have no regrets because they are still convinced they are right and somehow the markets and everyone else got it wrong.</p>
              <p>The irony of it is, they will be right eventually. Temasek is holding on to paper losses from these financial shares. So long as they don't realise the loss, they will make it back one day because the markets will NOT be down forever. Markets are cyclical. Booms follow busts and the cycle starts again. That is what they meant by investing for  the long term.</p>

              <p>The portfolio mix is determined by Temasek's investment policy.
                          If every sector is going down, then even if Temasek invest 10% in
                          financials and 90% in other sectors, the loss will be just as
                          great. I can give two reasons why Temasek is overweight in
                          financials.</p>
              <p>1. The shares they bought were once blue chip high quality
                          banking stocks. They are also protected and supported by foreign
                          governments. So the chances of these companies going bust are slim.
                          ie. the risk is of losing it all is actually less compared to
                          companies like ABC learning which shares are worthless now.</p>
              <p>2. The prices of the banking shares are selling at huge
                          discounts. Never have the prices plunged to these low levels in
                          recent history and it is a window of opportunity to pick up these
                          shares for a song. Temasek is taking a huge gamble but it is a
                          calculated risk. Warren Buffet, one of the world most successful
                          investor once said, "When everyone is greedy, be fearful. When
                          everyone is fearful, be greedy". Temasek is following that doctrine
                          and I think they will be vindicated when the markets eventually
                          recover, maybe in a few years time.</p>
              <p>About admitting mistakes, it is very hard for  Ho Ching to
                          do it. You see the PAP and govt related companies are run by very
                          intellegent and highly educated people.But they suffer from one big
                          weakness. That is, they cannot accept the fact that they can be
                          wrong because all their lives, they have used their intelligence to
                          solve and overcome complex problems. This gave them the illusion
                          that by using logic, they can figure out the markets and beat the
                          system. Unfortunately the markets are very often illogical and that
                          is where they will be caught flat footed. Which also explains why
                          they have no regrets because they are still convinced they are
                          right and somehow the markets and everyone else got it wrong.</p>
              <p>The irony of it is, they will be right eventually. Temasek is
                          holding on to paper losses from these financial shares. So long as
                          they don't realise the loss, they will make it back one day because
                          the markets will NOT be down forever. Markets are cyclical. Booms
                          follow busts and the cycle starts again. That is what they meant by
                          investing for  the long term.</p>

              <p>Its true all sectors would go down but of a different extent. SPH or SMRT may decline 20% but financial stocks like DBS has declined up to 66%.

              <p>now.. back to this topic started by another who has buried his head in the sand.. how the hell does he figure Singapore doesn't know how dark the world is?</p>

              <p>Oops. I'm confused. Could you please enlighten me on the definition of a PAP defender? And is a PAP defender the same thing as a PAP mole?</p>
              <p>What is MIW, CSJ?</p>

              <p>Basically supporting everything the PAP say or do, with emphasis on "everything". Though  it's more of a label than accurately describing anyone. No one really does that here.</p>
              <p>Depends, to some individuals it's the same thing.</p>
              <p>MIW i'm not too sure. Don't understand why Bear use it over the PAP or government.  </p>
              <p>CSJ is Chee Soon Juan</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The portfolio mix is
                      determined by Temasek's investment policy. If every sector is going
                      down, then even if Temasek invest 10% in financials and 90% in
                      other sectors, the loss will be just as great. I can give two
                      reasons why Temasek is overweight in financials.</em></span></p>
              <p>Its true all sectors would go down but of a different extent.
                      SPH or SMRT may decline 20% but financial stocks like DBS has
                      declined up to 66%. Temasek in my opinion has violated the
                      principles of diversification and has taken <span style="color: #ff0000;">disproportionate risks</span> by overinvesting in
                      the financial sector</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">About admitting mistakes, it
                      is very hard for  Ho Ching to do it. You see the PAP and govt
                      related companies are run by very intellegent and highly educated
                      people.But they suffer from one big weakness. That is, they cannot
                      accept the fact that they can be wrong because all their lives,
                      they have used their intelligence to solve and overcome complex
                      problems. This gave them the illusion that by using logic, they can
                      figure out the markets and beat the system. Unfortunately the
                      markets are very often illogical and that is where they will be
                      caught flat footed. Which also explains why they have no regrets
                      because they are still convinced they are right and somehow the
                      markets and everyone else got it wrong.</span></em></p>
              <p>PAP is used to having their way. They <span style="color: #000000;">can insist they are right after making a mistake
                      because they control the newspaper,the TV and information from
                      various  govt agencies.</span> The worry is that one day when
                      PAP makes a big mistake and opposition voice is drown out in the
                      parliament like the recent Job Credit Scheme, we may in for even
                      bigger financial diasters.</p>

              <p>I do not claim to know the reasons behind Temasek's decisions in overinvesting in the financial sector but I am guessing it could be like this:</p>
              <p>Say you have two blue chip companies like SPH and DBS. Both are well run profitable companies and you are neutral to choosing either. Normally to spread your risks, you buy 50% in SPH and 50% in DBS. But what if the price of DBS drops 3 times the price of SPH. It is seen as a bigger bargain and better value. Would you buy more of DBS then? In the case of Temasek, they decided it is worth the disproportinate risks because the returns are going to be much higher when the markets recover. Are they right in their decisons. Let the market judge. So far in the short term they are wrong. But we have to also judge them over the long term and let history decide if they are right or wrong.</p>

              <p>The question you have to ask is why is PAP having their way. Who voted them in every election? The American people voted Bush and realised their big mistake and booted him out. Are Sporeans willing to do the same thing? The choice is yours.</p>
