            <div class='col-md body'>Essay on business and engineering. 3 parts.<br>1) Business, accounting,computers<br>2) Electrical eng.<br>3) quality eng. management.<br><br>The integration of BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING and COMPUTERS<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>What is the nature of a business?<br>ANS:<br>An organisation that provides a service or product to<br>the client and that the transaction may give itself a profit.<br><br>What is the difference between a service-based business and a product<br>based business?<br>ANS:<br>1) Service-based business can be customer-service oriented.<br>Eg. Providing information over the phone, delivering of goods, repair of<br>equipment<br><br>2)A product business usually has an inventory that receives stock<br>from suppliers. It also has an operations side that sells the stock,<br>assemble/modify stock for use. Eg. restaurants, insurance, retail,<br>fish &amp; meat, marketshop-house. Sometimes it provides services not<br>related<br>to the business, eg. Asking the shopowner for an exchange of coins.<br><br>How does accounting relate to business?<br>ANS:<br>Accounting records information of expenditure, credit, debit,<br>capital and liabilities. It shows a business's performance.<br>This information is useful to the business organisation and to<br>government bodies that it must report to. Eg. Company Income tax Body.<br><br>What is Computing?<br>ANS:<br>The input and process of information by a dedicated device and its<br>delivery<br>and presentation to the user. Eg. Computer, Cash register, handphone<br>etc.<br><br>How has computers affect accounting?<br>ANS:<br>Traditionally, accounting is done by calculators and notes<br>written on recordbooks. Computers is a way to deliver<br>the information to another location. It also processes business<br>information<br>to provide brief, accurate reports.<br><br>How is computing used in any business?<br>ANS:<br>1) Administration/Sales<br>2) Engineering/Production<br>3) Critical data<br><br>1) In any service-based business, one can see extensive usage of<br>computers eg. in electronic cash-registers, a whole armada of<br>office-workers<br>behind computer desks and phonecalls.<br><br>2) Computing affects eng/production with these tools:<br>Rapid prototyping, PLC/SCADA, electro-mechanical automation.<br>These tools are used to test product design and manufacturing<br>processes.<br><br>3) The use of phones, recorders, radiosets especially to request for<br>exact information. (in scenes like emergency rooms, underground ops,<br>supplychain)<br><br>Electrical Engineering (EE)<br>----------------------------------<br>What is EE?<br>ANS: It is an applied science, a study in some polytechnics and has<br>a profound influence on urban life.<br><br>What does it involve?<br>ANS: It starts off with power delivery, distribution, and also<br>components,<br>systems and information technology.<br><br>How is it an applied science?<br>ANS: Alot of modern day products and devices uses electricity. How<br>they are safe and reliable involves design and economic usage of parts.<br>This is a role taken up by electrical engineers.<br><br>What does a study of EE involve?<br>Electrical Engineering graduates need to study<br>basic electrical circuits, electronics, design, power protection, PLCs<br>and mechanical interaction.<br><br>What does an electrical engineering project involve?ANS:<br>It could be a Programmable Logic Relay project or a electronics<br>circuitboard<br>or a computer software or a product-material research/study.<br>The tools used could be statistics, interviews, and documentation.<br>The mode of presentation can involve website displays that show<br>'live' product performance.<br><br>How is EE related to ELECTRONICS eng.?<br>Electronics focuses on op-amps, transistors, diodes, design and<br>performance<br>of TVs, COMPUTERS, hardware and software.<br>EE focuses on INSTALLATION and SAFETY INSURANCE such as<br>lighting appliances, datacable fixtures etc.<br><br>What is PLC?ANS:<br>PLC stands for programmable logic controller. It is a tool<br>used to control traffic lights, MRT trains, robots, etc.<br>It is often linked with SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition.<br><br>That is a tool often used in factories to supervise manufacturing<br>processes.<br>Programs are written into the PLC machine through a PLC controller.<br>The machine then processes the program and shows the results.<br><br>Where is EE most profound?<br>ANS:<br>It is a science that involves other disciplines. If we look at around<br>us,<br>alot of our lifestyle is made possible through EE.<br><br>For eg. To have a proper apartment, materials must be made<br>to fit and proper for use in accordance with housing regulations.<br>The wires chosen must be of correct rating and the mechanical<br>parts(eg. armatures, housings, cableboxes) must fit exactly.<br><br>Their behaviour must relate to each other in such a way<br>that there is a form of 'distinguishment'. This distinguishment<br>is for safety purposes. Eg. Enough gap inside a socket-housing<br><br>Airconditioners are made through electrical and mechanical<br>eng. but are repaired by people well-versed in gases and fluids.<br><br>What skill is needed to understand EE?<br>ANS: Understanding of relationships of parts and how they<br>are presented to the user in a cautious way.<br><br>What is javascript?<br>ANS: It is a language used on web-browsers. It processes codes<br>written by programmers. Together with advance languages,<br>they can tell our computer what to do and what to display.<br><br>What has javascript got to do with PLC programming?<br>IMHO they are both the same in rules and methods.<br>Both involve a use of a dedicated device to process<br>the rules(PLC machine and the Browser).<br><br>Both involve the usage of rules to get<br>1) User variables/input<br>2) User expectations.<br><br>Whereas PLC programming/SCADA runs stored programs<br>to control remote lights, machines, sensors located far away, the same<br>behaviour<br>goes for web-browsers: local browsers running codes stored<br>in servers and remote PCs in other countries.<br><br>Their only difference is that<br>1) PLC/SCADA serves the organisation requirements and is founded on<br>"CONTROL"<br>2) Web-browsers/handheld netdevices serves the user interests and is<br>founded on "FREEDOM"<br><br>How the two relate to each other is best found in<br>Space Satellites. There over 24 man-made satellites in outerspace<br>rotating<br>around Earth. They deliver information to and fro. When a<br>satellite receives continental information, it activates its PLC<br>program-turning<br>on or off the appropriate switches-then the signals are transmitted to<br>another<br>continent. The local device(browser or monitor) thus presents the<br>information.<br><br>Is there a possibility of a webbrowser running a server code to<br>activate: say my TV/RADIO/SHOWER and lights?<br>ANS:All this is very possible and is actually happening. Such a system<br>is very expensive<br>but i think BILL GATES'S HOUSE got such a thing.<br><br>Is it profitable to sell such a system?<br>Unless it becomes a way of life, IMHO i think it would produce only<br>marginal profits.<br><br>Foreseable benefits of JAVA cum PLC device:<br>1)Together with advance pollution control techniques, it would reduce<br>AIR POLLUTION<br>2)and improve SAFETY<br><br>Benefits to URBAN society<br>1) Improved interaction among house-trapped citizens<br>2) Reduced traffice movement.<br>3) Demand of programming literacy will rise<br><br>Nature of quality engineering &amp; management<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>What is quality?<br>Quality is about providing customer satisfaction such as getting good<br>reviews of service/product and reducing complains and also the running<br>of<br>smooth operations within the company.<br><br>I have seen companies stating they are quality class. What does it mean?<br><br>It means their company has the procedures and measures<br>to run their business according to a set of rules.<br><br>What are these set of rules?<br>The ISO 9000 series is a popular one. usually conformance to these<br>rules provide the company with an award. In the US, the award is know as<br>MALCOLM BALDRIDGE and in Japan, the DEMING prize.<br>In Singapore, the Productivity &amp; Standards Board(PSB) administer these<br>rules<br>for local companies.<br><br>Why should quality be related to engineering?<br>1) Safety. A well designed engineered product passes the safety test.<br>It is used and sold extensively in world-markets.<br>2) Performance: Solid performance shows the dedication of the people<br>involved.<br><br>How does engineering relate to Management?<br>Management serves to guide the organisation as a whole.<br>Engineering prepares the service or product for sale and use.<br>Management makes sure this product gets to the right person<br>and at the right time and price.<br><br>How is quality related to management?<br>A good quality management programme improves employee morale.<br>Reduced costs. More bonuses.<br><br>Can an organisation survive by a quality mark?<br>No. It must continously improve its ideas, retrain people and improve<br>methods<br>for survival. It needs the right people to take on the work.<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>28 July 2001 - Liew Kian Boon, Lawrence - SINGAPORE</div>
