              <p> managing director of a company  i worked in spore  was from bangladesh.in the past when he was still an engineer,he claimed he worked in germany etc.he walked around high tech factory as a software engineer.didnt really see him do much of anything but he liked to scold people.i was also dealing and programming software but unlike him i could do it faster and efficiently as well as way cheaper.think i didnt clobber him ...come to think of it, i didnt see him do anything except lecturing and walking in his suit and doing stuff i also could do in software side.he didnt do much except write letters and walked around scolding taiwanese customers and factory.</p>
              <p>when the usa software programmers came from the states , they claimed that software was altered and some machine functions was altered by the bangldesh engineerand that was the reason why facilty couldnt work at times during hardware system switchover.and thats why singaporean engineers had to rush in and try to do a manual system change.the bangladesh enginner altered the software without informing anyone.and he was kept on the job instead of getting fired and in the end become manager by scolding everyone he saw.</p>
              <p>meanwhile i was forced to do hardware stuff instead of dealing with software i was familiar with.as he werked in germany in the past mainly had notoriously outdated software programs he wanted badly at all cost to deal with the software i was trained and familiar in.....too bad the manageing director at that time was a stupid singaporean from NTU.and he kept giving him accolades.i dont know why he needed people like those.....all the hardware was done by me...the software was written in the usa .....and he cant talk chinese to taiwanese factory managers when there was a problem..........so he was promoted basically because he could write a good letter in english.</p>
              <p>I SEE NO HOPE FOR SINGAPORE NOT ONLY DUE TO FAULT OF GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO DUE TO ITS SUPPOSEDLY EDUCATED CITIZENS WHO CANT REALLY DO THINGS EFFECTIVELY AND EVEN THINK STRAIGHT AND METHODICALLY.thus promoting lower ranking rubbish to higher rank.</p>
              <p>FOR WHAT ITS ALL WORTH...I DONT SEE MUCH HOPE IN SINGAPORE AS IT TAKES 2 TO CLAP AS THEY SAY.</p>

              <p>In the future, the rules will be much stricter. All sorts of signs &amp;
               new ways to fine will be up. The streets will be very clean, &amp; the 
              buildings will be well maintain. More 'number one' airports, events will
               grace Singapore &amp; put us at the top of the world, BUT it is all 
              skin deep. Problems are brewing inside but Nobody, especially 
              visitors/tourists can see it. <br> <br> You will start to see different groups of people not mingling together 
              because of the over-import of foreigners. Communications are difficult 
              because different people from different countries do not understand each
               other. China-Chinese, India-Indians, Fillipinos etc stay away from each
               other, occupying huge areas in Singapore. etc Little India, Chinatown, 
              Geylang etc.<br> <br><span> Crime will definitely rise, &amp; despite control, sleazy activties are 
              highly active. Conflicts happen here &amp; there, &amp; small riots 
              starts to happen around Singapore. Groups of foreigners from the same 
              country will united, &amp; huge group will be form. Clashes with another
               group from another different country will cause major chaos. With 
              strikes/riots/fights/injur</span></p>
              <div>ies
               &amp; even deaths. It will be unsafe to walk alone in the streets at 
              night. Majority of the rich Singaporeans have migrated, leaving the much
               poorer ones struggling to find a job while the need to serve the 
              country. (NS, reservist etc)<br> <br><span> As the population grows, housing prices is sky-high, &amp; each unit is 
              getting smaller. More people will be force to sleep in the streets/parks
               as their CPF can’t afford HDBs &amp; the almost non-exist salary goes 
              to the family/kids/food/transport</span><span> fees. Jobs are in demand. Not only Singaporeans will get replaced by 
              Foreigners, but even foreigners will be replace by newly imported 
              foreigners. People will lose their jobs as companies are going to look 
              for cheaper workers/sources. Those Foreigners who used to work in top 
              companies gets retrench, &amp; they will start to compete with average 
              Singaporeans for jobs such as clerks/accountants/operato</span>rs etc.<br> <br> GST will hit 10% &amp; all sorts of fares will rise. Buses &amp; MRTs 
              will be more expensive, yet always crowded due to large amount of 
              foreigners, peak hours or not. It will be common when a person need to 
              wait for an average of 2-3 train/bus before he can aboard. The road will
               always be jammed &amp; they will add more ERPs to “solve the problem.<br> <br> School subjects will start to get tougher. Kids need to learn &amp; know
               all sorts of useless stuffs, which 80% of the knowledge learned aren’t 
              need at work. The stress from schools/parents will causes more suicidal 
              cases, bullying, &amp; unstable minds. People will start to become more 
              selfish &amp; uncaring due to the system here. Kids from other countries
               studied here, sponsored, once fully educated &amp; after they complete 
              their studies/bonds, they will leave Singapore, laughing at our 
              stupidity.<br> <br> Aging population will become a major problem here as the importing of 
              foreigners to become Singapore citizens system failed terribly. Most 
              foreigners earned enough &amp; leave the country or gave up their PR 
              status, going back to their own country to enjoy life, build houses 
              &amp; get married. They come, they ‘robbed’, they go. <br> <br> Last but not least, the value of our Singapore citizenship will drop 
              drastically as it seems like almost everyone/anyone can get a PR, then 
              gave them up once they gain what they want or use it to jump over to USA
               or European countries. Other countries will start to notice &amp; they 
              will start to imply Visa system for Singaporeans. We are screwed.</div>

              <p>In the future, the rules will be much stricter. All sorts of signs &amp; new ways to fine will be up. The streets will be very clean, &amp; the buildings will be well maintain. More 'number one' airports, events will grace Singapore &amp; put us at the top of the world, BUT it is all skin deep. Problems are brewing inside but Nobody, especially visitors/tourists can see it.<br><br>You will start to see different groups of people not mingling together because of the over-import of foreigners. Communications are difficult because different people from different countries do not understand each other. China-Chinese, India-Indians, Fillipinos etc stay away from each other, occupying huge areas in Singapore. etc Little India, Chinatown, Geylang etc.<br><br><span>Crime will definitely rise, &amp; despite control, sleazy activties are highly active. Conflicts happen here &amp; there, &amp; small riots starts to happen around Singapore. Groups of foreigners from the same country will united, &amp; huge group will be form. Clashes with another group from another different country will cause major chaos. With strikes/riots/fights/injur</span></p>
              <div>ies &amp; even deaths. It will be unsafe to walk alone in the streets at night. Majority of the rich Singaporeans have migrated, leaving the much poorer ones struggling to find a job while the need to serve the country. (NS, reservist etc)<br><br><span>As the population grows, housing prices is sky-high, &amp; each unit is getting smaller. More people will be force to sleep in the streets/parks as their CPF can’t afford HDBs &amp; the almost non-exist salary goes to the family/kids/food/transport</span> <span>fees. Jobs are in demand. Not only Singaporeans will get replaced by Foreigners, but even foreigners will be replace by newly imported foreigners. People will lose their jobs as companies are going to look for cheaper workers/sources. Those Foreigners who used to work in top companies gets retrench, &amp; they will start to compete with average Singaporeans for jobs such as clerks/accountants/operato</span>rs etc.<br><br>GST will hit 10% &amp; all sorts of fares will rise. Buses &amp; MRTs will be more expensive, yet always crowded due to large amount of foreigners, peak hours or not. It will be common when a person need to wait for an average of 2-3 train/bus before he can aboard. The road will always be jammed &amp; they will add more ERPs to “solve the problem.<br><br>School subjects will start to get tougher. Kids need to learn &amp; know all sorts of useless stuffs, which 80% of the knowledge learned aren’t need at work. The stress from schools/parents will causes more suicidal cases, bullying, &amp; unstable minds. People will start to become more selfish &amp; uncaring due to the system here. Kids from other countries studied here, sponsored, once fully educated &amp; after they complete their studies/bonds, they will leave Singapore, laughing at our stupidity.<br><br>Aging population will become a major problem here as the importing of foreigners to become Singapore citizens system failed terribly. Most foreigners earned enough &amp; leave the country or gave up their PR status, going back to their own country to enjoy life, build houses &amp; get married. They come, they ‘robbed’, they go.<br><br>Last but not least, the value of our Singapore citizenship will drop drastically as it seems like almost everyone/anyone can get a PR, then gave them up once they gain what they want or use it to jump over to USA or European countries. Other countries will start to notice &amp; they will start to imply Visa system for Singaporeans. We are screwed.</div>

              <p><br>well, i think a person who is able to spend within his means can alway enjoy a good life in Singapore, no one will ever said that money is enuf, even if you ask a billionaires, he/she will say, not enuf.</p>
              <p>So, it all voice down to each and every individual, if you are earning 5k, and like to flirt, gamble, drink, go exotic places to have holidays and fun, you will end up very miserable, the blaming culture here is alway on govt fault, thing expensives, govt, PRC gals cheat them also govt fault, too fat, also govt fault, cannot strike 4D or toto, also govt faults...because that is the best way of stress release. And many failed to look and blame themselves because of ego and pride...living in 3 rooms, complain 5 rooms very expensive, but never said he/she is living in 3 rooms.</p>
              <p>Many peoples here like to grumble about too much immigrant, and that depress their wages down, but let sit back and think, how can we make money out of these immigrants, open shops cater for them, rent out house to them, pay them less and work more for you, sell phonecards, etc etc...just like our rice stall outside, due to many PRC here, most like to eat rice, so i told the boss, to make money out of PRC, just add more rice, and it works, more and more PRC are coming to his stall, and you can compensate that by giving less to Singaporeans who are mostly on diet, and for me, he gives me free as alway</p>

              <p>Let me tell u what is the future of Singapore,that is,if the Lees continue to hold power in this country,we all have no future.Whether be it anti-Lees or pro-Lees.Coz after the Lees get rid of anti Lees ppl n consolidate their rule,they will turn to deal with the pro-Lees ppl.</p>
              <p>LKY n LHL are acting like Mao Ze Tong,Chiang Khek Sek,Stalin n Hitler.And if u read history,u will know how they deal with ppl who anti or pro them n their subordinates.</p>
              <p>If the Lees still holding power,in near future,i will see their "Sheeps"(like GCT,Mah BT,n even the Lees relative like Wong GC),all get send to trial in court n jail.The Lees dont have any humanity inside them,thats the biggest problem.They wont let go of anyone,from the way they lean towards Communism,u will know that.</p>

              <p>Its just that how are we going to deal with them.Close one eye n tolerate or even help them to become more dictatorial?Like what the Europe treat Hitler n Singaporean tolerating LKY.Or chase them away.</p>
