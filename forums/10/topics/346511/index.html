              <p>Tuesday, 03 February 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Singapore Democrats<br><br></em><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/logo/sdp.jpg" border="1" alt="" align="left">Through
                  the years, much has been said about the SDP. As a result many views
                  have been formed and propagated about what we stand for, our beliefs
                  and how we go about achieving our goals – some accurate and others
                  completely false.<br><br>We take a moment here to address these
                  misconceptions so that Singaporeans can get a better understanding of
                  the party. The information below will also be useful to counter the
                  propaganda put out by the PAP.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br><strong>Misconception No. 1: The SDP is not interested in parliamentary elections<br><br></strong>Parliamentary
                  elections are the cornerstone of a functioning democracy and we cannot
                  emphasize more that we see elections as the only legitimate way of
                  political parties gaining power. We have taken part in every election
                  in the past and will continue do so in the future.<br><br>What we don't
                  believe in, however, is that an opposition party, under present
                  political circumstances, should focus exclusively on elections. This is
                  because elections in Singapore are not free and fair. The PAP amends
                  electoral rules to suit its own needs, controls the media, and
                  victimises opposition leaders. Where else in the world can a prime
                  minister openly say that he needs to "fix" the opposition and "buy"
                  votes -- and get away with it?<br><br>The truth is that it is
                  impossible for the opposition to make any meaningful inroads into
                  Parliament through the existing electoral process. This is why, over
                  and above taking part in elections, opposition parties – together with
                  civil society – must work to reform the election system.<br><br>What
                  the SDP wants to see is a truly fair parliamentary election system in
                  Singapore, one acceptable by international standards. <strong><br><br>Misconception No. 2: The SDP wants to effect change through "extra-legal" means<br><br></strong>As
                  explained above, when effecting change through undemocratic elections
                  is impossible other peaceful, non-violent approaches are the only other
                  options open.<br><br>What the SDP is fighting for are the freedoms of
                  speech and peaceful assembly for Singaporeans, rights that are
                  enshrined in our Constitution. They are the building blocks of free and
                  fair elections without which we cannot press the Government to reform
                  the electoral process.<br><br>But when the PAP continues to violate the
                  Constitution and bans citizens from peaceful assembly, Singaporeans
                  must stand up and protect our Constitution. The only way that this can
                  be achieved is by defying the repressive laws put in place by the PAP.<br><br>Protecting
                  the Constitution is not extra-legal because the Constitution is the
                  supreme law of the country. It is the PAP that has resorted to
                  extra-legal measures by violating the supreme law of the land.<br><br><strong>Misconception No. 3: The SDP is an extremist party that advocates breaking laws</strong><br><br>Let
                  us be absolutely clear: Citizens cannot go about breaking a law just
                  because they don't agree with it. This is not what civil disobedience
                  is about. Civil disobedience is about standing up and not submitting to
                  unjust laws put in place by governments to deny citizens their most
                  basic rights. These rights are universally accepted as inalienable to
                  all persons and the PAP has no right to take them away.<br><br>In fact it is the PAP that does not adhere to the rule of law. Case in point: The police arrested <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em> protesters on 15 Mar 08 while allowing Consumers Association of
                  Singapore (CASE) members to conduct their protest. Such discrimination
                  clearly infringes Article 12 of the Constitution which demands that the
                  law must apply equally to all without favour or fear.<br><br>We, the
                  Singapore Democrats, are protecting our Constitution and there is
                  nothing extreme about that. In fact it is the duty of all citizens of
                  this republic to stand up for our Constitutional rights.<br><br>In any
                  democratic society, we would be considered a moderate party. It is only
                  in an authoritarian system that the ruling party tries to brand
                  reformers as extremists.<br><br><strong>Misconception No. 4: The SDP does not offer constructive alternative ideas </strong><br><br>Like the other misconceptions, this is one that the PAP likes to spread despite abundant evidence to the contrary.<br><br>Way back in 1994 the party adopted Dr Chee Soon Juan's book <em>Dare to Change: An Alternative Vision for Singapore</em> as its manifesto. The book explicitly spells out alternative policies
                  as well as the rationale for these ideas, including those for the
                  economy, politics, society, culture and the arts, education and the
                  media.<br><br>These ideas were subsequently expanded in<em> Your Future, My Faith, Our Freedom: A Democratic   Blueprint for Singapore</em>. They are further developed in <em>A Nation Cheated</em>. Our flagship publication, <em>The New Democrat</em>, and pamphlets consistently focus on our alternative ideas to the PAP programmes. A look at <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/the-party/our-manifesto">Our Manifesto</a> in this website would nail the lie that the SDP does not offer constructive alternatives. The latest example is our <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1845-budget-spending-not-transparent-sdp-proposes-alternative-5-point-plan-">Budget proposa</a>l to help Singaporeans and the economy.<br><br>But
                  Singaporeans don't know much of this because the state media will not
                  publish our ideas and keeps printing lies that the Singapore Democrats
                  simply criticise and don't offer constructive ideas.<br><br><strong>Misconception No. 5: The SDP is only interested in human rights and not bread-and-butter issues </strong><br><br>The
                  SDP has always been at the forefront of raising concerns about the
                  escalating prices of essentials. Again, a quick glance through this
                  website would show clearly that issues such as health care costs, CPF
                  savings, public transport fares, etc are regularly addressed.<br><br>The ongoing <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em> campaign, for example, is one of our main programmes to ensure that the
                  Government keeps the cost of living affordable. The plight of working
                  Singaporeans and SMEs remain high on our agenda. In fact during the
                  general elections, we zero in on pocket-book issues such as the minimum
                  wage, retrenchment entitlements, and the Singaporeans First Policy.<br><br>The
                  reason why the wider public does not realise this is because the mass
                  media censor much of what we say and do, especially on pocketbook
                  issues that we raise. A good example is their refusal to report our
                  proposals for this year's Budget.  <br><br>At the same time, however,
                  it is important to bring up human rights matters. Human rights and
                  bread-and-butter issues are two sides of the same coin. In order for us
                  to talk to the people about issues that concern them, we need freedom
                  of speech. Without this freedom we cannot effectively communicate with
                  the people.</p>
