            <div class='col-md body'>Segolene Royal was also rooting for economic reforms bent on lower taxes and jobs creation. The french have simply voted in favour of right-wingers this time round.<br><br>Given that their campaigns were driven by the same 'modest' reforms, it seems a moot point as to who the french voted for anyway.<br><br>In any case, their 35h week has paid other dividends. Their pro-family emphasis has maintained their status as one of the most family-orientated european nations; this is certainly good for nation building in the long run.<br><br>While they are indeed one of the highest taxpayers in the world, with taxes running in excess of 40%, it is not without benefits. First class specialist care in the form of medical treatment and almost fully-subsidised education fees at the lower levels are clear hallmarks of their system. To add also, the senior citizens in France are provided proper handouts in the form of supermarket rebates and vouchers and up to 50% discounted rates on SNCF and SNEF-run transportation.<br><br>Their system has its merits in promoting an altrustic and cultured society, with racial and religious acceptance openly practiced among their people despite beliefs to the contrary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay it is fair enough to point out France has problems and is trying to catch up with the rest of the world which are more open and accountable and willing to change like USA, UK, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland or Japan. France's problems though are largely the result of its traditionalism and deep sense of nationalism, cultural and historical self-centredness.<br><br>What about Singapore.

It is even using all kinds of creative accounting to make profits from the citizens like in the sale of public housing and provisions of essential government services.<br><br>Such a government does not have to spend much to look after citizens' basic needs and is not justified to collect higher taxes. However through excuses and creative accounting it constantly raises taxes and recover all expenses from charging fees and hoard the taxes as look-good surpluses from which to claim success which do not benefit the ordinary citizens.<br><br>Citizens are being made to pay again to all the GLCs which were formed to take over essential government services all the land and infrastructure costs again which were already previously paid by the citizens through taxation.<br><br>Is Singapore a better system than France?</div>

All the economists agree that Sarkozy has his work cut out for him. The french must be prepared to accept painful reforms to get back on track. It is a good lesson for us: never take the first step down the slippery welfare slope. It will be much harder trying to climb out of the hole.</div>
