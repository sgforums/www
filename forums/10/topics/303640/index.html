            <div class='col-md body'>Not too long ago, SM G mentioned about the rich coming forward for donation but was instead being asked to 'provide leadership'... wouldn't it be interesting that all those who are earning at least a million dollar a year donate from at least one percent to ten percent to... Millionaire Community Fund <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Comment leafed from a US website.<br>Hey 10% is all that God asks us to give back to HIm. Should be good enough for the government. Seriously, if EVERYONE has to pay back 10%, regardless of what they make, the middle class working citizens wouldn't be bearing the burden. Evidently that burden is huge or we wouldn't be buckling. Think about it......As for the current administration being responsible for our country's financial situations... Usually, with as slowly as the government machine moves, it takes years for the decisions made today, to effect us. So, what was put into motion during the Clinton years is what we started reaping during the Bush years. Besides, the recent college grads come out from under their educational rock, demanding, and getting, high salaries, but not high enough to afford all of the luxury items that they think is owed to them, because they have "paid their dues". At the ripe old age of less than 30? Give me a break. Wait until you have worked for 40 + years, gotten up every day to work hard physical jobs, not called in sick every other week, then tell me that you have "paid your dues". Shoot, my kids have 2 brand new cars, a new house and a huge tv....we don't. Never had had a brand new house, and only recently purchased a brand new car. Who do you think paid for those educations? Yeah, mom and dad----they paid their dues. If everyone pulled their own WEIGHT and didn't WAIT for the government to fix things, provide for them, pay them back, etc., we wouldn't be in this mess. Get busy US and start working again instead of asking congress to provide.<br>Posted by: the3beez 7:55 PM</div>
