            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: While Singapore's economic recovery is picking up speed, many Singaporeans remain concerned about issues like jobs and competition from foreigners. <br><br>These bread-and-butter issues dominated a two-hour dialogue session in Yew Tee with Law and Second Home Affairs Minister, K Shanmugam, on Sunday. <br><br>One after another, residents rose to query the minister on what some perceived to be difficult competition from foreigners. <br><br>But the minister explained that Singaporeans will always come first. <br><br>Mr Shanmugam said: "We have to start off with the perspective that we have to help Singaporeans first. Singaporeans must have jobs and be able to afford the basic things. <br><br>"You've heard the Prime Minister and various members of the Cabinet say that yes, there has been a tightening up in terms of who will be allowed to come into Singapore. <br><br>"Foreign workers will come in as needed by the economy and when not needed by the economy, they will go back." <br><br>Mr Shanmugam pointed out that at the lower levels, foreigners are taking up the jobs that Singaporeans shun. <br><br>Meanwhile at the upper levels, those foreigners coming in ended up improving job prospects for Singaporeans. <br><br>Another issue that came up during the dialogue session was the question of enough housing for young couples, especially with the recent Build-To-Order Project in Chua Chu Kang area being over-subscribed. <br><br>But Mr Shanmugam didn't think that HDB was building behind the curve. <br><br>He said the housing board had to be careful not to flood the market, even as it promises to build up to 12,000 BTO flats this year. <br><br>With the integrated resort in Sentosa opening soon, residents wondered if they could have a date with Lady Luck - for free. <br><br>"(How about) giving some free entry to these casinos (at Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands), especially on National Day? I think most will like it, right?" asked a resident. <br><br>But he didn't strike the jackpot with the answer he got. <br><br>Mr Shanmugam said: "I hope Singaporeans don't get overly excited about the casinos. I don't think the government can pay for it and say 'free entry'. <br><br>"We have put in various safeguards. So, let's see how those safeguards work." <br><br>As a social safeguard, Singaporeans and PRs have to pay a levy of $100 per day or $2,000 for an annual membership to enter the casinos. <br><br>Before the dialogue, Mr Shanmugam also toured the Yew Tee constituency and mingled with the residents. <br><br>During the ministerial walkabout, Mr Shanmugam was asked about the hit-and-run accident at Bukit Panjang that has been linked to Romanian Charge d'Affaires, Silviu Ionescu. <br><br>Mr Ionescu, who flew back to Romania a few days after the accident, has been recalled by the Romanian Foreign Ministry. This was to allow the Prosecutor's Office of Romania to investigate into the accident involving the embassy's car which belongs to Mr Ionescu. <br><br>The accident on 15 December last year left one person dead and two others injured. <br><br>Mr Shanmugam said it is important not to assume guilt, and that the due process of law has to be followed with police conducting a full investigation. <br><br>He said: "The next step in the process is for the Attorney-General and his Chambers to look at the evidence presented, to then decide whether or not there is a case to proceed. And he will only proceed if he feels a case can be made out in court with witnesses without reasonable doubt. There is no question in the Singapore context of us not going through the facts carefully or us trying to shield anyone." <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></p></div>

              Singapore has a population problem with very low birth rates. Bringing in the foreigners is the only solution for PAP. It's the same situation that the Japanese and Taiwanese are having so I read.
                                <br><br>
              But bringing in foreigners is only a short term solution. They should look for reasons why its population don't want to have more babies. A loosening of hectic life pace, lower cost of living incl housing and more freedom so that free people could live as free people are the needed real long term solution. I think it's time Singaporeans think about having a quality life . . .which is not all about work...you can only push people for so long after all but I guess these PAPers are too afraid losing their attractiveness as a cheap graduate employee spot that they are only demanding work work work. It's easy for them to do so they are paid millions and even the current PM is missing in action so I heard.

              <p>It probably depends on the agenda. If they want to increase their own salary again, of course they have to say economy doing well. If time to cut wages for people, then of course must say economy not that well.</p>
              <p>It all depends on the agenda for that day and they will change the story to fit it.</p>
              <p>Different people at different times, they will say different things. For example in early years lky will say values of national pledge is important, but later when people really start to take the pledge seriously , democratic society etc, he will say pledge is not serious thing.</p>
              <p>Or before come to power. talk about democracy, socialism, after came to power, to hell with democracy and socialism.</p>
              <p>When it comes to PAP and lky, only political morons would believe in their words. Unless they are talking about increasing their own salary. Then for sure they will increase.</p>

              <p>But Dear Singaporean,</p>
              <p>I dunno if you people learn about logistic, last time, when i took business course on it, the lecturer said, "First in, first out" leh. Meaning if this particular stock come in first, it must go out first by the next order. So hor, i think Ah neh Shamugam is giving you a hint, Singaporeans will alway come first, but he did not carry on to say, Singaporeans will also be the first to go out. So hor, becareful ya.</p>
