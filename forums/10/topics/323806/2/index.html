              <p>those who are doing well will not feel what the others are suffering.  And that doesnt means what is going on is right.</p>
              <p>The best way to cope with today's ridiculous non-stop hike and raising living standard is to make more then the hike, but how many can do it?  What if 1 day you fail and join in the group that suffers?</p>
              <p>whatever is not right should be corrected. i agree most people can still cope but at the rate it is going up, even if you are lucky enough to survive, can you assure that your family are able to do so? your relatives, your friends?  Can you be an Ostrich forever hoping that you are not the unlucky ones?</p>
              <p>I guess majority of the people think this way, but i hope at least they are aware of what is going on.  Telling me it is wrong but nothing you can do is better then telling me everything is fine, the system is good.</p>

              <p><br>Oh no, i also increase my staffs wages thru their performance, later we manage to get a consultant, he told us to use contractual obligation method, so now all my staffs are under contracts basis, no need to bother about their medical, leaves eetc etc. And if they dun performance, can ask them to go if contract finished. Quite fair to both the employer and the employees, but lack of loyality and trust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also understand the predicament of workers or so called the wage earners, most Singaporeans perhaps 80 percents are wage earners, they tight down at the expense of wages and govt policies. One can never be over committed as a wage earners, however economy lies in the purchasing power of wage earner, if bosses lower their salary, they spend less leading to economy meltdown.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Bosses also understand the need to raise salary at match the market condition, if not, turn over will be high, productivity goes down and business will be affected.</p>
