We have to make those two years that we put our sons through worthwhile. When we have reached the point where every family says Â‘I understand why NS is needed and IÂ’m proud to do itÂ’, I think weÂ’re getting there.Â”</span></span></strong><br><br>So conversely, is Dr Ng claiming the viewpoint of "<span style="font-style: italic;">hey my (anyone's) sons did NS, so should yours.

Assuming that a graduate earn 2k per month. he earns 24k a year and 48k in two yr. That is excluding the non countable like the ability for promotion.
