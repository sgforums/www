Perhaps there should be greater flexibility in the way NS servicemen are deployed.<br><br>In the present climate, perhaps more should be diverted to the police, civil service and anti-terrorism agencies rather than the army.

That means Singapore needs to sign extradiction treaty with every country in the world. Lets say if some countries do not wish to sign the treaty... Then what would happen? Will the "Secret Police" of Mindef still go around and kidnap those people?</div>

Will that law be legally binding in other countries? I do not think so...<br><br>For example that poor Australian guy that was hanged... He is an Australian but was under the mercy of Singapore Law because he is in Singapore territory and despite being a Australian citizen; the Australia's legal system and law would not have a binding effect.<br><br>Likewise if lets say a Singaporean is legally staying in Australia( maybe he has a Australian passport and citizenship by birth ) then he is under the mercy of the Australian legal system and the "law" from Singapore is not legally binding... Unless Singapore makes that Australia part of her own sovereign territory which to me, that is highly unlikely.</div>
