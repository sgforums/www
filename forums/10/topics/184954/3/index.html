If his application is successful, then everything will be fine. However, if he does not apply for the exit permit and continues to stay overseas for more than 3 months; then he and his parents have commited an offence in which both parents would be fined to a maximum of S$2000.<br><br>Regarding him being arrested at Changi, I do not think that will happen.
