              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Online brothels offering girls from various nationalities are becoming increasingly popular among Singapore men looking for a quickie, especially the youth.</p>
              <p>Frequent raids on the red-light district of Geylang had forced the freelance prostitutes to retreat to cyberspace to solicit for customers.</p>
              <p>As many as five new websites have appeared in the last few months alone offering a myriad of “services” from sexy massage to discreet sexual encounters from freelance prostitutes.</p>
              <p>Some appear to be websites set up by organized syndicates while others are hosted by independent freelance prostitutes themselves who are here in Singapore to make a quick buck.</p>
              <p>Online prostitution is not new in Singapore. Famous sex forum Sammyboy has a dedicated “freelance” section to allow prostitutes and pimps alike to post their services and contacts.</p>
              <p>One owner of such a site claimed he is a “landlord” who is helping his PRC tenants to earn some “extra cash”.</p>
              <p>The photos of the girls are listed on the site including their “statistics”, prices, types of services offered and “field reports” from previous patrons.</p>
              <p>Propsective clients have to contact the pimp directly using the handphone number provided who will inform him of the time and venue for the “transaction” to take place.</p>
              <p>Such online brothels are seeing an increase in business lately as they offer customers the flexibility to choose their time and girl as well as a place outside the usual red-light district to pursue their pleasures.</p>
              <p>When interviewed by the Straits Times, Dr Carol Balhetchet, director of youth services at the Singapore Children’s Society, said:</p>
              <p><em>“The scary part is prostitution has come to your doorstep – and it’s not just available to adults…..the scary part about the young is, they want to experiment. Now, they don’t need to go to Geylang…Prostitution can be more gypsy-like…In that sense, it’s risky.”</em></p>
              <p>Unlike licenced prostitutes working in designated brothels, freelance prostitutes who ply their trade online do not need have to go for monthly medical examation and blood tests to detect sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV.</p>
              <p>With the two Integrated Resorts set to open this year, the demand for such online sexual services is likely to increase especially with Singapore’s lax immigration and travel restrictions.</p>
              <p>Foreign prostitutes especially those from China often come to Singapore to “work” on a one-month tourist visa.</p>
              <p>Others come on a two-year student visa ostensibly to study in private institutions, but end up working in KTV lounges.</p>
              <p>Asked about the online brothels by the Straits Times, the police would only say: ‘Police will investigate reports made and take action if any offence is disclosed.’</p>
              <p>The police did not say whether anyone has been arrested in connection with the online brothels which have been in existence for Singapore for a very long time already.</p>
              <p>THIS IS FOR THE SHAMELESS AND COCKY <strong>OKB</strong></p>

              <p>Dunno about 'coming first', but <strong>first </strong>to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">conned during elections</span>.</p>
              <p><br>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:"...But in the next five years, if you give us a strong mandate, we will find ways to make healthcare affordable and more convenient for more Singaporeans... ... bringing down the cost of your healthcare, but (to) do this, we need a strong mandate from you ... ", sounds very presumptuous to me, over confident of winning the elections. The other possibility is that he has no dignity,just shameless toeing the line of his puppet masters. Healthcare costs dependent on a 'strong mandate'? Sounds like ransom.<br><br>Needs mandate to do the right thing? In context of their expectant win by virtue of the hyped up GRC system (constituency groups of up to  6, an inherently gerrymandering like situation), his statement seems more akin to extortion then leadership.<br>Mere puppets of the 'central executive committee' (PAP-CEC), what good are they for the leadership of Singaporeans? These walkovers only perpetuate the fallacy of the PAP 'GRC omnibus' being the highway to that purported life of privilege and prosperity ('PAP').<br><br>Instead of demanding a strong mandate, Dr Balaji would have done much better to say, "I will always have your rights and interest at heart, being elected would give me larger a platform to extend my purpose; a bonus of a good mandate allow me greater parliamentary credibility over other elected MPs. My priority for this term would be to keep healthcare accessible and affordable to all. No matter what the outcome of these elections, I'll always have the interest of Singaporeans at heart; no matter who I am or what I'm doing; you'll never regret your support for me.”<br><br>In no where do I sense Dr Balaji's moral commitment in his address and both possibilities are reprehensible.<br><br>In a 31Dec09CNA report of MM Lee's interview with National Geographic, <br>He (MM Lee) said “Singapore is in a good position at least for the next 10 years with the current leadership in place.   … For the long term, it will depend on whether there is a younger team imbibed with the same integrity and ability”. <br>Mr Lee said his task is to ensure institutions and systems are in place. <br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1027947/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1027947/1/.html</a><br><br>I beg to defer as the 4/2006CNA report of Dr Balaji's poor showing proves otherwise. Integrity as I've described remains question, likewise are the promises that have far from been fulfilled. If indeed the PAP's CEC had a part in Dr Balaji's statement, then the CEC must have a less then noble constitution and composition. So long as PAP persists in deploying its dirty election tricks, then the social cohesion that PAP so fervently acclaims shall remain no more than a mirage by which the PAP leadership is premised. <br><br>Perhaps Dr Balaji, (possibly the PAP puppet masters) need another lesson in humility?<br><br><br>References/ minor comments:<br>- The PAP cadre system, <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/80404st1.htm">http://www.singapore-window.org/80404st1.htm </a><br>- 29April06,CNA: Dr Balaji Sadasivan promises lower healthcare costs if PAP given strong mandate <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1284659">http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1284659</a><br>- 31Dec09,CNA: Social cohesion key to keeping Singapore going: MM Lee:  <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1027947/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1027947/1/.html </a><br>- Instead of the proclaimed motto of Integrity Service Excellence, it seems like the govt's true motto is Integrity subservient to Expedience ( <a href="http://www.gov.sg/">http://www.gov.sg/</a> )<br>------------------</p>
