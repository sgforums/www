The Bush administration, however, downplayed the talks' significance.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, when Israeli officials asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about pursuing exploratory talks with Syria, her answer, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, was, "don't even think about it." Similarly, the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth reports that Israeli government officials "understood from President Bush that the United States would not take kindly to reopening a dialogue between Israel and Syria." </blockquote>http://www.antiwar.com/orig/zunes.php?articleid=10904<br><br>So read more,Isreal want peace so does Syria but the US stops it.<br><br>why simple,divide and rule.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is defintely a carrot stick to isolate support for Herzbollah in the region and other islamic militant group. We maybe looking at a new shift, instead of war over land,  The war against extremist may be the new front. And I think it is probably a good direction if the offer are geniune.<br><br></div>
