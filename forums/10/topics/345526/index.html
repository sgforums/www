              <p><em>Moshav Tekuma, Israel</em></p>
              <p>Surveying the wreckage of a neighbor's bungalow hit by a Palestinian
                  rocket, retired Israeli official Avner Cohen traces the missile's
                  trajectory back to an "enormous, stupid mistake" made 30 years ago.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel's creation," </strong></span>says Mr. Cohen, a
                  Tunisian-born Jew who worked in Gaza for more than two decades.
                  Responsible for religious affairs in the region until 1994, Mr. Cohen
                  watched the Islamist movement take shape, muscle aside secular
                  Palestinian rivals and then morph into what is today Hamas, a militant
                  group that is sworn to Israel's destruction.</p>
              <p>Instead of trying to curb Gaza's Islamists from the outset, says Mr.
                  Cohen,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Israel for years tolerated and, in some cases, encouraged them
                  as a counterweight to the secular nationalists of the Palestine
                  Liberation Organization and its dominant faction, Yasser Arafat's
                  Fatah.</strong></span> Israel cooperated with a crippled, half-blind cleric named
                  Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, even as he was laying the foundations for what
                  would become Hamas. Sheikh Yassin continues to inspire militants today;
                  during the recent war in Gaza, Hamas fighters confronted Israeli troops
                  with "Yassins," primitive rocket-propelled grenades named in honor of
                  the cleric.</p>

              <p>Last
                  Saturday, after 22 days of war, Israel announced a halt to the
                  offensive. The assault was aimed at stopping Hamas rockets from falling
                  on Israel. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert hailed a "determined and
                  successful military operation." More than 1,200 Palestinians had died.
                  Thirteen Israelis were also killed.</p>
              <p>Hamas responded the next day by lobbing five rockets towards the
                  Israeli town of Sderot, a few miles down the road from Moshav Tekuma,
                  the farming village where Mr. Cohen lives. Hamas then announced its own
                  cease-fire.</p>
              <p>Since then, Hamas leaders have emerged from hiding and reasserted
                  their control over Gaza. Egyptian-mediated talks aimed at a more
                  durable truce are expected to start this weekend. President Barack
                  Obama said this week that lasting calm "requires more than a long
                  cease-fire" and depends on Israel and a future Palestinian state
                  "living side by side in peace and security."</p>
              <p>A look at Israel's decades-long dealings with Palestinian radicals
                  -- including some little-known attempts to cooperate with the Islamists
                  -- reveals a catalog of unintended and often perilous consequences.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Time and again, Israel's efforts to find a pliant Palestinian partner
                  that is both credible with Palestinians and willing to eschew violence,
                  have backfired.</strong></span> Would-be partners have turned into foes or lost the
                  support of their people.</p>
              <p>Israel's experience echoes that of the U.S., which, during the Cold
                  War, looked to Islamists as a useful ally against communism.
                  Anti-Soviet forces backed by America after Moscow's 1979 invasion of
                  Afghanistan later mutated into al Qaeda.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>At
                  stake is the future of what used to be the British Mandate of
                  Palestine, the biblical lands now comprising Israel and the Palestinian
                  territories of the West Bank and Gaza. Since 1948, when the state of
                  Israel was established, Israelis and Palestinians have each asserted
                  claims over the same territory.</p>
              <p>The Palestinian cause was for decades led by the PLO, which Israel
                  regarded as a terrorist outfit and sought to crush until the 1990s,
                  when the PLO dropped its vow to destroy the Jewish state. The PLO's
                  Palestinian rival, Hamas, led by Islamist militants, refused to
                  recognize Israel and vowed to continue "resistance." Hamas now controls
                  Gaza, a crowded, impoverished sliver of land on the Mediterranean from
                  which Israel pulled out troops and settlers in 2005.</p>
              <p>When Israel first encountered Islamists in Gaza in the 1970s and
                  '80s, they seemed focused on studying the Quran, not on confrontation
                  with Israel. The Israeli government officially recognized a precursor
                  to Hamas called Mujama Al-Islamiya, registering the group as a charity.
                  It allowed Mujama members to set up an Islamic university and build
                  mosques, clubs and schools. Crucially, Israel often stood aside when
                  the Islamists and their secular left-wing Palestinian rivals battled,
                  sometimes violently, for influence in both Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
              <p>"When I look back at the chain of events I think we made a mistake,"
                  says David Hacham, who worked in Gaza in the late 1980s and early '90s
                  as an Arab-affairs expert in the Israeli military. "But at the time
                  nobody thought about the possible results."</p>
              <p>Israeli officials who served in Gaza disagree on how much their own
                  actions may have contributed to the rise of Hamas. They blame the
                  group's recent ascent on outsiders, primarily Iran. This view is shared
                  by the Israeli government. "Hamas in Gaza was built by Iran as a
                  foundation for power, and is backed through funding, through training
                  and through the provision of advanced weapons," Mr. Olmert said last
                  Saturday. Hamas has denied receiving military assistance from Iran.</p>
              <p>Arieh Spitzen, the former head of the Israeli military's Department
                  of Palestinian Affairs, says that even if Israel had tried to stop the
                  Islamists sooner, he doubts it could have done much to curb political
                  Islam, a movement that was spreading across the Muslim world. He says
                  attempts to stop it are akin to trying to change the internal rhythms
                  of nature: "It is like saying: 'I will kill all the mosquitoes.' But
                  then you get even worse insects that will kill you...You break the
                  balance. You kill Hamas you might get al Qaeda."</p>
              <p>When it became clear in the early 1990s that Gaza's Islamists had
                  mutated from a religious group into a fighting force aimed at Israel --
                  particularly after they turned to suicide bombings in 1994 -- Israel
                  cracked down with ferocious force. But each military assault only
                  increased Hamas's appeal to ordinary Palestinians. The group ultimately
                  trounced secular rivals, notably Fatah, in a 2006 election supported by
                  Israel's main ally, the U.S.</p>
              <p>Now, one big fear in Israel and elsewhere is that while Hamas has
                  been hammered hard, the war might have boosted the group's popular
                  appeal. Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas administration in Gaza, came
                  out of hiding last Sunday to declare that "God has granted us a great
                  victory."</p>
              <p>Most damaged from the war, say many Palestinians, is Fatah, now
                  Israel's principal negotiating partner. "Everyone is praising the
                  resistance and thinks that Fatah is not part of it," says Baker
                  Abu-Baker, a longtime Fatah supporter and author of a book on Hamas.</p>
              <h6>A Lack of Devotion</h6>
              <p>Hamas traces its roots back to the Muslim
                  Brotherhood, a group set up in Egypt in 1928. The Brotherhood believed
                  that the woes of the Arab world spring from a lack of Islamic devotion.
                  Its slogan: "Islam is the solution. The Quran is our constitution." Its
                  philosophy today underpins modern, and often militantly intolerant,
                  political Islam from Algeria to Indonesia.</p>
              <p>After the 1948 establishment of Israel, the Brotherhood recruited a
                  few followers in Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza and elsewhere, but
                  secular activists came to dominate the Palestinian nationalist movement.</p>
              <p>At the time, Gaza was ruled by Egypt. The country's then-president,
                  Gamal Abdel Nasser, was a secular nationalist who brutally repressed
                  the Brotherhood. In 1967, Nasser suffered a crushing defeat when Israel
                  triumphed in the six-day war. Israel took control of Gaza and also the
                  West Bank.</p>
              <p>"We were all stunned," says Palestinian writer and Hamas supporter
                  Azzam Tamimi. He was at school at the time in Kuwait and says he became
                  close to a classmate named Khaled Mashaal, now Hamas's Damascus-based
                  political chief. "The Arab defeat provided the Brotherhood with a big
                  opportunity," says Mr. Tamimi.</p>
              <p>In Gaza, Israel hunted down members of Fatah and other secular PLO
                  factions, but it dropped harsh restrictions imposed on Islamic
                  activists by the territory's previous Egyptian rulers. Fatah, set up in
                  1964, was the backbone of the PLO, which was responsible for
                  hijackings, bombings and other violence against Israel. Arab states in
                  1974 declared the PLO the "sole legitimate representative" of the
                  Palestinian people world-wide.</p>

              <p>The
                  Muslim Brotherhood, led in Gaza by Sheikh Yassin, was free to spread
                  its message openly. In addition to launching various charity projects,
                  Sheikh Yassin collected money to reprint the writings of Sayyid Qutb,
                  an Egyptian member of the Brotherhood who, before his execution by
                  President Nasser, advocated global jihad. He is now seen as one of the
                  founding ideologues of militant political Islam.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cohen, who worked at the time for the Israeli government's
                  religious affairs department in Gaza, says he began to hear disturbing
                  reports in the mid-1970s about Sheikh Yassin from traditional Islamic
                  clerics. He says they warned that the sheikh had no formal Islamic
                  training and was ultimately more interested in politics than faith.
                  "They said, 'Keep away from Yassin. He is a big danger,'" recalls Mr.
                  Cohen.</p>
              <p>Instead, Israel's military-led administration in Gaza looked
                  favorably on the paraplegic cleric, who set up a wide network of
                  schools, clinics, a library and kindergartens. Sheikh Yassin formed the
                  Islamist group Mujama al-Islamiya, which was officially recognized by
                  Israel as a charity and then, in 1979, as an association. Israel also
                  endorsed the establishment of the Islamic University of Gaza, which it
                  now regards as a hotbed of militancy. The university was one of the
                  first targets hit by Israeli warplanes in the recent war.</p>
              <p>Brig. General Yosef Kastel, Gaza's Israeli governor at the time, is
                  too ill to comment, says his wife. But Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who
                  took over as governor in Gaza in late 1979, says he had no illusions
                  about Sheikh Yassin's long-term intentions or the perils of political
                  Islam. As Israel's former military attache in Iran, he'd watched
                  Islamic fervor topple the Shah. However, in Gaza, says Mr. Segev, "our
                  main enemy was Fatah," and the cleric "was still 100% peaceful" towards
                  Israel. Former officials say Israel was also at the time wary of being
                  viewed as an enemy of Islam.</p>
              <p>Mr. Segev says he had regular contact with Sheikh Yassin, in part to
                  keep an eye on him. He visited his mosque and met the cleric around a
                  dozen times. It was illegal at the time for Israelis to meet anyone
                  from the PLO. Mr. Segev later arranged for the cleric to be taken to
                  Israel for hospital treatment. "We had no problems with him," he says.</p>
              <p>In fact, the cleric and Israel had a shared enemy: secular
                  Palestinian activists. After a failed attempt in Gaza to oust
                  secularists from leadership of the Palestinian Red Crescent, the Muslim
                  version of the Red Cross, Mujama staged a violent demonstration,
                  storming the Red Crescent building. Islamists also attacked shops
                  selling liquor and cinemas. The Israeli military mostly stood on the
                  sidelines.</p>
              <p>Mr. Segev says the army didn't want to get involved in Palestinian
                  quarrels but did send soldiers to prevent Islamists from burning down
                  the house of the Red Crescent's secular chief, a socialist who
                  supported the PLO.</p>
              <h6>'An Alternative to the PLO'</h6>
              <p>Clashes between Islamists and
                  secular nationalists spread to the West Bank and escalated during the
                  early 1980s, convulsing college campuses, particularly Birzeit
                  University, a center of political activism.</p>
              <p>As the fighting between rival student factions at Birzeit grew more
                  violent, Brig. Gen. Shalom Harari, then a military intelligence officer
                  in Gaza, says he received a call from Israeli soldiers manning a
                  checkpoint on the road out of Gaza. They had stopped a bus carrying
                  Islamic activists who wanted to join the battle against Fatah at
                  Birzeit. "I said: 'If they want to burn each other let them go,'"
                  recalls Mr. Harari.</p>
              <p>A leader of Birzeit's Islamist faction at the time was Mahmoud
                  Musleh, now a pro-Hamas member of a Palestinian legislature elected in
                  2006. He recalls how usually aggressive Israeli security forces stood
                  back and let conflagration develop. He denies any collusion between his
                  own camp and the Israelis, but says "they hoped we would become an
                  alternative to the PLO."</p>
              <p>A year later, in 1984, the Israeli military received a tip-off from
                  Fatah supporters that Sheikh Yassin's Gaza Islamists were collecting
                  arms, according to Israeli officials in Gaza at the time. Israeli
                  troops raided a mosque and found a cache of weapons. Sheikh Yassin was
                  jailed. He told Israeli interrogators the weapons were for use against
                  rival Palestinians, not Israel, according to Mr. Hacham, the military
                  affairs expert who says he spoke frequently with jailed Islamists. The
                  cleric was released after a year and continued to expand Mujama's reach
                  across Gaza.</p>
              <p>Around the time of Sheikh Yassin's arrest, Mr. Cohen, the religious
                  affairs official, sent a report to senior Israeli military and civilian
                  officials in Gaza. Describing the cleric as a "diabolical" figure, he
                  warned that Israel's policy towards the Islamists was allowing Mujama
                  to develop into a dangerous force.</p>
              <p>"I believe that by continuing to turn away our eyes, our lenient
                  approach to Mujama will in the future harm us. I therefore suggest
                  focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before
                  this reality jumps in our face," Mr. Cohen wrote.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harari, the military intelligence officer, says this and other
                  warnings were ignored. But, he says, the reason for this was neglect,
                  not a desire to fortify the Islamists: "Israel never financed Hamas.
                  Israel never armed Hamas."</p>
              <p>Roni Shaked, a former officer of Shin Bet, Israel's internal
                  security service, and author of a book on Hamas, says Sheikh Yassin and
                  his followers had a long-term perspective whose dangers were not
                  understood at the time. "They worked slowly, slowly, step by step
                  according to the Muslim Brotherhood plan."</p>
              <h6>Declaring Jihad</h6>
              <p>In 1987, several Palestinians were killed in
                  a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver, triggering a wave of
                  protests that became known as the first Intifada, Mr. Yassin and six
                  other Mujama Islamists launched Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance
                  Movement. Hamas's charter, released a year later, is studded with
                  anti-Semitism and declares "jihad its path and death for the cause of
                  Allah its most sublime belief."</p>
              <p>Israeli officials, still focused on Fatah and initially unaware of
                  the Hamas charter, continued to maintain contacts with the Gaza
                  Islamists. Mr. Hacham, the military Arab affairs expert, remembers
                  taking one of Hamas's founders, Mahmoud Zahar, to meet Israel's then
                  defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, as part of regular consultations
                  between Israeli officials and Palestinians not linked to the PLO. Mr.
                  Zahar, the only Hamas founder known to be alive today, is now the
                  group's senior political leader in Gaza.</p>
              <p>In 1989, Hamas carried out its first attack on Israel, abducting and
                  killing two soldiers. Israel arrested Sheikh Yassin and sentenced him
                  to life. It later rounded up more than 400 suspected Hamas activists,
                  including Mr. Zahar, and deported them to southern Lebanon. There, they
                  hooked up with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed A-Team of anti-Israeli
                  militancy.</p>
              <p>Many of the deportees later returned to Gaza. Hamas built up its
                  arsenal and escalated its attacks, while all along maintaining the
                  social network that underpinned its support in Gaza.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, its enemy, the PLO, dropped its commitment to Israel's
                  destruction and started negotiating a two-state settlement. Hamas
                  accused it of treachery. This accusation found increasing resonance as
                  Israel kept developing settlements on occupied Palestinian land,
                  particularly the West Bank. Though the West Bank had passed to the
                  nominal control of a new Palestinian Authority, it was still dotted
                  with Israeli military checkpoints and a growing number of Israeli
                  settlers.</p>
              <p>Unable to uproot a now entrenched Islamist network that had suddenly
                  replaced the PLO as its main foe, Israel tried to decapitate it. It
                  started targeting Hamas leaders. This, too, made no dent in Hamas's
                  support, and sometimes even helped the group. In 1997, for example,
                  Israel's Mossad spy agency tried to poison Hamas's exiled political
                  leader Mr. Mashaal, who was then living in Jordan.</p>
              <p>The agents got caught and, to get them out of a Jordanian jail,
                  Israel agreed to release Sheikh Yassin. The cleric set off on a tour of
                  the Islamic world to raise support and money. He returned to Gaza to a
                  hero's welcome.</p>
              <p>Efraim Halevy, a veteran Mossad officer who negotiated the deal that
                  released Sheikh Yassin, says the cleric's freedom was hard to swallow,
                  but Israel had no choice. After the fiasco in Jordan, Mr. Halevy was
                  named director of Mossad, a position he held until 2002. Two years
                  later, Sheikh Yassin was killed by an Israeli air strike.</p>
              <p>Mr. Halevy has in recent years urged Israel to negotiate with Hamas.
                  He says that "Hamas can be crushed," but he believes that "the price of
                  crushing Hamas is a price that Israel would prefer not to pay." When
                  Israel's authoritarian secular neighbor, Syria, launched a campaign to
                  wipe out Muslim Brotherhood militants in the early 1980s it killed more
                  than 20,000 people, many of them civilians.</p>
              <p>In its recent war in Gaza, Israel didn't set the destruction of
                  Hamas as its goal. It limited its stated objectives to halting the
                  Islamists' rocket fire and battering their overall military capacity.
                  At the start of the Israeli operation in December, Defense Minister
                  Ehud Barak told parliament that the goal was "to deal Hamas a severe
                  blow, a blow that will cause it to stop its hostile actions from Gaza
                  at Israeli citizens and soldiers."</p>
              <p>Walking back to his house from the rubble of his neighbor's home,
                  Mr. Cohen, the former religious affairs official in Gaza, curses Hamas
                  and also what he sees as missteps that allowed Islamists to put down
                  deep roots in Gaza.</p>
              <p>He recalls a 1970s meeting with a traditional Islamic cleric who
                  wanted Israel to stop cooperating with the Muslim Brotherhood followers
                  of Sheikh Yassin: "He told me: 'You are going to have big regrets in 20
                  or 30 years.' He was right."</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2008-2009 Israel-Gaza Conflict: In Israel's Defence</strong></span></p>
              <p>by Donaldson Tan. 9 Feb 2009. <a href="http://globalcitizens.siiaonline.org/?q=blog/2008-2009-israel-gaza-conflict-in-israel%E2%80%99s-defence">Source</a></p>
              <p>The Middle East has always been a hot bed for conflicts. The recent
                  eruption of violence in Gaza Strip has earned Israel condemnation from
                  the international community on the disproportionality of its action.
                  Yet it is interesting to note despite the ritual condemnation, no Arab
                  states has actually put forward any important actions to undermine
                  Israel's occupation in Gaza after the Israel-Hamas truce had expired.
                  As usual, international media is quick to highlight bloodshed, the most
                  attention-grabbing result, while downplaying the role of Hamas in the
                  Israel-Gaza Conflict.</p>
              <h3>Israel-Gaza Conflict</h3>
              <div>
              <p>According to the BBC, the Israel-Gaza Conflict started on 27
                  December 2008 when Israel launched Operation Cast Lead into the Gaza
                  Strip . While media coverage has been biased in only focusing on the
                  disproportionality of Israel’s military action in the Gaza Strip, it is
                  important to note that things were already brewing in the background.
                  Since 2006, Hamas has fired at least 1,700 rockets into Israel despite
                  Israel’s easing of the blockade on the Gaza Strip. Hamas continued to
                  smuggle ammunitions, firearms and rockets despite its assurance to
                  Israel on its commitment to peace. Worse still, Hamas accused Israel of
                  violating the ceasefire first when Israeli agents raided a weapons
                  smuggling tunnel in Gaza, despite that weapons smuggling de-facto
                  breaks the ceasefire agreement. When the 6-month truce between Israel
                  and Hamas expired on 18 December 2008, Hamas refused to extend the
                  truce and renewed rocket attacks against Israel on 19 December 2008.</p>
              </div>
              <p>In March 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
                  vowed to press on with the deadly military operations against militants
                  who have been launching increasingly powerful rockets into Israel. The
                  Israeli action is merely a response to the renewed terrorism
                  originating from the Gaza Strip. Security for Israeli is the primary
                  priority for the current Israeli government.  Action speaks louder than
                  words and this is demonstrated by Israel’s unilateral ceasefire on 17
                  January 2009 and partial withdrawal of the Israeli Defence Force.
                  Israel’s fight is targeted against Hamas and not the People of Gaza.
                  Having destroyed Hamas’ military camps and 60% of Hamas’ tunnels
                  between Egypt and Gaza, there is no need to continue military action in
                  Gaza. By 21 January 2009, Israel has fully withdrawn its troops from
                  Gaza. This is not the first time that Israel withdrew its troops
                  unilaterally. In 2005, Israel made a unilateral decision to withdraw
                  its military and settlers from the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum criticised Israel for
                  taking a unilateral approach rather than entering into a deal with
                  Egyptian mediators: “It is an attempt to pre-empt the Egyptian efforts
                  and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the
                  occupying forces, an end to the siege and a ceasefire.” Moreover, the
                  international community and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
                  support the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, which is
                  repeatedly emphasised in UNSC Resolutions S/RES/1860(2009) and
                  S/RES/1850(2009). While a somewhat quiet night presided Gaza on the
                  first night of the unilateral ceasefire, Israelis woke up to yet again
                  another morning of Hamas rocket attacks. Surely rocket attacks is not
                  the way to invite your opponent to participate in peace talks hosted by
                  a less-than-neutral neighbour Egypt, one of the Arab League’s only 2
                  members that actually recognise Israel. In fact, fighting has now
                  resumed. Recent news indicated that the Israeli Air Force conducted air
                  strikes  in response to a new wave of rocket attacks from the Gaza
                  Strip.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The way out of the Israel-Gaza Conflict cannot be a one-off
                  temporary solution until the next eruption of fighting. President Obama
                  of the United States said in an Al Arabiya Interview  that continued
                  fighting “is not going to result in prosperity and security” for
                  Israelis and Palestinians, and commended the Arab Peace Initiative for
                  being a courageous act. The Arab Peace Initiative, proposed by King
                  Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, represents a new holistic approach to the
                  Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. While security implications on their
                  bordering countries cannot be separated from the Israeli-Palestinian
                  Conflict, there is notable regional desire for political stability.
                  Most importantly, the Arab Peace Initiative marks a stark departure
                  from the 1967 “Three No’s” that was the centre of Israeli-Arab
                  relations: no peace deals, no diplomatic recognitions, no negotiations.
                  However, a 2008 Angus Reid Global Monitor poll found that 67% of
                  Palestinians and 39% of Israelis support the Arab Peace Initiative .</p>
              </div>
              <h3>The Rise of Hamas</h3>
              <div>Hamas combines Palestinian nationalism with
                  Islamic fundamentalism. Its founding charter commits the group to the
                  destruction of Israel, the replacement of the Palestinian Authority
                  with an Islamist state on the West Bank and Gaza, and to raising "the
                  banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine." Its leaders have called
                  suicide attacks the "F-16" of the Palestinian people. Hamas leader Abd
                  al-Aziz Rantisi in April 2004 that "peace talks do us no good and we do
                  not believe we can live with the enemy." In fact, Hamas rejects the
                  Arab Peace Initiative.</div>
              <p>Hamas started out as the Palestinian chapter of the
                  Muslim Brotherhood – the biggest political opposition organisation in
                  Egypt and the Middle East. It was founded in December 1987 and came to
                  prominence during the First Intifada, a popular Palestinian uprising
                  against Israeli rule that took place between 1987 and 1993. While the
                  Muslim Brotherhood has denounced violence since 1988, Hamas became well
                  known for carrying out suicide bomb attacks in Israeli and Palestinian
                  territories. Hamas’ first suicide bomb attack took place in April 1993.
                  Hamas leader even hailed the suicide bombers the “F-16s” of Palestine.
                  The United States, European Union, Japan and Israel recognise Hamas as
                  a terrorist organisation.</p>
              <p>Prior to winning the 2006 Palestinian Authority
                  General Legislative Elections, Hamas already devotes much of its
                  estimated US$70-million annual budget to an extensive social services
                  network. Hamas funds schools, orphanages, mosques, healthcare clinics,
                  soup kitchens and sports leagues. "Approximately 90 percent of its work
                  is in social, welfare, cultural, and educational activities," writes
                  the Israeli scholar Reuven Paz. This is in contrast to the Palestinian
                  Authority, which often fails to provide such services. While some
                  Palestinians perceive Hamas as a honest organisation, there are some
                  Palestinians who disagree with its terrorist policies. In comparison to
                  the corrupt Fatah that represents the Palestinian Authority, Hamas is
                  the lesser evil to the Gaza electorate. Hamas is not a better choice
                  over peace and prosperity for the whole of Palestine.</p>
              <p>The 2006 Palestinian Authority General Legislative
                  Elections established Hamas as the municipal government of Gaza Strip
                  while Fatah remains as the unity government of the Palestinian
                  Authority. Many political punters had hoped that Hamas would move away
                  from violence to achieve its political aims, yet its military wing, the
                  so-called Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade, continued to operate. Rivalry
                  between Hamas and the ruling party Fatah escalated to a military coup
                  that took place in June 2007 . Hamas seized complete control of the
                  Gaza’s municipal government, ousted Fatah’s representative on Gaza’s
                  municipal parliament and drove out the Palestinian Authority’s security
                  forces, forcing President Mahmond Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to
                  declare a state of emergency. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Ali Babacan
                  even urged Hamas to decide “whether it wants to be a political movement
                  or an armed group” . Hamas is only one step short of declaring Gaza
                  Strip independent.</p>
              <h3>Prospects of Peace</h3>
              <p>One remarkable thing to note about Israel’s
                  Operation Cast Lead was that no Arab state moved quickly to take
                  aggressive steps on Palestinians’ behalf. Apart from ritual
                  condemnation, weeks into the offensive, no Arab state had done anything
                  significant. Why is it so? The Arab states do not view the creation of
                  a Palestinian state as being in their interests. They have never
                  acknowledged Palestinian rights beyond the destruction of Israel. In
                  theory, they have backed the Palestinian cause, but in practice they
                  have ranged from indifferent to hostile toward it. Iran is the only
                  major power that is now attempting to act on behalf of the
                  Palestinians. Being a non-Arab state, Iranian involvement is regarded
                  by the Arab regimes as one more reason to distrust the Palestinians.
                  The question of an independent Palestinian state would not be settled
                  even if Israel were destroyed.</p>
              <p>All the countries bordering Palestine have serious
                  territorial claims on Palestinian lands, not to mention a profound
                  distrust of Palestinian intentions. For example, Syria view Palestine
                  as an integral part of Syria, much as they saw Lebanon and Jordan. They
                  saw the Sykes-Picot agreement  as a violation of Syrian territorial
                  integrity, and opposed the existence of an independent Jewish state for
                  the same reason they opposed Lebanese or Jordanian independence.
                  Historically, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine today were part of
                  the same province under Greater Syria. In fact, the Syrians have always
                  been uncomfortable with the concept of Palestinian statehood and
                  actually invaded Lebanon in the 1970s to destroy the Palestine
                  Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Fatah .</p>
              <p>The Hashemite Monarchy of Jordan has a far more
                  critical view of Palestinians than the Syrians. After the partition of
                  the British-administered Palestine in 1948, Jordan took control of the
                  West Bank and East Jerusalem. But there were deep tensions with the
                  Palestinians, and the Hashemite Monarchy saw Israel as a guarantor of
                  Jordanian security against the Palestinians. They never intended an
                  independent Palestinian state. Jordan could have granted Palestine
                  independence between 1948 and 1967. In September 1970, Jordan fought a
                  bloody war against the Palestinians, forcing the PLO out of Jordan and
                  into Lebanon. Half of Jordanians have Palestinian ethnicity. Jordan
                  remain very fearful that the last vestige of the Hashemite Monarchy
                  could collapse under the weight of Palestinians in the kingdom and in
                  the West Bank, paving the way for a Palestinian takeover of Jordan.</p>
              <p>Gaza and the West Bank are very different places.
                  The West Bank has a population density of a little over 600 people per
                  square mile, many living in discrete urban areas distributed through
                  rural areas. The West Bank has a much higher degree of
                  self-sufficiency, even in its current situation. Under the best of
                  circumstances, the West Bank will not be entirely dependent on external
                  economic relations. In the worst of circumstances, the West Bank will
                  not be entirely dependent on outside aid.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Gaza is about 25 miles long and
                  no more than 7.5 miles at its greatest width, with a total area of
                  about 146 square miles. Gaza has a population density of about 11,060
                  per square mile, roughly that of a city. And like a city, Gaza’s
                  primary economic activity should be commerce or manufacturing, but
                  neither is possible given the active hostility of Israel and Egypt. 95%
                  of Gaza’s economy had collapsed due to Israel’s blockade. Gaza is a
                  compact city incapable of supporting itself in its current
                  circumstances and overwhelmingly dependent on outside aid. Under the
                  best of circumstances, Gaza will be entirely dependent on external
                  economic relations. In the worst of circumstances, it will be entirely
                  dependent on outside aid. Were Gaza physically part of the West Bank,
                  it would be the latter’s largest city, making Palestine a more complex
                  nation-state.</p>
              <p>If a Palestinian state were created, it is not clear
                  that the dynamics of Gaza, the city-state, and the West Bank, more of a
                  nation-state, would be compatible. Under the best of circumstances,
                  Gaza could not survive at its current size without a rapid economic
                  evolution that would generate revenue from trade, banking and other
                  activities common in successful Mediterranean cities. But these cities
                  have either much smaller populations or much larger areas supported by
                  surrounding territory. It is not clear how Gaza could get from where it
                  is to where it would need to be to attain viability.</p>
              <p>Gaza has the military advantage of being dense and
                  urbanised. It can be defended. But it is an economic catastrophe, and
                  given its demographics, the only way out of its condition is to export
                  workers to Israel. To a lesser extent, the same is true for the West
                  Bank. Palestine has been exporting workers for generations. Any peace
                  agreement with Israel would increase the exportation of labour locally,
                  with Palestinian labour moving into the Israeli market. Therefore, the
                  paradox is that while the current situation allows a degree of autonomy
                  amid social, economic and military catastrophe, a settlement would
                  dramatically undermine Palestinian autonomy by creating Palestinian
                  dependence on Israel.</p>
              <p>One of the immediate consequences of Palestinian
                  independence would be a massive outflow of Palestinians from Gaza to
                  the West Bank. The economic conditions of the West Bank are better, but
                  the massive domestic migration would buckle the West Bank’s economy.
                  Tensions currently visible between the West Bank under Fatah and Gaza
                  under Hamas would exacerbate. The West Bank could not absorb the
                  population flow from Gaza, but Palestinians in Gaza could not remain in
                  Gaza except in virtually total dependence on foreign aid. The only
                  conceivable solution to the economic issue would be for Palestinians to
                  seek work en masse in more dynamic economies. This would mean either
                  emigration or entering the work force in Egypt, Jordan, Syria or
                  Israel. Egypt has its own serious economic troubles, and Syria and
                  Jordan are both too small to solve this problem. The only economy that
                  could employ surplus Palestinian labour is Israel’s.</p>
              <p>Security concerns apart, while the Israeli economy
                  might be able to metabolise this labour, it would turn an independent
                  Palestinian state into an Israeli economic dependency. The ability of
                  the Israelis to control labour flows has always been one means for
                  controlling Palestinian behaviour. To move even more deeply into this
                  relationship would mean an effective annulment of Palestinian
                  independence. The degree to which Palestine would depend on Israeli
                  labour markets would turn Palestine into an extension of the Israeli
                  economy. And the driver of this will not be the West Bank, which might
                  be able to create a viable economy over time, but Gaza, which cannot.
                  Accepting a Palestinian state along lines even approximating the 1948
                  partition, regardless of the status of Jerusalem, would not result in
                  an independent Palestinian state in anything but name.</p>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>The problems of an independent Palestinian state
                  will not be settled with or without the destruction of Israel. Neither
                  would any two-state solution for the Middle East situation rectify
                  complex geopolitical issues in the region.  The two-state solution is
                  merely a political rhetoric among the Arab League and the international
                  community. Palestinians would not be better off too if the Palestine
                  breaks down into 2 independent regions. The Middle East situation is
                  made further more complex as the emergence of Hamas as a key player
                  represents renewed Palestinian nationalism and militancy in the region.
                  Hamas, no doubt, is a threat to political stability and power balance
                  in the Middle East.</p>

If world leaders especially the only superpower, are sincere, the conflict can be solved.    Get the ball rolling with UN playing a pivotal role. Un must be reformed first so that it can be a leading world organisation with teeth. I hope the new Sec.Gen can do something and not be a failure, like all previous Sec.Gen.</div>

              <p>I understand that expectations of the UN have increased over the years due to its affiliated agencies such as UNIDO, UNDP, and the FAO doing extensive work in humanitarian affairs and economic development. However, it is important to remain clear that the primary function of the UN is to act as an inter-governmental forum for discussing and undertaking multilateral approaches in conflict resolution and problem solving. The UN is neither a sovereign entity (e.g. country) or an extra-sovereign entity (e.g. European Union whereby each Member State pooled its sovereignity). It cannot have any teeth. It should not have any teeth. The UN is not the world government.</p>

              But UN was formed in 1945 and it has done good job in other fields except maintaining peace.  Look at the decades-old Israel/Palestinian conflicts.   Do world leaders want it to continue to eternity?  It seems they want.
              It is time to reform UN and world leaders have to work hard.
              No point of giving statement and request for restraints to both sides whenever conflict flared up.  Meanwhile, wait until ceasefire is achieved in the Security Council and then give another statement requesting both sides to honour it. By then, massive destruction of property and loss of lives.
