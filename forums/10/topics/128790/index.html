The reason being that the British media is relatively unbridled and can dig out the low-down on his accuser (who may even sell her story to them). The widespread attention given to the case by the public endangers the possibility of Shanker getting a fair trial and the Crown Prosecution Service might decide to throw out the case altogether. It has happened before in late 2003, when several English Premiership football stars were implicated in a rape scandal, but the case was not brought to court.</div>

They work, earn almost same salary, have big careers, big post .... I really don't see female as a wearker sex that needs specific sets of laws to protect them.<br><br>I also believe Rape is Rape. No matter is which sex rape. Male rape Female, Female Rape Female, Female Rape male or male raping male. It's wrong. As for age concers, 16 years seems right to me but should cover both sex not just cover females.<br><br></div></blockquote>x2. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recommend for rape cases:<br><br>If within 24hrs or UNDER the "Time Frame of Physical Evidence to be Collected", the women "must" go thru a medical examinations for evidences of rape. Her spoken words will be taken in but should be not consider as evidence because physical evidence is enough for confirm a rape &amp; is within the "Time Frame of Physical Evidence".<br><br>If it's already more then 24hrs or OVER the "Time Frame of Physical Evidence to be Collected", the words are considered to be taken in as evidence but with doubt flavourable to the mentioned "Attacker". Basically because one should face a crime done to you rather then hide it for sometime.<br><br>I know that if sex is non consensus, there is scratch marks at the gential areas. And these marks are very different from consensus sex or even consensus don't have marks. Also body hurt marks can determine estimate time of crime occur.<br><br>Sure most have seen "CSI" (Crime Sence Investigator). Modern science is a super tools to crime. There is no doubt about science used to support laws.<br><br>For molest cases:  It's more like a Chicken &amp; Egg I feel. Just touches is pretty difficult to be proven. Both complianant &amp; defenant words are in doubt if without evidence &amp; third party proves. Sure there is some space to be "LOOKED INTO".<br><br>Or someone can invent a device to prove molest?? Something to suck up all particule on the body for evidnce?? Time to call for "Young Invertors Award"</div>

Rape victims are not compelled by law to accept family responsibilities.<br><br>If your 'responsibility' refers to criminal justice, it must be proven that the act of sexual intercourse was not concensual, and that the man was unaware that he was having sex with his rapist before he could be acquited.</div>
