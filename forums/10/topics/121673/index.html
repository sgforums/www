And then there's terrorism, national security, social security, taxes etc etc etc..<br><br>So by right, S'pore govt has it easy. S"pore is 100 times smaller in terms of size &amp; population- by right they shd be more efficient. But by practise, S'pore govt's efficiency is as long as the American federal govt's.<br><br>And get this: we are paying them big salaries- the pap mps &amp; ministers earn more than 1m dollars each- especially if u count the fact that many mps work in GLC companies as a board director or CEO.<br><br></div>

They are having problems with social security policies, health costs and education. They keep spending taxpayer's money on the military equipment and to finance the Iraq war even with the huge balance deficit. The Bush government doesn't seem to want to keep the Church and the State seperate. Even recently, they overstepped their power of authority to intervene in the judicial process in the Schiavo case. They even begin to call these judges as "activists". Decisions made by the congress is slow. If you want to compare efficiency, maybe choose some European countries like Switzerland.</div>
