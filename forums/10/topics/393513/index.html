              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; ">26 March 2009<br><strong>Jieying Loh</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal; ">Singapore has increasingly been looked upon by the international community as a role model for water management. The city-state, which has no natural aquifers or groundwater, has made tremendous progress from facing challenges in water supply to setting the standards in sustainable water management. </span></span></p>
              <h2 style="margin: 0in 12pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="color: #40839d; ">The Singapore water story</span></strong></span></h2>
              <h2 style="margin: 0in 12pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal; ">With 4.5 million people living in an area of just 700 square kilometres, coupled with few fresh water resources, managing the country’s water resource is no mean feat.</span></span></h2>
              <h2 style="margin: 0in 12pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal; ">In the 1960s and 70s, the island faced a myriad of water problems, most of them associated with accelerated urbanisation: water shortages, flooding, and pollution in its rivers. </span></span></h2>
              <h2 style="margin: 0in 12pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal; ">Today, the situation is vastly different. Thanks to a dynamic and diversified strategy to secure alternative sources of water known as the Four National Taps, Singaporeans now have good, clean drinking water at a turn of the tap. The Four National Taps refer to water from four different sources of water: water from local catchment areas, imported water, recycled water (branded as NEWater) and desalinated water. </span></span></h2>
              <h2 style="margin: 0in 12pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal; "><span style="font-size: x-small;">To date, about half of Singapore is comes under a water catchment system, with 14 reservoirs as well as an extensive network of canals and drains to harvest rainwater. This is set to increase to two-thirds by 2009 with the completion of several new reservoir schemes, including a unique “reservoir in the city”, the Marina Reservoir.</span></span></h2>
              <div class="article-content">
              <div><strong></strong> </div>
              <div><strong><span style="color: #40839d; font-size: x-small;">A new chapter</span></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">Introduced in 2003, NEWater marked a new era in Singapore’s water history. Produced using state-of-the-art membrane technologies involving microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection, the result is an ultra-clean product that has been vetted by more than 30,000 scientific tests, surpassing even the World Health Organisation standards for drinking water.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">NEWater is supplied primarily for non-domestic use in wafer fabrication parks, industrial estates and commercial buildings, where it is used for industrial and air-cooling purposes. A small percentage is mixed with raw reservoir water before being treated as drinking water. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">There are at present four NEWater plants, which can meet 15% of Singapore’s water needs, with plans for a fifth plant underway that will boost the total capacity to 30%. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong><span style="color: #40839d; font-size: x-small;">Managing demand</span></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Putting the infrastructure in place alone is not sufficient to secure Singapore’s water supplies. <strong>Demand management is also imperative for sustainability.</strong></span> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 2006 Stockholm Water Prize laureate, Professor Asit Biswas, highlighted this as a key ingredient in Singapore’s effective water management, in a study he carried out for the United Nations Human Development Report 2006. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Singapore is one of the very few countries that looks at its water supply in totality,” he said. “One of the main reasons why they are successful in managing its water supply is the concurrent emphasis on supply and demand management.”</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The country’s holistic approach to water resource management has integrated a water demand management programme that incorporates the proper handling of the transmission and distribution network to minimise losses, as well as the implementation of water conservation measures. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">This has brought about a considerable reduction in unaccounted-for water, from 11 per cent in the 1980s to 5 per cent today, one of the lowest levels in the world. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong><span style="color: #40839d; font-size: x-small;">Educating the public</span></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">Singapore considers its people as joint stakeholders of their water resources and also actively seeks to engage the community in its water management efforts. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">Since 2004, a series of public education programmes has been launched to encourage water conservation through daily habits. It has worked: the per capita consumption of water in households has inched downwards, from 165 litres a day in 2003 to 157 litres a day now.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">Individuals and organisations are also encouraged to adopt the island’s waterways, take care of it so that they learn the value of keeping it clean. PUB (Singapore’s national water agency) also actively promotes recreational activities at its reservoirs such that they are now a haven for water sports such as kayaking and wakeboarding. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">To better integrate water with the urban environment, PUB has revealed a new long-term initiative called Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters Programme, which will transform the country’s drains, canals and reservoirs into vibrant streams, rivers and lakes, creating beautiful new spaces for the community’s enjoyment.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">In addition, PUB recently launched a new lifestyle magazine called PURE to interest and educate the public on water issues. A mascot named Water Wally helps to spread the water messages to the young in a lively and interactive way. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The goal of these initiatives is to bond Singaporeans more closely with water, so that they will cherish and better appreciate this precious resource. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong><span style="color: #40839d; font-size: x-small;">Becoming a global hydrohub</span></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">Over the years, Singapore has managed to turn its water woes from a vulnerability to a strategic advantage, and more recently, a growth industry for the country.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">With the water industry projected to be worth about US$400 billion by 2015, the Singapore government has identified it as a new growth sector for the country’s economy. As such, about S$330 million will be invested in water R&amp;D over the next five years to develop Singapore into a hub for water technologies. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The country is now a hotbed for water technologies, home to a thriving cluster of more than 50 Singaporean and international water companies like CH2MHill and Black &amp; Veatch, both of whom chose Singapore as the location for their regional headquarters. In addition, industry bigwigs like Siemens Water Technologies, GE Water, Delft Hydraulics, Keppel Corporation and Hyflux have set up R&amp;D facilities in Singapore.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">In line with this strategy, Singapore has also hosted several international water conferences, which include the International Desalination Association’s World Congress on Desalination and Water Reuse, and the International Water Association – Asia-Pacific Regional Group Conference and Exhibition. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">To complement other major shows around the world, the city state is set to hold a water conference of its own this June. The inaugural Singapore International Water Week (www.siww.com.sg) is a global conference and trade show aimed at providing a platform for industry leaders and decision makers to showcase new water technologies and share best practices. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The highlight of the Singapore International Water Week is the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, which will be presented annually to an individual or organisation for outstanding contributions towards solving global water problems through innovative technologies or policies and programmes. The inaugural winner was revealed on 18 March 2008 as Dr Andrew Benedek, a Canadian researcher and successful technopreneur, who pioneered the development of low-pressure membranes that enables drinking water to be produced from even highly polluted water. Dr Benedek received a cash prize of SGD300,000, a gold medallion and award certificate, and he will deliver the inaugural Singapore Water Lecture on 24 June 2008.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Singapore International Water Week, which will be held from 23 to 27 June, is part of PUB’s overall strategy for raising the profile of Singapore’s water sector even further. “It is a major step for us in our efforts to develop Singapore into a vibrant and thriving global hydrohub.” said Mr Khoo. “It signals our strong commitment to developing the water industry in Singapore and building overseas linkages and partnerships.”</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">For its outstanding efforts in this area, PUB was given the 2007 Stockholm Industry Water Award – one of the highest accolades in the industry. The agency was also recognised by Global Water Intelligence with the 2006 Water Agency of the Year prize at its annual awards.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Stockholm Water Award Committee praised PUB for putting in place a complex yet effective water management framework that is widely accepted by both the public and the industry. Mr Khoo Teng Chye, the Chief Executive of PUB, attributed Singapore’s success to several factors. He said, “We believe that innovation is important and have always placed emphasis on R&amp;D and investing in technology. PUB has worked hard over the last 40 years to overcome our water challenges and it is through strong political will, good governance, effective implementation and a motivated workforce that we have been able to put in place a robust and sustainable supply of water in Singapore.” <span style="color: #40839d;"><span>•</span></span></span></div>

              <p>Hi Atobe, wat do u want to say? The articles u post here is in fact praising SG.</p>
              <p>u ask--</p>
              <p>Is having all the infrastructure alone enough to keep Singapore
                                          secure ?</p>
              <p>My answer is Yes!</p>
              <p>The demand side is managed very well</p>
              <p>----SG is one of lowest NRW--non revenue water in the world,ie water</p>
              <p>missing due to leaking, stolen etc. This is only abt 5 %,considered very low</p>
              <p>in first world countries city which loss abt 30 %.</p>
              <p>----lowest domestic water consumption , at about 160 liter per day /capita.</p>
              <p>Wat do u SG do more in demand side?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How abt the supply side?</p>
              <p>u read my old postings dated back to 2005 then u can know better.</p>
              <p>1.catchment aread can increase from current two third to 90 %</p>
              <p>( pl go thro PUB web site. Like other gavamna and stat boards, SG civil servants</p>
              <p>too shy to show off their skills.</p>
              <p>PUB take one step at a time. They will carry  a feasibilty study,</p>
              <p>then build one pilot plant, then build one more bigger plant to implement</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, talking about water and electricity, my native land in taiwan are more advance...we are using solar cells on top of our village house, big tank with filter to collect rain water for our use, and satellite dishes to watch our TV. Our rain is less than singapore, and yet we still collect rain water...actually, Singapore household can do the same,...collect their own rain water on top of the building, filter it thru a good system, and collectively all can use it, and also, since singapore is shiny hot all year round, those building top can install solar cell to get electricity for the building. Then as for TV, can use a big satelite dish, which can take in many world channel for free.</p>
              <p>Now, why is singapore govt not doing that??? Because..if they do it, power supply is going to close shop, Cable TV is going to close shop, and many other industrial supporting them is going to close shop and most importantly, govt will get much much less revenue leading to a total collapse...that is why our govt never promote collection of rain water, uses of solar cell and do not permit satelite dishes...antennas. And mind you, all these are clean and good for the green world</p>
