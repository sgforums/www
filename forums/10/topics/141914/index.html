            <div class='col-md body'>Today<br>11 July 2005<br><br>THE police made a late guest appearance at Saturday's launch of the latest book by opposition leader Chee Soon Juan.<br><br>Held at the Grand Plaza Parkroyal Hotel, the indoor public talk, attended by about 50 people, had ended, and the few who remained were having refreshments when the police arrived Â— after receiving word that video images had been screened.<br><br>The 2003 footage of Hong Kong residents protesting peaceably against a proposed anti-subversion law had been projected onto a screen as Dr Chee autographed copies of his book, The Power of Courage, after a Q&amp;A session.<br><br>Police spokesperson ASP Victor Keong told Today: "During the event, a video disc was screened to the public. As the disc did not possess a certificate for public exhibition, it was seized under the Films Act for investigation."<br><br>The police questioned Dr Chee and will take statements later for their investigation.<br><br>During his presentation, Dr Chee cited the "unjust" introduction of laws, as well as their selective application and interpretation, as reasons to effect political change in Singapore through non-violent campaigns.<br><br>In his book, he cited the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act as "perhaps the most damaging to the development of democracy in Singapore".<br><br>Although licensing rules for indoor public talks were eased last year when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his National Day Rally, encouraged greater freedom of expression, restrictions remain for public assemblies.<br><br>Asked why he chose the topic of non-violent civil disobedience for his sixth book, Dr Chee said there needed to be a rethink of strategy because, after 40 years, "it real1y didn't matter what civil society or political society did, because nothing changes".<br><br>The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief referred to electoral reform in particular, likening the Opposition's predicament to that of a high-jumper training to clear a certain height for a competition, only to have officials raise the bar just before he is about to jump.<br><br>The SDP has helped organise two workshops this year to train people on the principles of non-violent campaigns, with a third coming up this month.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree, CSJ should concentrate on ground issues and stop making a monkey  of himself.  This is the best time going forward for him to 'revamp' his political   style and approach.<br><br>CSJ must work hard to inspire confidence  with the people.  He must spend more tiime talking to residents  in HDB.  He also should stop wasting efforts making personal attacks on PAP people to avoid bankruptcy.  Those old guys at the PAP heirarchy are waiting to sue him again I am sure.  They are universallly famous  for  that sort of action against their opponents.<br><br>I believe Singaporeans are hoping for a dynamic and sensible  alternate leader in the oppositions to step into the political sceene.<br><br>We desperately need to get rid of the current bunch of out-of-touch and arrogant PAP oldies.<br><br></div>
