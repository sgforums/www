            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HIS HEART IN GOOD HANDS<br>Study shows doctors here well equipped for heart surgery<br>By Ng Wan Ching<br><br>December 08, 2007    </strong><br><br>FORMER police superintendent Mr Ong Lian Tat is a lucky man to be alive.<br><br>Mr Ong survived a heart attack five years ago, thanks to his surgeon's expertise. -- Picture: KELVIN CHNG<br>On his 64th birthday in September 2002, he suffered a massive heart attack.<br><br>He made it, in no small part, due to his surgeon's expertise.<br><br>Said Mr Ong: 'It was Dr Kenny Sin who operated on me and saved my life.'<br><br>As Singaporeans age, more and more will need heart surgery, say doctors.<br><br>The good news is the latest report card on heart surgery in the two public hospitals here is positive.<br><br>An information paper by the Ministry of Health shows that outcomes from the National Heart Centre (NHC) and National University Hospital (NUH) are comparable to those in developed countries for both low- and high-risk surgery.<br><br>Elective or planned surgery is usually considered lower risk.<br><br>The paper provides an overview of heart surgery outcomes at both hospitals from 2001 to 2005.<br><br>It revealed that those who undergo low-risk heart bypass surgery have a one in 1,000 to six in 1,000 chance of dying.<br><br>Those who undergo high-risk surgery have a five in 100 chance to a nine in 100 chance of dying.<br><br>Said Dr Sin, head and senior consultant, department of cardiothoracic surgery at NHC: 'The man in the street who comes for heart surgery can be assured of the best outcome.'<br><br>Mr Ong should know.<br><br>Said the grandfather of one: 'I was very lucky. Their excellent care and expertise pulled me through.'<br><br>He suffered a heart attack while parking his car near a hawker centre, and was sent to NHC.<br><br>Said Mr Ong: 'I told Dr Sin who saw me at NHC that I wanted to live, I didn't want to die. I told him he must do his best for me,' he said.<br><br>Said Dr Sin: 'Mr Ong was an emergency case. If we hadn't operated on him, he would have died within hours.'<br><br>As it was, his chances of survival did not look good. He fell in the high-risk group and Dr Sin estimated that he had a 20 in 100 to 30 in 100 chance of dying.<br><br>'We will be seeing more such high-risk patients as doctors and modern medicine extend people's lives more,' said Dr Sin.<br><br>Mr Ong lived to see his first grandchild born and is now living life to the fullest.<br><br>But as the paper reveals, the risk of dying is much lower if you undergo elective surgery rather than wait for a heart attack.<br><br>For Dr Lim Huat Seng, who has a doctorate in computer science, it was a routine check-up which saved his life.<br><br>Said Dr Lim, 63: 'I was trying to buy some retirement insurance at the time. I had had my usual annual check-up but did not do a treadmill test.'<br><br>The insurance company wanted him to go for the treadmill test. That was in May 2005.<br><br>The test uncovered something very ominous.<br><br>He had two blocked arteries, one was blocked in a critical position. If blood flow had stopped in that artery, it would have affected 70 per cent of his heart.<br><br>'If I had had a heart attack because of the blockage, it would have been an instant death,' said DrLim.<br><br>Shocked, he went for a second and a third opinion.<br><br>After the second and third doctors told him the same thing, he realised he had to have an operation.<br><br>The grandfather of three decided to get his elective bypass surgery done at NUH by Professor Lee Chuen Neng, chief &amp; senior consultant, department of cardiac, thoracic &amp; vascular surgery.<br><br>His operation was over in four hours and his recovery rapid.<br><br>'I was back at work after two weeks, even though I had a six-week MC,' said Dr Lim, WBL Corporation's group managing director of technology and manufacturing.<br><br>A month after his surgery, he was back to working 12-hour days. Today, he's travelling to the US and Europe every three to six months.<br><br>Said Prof Lee: 'Hopefully, everyone will go for regular check-ups. The outcome for an elective surgery is much better than for an emergency surgery.'<br><br>After Dr Lim's experience, many of his friends and colleagues also went for a treadmill test.<br><br>'Three of them found blockages in their arteries. But it was not as bad as mine. They are now taking medication and monitoring their conditions,' said Dr Lim.<br><br></div>
