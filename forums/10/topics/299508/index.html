They will kicked out becoz they will become corrupt due to low pay package, as suggested by the WHITES when justifying their ridiculous payrise. The Chinese people need not pay their ministers millions to defray high transportation cost. I think we are gettin short changed here. Give me a 'communist' leader anytime mate.<br><br></div>
