              <p> </p>
              <p>As United States President Barack Obama heads into his second 100 days in 
                  																	office, let's head for the big picture ourselves, the ultimate global plot 
                  																	line, the tumultuous rush towards a new, polycentric world order. In its first 
                  																	100 days, the Obama presidency introduced us to a brand new acronym, OCO - for 
                  																	Overseas Contingency Operations - formerly known as GWOT (as in "global war on 
                  																	terror").
                  																	<br> <br> Use either name, or anything else you want, and what you're really talking 
                  																	about is what's happening on the immense energy battlefield that extends from 
                  																	Iran to the Pacific Ocean. It's there that the liquid war for the control of 
                  																	Eurasia takes place.
                  																	<br> <br> Yep, it all comes down to black gold and "blue gold" (natural gas), hydrocarbon 
                  																	wealth beyond compare, and so it's time to trek back
                  																	to that ever-flowing wonderland - Pipelineistan. It's time to dust off the 
                  																	acronyms, especially the SCO or Shanghai Cooperative Organization, the Asian 
                  																	response to NATO, and learn a few new ones like IPI and TAPI. Above all, it's 
                  																	time to check out the most recent moves on the giant chessboard of Eurasia, 
                  																	where Washington wants to be a crucial, if not dominant, player.
                  																	<br> <br> We've already seen Pipelineistan wars in Kosovo and Georgia, and we've followed 
                  																	Washington's favorite pipeline, the BTC, which was supposed to tilt the flow of 
                  																	energy westward, sending oil coursing past both Iran and Russia. Things didn't 
                  																	quite turn out that way, but we've got to move on, the New Great Game never 
                  																	stops. Now, it's time to grasp just what the Asian Energy Security Grid is all 
                  																	about, visit a surreal natural gas republic, and understand why that Grid is so 
                  																	deeply implicated in the Af-Pak war.
                  																	<br> <br> Every time I've visited Iran, energy analysts stress the total "interdependence 
                  																	of Asia and Persian Gulf geo-ecopolitics". What they mean is the ultimate 
                  																	importance to various great and regional powers of Asian integration via a 
                  																	sprawling mass of energy pipelines that will someday, somehow, link the Persian 
                  																	Gulf, Central Asia, South Asia, Russia and China. The major Iranian card in the 
                  																	Asian integration game is the gigantic South Pars natural gas field (which Iran 
                  																	shares with Qatar). It is estimated to hold at least 9% of the world's proven 
                  																	natural gas reserves.
                  																	<br> <br> As much as Washington may live in perpetual denial, Russia and Iran together 
                  																	control roughly 20% of the world's oil reserves and nearly 50% of its gas 
                  																	reserves. Think about that for a moment. It's little wonder that, for the 
                  																	leadership of both countries as well as China's, the idea of Asian integration, 
                  																	of the Grid, is sacrosanct.
                  																	<br> <br> If it ever gets built, a major node on that Grid will surely be the prospective 
                  																	US$7.6 billion Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline, also known as the "peace 
                  																	pipeline". After years of wrangling, a nearly miraculous agreement for its 
                  																	construction was initialed in 2008. At least in this rare case, both Pakistan 
                  																	and India stood shoulder to shoulder in rejecting relentless pressure from the 
                  																	Bush administration to scotch the deal.
                  																	<br> <br> It couldn't be otherwise. Pakistan, after all, is an energy-poor, desperate 
                  																	customer of the Grid. One year ago, in a speech at <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/KE14Ag01.html"></a>Beijing's Tsinghua 
                  																	University, then-president Pervez Musharraf did everything but drop to his 
                  																	knees and beg China to dump money into pipelines linking the Persian Gulf and 
                  																	Pakistan with China's far west. If this were to happen, it might help transform 
                  																	Pakistan from a near-failed state into a mighty "energy corridor" to the Middle 
                  																	East. If you think of a pipeline as an umbilical cord, it goes without saying 
                  																	that IPI, far more than any form of US aid (or outright interference), would go 
                  																	the extra mile in stabilizing the Pak half of Obama's Af-Pak theater of 
                  																	operations, and even possibly relieve it of its India obsession.
                  																	<br> <br> If Pakistan's fate is in question, Iran's is another matter. Though currently 
                  																	only holding "observer" status in the SCO, sooner or later it will inevitably 
                  																	become a full member and so enjoy NATO-style, 
                  																	an-attack-on-one-of-us-is-an-attack-on-all-of-us protection. Imagine, then, the 
                  																	cataclysmic consequences of an Israeli preemptive strike (backed by Washington 
                  																	or not) on Iran's nuclear facilities. The SCO will tackle this knotty issue at 
                  																	its next summit in June, in Yekaterinburg, Russia.
                  																	<br> <br> Iran's relations with both Russia and China are swell - and will remain so no 
                  																	matter who is elected the new Iranian president next month. China desperately 
                  																	needs Iranian oil and gas, has already clinched a $100 billion gas "deal of the 
                  																	century" with the Iranians and has loads of weapons and cheap consumer goods to 
                  																	sell. No less close to Iran, Russia wants to sell them even more weapons, as 
                  																	well as nuclear energy technology.
                  																	<br> <br> And then, moving ever eastward on the great Grid, there's Turkmenistan, lodged 
                  																	deep in Central Asia, which, unlike Iran, you may never have heard a thing 
                  																	about. Let's correct that now.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>Gurbanguly is the man</strong><br> Alas, the sun-king of Turkmenistan, the wily, wacky Saparmurat "Turkmenbashi" 
                  																	Nyazov, "the father of all Turkmen" (descendants of a formidable race of 
                  																	nomadic horseback warriors who used to attack Silk Road caravans) is now dead. 
                  																	But far from forgotten.
                  																	<br> <br> The Chinese were huge fans of the Turkmenbashi. And the joy was mutual. One key 
                  																	reason the Central Asians love to do business with China is that the Middle 
                  																	Kingdom, unlike both Russia and the United States, carries little modern 
                  																	imperial baggage. And of course, China will never carp about human rights or 
                  																	foment a color-coded revolution of any sort.
                  																	<br> <br> The Chinese are already moving to successfully lobby the new Turkmen president, 
                  																	the spectacularly named Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, to speed up the 
                  																	construction of the Mother of All Pipelines. This Turkmen-Kazakh-China 
                  																	Pipelineistan corridor from eastern Turkmenistan to China's Guangdong province 
                  																	will be the longest and most expensive pipeline in the world, 7,000 kilometers 
                  																	of steel pipe at a staggering cost of $26 billion. When China signed the 
                  																	agreement to build it in 2007, they made sure to add a clever little 
                  																	geopolitical kicker. The agreement explicitly states that "Chinese interests" 
                  																	will not be "threatened from [Turkmenistan's] territory by third parties”. In 
                  																	translation: no Pentagon bases allowed in that country.
                  																	<br> <br> China's deft energy diplomacy game plan in the former Soviet republics of 
                  																	Central Asia is a pure winner. In the case of Turkmenistan, lucrative deals are 
                  																	offered and partnerships with Russia are encouraged to boost Turkmen gas 
                  																	production. There are to be no Russian-Chinese antagonisms, as befits the main 
                  																	partners in the SCO, because the Asian Energy Security Grid story is really and 
                  																	truly about them.
                  																	<br> <br> By the way, elsewhere on the Grid, those two countries recently agreed to 
                  																	extend the East Siberian-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline to China by the end of 
                  																	2010. After all, energy-ravenous China badly needs not just Turkmen gas, but 
                  																	Russia's liquefied natural gas (LNG).
                  																	<br> <br> With energy prices low and the global economy melting down, times are sure to 
                  																	be tough for the Kremlin through at least 2010, but this won't derail its push 
                  																	to forge a Central Asian energy club within the SCO. Think of all this as 
                  																	essentially an energy entente cordiale with China. Russian Deputy Industry and 
                  																	Energy Minister Ivan Materov has been among those insistently swearing that 
                  																	this will not someday lead to a "gas OPEC [the Organization of Petroleum 
                  																	Exporting Countries]" within the SCO. It remains to be seen how the Obama 
                  																	national security team decides to counteract the successful Russian strategy of 
                  																	undermining by all possible means a US-promoted East-West Caspian Sea energy 
                  																	corridor, while solidifying a Russian-controlled Pipelineistan stretching from 
                  																	Kazakhstan to Greece that will monopolize the flow of energy to Western Europe.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>The real Afghan war</strong><br> In the ever-shifting New Great Game in Eurasia, a key question - why 
                  																	Afghanistan matters - is simply not part of the discussion in the United 
                  																	States. (Hint: It has nothing to do with the liberation of Afghan women.) In 
                  																	part, this is because the idea that energy and Afghanistan might have anything 
                  																	in common is verboten.
                  																	<br> <br> And yet, rest assured, nothing of significance takes place in Eurasia without 
                  																	an energy angle. In the case of Afghanistan, keep in mind that Central and 
                  																	South Asia have been considered by American strategists as crucial places to 
                  																	plant the flag; and once the Soviet Union collapsed, control of the energy-rich 
                  																	former Soviet republics in the region was quickly seen as essential to future 
                  																	US global power. It would be there, as they imagined it, that the US Empire of 
                  																	Bases would intersect crucially with Pipelineistan in a way that would leave 
                  																	both Russia and China on the defensive.
                  																	<br> <br> Think of Afghanistan, then, as an overlooked subplot in the ongoing Liquid War. 
                  																	After all, an overarching goal of US foreign policy since president Richard 
                  																	Nixon's era in the early 1970s has been to split Russia and China. The 
                  																	leadership of the SCO has been focused on this since the US Congress passed the 
                  																	Silk Road Strategy Act five days before beginning the bombing of Serbia in 
                  																	March 1999. That act clearly identified American geostrategic interests from 
                  																	the Black Sea to western China with building a mosaic of American protectorates 
                  																	in Central Asia and militarizing the Eurasian energy corridor.
                  																	<br> <br> Afghanistan, as it happens, sits conveniently at the crossroads of any new Silk 
                  																	Road linking the Caucasus to western China, and four nuclear powers (China, 
                  																	Russia, Pakistan and India) lurk in the vicinity. "Losing" Afghanistan and its 
                  																	key network of US military bases would, from the Pentagon's point of view, be a 
                  																	disaster, and though it may be a secondary matter in the New Great Game of the 
                  																	moment, it's worth remembering that the country itself is a lot more than the 
                  																	towering mountains of the Hindu Kush and immense deserts: it's believed to be 
                  																	rich in unexplored deposits of natural gas, petroleum, coal, copper, chrome, 
                  																	talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc and iron ore, as well as precious and 
                  																	semiprecious stones.
                  																	<br> <br> And there's something highly toxic to be added to this already lethal mix: 
                  																	don't forget the narco-dollar angle - the fact that the global heroin cartels 
                  																	that feast on Afghanistan only work with US dollars, not euros. For the SCO, 
                  																	the top security threat in Afghanistan isn't the Taliban, but the drug 
                  																	business. Russia's anti-drug czar Viktor Ivanov routinely blasts the disaster 
                  																	that passes for a US/NATO anti-drug war there, stressing that Afghan heroin now 
                  																	kills 30,000 Russians annually, twice as many as were killed during the 
                  																	decade-long US-supported anti-Soviet Afghan jihad of the 1980s.
                  																	<br> <br> And then, of course, there are those competing pipelines that, if ever built, 
                  																	either would or wouldn't exclude Iran and Russia from the action to their 
                  																	south. In April 2008, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India actually 
                  																	signed an agreement to build a long-dreamt-about $7.6 billion (and counting) 
                  																	pipeline, whose acronym TAPI combines the first letters of their names and 
                  																	would also someday deliver natural gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India 
                  																	without the involvement of either Iran or Russia. It would cut right through 
                  																	the heart of Western Afghanistan, in Herat, and head south across lightly 
                  																	populated Nimruz and Helmand provinces, where the Taliban, various Pashtun 
                  																	guerrillas and assorted highway robbers now merrily run rings around US and 
                  																	NATO forces and where - surprise! - the US is now building in Dasht-e-Margo 
                  																	("the Desert of Death") a new mega-base to host President Obama's surge troops.
                  																	<br> <br> TAPI's rival is the already mentioned IPI, also theoretically underway and 
                  																	widely derided by Heritage Foundation types in the US, who regularly launch 
                  																	blasts of angry prose at the nefarious idea of India and Pakistan importing gas 
                  																	from "evil" Iran. Theoretically, TAPI's construction will start in 2010 and the 
                  																	gas would begin flowing by 2015. (Don't hold your breath.) Embattled Afghan 
                  																	President Hamid Karzai, who can hardly secure a few square blocks of central 
                  																	Kabul, even with the help of international forces, nonetheless offered 
                  																	assurances last year that he would not only rid his country of millions of land 
                  																	mines along TAPI's route but somehow get rid of the Taliban in the bargain.
                  																	<br> <br> Should there be investors (nursed by Afghan opium dreams) delirious enough to 
                  																	sink their money into such a pipeline - and that's a monumental if - 
                  																	Afghanistan would collect only $160 million a year in transit fees, a mere 
                  																	bagatelle even if it does represent a big chunk of the embattled Karzai's 
                  																	current annual revenue. Count on one thing though, if it ever happened, the 
                  																	Taliban and assorted warlords/highway robbers would be sure to get a cut of the 
                  																	action.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>A Clinton-Bush-Obama great game</strong><br> TAPI's roller-coaster history actually begins in the mid-1990s, the Clinton 
                  																	era, when the Taliban were dined (but not wined) by the California-based energy 
                  																	company Unocal and the Clinton machine. In 1995, Unocal first came up with the 
                  																	pipeline idea, even then a product of Washington's fatal urge to bypass both 
                  																	Iran and Russia. Next, Unocal talked to the Turkmenbashi, then to the Taliban, 
                  																	and so launched a classic New Great Game gambit that has yet to end and without 
                  																	which you can't understand the Afghan war Obama has inherited.
                  																	<br> <br> A Taliban delegation, thanks to Unocal, enjoyed Houston's hospitality in early 
                  																	1997 and then Washington's in December of that year. When it came to energy 
                  																	negotiations, the Taliban's leadership was anything but medieval. They were 
                  																	tough bargainers, also cannily courting the Argentinean private oil company 
                  																	Bridas, which had secured the right to explore and exploit oil reserves in 
                  																	eastern Turkmenistan.</p>
              <p>In August 1997, financially unstable Bridas sold 60% of its stock to Amoco, 
                  																	which merged the next year with British Petroleum. A key Amoco consultant 
                  																	happened to be that ubiquitous Eurasian player, former national security 
                  																	advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, while another such luminary, Henry Kissinger, just 
                  																	happened to be a consultant for Unocal. BP-Amoco, already developing the 
                  																	Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, now became the major player in what had 
                  																	already been dubbed the Trans-Afghan Pipeline or TAP. Inevitably, Unocal and 
                  																	BP-Amoco went to war and let the lawyers settle things in a Texas court, where, 
                  																	in October 1998 as the Clinton years drew to an end, BP-Amoco seemed to emerge 
                  																	with the upper hand.
                  																	<br> <br> Under newly elected president George W Bush, however, Unocal 
                  																	snuck back into the game and, as early as January 2001, was cozying up to the 
                  																	Taliban yet again, this time supported by a star-studded governmental cast of 
                  																	characters, including undersecretary of state Richard Armitage, himself a 
                  																	former Unocal lobbyist. The Taliban were duly invited back to Washington in 
                  																	March 2001 via Rahmatullah Hashimi, a top aide to "The Shadow," the movement's 
                  																	leader Mullah Omar.
                  																	<br> <br> Negotiations eventually broke down because of those pesky transit fees the 
                  																	Taliban demanded. Beware the Empire's fury. At a Group of Eight summit meeting 
                  																	in Genoa in July 2001, Western diplomats indicated that the Bush administration 
                  																	had decided to take the Taliban down before year's end. (Pakistani diplomats in 
                  																	Islamabad would later confirm this to me.) The attacks of September 11, 2001 
                  																	just slightly accelerated the schedule. Nicknamed "the kebab seller" in Kabul, 
                  																	Hamid Karzai, a former Central Intelligence Agency asset and Unocal 
                  																	representative, who had entertained visiting Taliban members at barbecues in 
                  																	Houston, was soon forced down Afghan throats as the country's new leader.
                  																	<br> <br> Among the first fruits of defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld's bombing and 
                  																	invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 was the signing by Karzai, 
                  																	Pakistani president Musharraf and Turkmenistan's president Saparmyrat Nyazov of 
                  																	an agreement committing themselves to build TAP, formally launching a 
                  																	Pipelineistan extension from Central to South Asia with brand USA stamped all 
                  																	over it.
                  																	<br> <br> Russian President Vladimir Putin did nothing - until September 2006, that is, 
                  																	when he delivered his counterpunch with panache. That's when Russian energy 
                  																	behemoth Gazprom agreed to buy Nyazov's natural gas at the 40% mark-up the 
                  																	dictator demanded. In return, the Russians received priceless gifts (and the 
                  																	Bush administration a pricey kick in the face). Nyazov turned over control of 
                  																	Turkmenistan's entire gas surplus to the Russian company through 2009, 
                  																	indicated a preference for letting Russia explore the country's new gas fields 
                  																	and stated that Turkmenistan was bowing out of any US-backed Trans-Caspian 
                  																	pipeline project. (And while he was at it, Putin also cornered much of the gas 
                  																	exports of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as well.)
                  																	<br> <br> Thus, almost five years later, with occupied Afghanistan in increasingly deadly 
                  																	chaos, TAP seemed dead-on-arrival. The (invisible) star of what would later 
                  																	turn into Obama's "good" war was already a corpse.
                  																	<br> <br> But here's the beauty of Pipelineistan: like zombies, dead deals always seem to 
                  																	return and so the game goes on forever.
                  																	<br> <br> Just when Russia thought it had Turkmenistan locked in …
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>A Turkmen bash</strong><br> They don't call Turkmenistan a "gas republic" for nothing. I've crossed it from 
                  																	the Uzbek border to a Caspian Sea port named - what else - Turkmenbashi where 
                  																	you can purchase one kilo of fresh Beluga for $100 and a camel for $200. That's 
                  																	where the gigantic gas fields are, and it's obvious that most have not been 
                  																	fully explored. When, in October 2008, the British consultancy firm GCA 
                  																	confirmed that the Yolotan-Osman gas fields in southwest Turkmenistan were 
                  																	among the world's four largest, holding up to a staggering 14 trillion cubic 
                  																	meters of natural gas, Turkmenistan promptly grabbed second place in the global 
                  																	gas reserves sweepstakes, way ahead of Iran and only 20% below Russia. With 
                  																	that news, the earth shook seismically across Pipelineistan.
                  																	<br> <br> Just before he died in December 2006, the flamboyant Turkmenbashi boasted that 
                  																	his country held enough reserves to export 150 billion cubic meters of gas 
                  																	annually for the next 250 years. Given his notorious megalomania, nobody took 
                  																	him seriously. So in March 2008, our man Gurbanguly ordered a GCA audit to 
                  																	dispel any doubts. After all, in pure Asian Energy Security Grid mode, 
                  																	Turkmenistan had already signed contracts to supply Russia with about 50 
                  																	billion cubic meters annually, China with 40 billion cubic meters and Iran with 
                  																	eight billion cubic meters.
                  																	<br> <br> And yet, none of this turns out to be quite as monumental or settled as it may 
                  																	look. In fact, Turkmenistan and Russia may be playing the energy equivalent of 
                  																	Russian roulette. After all, virtually all of Turkmenistani gas exports flow 
                  																	north through an old, crumbling Soviet system of pipelines, largely built in 
                  																	the 1960s. Add to this a Turkmeni knack for raising the stakes non-stop at a 
                  																	time when Gazprom has little choice but to put up with it: without Turkmen gas, 
                  																	it simply can't export all it needs to Europe, the source of 70% of Gazprom's 
                  																	profits.
                  																	<br> <br> Worse yet, according to a Gazprom source quoted in the Russian business daily 
                  																	Kommersant, the stark fact is that the company only thought it controlled all 
                  																	of Turkmenistan's gas exports; the newly discovered gas mega-fields turn out 
                  																	not to be part of the deal. As my Asia Times Online colleague, former 
                  																	ambassador MK Bhadrakumar put the matter, Gazprom's mistake "is proving to be a 
                  																	misconception of Himalayan proportions".
                  																	<br> <br> In fact, it's as if the New Great Gamesters had just discovered another 
                  																	Everest. This year, Obama's national security strategists lost no time 
                  																	unleashing a no-holds-barred diplomatic campaign to court Turkmenistan. The 
                  																	goal? To accelerate possible ways for all that new Turkmeni gas to flow through 
                  																	the right pipes, and create quite a different energy map and future. Apart from 
                  																	TAPI, another key objective is to make the prospective $5.8 billion 
                  																	Turkey-to-Austria Nabucco pipeline become viable and thus, of course, trump the 
                  																	Russians. In that way, a key long-term US strategic objective would be 
                  																	fulfilled: Austria, Italy and Greece, as well as the Balkan and various Central 
                  																	European countries, would be at least partially pulled from Gazprom's orbit. 
                  																	(Await my next "postcard" from Pipelineistan for more on this.)
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>IPI or TAPI?</strong><br> Gurbanguly is proving an even more riotous player than the Turkmenbashi. A year 
                  																	ago he said he was going to hedge his bets, that he was willing to export the 
                  																	bulk of the eight trillion cubic meters of gas reserves he now claims for his 
                  																	country to virtually anyone. Washington was - and remains - ecstatic. At an 
                  																	international conference last month in Ashgabat ("the city of love"), the Las 
                  																	Vegas of Central Asia, Gurbanguly told a hall packed with Americans, Europeans 
                  																	and Russians that "diversification of energy flows and inclusion of new 
                  																	countries into the geography of export routes can help the global economy gain 
                  																	stability”.
                  																	<br> <br> Inevitably, behind closed doors, the TAPI maze came up and TAPI executives once 
                  																	again began discussing pricing and transit fees. Of course, hard as that may be 
                  																	to settle, it's the easy part of the deal. After all, there's that Everest of 
                  																	Afghan security to climb, and someone still has to confirm that Turkmenistan's 
                  																	gas reserves are really as fabulous as claimed.
                  																	<br> <br> Imperceptible jiggles in Pipelineistan's tectonic plates can shake half the 
                  																	world. Take, for example, an obscure March report in the Balochistan Times: a 
                  																	little noticed pipeline supplying gas to parts of Sindh province in Pakistan, 
                  																	including Karachi, was blown up. It got next to no media attention, but all 
                  																	across Eurasia and in Washington those analyzing the comparative advantages of 
                  																	TAPI vs IPI had to wonder just how risky it might be for India to buy future 
                  																	Iranian gas via increasingly volatile Balochistan.
                  																	<br> <br> And then in early April came another mysterious pipeline explosion, this one in 
                  																	Turkmenistan, compromising exports to Russia. The Turkmenis promptly blamed the 
                  																	Russians (and TAPI advocates cheered), but nothing in Afghanistan itself could 
                  																	have left them cheering very loudly. Right now, Dick Cheney's master plan to 
                  																	get those blue rivers of Turkmeni gas flowing southwards via a future TAPI as 
                  																	part of a US grand strategy for a "Greater Central Asia" lies in tatters.
                  																	<br> <br> Still, Brzezinski might disagree, and as he commands Obama's attention, he may 
                  																	try to convince the new president that the world needs a $7.6 billion-plus, 
                  																	1,600-km steel serpent winding through a horribly dangerous war zone. That's 
                  																	certainly the gist of what Brzezinski said immediately after the 2008 
                  																	Russia-Georgia war, stressing once again that "the construction of a pipeline 
                  																	from Central Asia via Afghanistan to the south ... will maximally expand world 
                  																	society's access to the Central Asian energy market."
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>Washington or Beijing?</strong><br> Still, give credit where it's due. For the time being, our man Gurbanguly may 
                  																	have snatched the leading role in the New Great Game in this part of Eurasia. 
                  																	He's already signed a groundbreaking gas agreement with RWE from Germany and 
                  																	sent the Russians scrambling.
                  																	<br> <br> If, one of these days, the Turkmenistani leader opts for TAPI as well, it will 
                  																	open Washington to an ultimate historical irony. After so much death and 
                  																	destruction, Washington would undoubtedly have to sit down once again with - 
                  																	yes - the Taliban! And we'd be back to July 2001 and those pesky pipeline 
                  																	transit fees.
                  																	<br> <br> As it stands at the moment, however, Russia still dominates Pipelineistan, 
                  																	ensuring Central Asian gas flows across Russia's network and not through the 
                  																	Trans-Caspian networks privileged by the US and the European Union. This 
                  																	virtually guarantees Russia's crucial geopolitical status as the top gas 
                  																	supplier to Europe and a crucial supplier to Asia as well.
                  																	<br> <br> Meanwhile, in "transit corridor" Pakistan, where Predator drones soaring over 
                  																	Pashtun tribal villages monopolize the headlines, the shady New Great Game 
                  																	slouches in under-the-radar mode toward the immense, under-populated southern 
                  																	Pakistani province of Balochistan. The future of the epic IPI vs TAPI battle 
                  																	may hinge on a single, magic word: Gwadar.
                  																	<br> <br> Essentially a fishing village, Gwadar is an Arabian Sea port in that province. 
                  																	The port was built by China. In Washington's dream scenario, Gwadar becomes the 
                  																	new Dubai of South Asia. This implies the success of TAPI. For its part, China 
                  																	badly needs Gwadar as a node for yet another long pipeline to be built to 
                  																	western China. And where would the gas flowing in that line come from? Iran, of 
                  																	course.
                  																	<br> <br> Whoever "wins," if Gwadar really becomes part of the Liquid War, Pakistan will 
                  																	finally become a key transit corridor for either Iranian gas from the monster 
                  																	South Pars field heading for China, or a great deal of the Caspian gas from 
                  																	Turkmenistan heading Europe-wards. To make the scenario even more locally 
                  																	mouth-watering, Pakistan would then be a pivotal place for both NATO and the 
                  																	SCO (in which it is already an official "observer").
                  																	<br> <br> Now that's as classic as the New Great Game in Eurasia can get. There's NATO vs 
                  																	the SCO. With either IPI or TAPI, Turkmenistan wins. With either IPI or TAPI, 
                  																	Russia loses. With either IPI or TAPI, Pakistan wins. With TAPI, Iran loses. 
                  																	With IPI, Afghanistan loses. In the end, however, as in any game of high stakes 
                  																	Pipelineistan poker, it all comes down to the top two global players. Ladies 
                  																	and gentlemen, place your bets: will the winner be Washington or Beijing?</p>

              <p>India is believed to have joined Russia, the USA and Iran in a concerted front against Afghanistan's Taliban regime.<br><br>Military sources in Delhi, claim that the opposition Northern Alliance's capture of the strategic town of Bamiyan, was precipitated by the four countries' collaborative effort.<br><br>The 13 February fall of Bamiyan, after several days of heavy fighting, threatened to cut off the only land route from Kabul to Taliban troops in northern Afghanistan. However, media reports indicate that Taliban forces recaptured the town on 17 February.<br><br>India is believed to have supplied the Northern Alliance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud, with high-altitude warfare equipment. Indian defence advisors, including air force helicopter technicians, are reportedly providing tactical advice in operations against the Taliban.<br><br>Twenty-five Indian army doctors and male nurses are also believed to be treating Northern Alliance troops at a 20-bed hospital at Farkhor, close to the Afghan-Tajik border. The Statesman newspaper quoting Indian officials said the medical contingent is being financed from Delhi.<br><br>Several recent meetings between the newly instituted Indo-US and Indo-Russian joint working groups on terrorism led to this effort to tactically and logistically counter the Taliban.<br><br>Intelligence sources in Delhi said that while India, Russia and Iran were leading the anti-Taliban campaign on the ground, Washington was giving the Northern Alliance information and logistic support.</p>
              <p>Oleg Chervov, deputy head of Russia's security council, recently described Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as a base of international terrorism attempting to expand into Central Asia. Radical Islamic groups are also trying to increase their influence across Pakistan, he said at a meeting of Indian and Russian security officials in Moscow. "All this dictates a pressing need for close co-operation between Russia and India in opposing terrorism," he said.<br><br>Military sources indicated that Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are being used as bases to launch anti-Taliban operations by India and Russia.

              <p>India is believed to have joined Russia, the USA and Iran in a concerted front against Afghanistan's Taliban regime.<br><br>Military sources in Delhi, claim that the opposition Northern Alliance's capture of the strategic town of Bamiyan, was precipitated by the four countries' collaborative effort.<br><br>The 13 February fall of Bamiyan, after several days of heavy fighting, threatened to cut off the only land route from Kabul to Taliban troops in northern Afghanistan. However, media reports indicate that Taliban forces recaptured the town on 17 February.<br><br>India is believed to have supplied the Northern Alliance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud, with high-altitude warfare equipment. Indian defence advisors, including air force helicopter technicians, are reportedly providing tactical advice in operations against the Taliban.<br><br>Twenty-five Indian army doctors and male nurses are also believed to be treating Northern Alliance troops at a 20-bed hospital at Farkhor, close to the Afghan-Tajik border. The Statesman newspaper quoting Indian officials said the medical contingent is being financed from Delhi.<br><br>Several recent meetings between the newly instituted Indo-US and Indo-Russian joint working groups on terrorism led to this effort to tactically and logistically counter the Taliban.<br><br>Intelligence sources in Delhi said that while India, Russia and Iran were leading the anti-Taliban campaign on the ground, Washington was giving the Northern Alliance information and logistic support.</p>
              <p>Oleg Chervov, deputy head of Russia's security council, recently described Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as a base of international terrorism attempting to expand into Central Asia. Radical Islamic groups are also trying to increase their influence across Pakistan, he said at a meeting of Indian and Russian security officials in Moscow. "All this dictates a pressing need for close co-operation between Russia and India in opposing terrorism," he said.<br><br>Military sources indicated that Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are being used as bases to launch anti-Taliban operations by India and Russia. They also hinted at the presence of a small Russian force actively assisting Massoud in the Panjsher Valley. "The situation in Afghanistan cannot be ignored as it impinges directly on the 12-year old Kashmir insurgency," an Indian military official said, adding that the Northern Alliance's elimination by the Taliban would be "disastrous" for India.</p>
