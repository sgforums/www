              <p class="first" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan’s <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://app.mnd.gov.sg/Newsroom/NewsPage.aspx?ID=4474&amp;category=Parliamentary%20Speech&amp;year=2013&amp;RA1=&amp;RA2=&amp;RA3=">ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday</a>, which touched on town councils and the PAP-owned Action Information Management (AIM), sparked off a charged debate with some of the fiercest arguments coming from Worker’s Party (WP) chairman Sylvia Lim.  <br> <br>In rejecting the Ministry of National Development's (MND) finding that residents’ interests had not been compromised in a deal between PAP town councils and AIM, she questioned aspects of the AIM deal, like the nature of AIM and the one-month termination clause in the event the town council changed hands.<br> <br>For example, she pointed out that the timing for the 2010 sale of the IT software to AIM was questionable. <br> <br>“The timing of the sale to commence a few months before the General Elections (GE) in 2011 also calls for explanation. Was it a pure coincidence? Or was there simply a need to sell the software quickly, so that termination can be effected if political seats were lost?” she said. <br> <br>To this, the Minister replied in his <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://app.mnd.gov.sg/Newsroom/NewsPage.aspx?ID=4478&amp;category=Parliamentary%20Speech&amp;year=2013&amp;RA1=&amp;RA2=&amp;RA3=">round-up statement</a>, “First, the TCs brought in Deloitte &amp; Touche (D&amp;T) to evaluate their software, not in the year just before the 2011 GE, but as early as June 2009.” He added that the TCs’ software was also obsolete and was scheduled for replacement, with the software maintenance contract with NCS “expiring in October 2010”. <br><strong> <br>Resident’s interests at stake</strong><br> <br>Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, also attacked the reasons given for the one-month termination clause – she said they were “plainly unconvincing” and put residents’ welfare at risk. <br> <br>“First, no attempt was made to explain why a material change in membership of TC should allow unilateral termination by the contractor with one month’s notice,” she said. “The real sting of the termination clause lay in its one-month notice period. Is a one-month termination reasonable for a critical IT system? It is quite clear that time is needed to develop a system of this complexity – in the PAP’s own estimation, 18 to 24 months. Did the PAP TCs not realise that this aspect of the AIM transaction endangered the continuity of public services?  Or perhaps that was the intention in the case of a change in political leadership?” <br> <br>To this, Khaw replied, “There are now, as we have heard repeatedly, two interpretations of what actually happened. AIM insisted that it did not initiate termination and that it was the Aljunied-Hougang TC which gave notice of its intention to use its own software. Only on receipt of that notice did AIM then terminate the contract. The AHTC’s version is that they believed that it would be terminated and so decided to start sourcing for their own IT software system. The Review Team has included the full exchange of letters in their report, and we will let the readers draw their own conclusion.”<br><br>Controversy over the AIM deal first erupted last December, when the MND released its town council management report, singling out the AHTC with a “red” rating for the latter’s handling of service and conservancy charge (S&amp;CC) arrears. Lim that month explained that the town council’s audit took longer than expected because of its need to develop a new computer and financial system from scratch after having been informed in 2011 that the existing system would be terminated.<br> <br><strong>Tender truly open?</strong><br> <br>Lim also questioned on Monday the open tender for the software contract – “Was it an open tender in substance,” she asked. <br> <br>“The tender was advertised and five companies picked up the documents. However, a closer look at the Conditions of Contract will reveal that the specifications required each of the directors of the tendering company to have “adequate experience with the operations and functions of a Town Council”. I wonder how many companies in the software business in Singapore can say that all their directors have TC experience – perhaps only AIM?” she said.<br> <br>“The tender period was advertised as 14 days, shorter than the minimum period of three weeks for local tenders required under the TC Financial Rule 74(6). It was then extended by another week to give 3 weeks. Why the initial period advertised was one week less than the minimum was not explained at all in the MND report.”<br> <br>In response, Khaw pointed out that some latitude is given to TC managers and, in the case of the tender, the proper clearances had been sought for the shorter time period. It was something Lim exercised as well, Khaw said. <br><br>“The TC Financial Rules also provide latitude to TCs or their Chairmen to waive requirement to call for tender altogether. Ms Sylvia Lim would be familiar with this because she exercised this latitude when her TC waived competition and appointed FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd (FMSS) as its Managing Agent (MA) in 2011. MND left the appointment to her best judgement and did not object. We have to apply the TCs Act and the TC Financial Rules fairly, evenly and consistently,” he explained.<br> <br>Furthermore, in response to concerns raised that there was a conflict of interest when town councils deal with companies owned by political parties, Mr Khaw pointed out that FMSS is run by a husband-and-wife team who are long-time WP supporters. They, in fact, “acted as assentor and proposer to the WP team of candidates led by Mr Yaw Shin Leong to contest in Ang Mo Kio GRC in the 2006 General Election”, he said. FMSS was set up four days after the WP won Aljunied GRC and it was given a S$5.2 million-a-year contract. <br><strong> <br>Passengers in Cessna</strong><br> <br>In concluding her speech, Lim recalled an interesting episode from the Parliamentary debate in 1988 when the Town Council Bill was first presented for the Second Reading. <br> <br>“At that debate, the then First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong justified the introduction of Town Councils as providing political stabilisers to the political system. He said there was a need to protect the public by ensuring that political parties which aspired to be government should first prove that they could run a Town Council for a constituency. He said, ‘If a new party finds itself unexpectedly in government, it would be like an aspiring pilot taking over an SIA jumbo jet in mid-air before he has flown solo in a Cessna. This cannot be in the interest of passengers in the jumbo… TCs are the Cessnas of our political system.’<br> <br>“Is this what this whole AIM episode is about – ensuring that the passengers in the Cessnas have bumpy rides or even crash land?  Does the government even care about the passengers in the Cessnas, or are they simply collateral damage in a bigger political game?”<br> <br>In response, Khaw replied sternly, “Ms Sylvia Lim said that the PAP is not concerned about the passengers sitting in the Cessna getting hurt should it crash land. This is self-righteous, and – pardon me for saying so – arrogant. Many of us in this House have been serving Singaporeans for decades, long before she entered this House. Please, don’t behave as if you are the only patriot in this House.”<br><br>Lim, rising to speak right after Khaw’s round-up speech, defended herself, “I have to take issue with his ascribing to me personal motives of pride and arrogance because I think nothing can be further from the truth.  <br> <br>“The reason why we raised this matter for public discussion and debate is because we want to improve things for the future. So I definitely do not accept his ascription of those motives to me personally.”</p>

"Ms Lim has not answered a single question I asked."<br><br>"Why is Ms Lim reluctant to answer questions? What is she afraid of?" he asked.<br><br>Worker's Party Chairman Sylvia Lim has challenged Dr Teo Ho Pin to make a report to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) if he believes that the WP had mismanaged the Town Council. <br><br>In a press release in terse response to PAP Town Council chairman Dr Teo's reference on Thursday to "troubling facts" in the "questionably close relationship" that the WP has with FM Solutions and Services (FMSS), its managing agent for Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC).<br><br>"If the Minister, Dr Teo or the Ministry believe there was any wrongdoing in WP's management of the Town Council, we invite them to make a report to the CPIB or other relevant agencies to investigate the matter, rather than to make these suggestions and insinuations," read the statement. <br><br>"We assure these agencies of our full cooperation." <br><br>Lim also said that it was "most regrettable" and "disappointing" that Dr Teo and Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan had chosen to "distract the public" by "casting aspersions on WP's management of the Town Council", the allegations made by Dr Teo had already been addressed in Parliament or via media statements issued by AHPETC. <br><br>Lim said that Dr Teo's question on why WP had chosen to appoint a Managing Agent to run its Town Council "should be clear" to him, as almost all PAP Town Councils also appoint Managing Agents. <br><br>She also accused Dr Teo of misrepresenting her response in Parliament during a debate with Khaw over Managing Agent rates. <br><br>"He said that I was “not sure of the unit rates paid by AHTC to FMSS”. I am surprised, as this is clearly different from what was correctly recorded in the draft Hansard which all MPs had received by Tuesday 14 May. I said I needed to double-check the prices the Minister quoted on property units because I thought there might be some errors in the prices that he mentioned, and that we needed to ensure that the comparisons were made on the same basis," clarified Lim. <br>
              <p id="yui-tmp-27" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The press release even included a table charting the distinctions between the controversial AIM transaction and WP's appointment of FMSS, pictured below. <br><br><span id="yui_3_0_0-2-1368710371340211" class="yui-editorial-embed"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-left" style="clear: both; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 11px; display: block; width: 630px;"><img class="editorial " style="display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;" title="WP released a press statement on Thursday with a table explaining its position" src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/3qYgRS19Y2LQDIOJI4S72Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/249/2013/05/16/WPtable-jpg_134413.jpg" alt="" width="630"><span class="legend" style="display: block; margin: 5px 0px 0px; font-family: arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.7em; color: #414141; padding: 0px;">WP released a press statement on Thursday with a table explaining its position</span></span></span></p>
              <br>WP's statement comes as the opposition party's latest salvo in the war of words taking place in Parliament over the AIM saga. <br><br>PAP(People's Action Party) Town Council coordinating chairman Teo Ho Pin had earlier attacked the <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://wp.sg/">Workers' Party</a>'s (WP's) relationship with its town council managing agent.<br><br>In <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="https://www.facebook.com/TeoHoPin/posts/464174723658966">a 13-paragraph statement</a> he posted on his <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="https://www.facebook.com/TeoHoPin">Facebook page</a>, Ho repeated details raised by National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan in <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/khaw-boon-wan-and-sylvia-lim-engage-in-fierce-debate-over-aim-deal-002735963.html">closing remarks</a> on Monday in Parliament on “troubling facts” and the questionably close relationship that the WP has with its managing agent for <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://www.ahpetc.sg/">Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council</a> (AHPETC), <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://www.fmsolutions.com.sg/">FM Solutions and Services</a> (FMSS).<br>
              <p class="first" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><br>Among other things, Ho said AHPETC chairman Sylvia Lim, who is also WP chairman, needs to explain why her town council "gave more than $26 million of public funds in contracts to close associates", and why it paid "significantly higher than normal" management fees than Aljunied Town Council's previous managing agent.<br><br>Ho also accused Lim of "trying to obfuscate the public with wrong calculations on how much FMSS charged AHTC", in reference to an exchange between the MND and the town council, where the two disputed the rates that were paid by AHPETC to FMSS.<br><br>Delving further into the exchange of words on rates paid, Ho said even at Lim's raised managing agent rate of <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://www.ahpetc.sg/media-release-15-may-2013/">$7.58 per unit</a>, after including commercial property, as opposed to her <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://www.ahpetc.sg/media-release-14-may-2013/">initial figure of $7.01</a>, which only factored in residential units, the MND said the contract value over a three-year period would amount to $15.8 million, short of the $16.8 million Lim declared to the Housing Development Board in 2012.<br><br>"Where is the missing $1 million?" he asked, also probing further into the status of FMSS's owners, husband-and-wife team How Weng Fan and Danny Loh, with the town council.<br><br>"Do they draw salaries as employees of the Town Council (being General Manager and Deputy Secretary respectively)?" he asked. "As Mr Loh and Ms How do business with the TC through FMSS which they own and profit — do they get paid twice?" â€¨â€¨Ho further mentioned that the town council could have employed How directly to manage the town in the way Hougang Town Council had done, instead of forming a separate company.<br><br>"The WP MPs in AHTC owe it to the residents of Aljunied and Hougang, as well as Singaporeans in general, to give full answers to (the questions he raised)," concluded Ho.<br><br>Ho's statement follows a <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/khaw-boon-wan-and-sylvia-lim-engage-in-fierce-debate-over-aim-deal-002735963.html">fiery debate on Monday evening</a> in Parliament between Khaw and WP chairman Sylvia Lim over a <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/town-council-spat-puts-spotlight-on-pap-042316314.html">controversial sale</a> of the PAP Town Councils' computer software system to a party-owned company called Action Information Management (AIM). <br><br>The exchange eventually saw Khaw turning the tables on WP, drawing scrutiny on the AHPETC's transactions with FMSS from the time the party took over Aljunied GRC in May 2011.</p>

That was why the PAP set up AIM in 1991: to ensure that residents living in PAP-run town councils would be well served," he pointed out.<br> <br><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;">Handover of TCs<br></strong><br>He acknowledged, however, that there are gaps in the handing over of town councils and that this issue needs to be addressed.<br><br>He noted that the MND review team made some "useful recommendations" to institutionalise some change-over rules, to minimise disruptions to critical services during a change in leadership. <br><br>These recommendations include: putting in place contractual provisions for automatic one-off extensions following an election when there is a change of party in charge of the council, setting a minimum notice period for termination initiated by the contractor or key appointment holders such as general managers.<br><br>The town councils themselves, he said, have suggested that MND should consider extending the period of handover, and play a greater role in the process. <br><br>"These are all useful suggestions and MND will take them in when it updates the town councils' rules,"  Khaw said.<br> <br>He also said Senior Minister of State for National Development Lee Yi Shyan has been appointed to undertake MND's review on the framework for town councils. <br><br>Khaw said at least three areas needed to be looked at: <br>1) town councils' duties and responsibilities vis-à-vis HDB's<br>2) adequacy of town councils' sinking funds and their long term financial sustainability<br>3) hand-over and transition arrangements when MPs change. <br><br>He also that Singapore should not return to the time when HDB administered estates all over Singapore, and MPs had no authority or responsibility over what is done or how well things work.<br><br>Earlier in May, MND said its probe into the sale of the PAP's Town Council management software to AIM found no evidence of any misuse of public funds.<br> <br>A report submitted to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong by MND found that the AIM deal had complied with the Town Councils Act and Town Council Financial Rules.<br> <br>In its findings, the report stated that the main issue at hand was whether the interests of residents had been protected, if there had been a conflict of interest for the parties in the deal and if there had been any misuse of public funds.<br><br><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;">--With additional reporting by Jeanette Tan</strong></em></p>

              <p class="first" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan’s <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://app.mnd.gov.sg/Newsroom/NewsPage.aspx?ID=4474&amp;category=Parliamentary%20Speech&amp;year=2013&amp;RA1=&amp;RA2=&amp;RA3=">ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday</a>, which touched on town councils and the PAP-owned Action Information Management (AIM), sparked off a charged debate with some of the fiercest arguments coming from Worker’s Party (WP) chairman Sylvia Lim.  <br> <br>In rejecting the Ministry of National Development's (MND) finding that residents’ interests had not been compromised in a deal between PAP town councils and AIM, she questioned aspects of the AIM deal, like the nature of AIM and the one-month termination clause in the event the town council changed hands.<br> <br>For example, she pointed out that the timing for the 2010 sale of the IT software to AIM was questionable. <br> <br>“The timing of the sale to commence a few months before the General Elections (GE) in 2011 also calls for explanation. Was it a pure coincidence? Or was there simply a need to sell the software quickly, so that termination can be effected if political seats were lost?” she said. <br> <br>To this, the Minister replied in his <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://app.mnd.gov.sg/Newsroom/NewsPage.aspx?ID=4478&amp;category=Parliamentary%20Speech&amp;year=2013&amp;RA1=&amp;RA2=&amp;RA3=">round-up statement</a>, “First, the TCs brought in Deloitte &amp; Touche (D&amp;T) to evaluate their software, not in the year just before the 2011 GE, but as early as June 2009.” He added that the TCs’ software was also obsolete and was scheduled for replacement, with the software maintenance contract with NCS “expiring in October 2010”. <br><strong> <br>Resident’s interests at stake</strong><br> <br>Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, also attacked the reasons given for the one-month termination clause – she said they were “plainly unconvincing” and put residents’ welfare at risk. <br> <br>“First, no attempt was made to explain why a material change in membership of TC should allow unilateral termination by the contractor with one month’s notice,” she said. “The real sting of the termination clause lay in its one-month notice period. Is a one-month termination reasonable for a critical IT system? It is quite clear that time is needed to develop a system of this complexity – in the PAP’s own estimation, 18 to 24 months. Did the PAP TCs not realise that this aspect of the AIM transaction endangered the continuity of public services?  Or perhaps that was the intention in the case of a change in political leadership?” <br> <br>To this, Khaw replied, “There are now, as we have heard repeatedly, two interpretations of what actually happened. AIM insisted that it did not initiate termination and that it was the Aljunied-Hougang TC which gave notice of its intention to use its own software. Only on receipt of that notice did AIM then terminate the contract. The AHTC’s version is that they believed that it would be terminated and so decided to start sourcing for their own IT software system. The Review Team has included the full exchange of letters in their report, and we will let the readers draw their own conclusion.”<br><br>Controversy over the AIM deal first erupted last December, when the MND released its town council management report, singling out the AHTC with a “red” rating for the latter’s handling of service and conservancy charge (S&amp;CC) arrears. Lim that month explained that the town council’s audit took longer than expected because of its need to develop a new computer and financial system from scratch after having been informed in 2011 that the existing system would be terminated.<br> <br><strong>Tender truly open?</strong><br> <br>Lim also questioned on Monday the open tender for the software contract – “Was it an open tender in substance,” she asked. <br> <br>“The tender was advertised and five companies picked up the documents. However, a closer look at the Conditions of Contract will reveal that the specifications required each of the directors of the tendering company to have “adequate experience with the operations and functions of a Town Council”. I wonder how many companies in the software business in Singapore can say that all their directors have TC experience – perhaps only AIM?” she said.<br> <br>“The tender period was advertised as 14 days, shorter than the minimum period of three weeks for local tenders required under the TC Financial Rule 74(6). It was then extended by another week to give 3 weeks. Why the initial period advertised was one week less than the minimum was not explained at all in the MND report.”<br> <br>In response, Khaw pointed out that some latitude is given to TC managers and, in the case of the tender, the proper clearances had been sought for the shorter time period. It was something Lim exercised as well, Khaw said. <br><br>“The TC Financial Rules also provide latitude to TCs or their Chairmen to waive requirement to call for tender altogether. Ms Sylvia Lim would be familiar with this because she exercised this latitude when her TC waived competition and appointed FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd (FMSS) as its Managing Agent (MA) in 2011. MND left the appointment to her best judgement and did not object. We have to apply the TCs Act and the TC Financial Rules fairly, evenly and consistently,” he explained.<br> <br>Furthermore, in response to concerns raised that there was a conflict of interest when town councils deal with companies owned by political parties, Mr Khaw pointed out that FMSS is run by a husband-and-wife team who are long-time WP supporters. They, in fact, “acted as assentor and proposer to the WP team of candidates led by Mr Yaw Shin Leong to contest in Ang Mo Kio GRC in the 2006 General Election”, he said. FMSS was set up four days after the WP won Aljunied GRC and it was given a S$5.2 million-a-year contract. <br><strong> <br>Passengers in Cessna</strong><br> <br>In concluding her speech, Lim recalled an interesting episode from the Parliamentary debate in 1988 when the Town Council Bill was first presented for the Second Reading. <br> <br>“At that debate, the then First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong justified the introduction of Town Councils as providing political stabilisers to the political system. He said there was a need to protect the public by ensuring that political parties which aspired to be government should first prove that they could run a Town Council for a constituency. He said, ‘If a new party finds itself unexpectedly in government, it would be like an aspiring pilot taking over an SIA jumbo jet in mid-air before he has flown solo in a Cessna. This cannot be in the interest of passengers in the jumbo… TCs are the Cessnas of our political system.’<br> <br>“Is this what this whole AIM episode is about – ensuring that the passengers in the Cessnas have bumpy rides or even crash land?  Does the government even care about the passengers in the Cessnas, or are they simply collateral damage in a bigger political game?”<br> <br>In response, Khaw replied sternly, “Ms Sylvia Lim said that the PAP is not concerned about the passengers sitting in the Cessna getting hurt should it crash land. This is self-righteous, and – pardon me for saying so – arrogant. Many of us in this House have been serving Singaporeans for decades, long before she entered this House. Please, don’t behave as if you are the only patriot in this House.”<br><br>Lim, rising to speak right after Khaw’s round-up speech, defended herself, “I have to take issue with his ascribing to me personal motives of pride and arrogance because I think nothing can be further from the truth.  <br> <br>“The reason why we raised this matter for public discussion and debate is because we want to improve things for the future. So I definitely do not accept his ascription of those motives to me personally.”</p>
