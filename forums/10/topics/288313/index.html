I fail to see the connection between economics and politics ... okie, so what if chevron's investments is being scrutinized by the US congress ? ... so what if they pull out ? ... sinopec moves in then ... what about sudan, darfur ? sure, we get floods of sudanese refugees in canada, sure, the vegetarian leftist hippie fringe on campus organizes talks and slideshows on darfur, but hey, I just saw an ad on the local newspaper for drillers in sudan and the niger delta ... how does C$300k a year grabs you ? ... corporations are not driven by ethics or morales, nor the "political attractiveness" of a particular country, and, in this age of global competition, national laws handicapping corporations do nothing but shoot their own national companies in the foot ... it also doesn't fly, cos there are plenty of other countries that would gladly fill in the vaccuum ... and with the economic clout of the world shifting to asia, it doesn't matter anymore ... pragmatism overrides everything, take for example yahoo ... yahoo is a spent force in china, not because they were party to the arrest of some two bit dissident, but because the chinese people see them as being hamstrung by the US goverment ... google does the same thing, filtering searches and all that in china, (try falungong on google.cn) ... but they are winning, cos they have managed to posture themselves as apolitical ... (but of course, sohu and baidu are the biggest winners, cos you can search for copyrighted stuff easily ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>and what do you know or think about our branding abroad ? .... what do you think our branding abroad is ? ... let me tell you ... a few articles by leftist militant liberal reporters is not representative of how singapore is viewed abroad, the kind of  exposure we get through certain foreign reporters whenever we hang some wretched drug trafficker is not representative of how we are viewed abroad ... we are still new to this game of thoughts, yes, our press is not completely bias free, thus whenever we read foreign media pieces about our politics, we view it as new, refreshing, novel, inspiring, we read and learn about abstract notions of personal liberty and freedom much brandied about by certain sectors of the foreign press ...  but no one really gives a flying fark over here, cos you see and read about such things everywhere everyday ... you read about liberals scandals, you read about conservative scandals, I gave up reading the local newspapers a year after I got here, I got jaded, as have most of the locals, information overload I call it ... people become apathetic, jaded, that's why I say people like CSJ can only survive in a climate like ours, which he has to thank for,cos anywhere else he'd  belong to nowhere but the lunatic fringe, and become politically extinct ... we don't have to go far, you think he'll be a viable newsmaker in say, taiwan ? ... in anycase, you'd be surprised by how positive our international image is ... people do not form their opinions solely from what they read from the media alone ... they travel around the region on business, and singapore stands out like an oasis of peace and prosperity in a third world shit hole ... sure, we can't chew gum and we are forced to flush our toilets on the pain of a fine ... but are we run by a military junta ? do we have death squads dragging people away in the dark of the night ? ...<br><br>I'm sorry, but I think you'd have to support your statements with more substantial examples to show the links between economics and politics ...</div>

I am right of center,  because I tried out the leftist vegetarian hippie fringe before and found them wanting, more form than substance, ... they see what they wanted to see, and were just rebels trying to find a cause in something, most often they have no idea what they were talking about ... one of those pot heads once told me that he pitied me to have come from an undemocratic country ... I was curious ... and asked him if he knew where Singapore was ... he didn't, it slowly dawned on me that he was actually talking about China ... and no, he didn't know the current president of china either .... that's the kind of lunatic fringers that typified those people ... more form than substance ... but then perhaps it's just me, I was a science major ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I believe in pragmatism, in the good of the people being the highest law ... I also have this deeply oriental desire for peace and stability, and the harmony of the society. That is why I have emphasized time and again the dangers of swallowing wholesale certain liberal abstract notions of personal freedoms etc etc ... simply because people have to be taught about the responsibility that comes with certain things, if ever ... take holland for example, remember van Gogh's stabbing ? or the prophet cartoons ? ... imagine this happening in singapore ...<br><br>China ? sure, china's development isn't smooth going, but I see wages disparity, corruption and all that as economic and social problems, not political, I wonder if you have ever talked to any educated chinese before, the country has political subtleties and nuances that are often invisible to the rest of the world (read: biased, occidental minds) ... have you ever surfed chinese forums before ? ... taken a look at their political discussions ? ... it can be more virulent than anything sammyboy's can dish out ... but nothing is done to them, the servers are even hosted in country ! ... I was curious about this, and some PRC enlightened me to some of the subtleties involved; it's alright to complain and whine, infact when the calls get strident enough, the central goverment do take notice, quite a few grafters were caught that way ... but when you organize ... when you bring your complaints abroad ... airing the dirty linen internationally .... things change .... which to me is perfectly acceptable, and a very asian way of doing things ... certain things belongs only to the domain of the "family" and the "family" alone ...<br><br>outsourcing eh ? ... okie, so what are the whole world outsourcing low level production to china ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ... enough about that, as for the power of the press goes, like I said, very often, because our exposure to the media circus that masquerades as the international press is new, we tend to view what appear in certain columns or articles as representative of another society, don't you suppose, that if the ST is in no way representative of what the singaporean ground feels, it would also be the same for foreign media ? even more so, we have to reconcile our minds to the fact that the foreign media is also in no way representative of the views and the stance of their respective national goverments ... that is what an independent press means, ironically, no ? ... otherwise, doesn't it imply that the press in other countries are somehow "controlled" ? .... go chew on that ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I wonder if people remember the australian press' coverage of the nyugen druggie hanging ... I followed that avidly, and it left a bad taste in my mouth more than anything else, most of the stuff was sensational tabloid folder, interspersed with commentary from leftists reporters and people with agendas like our very own CSJ, I shall always remember the piece about the chap being hung by the neck until shit flows and his eyes and tongue bulges out ... or how they cornered and entrapped the hang man that was supposed to perform the execution, of how the chap's body being carried in the open to a waiting van by this undertaker's service company got constructed as singapore goverment not giving his body due dignity even after the execution ... what would a thinking man make of all this ? ... or do people just see what they would like to see ? .... or, after reading the varied comments on news.au's forums ... can we continue to see their media's bias as representative of the australian public ? ....<br><br>it doesn't matter really ... because the only consequence in this age of boundaryless media ... is that the "truth" gets buried underneath a mountain of opinions and biased drivel ... the internet age did not make the media more powerful ... it only made the whole enterprise loose it's credibility ... you watch ... people like CSJ will become politically extinct once our press and society opens up further .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
