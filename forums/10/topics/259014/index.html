Oakwell responded that it was for Canadian courts to decide on this, based on the criteria laid out by the courts. Among other things, it pointed out that Enernorth had neither alleged bias nor contested the Singapore courts' jurisdiction when the case was heard in Singapore. [b]When the case was moved to Canada, two of Enernorth's expert witnesses Â– including Francis Seow Â– had admitted they were unaware of any commercial case from Singapore that had been attacked as unfair or biased. In January 2007, the Supreme Court, presided over by Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, dismissed Enernorth's appeal and ordered it to bear the costs of the appeal.[</strong>2]"<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakwell_Engineering_v._Enernorth_Industries" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakwell_Engineering_v._Enernorth_Industries</a><br><br>What a joker you are!
