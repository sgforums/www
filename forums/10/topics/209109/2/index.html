            <div class='col-md body'>Education is one of the policy to help singaporeans fight against globalisation for a more skill worker is paid more and has a lesser chance to face unemployment. Scholarship is one type of subsidy given by government to help to develope talent and most importantly offer students who are doing well a chance to further their studies to the fullest. Most importantly scholarship are also known as a form of subsidy to help poorer student.<br><br>However scholarship (esp the most prestigious) are given to foreigner or ppl who are well to do enough to afford the fees of oversea education. This leads to a Q which many neglect is singaporeans less hardworking, are not as clever? Or it just point to a unfair playing field for the help they are given in the course of their studies also plays an important role in them achieving good grades. Personally i believee that its the later.<br><br>Aiiii without a level playing field to allow average singaporeans to achieve their full potential or even exceed it how are average singaporeans ever going to survive in a dod eat dog world when globalisation sets in fully.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore: Place or nation?<br>By Linda Lim, For The Straits Times<br>Jun 19, 2006<br><br>..........<br><br>In the capital- and talent-intensive field of the life sciences, foreign talent is imported (sometimes by paying above-world-market rates), and capital subsidies provided to foreign firms, to produce medical breakthroughs for global consumers.<br><br>This might make Singapore a profitable place for parts of the life sciences' global value chain to locate. But it is not clear where Singapore the nation benefits, since the jobs, profits and goods are produced overwhelmingly by and for foreigners. In this case, the Singapore state may be seen as acting as a steward of the interests of non-Singaporeans.<br><br>...........<br><br>Singapore-born Dr Linda Lim is a professor of strategy at the University of Michigan who has taught in the US for 20 years. The above is an extract of her recent lecture to Singaporean students.<br><br>yes, we can't block globalisation but we don't have to be a steward of the interest of foreigners, right?<br></div>
