            <div class='col-md body'>THE way Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew sees it, the march of globalisation is unavoidable.<br>And even if a country should block it, it will find itself sidelined after a while, he predicted.<br><br>As it is, every economy, in varying degrees, is exposed to globalisation and feeling its many unforeseen consequences.<br><br>The Americans, for example, are already unhappy. Outsourcing is hitting not just their white-collar jobs, but also high-level professional positions such as radiographers, accountants and software programmers.<br><br>Mr Lee was responding to a question on how he saw globalisation unfolding, during a dialogue with unionists to mark the NTUC's 45th anniversary.<br><br>He replied by referring to a comment by former World Bank economic adviser Joseph Stiglitz that whether a country benefits or loses from globalisation depends on how it positions itself.<br><br>The Nobel prize-winning economist also noted, he said, that one could not assume the developed countries would continue to support globalisation. They might grow reluctant as more of their top end, the white-collar professionals, lose their jobs.<br><br>Hence, the mood in the United States may change, and its leaders may not want any more free trade agreements so other economies will not grow so fast. In this way, they hope to protect their jobs.<br><br>Mr Lee said that while the US could afford to do that because of its size, Singapore could not take such a path. 'We will stagnate. We will perish.'<br><br>But he believes the US will still have to open up. 'My own gut instinct tells me in the end, it's unavoidable. If you don't do it in America, you don't outsource, then the British will, the Japanese will. You can block it for a while, but it then becomes too high-cost. Your economy is not productive.'<br><br>Singapore's approach has been to manage the effects of globalisation. 'There will be casualties along the way. It is the job of the Government to try and manage and redress the balance as best as we can... never make it equal, but we must try to alleviate the dislocation.'<br><br>Straits Times 7 Sept</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that we cannot block globalisation but the gov is not doing the right thing with UNREGULATED influx of FT into singapore to solve the problem which instead might make thing worse just like the infamous stop at two policy which lead to population aging problem we see today. As usual, the citizen have no say politically. The only thing we can do is to take on the wave and adapt to the changing environment to compete with the FT in the job market to survive. Work hard and spend less is the key. Singapore had became just a working office instead of home to many who had learned to adapt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>at this point in time, it is the rich countries that benefit more from globalization than poorer ones. hence, whatever capitalist media talk and text book theories about globalization is sure to sing high praises about this phenomena without even mentioning some of its ill effects and in more severe cases, how globalization may be mismanaged and bring more harm to a country. Yes, it is easy for some big shot with a million dollar salary to just go about like a broken record  selling to its citizens to sacredly embrace 'globalization'. but will the benefits (and ill effects) ever be clearly known? you see, globalization is a double edged sword. It is just the same as some would argue that protectionism is wrong/bad? The problem with these arguments/non-arguments is that, people tend to go the extremes of the spectrum without understanding their impacts. well, haven't we heard something about a 'balanced approach'? Just as there are all the good things to hear, there are also bad things maybe some would not like you to know? everytime we read the state controlled media splashed with grandiose speeches, take a step back and think, is there something wrong with this statement? Are they half-baked potatoes? Why are they going with such desperation to open the gates wide? Have they dissected every possible issues etc...Do a research on the Internet and challenge the authorities with more questions and issues as the ramnifications for these policies have far wide reaching effects and they are paid to be accountable to their citizens. it is your every entitlement to know the truth.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">In the end, who really benefit from globalization??</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When people think of globalisation most of them relate it to outsoursing. A scenario that greatly threaten the jobs of professionals in the developed counrty an example is the radiologists as mention by MM Lee. As the world become a smaller place as a result of great advancement in science and technology outsourcing of jobs to save cost. Everyone will be affected by the change of tides.<br><br>Now a question arises which jobs will not be affected by globalisation. The most obvious one will be to be a politician or a military general surely the country will not outsource the jobs. What about the private sector? Jobs that require immediate action, flexible thinking and indept knowledge in other words u are indispensible will be the savest. Such exemples are ER doctors, professionals doing important research or even private bankers.<br><br>It seems that globalisation will lead to many losing their jobs. It does not seem to be beneficial. However, when the world becomes smaller one need not limit himself to jobs that within his country. One can conclude their there are more job opportunities around. In the end one will have a job but it might not be a high paying one. The reason why people cant find jobs oversea is due to both the beureacratic redtape and also the lack of information.<br><br>For people who are content in just having a job globalisation might be good news. Those who want a high paying stable job globalisation will be their nemesis.</div>
