              <p>The Taiwanese "hum" is perfect in its timing to spam its irreverent replies that distract the thread again.</p>
              <p>Is the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">giving to durian puffs girlfriens some mango in exchange for 2 pieces of durian cake</span></em>" - an appropriate reply to the thread starter's effort to have a decent exchange of "<strong>a free market economy in a society with unbridled capitalism</strong>" ?</p>
              <p>The trading of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">mango in exchange for 2 pieces of durian cake</span></em>" is no more then personal barter trading.</p>
              <p>Does it take any semblance of the macro level that the thread starter had intended ?</p>
              <p>The imbecile "hum" cannot even appreciate the intent of the thread but will simply jump into one simply to score another for the record.</p>

              <p>I can offer no advice. But just sharing a thought with you.</p>
              <p>Capitalism means many things to many different people. Ultimately, one simply word to describe it is greed.</p>
              <p>A monk seeks nothing, wants nothing, does nothing. He prays and meditates on scriptures or sutras. Can he create a market?</p>
              <p>Since the dawn of civilisation when mankind became farmers under tribal system of governance, they had excess food when the harvest came in. Rather than to let it rot, they sold such excesses to others, such as fishermen. Trade developed, and a whole range of industries spouted with such wealth - lumberjacks, stone masons, etc, paid with such wealth created.</p>
              <p>As mankind improved and grown wealthier, it was often the tribal leaders who had the most wealth, being the bossman of the tribe. He alone could either distribute such wealth or keep it under his control.</p>
              <p>Being rich, he dictates and direct economic efforts. Scientific progress led to greater improvements of his and his society surroundings, paid thru the wealth he and his society gain.</p>
              <p>He could have remain as he was, a jungle village or a thriving metropolis. He had that choice. Many of our ancestors choosed the metropolis, and thus capitalism was founded.</p>
              <p>Democracy or Communism, that aspect of capitalism had never disappear. It had always been in mankind who traded its excess goods and resources. Democrats redistribute their wealth, but communists used it unwisely - traded valuable resources to build up their power and control over the population, as proven by the russians and chinamen.</p>
              <p>No. we will all be monks only if capitalism do not exist.</p>

              <p>The words capital refer to money, people created money in exchange for goods, in early years, where is no money or capital, people uses silver or gold to exchange for goods in a free market, and further than that, before gold and silver was said to be precious metal, people used goods in exchange for goods, in a free markets, no capital inolved. Each family of village will do certain job that does not contradict much on each other, just like a foodcourt,, it cannot be like all selling mee siam mai hum dish. So if A family grow rice, B family will grow vege and C family will take care of pig, chicken, cow etc etc and so on. Then they come to the market for a free exchange. Therefore, it is possible.</p>
              <p>People created money because many of them dun want to plough the land or take care animals, they simply wants to be the middle man or sit and cheat others by creating Capital as the new order of the world</p>

              <p>The TS actually asked TWO different questions.</p>
              <p>One in the title of this thread, and the other in his 1st post.</p>
              <p>As answered and explained by my personal and simplified view on my initial post, there can be no free market w/o capitalism.</p>
              <p>However, to answer to TS second question, now that I have time to share a thought, I doubt if there can be free market economy in a society with unbridled capitalism.</p>
              <p>Unbridled would mean unrestrained or uncontrolled. If I did not misinterprete TS at word value, he would mean a free market economy in a society with uncontrolled capitalism.</p>
              <p>Unbridled capitalism within a democracy would mean less or no govt control and regulation, and allow the market to be dictated by free enterprise - in other words - the law of the jungle applies - survival of the fittest. No level playing field. No unions. No laws save constitutional laws of the land. The govt is supposed to shut up where biz is concern.</p>
              <p>Civilised human beings did not step out of the jungle for nothing. Jungle laws were harsh, terrifying and would only doom a tribe to extinction, even with the supposition that the tribe was made up of noble people, which we know nobility is not gifted in equal measure to every human.</p>
              <p>Even if the financial crisis had not happened, without govt regulation corporations will instead become dictators of the economy, with their bottomlines being the reason of the existance or annihilation.</p>
              <p>Everything else are illusions and the goal is to achieve the targetted bottomlines to pay off shareholders - no reason, no law, no concern, and espacially no welfare to anyone, any society and employees, nothing must get in their way, everything and everyone a fair game, everything to be achieve at any costs, even murder as long as one doesnt get caught. The mighty bottomline is the final reward, which will flow into theirs and their shareholders pockets.</p>
              <p>Nope. Private enterprises should be free from govt interferences, but there must be regulations to ensure a cowboy free for all culture do not exist.</p>

              <p>Why has the X-rated Fraud missed the glaring fact the Government in Singapore is above the Law, when the Government becomes a  participant in the free economy as part of "capitalism" or "unbridled Capitalism" - and becomes the worst of Capitalism with Government powers to abuse the "<strong>Free Market Economy</strong>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the X-rated Fraud too ashamed to mention the fact that the Singapore Government is not only a Political Autocrat but had also become "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">dictators of the economy</span></em>" ?</p>

              <p>Obviously, the ignorance of the X-rated pseudo-intellect will overlook the Singapore Government involvement in Private Enterprise - closing Statutory Boards and retrenching the Civil Servants, and opening new Private Corporations capitalised by Public Money and staffed by the Civil Servants who were previously retrenched - and to provide the same basic essential service that is required by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With the Government at every strata of the economy, determining wages, prices, and costings - is this not a "free for all culture" based on the Laws of the Jungle as the PAP Government sees fit to tweak the Law and re-interprete to their own advantage ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is certainly revealing the intellectual prowess of the resident X-rated Fraud.</p>

              <p>When boils to down it, its about STORED VALUE. The land is a stored value due to its minerals and agricultural/commercial value, agreeable to a MANMADE VALUE called CASH when SOLD, as it often does.</p>

              <p>Utimately, the critical factor is what we do with it, and how it is used to benefit us or others, regardless of how it is defined in the many different cultures and language of our world. CASH is known to all, from the intellectual to the simply ordinary villager, in whatever lingo and culture, at risk of oversimplifying it so that more may understand.</p>
              <p>Again, I hasten to add, I am only offering a perspective, and do not presume i am right, as this is only a discussion, and not a fight. Furthermore the topic is actually CAPITALISM - a concept that is defined in many different manner to many different political thoughts and working professionals.</p>

              <p>Utimately, the critical factor is what we do with it, and how it is used to benefit us or others, regardless of how it is defined in the many different cultures and language of our world. CASH is known to all, from the intellectual to the simply ordinary villager, in whatever lingo and culture, at risk of oversimplifying it so that more may understand.</p>
              <p>Again, I hasten to add, I am only offering a perspective, and do not presume i am right, as this is only a discussion, and not a fight. Furthermore the topic is actually CAPITALISM - a concept that is defined in many different manner to many different political thoughts and working professionals.</p>

              <p>It is obvious that you cannot discuss 'Economics" with someone who is so economical with its X-rated factor that it ends up being a mere "pseudo-intellect'.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that it has to admit that its discussion with you is on two "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">different wavelengths</span></em>" - as in all matters that it intend to be an expert in by re-interpreting issues based on its skewed "dumbed down" version into nonsensical simplicity ?</p>
              <p>It is nothing to wonder about the X-rated skills of a Fraud - who has picked up this "dumbed down" skills from its idol at the NTUC - who is also a million dollar salaried Minister without Portfolio, with his unique immense potential of "dumbing down" any issues to his characteristic "lollipop" style, and making him a favorite speaker with the more tolerant kiddies at the PAP runned kindergartens.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Wherelse i am attempting to turn complex issue more simply, down to its basics so that more may understand, but you are still stuck in convoluted premises of definition.<br>Majority of us come from different institution of learnings, its syllabus and teaching method are different, as well as different levels of learnings achieved by many. Some institutions even from overseas.<br>Thus, its the responsibility of the educated to simplify matters, stick to the basic core of an issue, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not use bombastic</span> words to step upon the heads of those who are not familiar with the terms discussed, as the piece of self admitted piece of shit here often does, and uses her illusive play of words to demean, humilate, bully others who do not agree with her views. Such is her way, flaws evidently seen and not lost on all with her credibilities or the lack of it.<br>What can one expect from a self admitted piece of shit? Shit of course, no matter how she attempts to project an illusive learned status. Her words dig her own grave.</p>
