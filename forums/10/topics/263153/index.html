            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, we need new blood in the politics here.  However, complete change does not happen immediately, it takes time.  Let's just hope that the winning percentage for the ruling party will continue to decline, and gradually they will be voted out of power.<br><br>WE don't need a ruling party who care and work only for themselves.  All they care is $$$$$.  In recent years, there have been so much of $$$$ money from them.  This year is the worst, they said it and they got it, pay themselves such filthy super high salary.<br><br>Guess, those who left - left not because they don't like the country, but rather they left because they can't stand and agree with the way the ruling party is running Singapore.<br><br>Usually I drag to see them appearing on National Day Parade.

So basically there are 2 levels - federal and state government. Australia is a large continent country so yes it differs from Singapore.<br><br>My tax paying money may be spent on bludgers but I still get something back and I have a sense of security that Australia will look after me based on my resident status.<br><br>I work in Canberra. Seen their processes , tedious as it is, something gets done. Do you even understand the government processes first before I go on about it? Things maybe slower in Australia but one thing is that their process are quite transparent . Portfolio budget statements, live debates , senate estimates where senators from ruling and opposition parties  pour through the expenditure and ask why things are spent that way and why some are not expended. Before you start criticising, you better understand the process.<br><br>Nothing gets done? Well excuse me , their biomedical hub is more advanced than Singapore's . What has Singapore produced since the hubbing of biomed started? And freedom of information, they have it here - Australian citizens can ask for information on anything they wish and the information is provided when possible.<br><br>Spending tax payer's monies on bludgers - well ........ok that is a part I don't like but hey free healthcare and nice subsidies for study , I get my benefits back. Spending taxpayer monies to pay the Minister's millions of a salary , I hate that when nothing can be gained.<br><br>If you are australian ,  you can be happy with your expat pay and I am happy for you too but I stayed in Singapore for too long working for crumbs and overworked because I was a local there . let me see , can you still run back to Australia when things go wrong?  If you can, your statement is just plain waste of space because you can run easily.<br><br>Alot of Singaporeans can't except for a number of us. We get streamlined into a castelike system of who is more talented , who is designated for the ordinary workforce and who is designated for the menial labour workforce starting from the time we start school. So basically once your path is set , hard to get out of it. Australia meanwhile allows you to transfer into any job or position through retraining via subsidised postgrad studies or if you really want, can do an apprentice training course.<br><br>How to support my ageing parents with their health problems on top of paying for some govt subsidised hdb flat which costs as much as (if not more) a CBD apartment in Melbourne.  So shut up if you can easily pick up the pieces and run back to Australia. And btw don't tell me that you gave up citizenship because Australian citizenship can be easily re-acquired back.<br><br>No country is perfect , each has its flaws. I sacrifice street safety for an opportunity to progress and specialise in a job I want to be in another country and build upon my experiences than to have my country tell me that just because an employer can legally age discriminate against me , I have to work in macdonalds or wash the toilets.<br><br></div>

Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central): Said that the generosity of the recent budget is possible under the stewardship of the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party.<br><br>3. Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC): Â“This is one of the best, if not the best budgets, I have seen.Â” and Â“WonderfulÂ”<br><br>2.
