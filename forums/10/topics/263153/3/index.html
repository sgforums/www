Work here before or<strong> is your income above 90k</strong>?? If not , I suggest you look at ATO's website.<br><br>It is not 50%, base income tax is 27% on the first tier if you have resident status which I do with first 6k being absolutely tax free.

I kena full wipe out at 48% for work in Australia when  I was an international student. Very big difference.<br><br>And if you consider - nurses here are paid at least 42k at the starting point and Singaporean nurses earn half at the same starting point. Now if we equalise the working times - Singaporean nurses work 6 day week while the aussies work 5 day weeks. That makes it less. Plus the aussies get 1.5 * the salary rate on weekdays and 3* the salary rates on christmas and new year's as well as 2* on public holidays. It is easy to make 45K itself - I made 58k before in one year  just working part time 3 night shifts per week. And full timers get the perks of an additional day off for every month.<br><br>Oh ya Overtime is paid at 2 times the rate. So I was famous for overclocking on shifts - by taking another shift on top of mine if they are short on staff.<br><br>Now let's take 42K as base - take 27% off - you get 30.6k then you claim for work expenses ( your stethoscopes, torchlight , even stationary and mobile if you are on call type)  registration, and laundry ( 500 dollars per year approx - I know that because I worked as a nurse before)  - may be you come back with 31k after tax is refunded.<br><br>Now Singaporeans nurses - 1.7k per month now right? That makes 20,400 dollars per year. Non taxable except for the 400 dollars. Cannot claim laundry and have to work one extra day. So let's look what happens if they work a 5 day week and equalise the income to a 5 day week -  taking this crude formula<br><br>1.7K / 28 days (4 weeks ) * 20 ( being the 5 day work week for the month) = around 1.214.<br><br>Now do it for the whole year - in effect if you work as a new nurse and only work 5 days in Singapore - you get paid roughly less than half of what Australia pays and you cannot claim much in Singaporean.<br><br>So look at this perspective . 6 weeks of paid rec leave if you are a full time nurse in some hospitals ( I worked in one which gave 6 weeks) while in Singapore 3 weeks. Then lets talk health expenses - free in Australia - pay in Singapore.<br><br>Still a new nurse will make more in Australia and survive despite the high tax rate.
