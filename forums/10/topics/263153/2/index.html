            <div class='col-md body'>Note: The Below Article is reproduced from Asiaone forum. It do not have anything to do with the views of "Ionlytalknoaction" in any ways.<br>Thank you<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>June 21, 2007<br><br>Ex-steward cleared of molestation charges<br><br>A FORMER flight steward was cleared on Tuesday of two counts of<br>molesting a woman colleague after the court allowed the matter to<br>be compounded.<br><br><strong>Mr Francis Gerard Han Khai Meng, 34,</strong> now an assistant director with the<br><strong>People's Association</strong> (Now I know what people meant when they say,<br>" I am making a 'strategic career move' "...), was charged in March this<br>year with two counts of outraging the modesty of the 24-year-old woman<br>on board a Singapore Airlines flight on April 26, 2004.<br><br>On both counts, he was said to have grabbed her right hand and placed<br>it on his private part. He had also earlier been accused of insulting her<br>modesty twice that day. It is not known why he was charged only this<br>year.<br><br>His case was originally fixed for a three-day hearing before District Judge<br>Roy Neighbour.<br><br>Yesterday, Assistant Public Prosecutor Simran Toor told the court that the<br>alleged victim and the accused had agreed on terms for composition of the<br>two molestation charges, and the prosecution had no objection.<br><br>As part of the settlement, Mr Han gave $10,000 to the victim as<br>compensation, apologised to her in open court, and will publish an apology<br>in The Straits Times. He was given a warning on the two charges of insult<br>of modesty.<br><br>Mr Han was acquitted of these charges after the prosecutor withdrew<br>them. The alleged victim, who was in court yesterday, declined comment.<br><br>Outraging of modesty, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation<br>are charges that can be compounded. Composition is the same as an<br>acquittal. The alleged victim and prosecution must agree to this but the<br>judge has the final say.<br><br><strong>This Han Khai Meng was a Returning Officer in GE2006.</strong><br><br>http://www.elections.gov.sg/gazette/20060420f.pdf<br><br>So, I think he must have some very good connections.<br>May be, he is one of the PAP inner circle people?<br>Who really knows?<br><br>Does BigCannonKing's MP knows? Good to have friend, hah?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>From this point forward, ionlytalknoaction is going to explain his views.<br><br>As read from the above article, I presume that Mr Han is from PAP(Correct me if I am wrong).<br><br>Recent Cases of MP WEE(PAP) and his daughter being targeted by bloggers to step down since bloggers do not accept the insincere apologies in the straitstime.(modified extracted from xia xue blog). The local media are not allowed to broadcast exclusively on this issue.(Correct me if I am wrong)<br>There was no public media(excluding the internet) debating about the insincere apologies written by MP WEE in the straitstimes(Correct me if I am wrong).<br>Only bloggers on the internet start to bloomblast the MP WEE's insincere apology, citing a prosposal for MP WEE to step down.<br><br>People/Bloggers are starting to question why we vote for such people who call themselves the uncaring face of the elite(phrase extracted from MP Wee's daughter's offensive blogs).<br><br>My conclusion is this, PAP has gripped an alarming stronghold and POWER on the system.<br><br>The proof for my conclusion is an extract from another website.<br>(Italknoaction's view stopped here)<br><br>Another extract from http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-634.htm<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Section 24 creates another classification called "declared foreign newspapers". The wording in the law is messy, because unlike Section 23, which uses the term "offshore newspaper", here it uses the term "foreign newspaper".<br><br>Whether "offshore" is the same as "foreign" is left unclear. However, "declared foreign newspaper" is defined in the law as "any newspaper published outside Singapore which has been declared by the Minister under section 24 (1) to be engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore".... which omits the qualification that it has to be at least a weekly, based on the Section 23 definition of "offshore newspaper".<br><br>What does Section 24 empower the minister to do? It empowers him to impose whatever conditions he likes, without assigning any reason, before granting the permit.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>(Ionlytalknoaction's view starts again at this point onwards)<br>PAP maybe a sc** ( Description was adopted by another replier in the forum),<br><br>however,<br><br>Without PAP, Most of us won't have the prosperity we had today.<br>No peace from communist party, racist riots.<br>PAP do have a credible background.<br><br>I believed Singapore cannot do without PAP. However, Singaporeans should not give too much POWER to PAP. In order for true democracy, there should be at least 2 governing parties in the parliament. Other wise, there will be only 1 party agenda governing 1 party's interest.<br><br>Hopefully, in the next general elections, Singaporeans can still vote to keep PAP in the parliament.<br><br>However, we should also look out for credible and <strong>strong</strong> opposition party to be voted into a parliament too.<br><br>In that way, 1 party do not govern 1 party's interest because they will be competing with each other to win the interest of common singaporeans like you and me.<br><br>Win~Win Situation.<br><br>The problem singapore faced now is that ONLY PAP has a credible background and is a strong party.<br><br>There is non other party more powerful than PAP as to date.<br><strong>(Correct me IF I AM WRONG)</strong><br><br></div>
