              <p><strong>By Khalil Adis</strong></p>
              <p>While the premium for Group Personal Accident Insurance Scheme is affordable, the government should cover the cost since national servicemen are defending the country</p>
              <p>I have been serving my national service faithfully for a full two-and-a-half-years and will soon complete my reservist this year, at the end of my ten-year cycle.</p>
              <p>At this time of writing, I have just finished doing my duty for the 20th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum held in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Throughout my service with the Singapore Police Force, I have kept our streets safe, assisted my commander and senior officers in writing reports, managed the staff suggestion scheme, came up with newsletter for fellow national servicemen and guarded key installations across the island.</p>
              <p>I have also endeavoured to pass my physical fitness test (IPPT) with a Silver award almost every year.</p>
              <p>However, before I take a final bow from my national service duty, there is one burning question my troop mates and myself have been left wondering – why do we need to pay for our own insurance when we are in fact taking time from our work and family to risk our lives for our country?<br><strong><br>Terms of insurance coverage</strong></p>
              <p>The Police National Service (PNS) Department last year sent us a letter saying that with effect from 1 April 2008, Home Team NSmen will be automatically covered under the Group Personal Accident Insurance Scheme.</p>
              <p>This insurance scheme only covers reservist personnel like myself and not full-time national servicemen</p>
              <p>So, unless we choose to opt out, the premiums are deducted from our make-up pay or service allowance.</p>
              <p>Most of us have left it as it is as we are just too unaware of its implications or too busy with our duties to even question it.</p>
              <p>The insurance is underwritten by American Home Assurance Company Singapore (AIG) and managed by Zuellig Insurance Singapore.</p>
              <p>Police national servicemen are covered during their In-Camp Training (ICT) and pre-ICT assessment, mobilisation, IPPT and remedial test, course and other NS activities where the Order to Report for Service has been served.</p>
              <p>The sum is not a lot, amounting to $4.85 (inclusive of GST).</p>
              <p>The insurance provides coverage of up to 30 days of call-up per work year.</p>
              <p>It covers each individual a sum assured of $100, 000 in the event of death and a scale of benefits of up to $150, 000 for permanent disablement arising from an accident.</p>
              <p>In addition, there are other benefits, such as claims for accidental partial disability and child education lump sum benefit.</p>
              <p>Insurance experts agree that the insurance coverage national servicemen are getting is a good deal.</p>
              <p><em>“If you compare this with a normal personal accident plan, for the same risk level, it costs $360 with $50, 000 sum assured in the event of accidental death and total and permanent disablement. As the insurance for national servicemen covers higher risks, it is value-for-money,”</em> says Hakim Halim, a financial advisor with Promiseland Independent Pte Ltd.</p>
              <p><strong>Cost is not the issue</strong></p>
              <p>However, the cost and coverage of the insurance is not the issue.</p>
              <p>The issue is, despite our service to our country where we constantly have to put our life at risk, the government still makes us pay for our own insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>Even the companies that we work for do pay for our insurance in the event any accident happens to us during our course of employment.</p>
              <p>So, on behalf of my troop mates, I wrote an email to the Police National Service (PNS) Department early this year, asking them to explain why we have to foot the bill.</p>
              <p>It is almost the end of the year and the PNS Department has yet to reply to our query.</p>
              <p>Our political leaders have always questioned if Singaporeans would defend the country in times of war.</p>
              <p>However, the government’s penny-pinching attitude will only sow the seeds of apathy and discord among existing national service men who have continued putting their lives at risk.</p>
              <p>Should future generations feel less than patriotic, the government have only themselves to be blamed for their “money-as a-means-to-an-end” approach.</p>
              <p>If the government can allocate $10 million of taxpayers’ money to make permanent residents feel more welcomed and foot the bill to host APEC, surely paying the insurance cost for national servicemen is not too much to ask for, right?</p>
              <p>After all, we have paid our dues by helping to keep the country safe and secure.</p>
              <p>Despite our grievances, we are grateful for the excellent welfare provided for us at APEC and the senior officers who took time to sit down to listen to the sentiments among national servicemen.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, we are waiting with bated breath for the PNS Department’s official reply.</p>

              <p>I am disappointed that a grad from a prestigious Uni would feel such way. The reason is so simple to deduced, that I am too ashamed to reveal it, for it would only impunge the honour, integrity and purpose why we male citizens perform National Service, not just the cost issue.</p>
              <p>We did not serve because of money, for no money  in the world would make us give up our precious lives, and no mother would give up her beloved son for money. No compensation is enough. Money is never the issue and would only cheapen and demean our sacrifices.</p>
              <p>There is something greater than money, while living within a civilised community. It's called honour, which no money can buy.</p>
              <p>There is no denying NS, regardless if in army, police or PDF, it is not boys game. There are risks involved, even if every single aspect of safety is rigidly looked into. Like a chinese saying - not frighten of 10,000, but just one. - the unexpected hand of fate. Blaming no metaphysical, in reality mistakes do happen, for we are human.</p>
              <p>We know full well the risk, but NS is a service to our nation. Despite some cowards amongst us who makes the most derogative noise on it, many more served honourably, to be trained and to keep our country, citizens safe. It is a noble sacrifice, by men who put on the No,4 uniform, felt true and deep buried inside their hearts, despite their talk of 'keng' or 'liao see kan' 'boliao', so as not to behave sentimentally.......</p>
              <p>I personally witness the death of my comrades before during training. It was the most horrifying experience I wish upon no other, to watch your buddy fall from a helicopter with weapons and full pack, 30 metres to the ground.....</p>
              <p>...still, our horror was nothing compared to the victim's loved ones, which no insurance money can pay for the loss of a precious human life. Their horror was something we knew and was doubly overwhelmed with grief for all.,,,.....</p>
              <p>When all was said and done, as we stood in parade under the gloomy and rainy skies, we bow our heads, no tears for grown men dont cry, and swore silently to uphold our National Service purpose - to protect our families, our relatives and friends, and now to protect our dead comrade's families, relatives and their friends as well, even at the cost of our own lives in the event of an armed conflict.</p>
              <p>Their ultimate noble sacrifice for the sake of our nation will never be forgotten, as long as our flag still flies or each citizen that carries the name of Singapore in his/her heart...</p>
              <p>We have no ability to bring back the dead no matter what we do, but we will make sure of our capability always to protect the living....</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Was Money ever the issue, or has it not been a compulsory National Service Law that require all Singaporeans to perform National Service ?</p>
              <p>Without this Law being enforced, it is doubtful that the X-rated Fraud will even have the pseudo-intellect to consider impugning the value of National Service.</p>
              <p>It is due to the existence of the Law that the X-rated Fraud will quietly find reasons to satisfy its frustrations with National Service and not to attack as false or questionable, or even to challenge the idea of National Service.</p>
              <p>Was Money ever the issue until the aged Father and Mother find it hard to accept the loss of a son or daughter - sacrificed to a useless Government that do not look after the aged survivors of those who gave up their lives for the Nation ?</p>

              <p>Yes, there is something greater than money, while living within a civilised community, which it is surprising that the pseudo-intellect can find that money cannot buy HONOR</p>
              <p>Yet, its Master that has a tail that can wag the X-rated doggone body believe that it requires Money to ensure INTEGRITY is kept intact.</p>
              <p>Is there a difference between HONOR and INTEGRITY ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is time for the Dog to teach its Tail that money is not everything in a civilised community, or perhaps the Dog has not realised that this is not a civilised society when the Tail can control the emotion of the Dog. </p>

              <p>The X-rated Fraud must be standing on both sides of the coin, in its usual decieftul ways of "denying and deriding" while still supporting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I personally witness the death of my comrades before during training. It was the most horrifying experience I wish upon no other, to watch your buddy fall from a helicopter with weapons and full pack, 30 metres to the ground.....</p>
              <p>...still, our horror was nothing compared to the victim's loved ones, which no insurance money can pay for the loss of a precious human life. Their horror was something we knew and was doubly overwhelmed with grief for all.,,,.....</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can a X-rated Fraud be a comrade of those - who died while rapelling down from helicopters; or is it merely indulging in another characteristic self-deluding session -deluding itself as being a member of the Elites, when its tell-tale signs reveals an indecisive, wishy-washy character unfit to be amongst the Best of the Very Best ?</p>

              <p>When all was said and done, as we stood in parade under the gloomy and rainy skies, we bow our heads, no tears for grown men dont cry, and swore silently to uphold our National Service purpose - to protect our families, our relatives and friends, and now to protect our dead comrade's families, relatives and their friends as well, even at the cost of our own lives in the event of an armed conflict.</p>
              <p>Their ultimate noble sacrifice for the sake of our nation will never be forgotten, as long as our flag still flies or each citizen that carries the name of Singapore in his/her heart...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In its typical artfully deceitful ways, this soap opera can only be plagiarised from the most recent movie seen by the X-rated Fraud, popping its favorite turd pieces into its foul mouth, as it breathes the hot gas from the container to give an extra kick to its X-rated brain to move into high gear to defecate its verbiage cheaper, faster and better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>We have no ability to bring back the dead no matter what we do, but we will make sure of our capability always to protect the living.... </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How does the pseudo-intellect in the X-rated Fraud intend to protect the living - especially the surviving members of the dead, who had sacrificed their lives for its imbecilic existence ?</p>
              <p>With a government that is prepared to throw away US$100 Billion to rescue foreign banks without even batting an eyelid to ensure due diligence to safeguard the so called investment - the same government will not even spent a cent on the lives of Singaporeans, even as large portions of that US$100 Billion had been used to pay the bonuses of those foreign executives that had bankrupted their foreign banks.</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated Fraud will find that such clear cut ideas are products of some mind twisting efforts, when it will not exercise any initiative of its own to think but will waste its energy in its deluded relationship with its besotted turds from its beloved Turdistan.</p>

              <p>Was Money ever the issue, or has it not been a compulsory National Service Law that require all Singaporeans to perform National Service ?</p>
              <p>Without this Law being enforced, it is doubtful that the X-rated Fraud will even have the pseudo-intellect to consider impugning the value of National Service.</p>
              <p>It is due to the existence of the Law that the X-rated Fraud will quietly find reasons to satisfy its frustrations with National Service and not to attack as false or questionable, or even to challenge the idea of National Service.</p>
              <p>Was Money ever the issue until the aged Father and Mother find it hard to accept the loss of a son or daughter - sacrificed to a useless Government that do not look after the aged survivors of those who gave up their lives for the Nation ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I occur the needs to do National Service, even the taiwanese and korean guys did their nation services, and in taiwan, it is an Honor, furthermore, it enchance the young strength and discipline,  if you notice that in country that dun provide national services, their are alots of young gangster being formed leading to bad youth and more crimes, and these mostly will churn out useless bums. National service is good for helping the country security and self discipline, I had seen many Uncles and guys at ECP doing running and other form of exercise even when they are no more in the army, that is good, very good for health and good thinking. I would said that NS is not bad at all, just the with the current inflow of Foreigner citizenships, there is a question on fairness and equalities.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, there is something greater than money, while living within a civilised community, which it is surprising that the pseudo-intellect can find that money cannot buy HONOR</p>
              <p>Is there a difference between HONOR and INTEGRITY ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">As i alway said, how much does honor per kg worth, and how much does integrity per kg worth??? Everyone will percieve their own way of determining the worth, therefore it is in the eyes of the beholden.</span></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>With a government that is prepared to throw away US$100 Billion to rescue foreign banks without even batting an eyelid to ensure due diligence to safeguard the so called investment - the same government will not even spent a cent on the lives of Singaporeans, even as large portions of that US$100 Billion had been used to pay the bonuses of those foreign executives that had bankrupted their foreign banks.</p>
              <p>For that you must understand, that our govt are global player in investment, and once global goes into a downturn, we suffered, that is the logic of it, since they are committed in investment, they had to uphold the liabilities when things goes from bad to worst. And I can tell you the truth that the lost is not just US100 billions, it is much more than that, you can never trust an account from the state. The point is, if they dun rescue what they had committed, the elites, the poor, the middle class and all other Singaporeans will be finish, govt will have to tax us more to supplement the losses, our sg dollars will sink and you can find your saving in banks, stocks, bonds or funds such CPF worth lesser by more than half. In another words, there is no way out.</p>

              <p>The X-rated Fraud must be standing on both sides of the coin, in its usual decieftul ways of "denying and deriding" while still supporting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can a X-rated Fraud be a comrade of those - who died while rapelling down from helicopters; or is it merely indulging in another characteristic self-deluding session -deluding itself as being a member of the Elites, when its tell-tale signs reveals an indecisive, wishy-washy character unfit to be amongst the Best of the Very Best ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In its typical artfully deceitful ways, this soap opera can only be plagiarised from the most recent movie seen by the X-rated Fraud, popping its favorite turd pieces into its foul mouth, as it breathes the hot gas from the container to give an extra kick to its X-rated brain to move into high gear to defecate its verbiage cheaper, faster and better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How does the pseudo-intellect in the X-rated Fraud intend to protect the living - especially the surviving members of the dead, who had sacrificed their lives for its imbecilic existence ?</p>
              <p>With a government that is prepared to throw away US$100 Billion to rescue foreign banks without even batting an eyelid to ensure due diligence to safeguard the so called investment - the same government will not even spent a cent on the lives of Singaporeans, even as large portions of that US$100 Billion had been used to pay the bonuses of those foreign executives that had bankrupted their foreign banks.</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated Fraud will find that such clear cut ideas are products of some mind twisting efforts, when it will not exercise any initiative of its own to think but will waste its energy in its deluded relationship with its besotted turds from its beloved Turdistan.</p>
