            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>(as posted at youngpap.org.sg on 18.11.06)<br><br>roberttehkh wrote:<br>The key issue of LHL government is how to lessen the cost burdens imposed by GCT and his father.<br><br>Solution actually is quite simple. Singapore has now achieved through people's past sacrifices a certain surplus level far exceeding than what is needed for stabilising the currency etc.<br><br>He can set up endowment funds from these surpluses to produce interest incomes which can be used to cover some subsistence costs for people who are unemployed. Many people are willing to find works but there is no jobs due to relentless tax-and-recovering policy of the government which caused the whole economy to lose its competitiveness.<br><br>This people's problem in finding jobs was caused by ministers' lack of talents as demonstrated by recent recessions when they conveniently blamed it on the people for lack of skills.<br><br>Let's say we consider helping people only on the basic i.e. utility and food for three months at reducing quantum over two years at the maximum after which further assistance needs certification.<br><br>If we do it like Japanese prime minister Mr. Abe, sacrifice 20% of his own pay and 10% of ministers' pay and do away with uncalled for life-long annuities to all his MPs and ministers who are quite rich and set up a endowment fund for this purpose, I am sure this will amount to hundreds of millions sufficient to help prevent desperate unemployed citizens from jumping the MRT track.<br><br>How much do we need to spend on such subsistences for those who are dying and starving. I am sure the whole society will not become a welfare state just because of such a gesture.<br><br>So I do not understand the elitist MPs who kept insisting this subsistence from cut-backs on over-generous salaries of ministers will lead to whole economy slipping down the slippery slope of welfare.<br><br>With the above-stated returns of repatriation of over-generous salaries packages from ministers and MPs to the people who are dying there will be sufficient fund to save some lives and no one needs to be left behind. There will be no need to increase the GST to cause more suicides.<br><br>Ministers and MPs who got lesser pays will not complain because in the first place they were over-generously paid and what is 10% of pay cut compared with people's support for their good deeds.<br><br>Republicans wrote:<br>Our ministers could easily pack their bags and leave office any time they desire.They could be earning more,even a million per annum,if working in the private sector.Its certainly a good investment,on the part of singaporeans,to have an efficient,effective government,where anti-corruption is the key principle,by paying a handsome,substantial sum as salaries to ministers.As taxpayers,you ought to feel proud that we do have indeed a clean efficient and transparent govt.We wouldnt want corruption to seed in,surely.</blockquote>This is just a propaganda by the ministers and MM Lee. It is not proven in real cases.<br><br>Many ex-ministers could not get similar private sector jobs which pay them multi-million salaries after they have resigned or left except in the government GLCs due to connections.<br><br>Why ? The reason is very simple. Private sector cannot afford this kind of salaries unless it is well proven the worth of the candidates who would be people with real capabilities like Iaccoca or Jack Welch as otherwise this kind of salaries would be easily eroding their profitability.<br><br>This was confirmed too by private sector bosses like Mr. Wee Chaw Jaw who said recently that he does not believe in employing multi-million CEOs for his UOB banking group as they normally lead to instability and do not help to grow the company. Remember Wee is a boss in private sector business which he owns and sets up with his own monies but other ministers are only wage earning employees or servants and not are comparable to him. He can pay himself tens of millions out of his own business profits and no bodies should try to compare "employee category" salaries like MM Lee has wrongly done with people like him. Similarly Bill Gates or Sim Wong Hoo can at any time raise their own salaries to hundreds of millions per year and no body will say that is wrong but not our ministers who are only employees and different kettle of fish.<br><br>His comments were widely reported. Go and check out those public listed companies where CEOs are paid higher salaries after listing and see what happen.<br><br>Many companies which pay too high salaries to their management after public listing when the owners think that they could use public monies from shareholders to reward themselves were suffering from losses due to excessive pays to themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the oft touted market economy is their means to justify their high wages... admittedly, i would rather live in a capitalist society than a dictatorship, but here we have a unique combination of both.....<br><br>market driven wages is flawed actually... if one were to consider what market forces are, we then need to look at who the market makers are.....this is often overlooked because we've been led to believe some people deserve their wages because they've done well but that is not always true is it??<br><br>sgx had an outstanding financial performance of 80% over the previous year....the board of directors had no second thoughts about rewarding the chairman performance bonus of the corresponding percentage. first thought, does the chairman need to be a millionaire twice over in the same year? next, does everyone in the organisation receive 80% bonus? that my friends is what market forces all about, the greed and the excesses of the market makers...<br><br>another fine example would be a previous chairman of comfort... the ex-mp was paid an excessive $1.4mil for practically doing nothing. this was his shoo-in job after his political service. yet the cabbies under the same group had to face increasing vehicle rentals and tougher competition...the whole thing ended in embarrassment to the company when the bonus was reported in the press...the chairman was removed soon after.....<br><br>well, that's market economy for you.....  those who have but no need will always suppress those who have not but need.
