FTs will most lkly be here on their own and do not have the same level of commitment SGns hv (family, loans, etc). n becos they need to `get tt break', they r willing to compromise on the pay first just to land the job, or a job. Ft's motivations is to find a better life for their family back home. SGns on the other hand, have different motivations to say the least. for mid- to entry level jobs, the competitive pressure then is driving the renumeration down. u have more candidates now for the same finite number of jobs.  tis unfortunately affect the bulk of Sgeans. for a S$3k job, if the FT is willing to settle for S$2.5k, the SGeans are in for a rude shock<br><br>On the flip side, for the lucky few SGeans who are in the upper echelon of the work force, they are in for a better time. this fenomena is the reverse. FTs will drive up the income level, due to the `skillsets' they bring. Sgeans, with the similar skillsets, will ride the wave.<br><br>the only safe hobbits are the ones in government org.<br><br>this will drive 2 trends:<br>1. income disparity amgst Sgeans widens amongst the haves and the have nots.<br>2. SGeans will be encourage to go to the foreign lands to find work. repeating the exact same thing that is happening here. go to a city/country tt will pay u `better wage', read `below market rate over there'. dubai, hong kong, usa comes to mind.<br><br>for the less mobile, they r the unluckiest lot. they just need to depend on the progress package. but to get that, mk sure they cast the right vote....<br><br></div></blockquote>FTs, where do you put them? how much do you pay them? isnt that the decision that your boss decide?<br><br>if your boss thinks he is getting good returns for the salary he is offering.. who are you to say otherwise?<br><br>who do u complain if your boss thinks that his FT is more talented then you? and on what basis can we demand our boss to decide for them how they choose to spend their money?<br><br>singapore isnt the only country in this world... if the govt tied up your boss hand.. your boss would probably just close shop, fire you and move oversea...  with his FT.<br><br>bosses and buissness are answerable to the shareholders and to their superiors... if the buissness dont do well... it doesnt matter if you are local or FT... both will get the chop.</div>

The costs have certainly come down but prices reamin high because there are people who are prepared to pay for them.
