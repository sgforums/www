Each foreign stduent is getting $30000 in subsidies over a 3 years course at the Poly. Do you really think by sticking out here for 3 years, working after graduation, these students would be paying back more than $30k in taxes? Its a brilliant deal for someone who comes from another third world country, gets an almost free education in singapore and after that gets to work here for 3 years. Name me 1 country in the world with a similar scheme for foreign students. We are simply to generous at the expense of our local students. No wonder university fees are going up cause we are too busy handing out subsidies to foreigners.</div>

Went in slightly early then me. One left after bond completed, better thing to do back home, while another one stayed. Few of my local colleague come together or eariler also no match. Started lower, mainly NS only, later can say "no horse run or home run". Can hit 3rd level without citzenship / PR also can. Some of them converted to citzen go further. like most of my local pioneer, I worked 8 years can only hit 2nd level same as my local colleague. He was slightly lucky cause we create 3rd level for him when we lefted at the 10 years. But pay no much changes.<br><br>So if they crossed 2nd level earlier than you, your career path is basically light off unless got "santa" coming to town. Waiting for vacancies and new post not that easy these days. Crossing level, the gap can be near 4 digits, so how much will you be falling behind, will greatly depend on how fast you chased. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> . Your performance likely to lose also, because he is a level higher. (No good how to promote, rite)<br><br>Yes, if they break their bond, they will need to pay like local scholar who break bonds.<br><br>I am not saying that they are not workable, but somehow the feeling is always bad. Cause you will be likely to be behind, unless you look or do for something about it that can help you..<br><br></div>

Why should students at universities pay higher fees each year when the government is handing out huge subsidies to foreign students who come here to study? It doesnt make sense to me.  Do we the citizens come first or foreigners who use our system to improve themselves?</div></blockquote>Sorry, when we singaporean going oversea, we paid every single cents. (What grant). Only PHD are offered by the Uni (paid for doing research).<br><br>I don't understand why should grant be given to foreigner in the first place. Unless already indentified as "talent", using academic records as selection only can be scholar. Should go for scholarship then..<br>Wouldn't you think that your privilege had been stolen, not saying our tax payer money then.<br><br></div>
