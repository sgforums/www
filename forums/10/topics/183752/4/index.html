            <div class='col-md body'>I have some experience with PRC students. There is a fren of mine from PRC stating that our govt provide them not onli tution fee for the 4 yrs in the Uni, but also 500 dollars a month living expenses, a free laptop each and free confirmed space in the Halls.......No wonder they were smiling all the way! That make me thing of this, why are our govt funding these guys to come here in THRONGS when there is no guarantee they will stay on? Would'nt it be better to give more chances to locals? In fact, that China fren of mine claims that he won't imagine that there is such 'carrot heads' like our govt, willing to let them be the "cuckoo" in the rich "Singapore nest". To make matter worse, NTU, NUS fees are going to increase 6000+ soon, despite heavy protest.<br><br>My experience with PRCs is ur contrary to the one stated above. They are not as "civilised" and "courteous" as the Lecturer in the above thread fantasize. Most of them are pretty in considerate, like for example, there was this PRC guy that always like to sing loudly his dialect song when near or in the hall. In fact, I once could even hear him sing 150+m away as he walked towards the hall. Ironically, many PRCs refuse to assimilate into the local culture, instead, they expect the local to follow their way and hope to turn here into a mini "China-pore". Once during chem tutorial, one PRC scholar actually swagger into the room despite being 40mins late. After a while he interrupted the tutor rudely and exclaimed "Sir, I think the way you locals pronounced the CH3. group is wrong. It is pronounced as 'methyl' as I learn it in China that way. I know you all Singaporeans learn English since very young but your people pronounciation is very poor, thus you should stick to my way." WAH LAU!!!!! Someone didn't tell him his way of saying is the American way, we learn the British pronounciation.<br>I once discuss project with a bunch of PRC ppls over MSN. Despite knowing that I am in the group chat, one of them arrogantly used strong words to critize me, despite others telling her that she is being veri vulgar.</div>

If they are not happy with the government, they vote against them in elections.  If that cannot be done, they just pack up their bags, renounce their sg citizenship and go back home to China.
