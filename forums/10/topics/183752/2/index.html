Why cant foreifn students be entitled to only 50% or 60% grants? Does it not occur to the government that the couple of thousands more collected from each student would go towards education investments for its own citizens. Why should students at universities pay higher fees each year when the government is handing out huge subsidies to foreign students who come here to study? It doesnt make sense to me.  Do we the citizens come first or foreigners who use our system to improve themselves?</div></blockquote>In the first place, why should they be given grants.<br><br>They are not even us. Or had contributed to our society.<br><br>Tell them go home.<br><br>Else get scholarship, if really so good with our local scholar.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jobs are created due to the demand. When demand exist supply will come in time. Using foreigner to fill up jobs first will erase away the demand. As a result students will not want to study in that field. An indication of jobs with high demand is the starting pay of the job. If the starting pay is good there will always be people willing to work however they might be hinder by the high education fee. Most local students will not qualify for the scholarships. Students who qualify for scholarships will aim for high flying job. Thus labs having more foreigners than local is not surprising if singapore is giving grants mention by the starter of the forum.</div>
