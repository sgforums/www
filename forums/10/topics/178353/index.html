The other is to double the maximum fine to $10,000 for those who dodge the draft, an increase prompted by the Melvyn Tan episode.<br><br>Dr Teo Ho Pin, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Defence and Foreign Affairs, sees the exit permit change mainly as a reminder to those going for overseas study.<br><br>'It's to remind them that they have a duty to return to do national service,' Dr Teo, who is an MP for Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC, said last night.<br><br>So, families with young sons going on holidays abroad during a long weekend or the school holidays are not going to be affected by the change.<br><br>But those going abroad, say, on a student exchange programme that extends beyond three months or to study at a foreign institution will need to apply for an exit permit.<br><br>It can be done in person at Mindef's Central Manpower Base or on the Internet.<br><br>Those who fail to do so face a fine of up to $2,000. The same maximum fine will be imposed when the child remains outside Singapore for a period longer than that stated on the exit permit.<br><br>Each of the child's parents or legal guardians could also be fined up to $2,000.<br><br>Mr Sin Boon Ann, also a member of the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs, said the changes are 'timely and necessary'.<br><br>Said Mr Sin, an MP for Tampines GRC, last night: 'The Melvyn Tan episode highlighted the need to reinforce how seriously we regard national service.'<br><br>The Singapore-born pianist, now 49 and a British citizen, sparked a public outcry when he got a $3,000 fine last year for skipping national service.<br><br>He left Singapore to study music in Britain and did not return home for national service in 1977.<br><br>Last month, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament that stiffer punishments would be proposed against draft dodgers, including pressing for a jail term that is provided for under current legislation.<br><br>In explaining the new position, Mr Teo said the increased penalties are to send a strong signal that national service is critical to Singapore's survival.<br><br>About 700,000 Singapore men had served or are serving national service.<br><br>One of them is writer Ng Yi-Sheng, 25. He feels the changes are an overreaction.<br><br>'Increasing the punishment for draft-dodgers would make NS seem even more of a forced obligation,' he said.<br><br>However, Mr Kevin Loh, 29, who owns a cleaning company, disagrees. He favours the changes.<br><br>'National service is a key institution, and while those who are willing to serve have nothing to fear, it will be good to have a stronger deterrent for those who might want to escape their duty,' he said.</span><br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060214_371117.html" rel="nofollow"><br>http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060214_371117.html</a><br><br></div>

Just like we are taught commiting a crime is bad but how come ppl still commit? Anyone that have a slight history knowledge will understand why there a need to be able to defend the country on our own, don't tell me you don't understand that when you know what happen during Jap occupation in Singapore. Also some or most ppl heard of the word NS they will associate it as wah tough man or i am going to suffer. So even if they know or understand, some may still try to find a way to dodge it.<br><br>White horse black horse why should we give a damn? We serve not for the country but for the protection of our love one. If they want an easy way out that their problem. Keep comparing with one another lead to nothing but more unhappiness.<br><br>It already reduce to 2 years and if we reduce to 1.5 years, it not only going to be rush, it may not even be enough to train them up properly. Not sure if you have gone through, but for me i serve 2.5 years and i think 2 years is the bare minimun for us to gel up and learn what we are suppose to learn. By reducing further, it only reduce the capability of our fighting ability.<br><br>No doubt we lose out in competitiveness in the job market, but this can't be help nor compromise unless we are prepare to suffer any consequences if we get invaded.</div>

Under the Singapore Constitution, any male who wants to renounce his citizenship must first discharge his NS liabilities under the Enlistment Act. That means that if you happen to be a Singapore-Born male, you need to serve NS before you can renounce your citizenship; if not, you will be stuck.<br><br>But, if you happen to be born OVERSEAS but somehow acquired Singapore Citizenship due to DESCENT then it will be easier for you to renounce the citizenship.<br><br>If you manage to leave Singapore and remain outside with Citizenship of another country until you are 21 then it is very different. Under the Singapore Constitution, any male in this category has to take an OATH at the age of 21. Failing to do so will result in the Singapore Government depriving him of the Singapore Citizenship. In simple terms, if you do not take the OATH by 21... Then you will be out.<br><br>And those who managed to renounce their citizenship but decided to come back to Singapore does not automatically become a PR. The government may not even grant you the license to work in Singapore! So do not worry, they are not treated any better than you Singaporeans.</div>
