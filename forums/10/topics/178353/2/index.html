Lets say he decided not to take the OATH, MINDEF would force him to serve as he is still Singaporean. So the situation is like this, whether he wants to take the OATH or not is another story.... But he needs to serve first. That is the part which annoys me. Unless he leaves Singapore, he WILL have to serve even though he does not want to take the OATH at 21.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Maybe Goh Meng Seng might have heard of it from his party bosses.<br><br>Still I do not see how letting 18-year-olds vote is nonsensical just because military service is mandatory. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>I don't see the need to follow suit without first thinking of the unique nature of each country, time and space. In the case of USA that you provided, you are referring to protests in a wartime situation!<br><br>Knowing your history is good but to apply the gist and lessons learnt in policies is no means and easy feat. The right application is more critical than quoting history texts my friend.

Rightfully, the rights to a citizenship should follow the father (breadwinner) and the entire family unit should migrate to the country that the father reside in. No issue with this part.<br><br>However, I do agree that women can be the sole income-earner in recent years as the workforce gets more educated. Hence, there is a likelyhood that the father migrate instead. I guess there is no issue once the citizenship is granted to the father.<br><br>Problems occur when the father itself cannot aquired the citizenship due to a lack of skills or professional qualifications. Making his son liable for NS as reflected in the system on the family root between father and son. By letting the son to renounce his citizenship and discharge all NS liability has no inter-correctional relationship to the father getting his citizenship any faster.<br><br>It seem the solution to the root of this problem can be better achieve by focusing on the way the granting of citizenship to a newborn instead of fine-tuning the renoucing law as the option. Although the problems may be tackle from there, the implementation process still lies in the statistical figures for this unique group.<br><br>I hoped to have gave you an insight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

They will be required to register for national service with Central Manpower Base and apply for deferment from full-time NS until the age of 21, pending the renunciation of their Singapore citizenship.
