            <div class='col-md body'>JAKARTA: Indonesia's anti-monopoly commission said Temasek Holdings has violated the country's anti-monopoly laws through its ownership in two large mobile telecommunication operators.<br><br>Ending three months of investigations, the commission gave the Singapore investment company a fortnight to submit its defence.<br><br>A 109-page document on Singapore's Temasek Holdings is one of the most detailed investigation reports produced by Indonesia's Anti-Monopoly Commission (KPPU).<br><br>After a probe that lasted for the maximum 120 days allowed, a KPPU team concluded that the Singapore investment company has violated Indonesia's anti-monopoly law.<br><br>Temasek Holdings was found to have done so through its subsidiaries' shareholdings in two of Indonesia's largest mobile telecommunication operators.<br><br>Temasek's subsidiaries own a 42 percent stake in Indosat and a 35 percent stake in Telkomsel.<br><br>Mohammad Iqbal, Head of Indonesian Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition, said: "There's evidence to prove that the process of cross-ownership took place after the divestment of Indosat to Temasek Group. This created unhealthy competition."<br><br>Indosat and Telekomsel dominate Indonesia's mobile telecom sector, where eight other players compete in one of the region's most lucrative markets worth US$5 billion.<br><br>Temasek Holdings has denied the charges of cross-ownership, maintaining that its subsidiaries have their own board of directors who make their own operational decisions.<br><br>It has also denied any involvement in price fixing for mobile phone charges, pointing out that Telkomsel's majority shareholder is the Indonesian government.<br><br>Temasek's legal counsel reiterated that all claims against the company are baseless and without merit.<br><br>He said Temasek intends to vigorously defend its legal rights at all opportunities and in all available legal forums.<br><br>KPPU's findings have been submitted to a five-member independent council that will deliver a judgement.<br><br>"The council has given the findings of the extended investigation to the party concerned so that it can inspect the documents, give its views and enter its defence," said Mohammad Iqbal.<br><br>The council threw out a number of cases in the past after the companies involved entered their defence.<br><br>But should it rule against Temasek, it can impose a fine on the Singapore firm, instruct it to end unfair practices, and pay restitution for any losses caused. If that happens, Temasek can still appeal to the Indonesian courts.<br><br>The council is expected to deliver its verdict next month in a case that many experts said lacks clear-cut evidence.<br><br>International investors are watching the case closely, and a guilty verdict, the experts said, would shake investors' confidence and raise doubts about Jakarta's commitment to protecting foreign investments even as the country tries to woo more new ones to fuel the economy.<br><br>- CNA/so<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MDA has passed a law requiring all buildings to provide automatically facilities and even power supply to allow Tecommunication companies like Singtel or Starhub to install their fixed lines within the building without charge or rentals.<br><br>However existing GLCs like Singtel is exempted from such sharing of facilities. It has prevented others like Starhub or M1 to share their manholes, trunking or cabling for such installations.<br><br>Is such an exemption a conflict of interest under the Telecommunication Act. Why allow Singtel to enjoy monopoly when the Act requires buildings to provide free access of such services?<br><br>DBS is also seen to be protected with privileges like closing of existing banks to give it the monopoly. Now DBS is using such monopoly to charge higher service charges which are followed by all other banks as expected.<br><br>SBS is enjoying all the monopoly power to increase their fares even in bad times to increase profits (not avoid losses due to higher wages or oil prices)<br><br>When is there going to be a government without so many conflicts of interests and real check on such monopolies to lower costs of living or doing business?<br><br>So now it is time for Singtel and Temasek to prove their monopoly over the telecommunication acquisitions in another country are right commercial decisions and not anti-competition without the protection by their own government in the acquisitions of Tekomsel.</div>
