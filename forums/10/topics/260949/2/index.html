And the selection from BMT to OCS, the PC or OC actually recommends the more "on the ball" ones. And being on the ball does help in your professional life in some way. its just one example. There are other factors but similar to poly students as well.<br><br>And those in who went thru OCS, if they paid attention, they would have actually learned something positive from the whole 9 mths they were there. I'm not an officer, but I have seen some of the course content.<br><br>But there are officers/specs who are bums as well, or don't make it big. But going thru OCS or SISPEC does build some character in some of them.</div>
