            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this in, but i just came back from an interview. Basically, What the interviewer said, was that since i'm a fresh graduate from poly, they're just going to pay me 1.5k, which is what my female coursemate got 2 years ago.<br><br>When i asked whether they are going to consider my 2 years of National service to calculate my pay, he just smiled and say most private companies do not recognise this, and they go 'according to the law'.<br><br>What he means is that he understands reservice, because its statute-dictated, but not this "2 years of NS service = extra money when starting up" issue.<br><br>Here in SG, where men are expected to pay virtually everything for their partners, owe a car, have a credit card, and earn more than their wife, how is this supposed to help us in any way? (I don't even want to start on this issue.)<br><br>I suppose my 2 years of NS can only count as 'personal experience' then. And that i'll forever be lagging 2 years behind my female compatriates.<br><br>Why doesn't someone propose a bill, that we get a mandatory $100 increase because we have served our country, and make us feel better in the process, as compared to making us feel that we've wasted 2 years serving?<br><br>Or has this even been raised before?<br><br>Aaron</div>
