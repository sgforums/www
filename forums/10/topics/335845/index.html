              <div class="story_text" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 120%;">SENIOR Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser Luck is the new chairman of the People's Action Party's youth wing.
              <p>Mr Teo, 40, takes over from Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, 47, Minister of Community Development, Youth and Sports.</p>
              <p>The new appointment, made at the Young PAP (YP) convention yesterday, marks the first time the entire 31-member leadership of YP has been drawn from the post-independence generation.</p>
              <p>Assisting Mr Teo, who is with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and the Ministry of Transport, are two vice-chairmen: MPs Zaqy Mohamad, 34, and Christopher de Souza, 32.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo was previously YP's vice-chairman, alongside MP Josephine Teo, 40, who is stepping down to make way for the younger generation.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, he outlined three key objectives for the 22-year-old YP he leads.</p>
              <p>They are: Continue to recruit and retain members; develop a strategy to engage youth through new media; and have members be aware of current issues so they can explain policies to their peers.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo also paid tribute to Dr Balakrishnan for giving younger members opportunities to prove themselves, and for introducing elections for several posts in the YP leadership in 2004.</p>
              <p>'He established YP's position in the party and public as well,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I have a very big pair of shoes to fill, and I cannot do it alone,' he told 300 YP members at the NTUC Centre.</p>
              <p>'I have to do it with everyone at branch level, at the exco.'</p>
              <p>The new 31-member exco appointed yesterday includes 15 new faces.</p>
              <p>It also includes two Young NTUC leaders, as a sign of the symbiotic relationship between the PAP and the labour movement.</p>
              <p>A new post of YP organising secretary was created to give non-MPs more leadership opportunities.</p>
              <p>Medical officer Tan Wu Meng, 33, was elected as the first organising secretary.</p>
              <p>In an off-the-cuff 30-minute speech to members, Dr Balakrishnan dwelt at length on the five key values the PAP stood for: multiracialism, meritocracy, honest government, a self-reliant people and a fair and just society.</p>
              <p>He reminded them that the PAP first entered Parliament as an opposition party 54 years ago, before taking over in 1959.</p>
              <p>'By next year, we would have been in power for 50 years. Fifty years from now, will we still be in power? Will we continue to grow this place...or will we become tired, incompetent, corrupt and soft?'</p>
              <p>He added: 'Can the PAP continue to win elections for the next 50 years? If we do, that will be a political feat that has never been achieved anywhere in this world.'</p>
              <p>He noted that there were three ways elections could be won: have an auction and promise handouts that might not be able to stretch over 50 years; offer change and enthuse people about something that will not last long; and the PAP way.</p>
              <p>'We are trying to build...a fair and just society, for the long term,' he said.</p>
              <p>Dr Balakrishnan also identified four things the PAP must deliver to win over the people: opportunities to succeed in life; fairness; security of the country; and freedom to act within limits.</p>
              <p>'Ask yourself, and we should ask others this when we are campaigning: Who is going to look after your long-term interests, your assets, your hopes, your dreams?' he said.</p>

              <p>If elitism is not encouraged, then is there an real desire for us to achieve good results and etc?</p>
              <p>Morever, the end result is the same, kids and teenagers may hold that idea that being in elite schools means you are an elite all the way, but when they grow up, they will understand that there are people who is a late boomer. However, if the end goal of being a university graduate is achieved, will society view you differently?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can always say that I am from a good primary school for that matter, however, it is your degree that counts in society. The elitism that has been encouraged has encourage us to push ourself towards a better results. Education does matter, and if elitism encourage us as a society to excel in our study, then it is worthwhile to have such a education policy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One point to note, just because you are anti-government does not mean you are better, because in the end, there will be a government. For you to be truly anti-government, and not anti-party, you have to support the idea of anarchy, which is bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, it is the contribution a person made to society that matters, in regardless of his political affilation.</p>
