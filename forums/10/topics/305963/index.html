              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Adolf Hitler and Lee Kuan Yew</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Today, the 3oth of January 2008, is the
              75th anniversary of Adolf Hitler forming the government in Berlin with
              his appointment as Chancellor in the Reichstag, Berlin, 30th January
              1933. So I thought of Lee Kuan Yew. Are there similarities?<br><br>In
              1933 when Hitler formed the government, Germany was under the yoke of
              the West. The Treaty of Versailles signed at the end of the First World
              War in 1918 humiliated the Germans. They were required to pay
              reparations to England, their navy was ordered reduced, air force
              curtailed, the Rhineland was off limits and the Reichmark, the Germany
              currency was not worth the paper it was printed of.<br><br>For this
              defeated humiliated people came a Hitler who told them it was time to
              rise again. Time to be proud again. Time to throw up the unbearable
              yoke that was put over them by the victors Britain and France. And he
              told them he would do it.<br><br>Although he did not win outright at
              the elections, he managed by skullduggery and violence to force
              President Hindenburg to swear him in as the Chancellor. And so began
              the Third Reich. And true enough, Hitler did manage to make Germany the
              strongest mightiest and economically strongest and most powerful
              European country from 1933 to 1939 and beyond. From shambles, Hitler
              managed to make Germany the most powerful country in Europe.<br><br>And
              Lee Kuan Yew? In 1959, Singapore was nothing more than a backwater and
              a sea port. Unemployment was high, poverty was all around and people
              did not know which way to turn, or what was to come. But Lee Kuan Yew
              becoming Prime Minister in 1959 did turn the country around. From the
              sleepy shipping harbor that it was Lee Kuan Yew and his policies
              managed to turn it into what it is today, an international city.<br><br>So
              the similarities and the abilities between the two are striking. From
              great adversity they managed to turn a difficult situation around. But,
              just as Hitler, Lee Kuan Yew will eventually fail. For Germany the
              failure was due to military defeat. For Singapore, it will be because
              the basis of his policies have lost their appeal in this modern age.<br><br>In
              1959, it was easy for Lee to tell the people to support his policies
              without complaint. It was a time when people were just trying to
              survive. With heavy unemployment, with poverty and little hope, the
              people of Singapore were prepared to pay any price, sacrifice their
              rights and liberties in return for a better life; in return for bread
              and butter.<br><br>So for a long time, he forced every Singaporean into
              resettlement into HDB flats, he controlled the unions, he denied civil
              liberties, he kept wages low in order to compete with other low cost
              countries, he invited Western countries to set up assembly line
              factories with cheap labor from Singapore, he controlled the press with
              propaganda, he denied assemblies and protests. In other words he
              controlled people's lives for one purpose and one purpose alone; that
              is for economic development. The Singapore people who were
              predominantly poor allowed him to control their lives any way he
              wanted; as long as he managed to lift up their lives economically.<br><br>But
              the problem now is different. Singaporeans have now reached a certain
              level of education. A certain level of sophistication. They are no
              longer the impoverished coolie of 1959. They cannot be expected to
              tolerate those restrictions imposed on them such as in 1959. But the
              problem is, Lee Kuan Yew feels he can still make Singaporeans obey his
              orders like before. And this is where he will fail.<br><br>Singaporeans
              of today are not those of 1959. Today they expect a little more than
              just food on the table. They expect some liberties too. They expect a
              right to criticize the government. The right to speak. The right to
              assemble. The right to a free press. The right to live like Europeans,
              as they have the means to do so.<br><br>Very soon I expect more and
              more Dr. Chee Soon Juans to appear in Singapore. As if one is not bad
              enough! You can see this happening already. And just as Hitler fell,
              having been defeated militarily, Lee Kuan Yew too will fall because
              there are too many Dr. Chee Soon Juans. Who refuse to roll over, just
              because Lee says so.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
