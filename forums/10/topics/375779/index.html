              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo, Consultant Editor (Editing by Jeremy Yau)</strong></p>
              <p><em>[In this classic five-part series, Eugene Yeo will examine the
              inherent weaknesses of the ruling PAP, its implications for Singapore
              and possible scenarios in the post-LKY era.]</em></p>
              <p>As the PAP celebrated its 50th year anniversary in power in 2009 as
              well as the distinction of being the second longest political party
              in government in Asia after the Chinese Communist Party, it appears
              that this dominant party will continue its rule for the next fifty
              years.</p>
              <p>Fifty years of uninterrupted rule has entrenched the PAP in all
              aspects of Singapore’s institutions and life. The line between
              government and party has become increasingly blurred with each passing
              day. The opposition is too enfeebled and divided to put up a strong
              challenge such that elections are relegated no more than a five-year
              “PR exercise” to legitimatize the PAP’s “mandate” to govern Singapore.</p>
              <p>Despite being one of the world’s most successful political parties,
              the PAP is facing an impending crisis, if it is not already in one
              stemming largely from its internal structural weaknesses which
              ironically were its greatest strengths in its early days culminating in
              a monolithic, stable and efficient political machinery.</p>
              <p>When Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said lately that Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong is looking for a candidate in his 30s and 40s to take
              over him, he had unwittingly revealed the PAP’s greatest weakness: an
              ossified internal structure which has long ceased to be a viable,
              dynamic and ambitious political party crippled by a lack of
              institutionalized system of succession and renewal to pass the baton
              from one generation of leaders to another.</p>
              <p>The PAP has a monopoly of the best talents in Singapore. There are
              ready candidates in the party with many years of experience
              in government to take over Mr Lee’s position: Health Minister Mr Khaw
              Boon Wan, Finance Minister Tharman, Foreign Minister George Yeo,
              Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen and Youth and Sports Minister Dr
              Vivian Balakrishnan, just to quote a few. Why is there a need to source
              for a fresh, inexperienced and untested candidate from outside the
              party hierarchy for Singapore’s 4th Prime Minister?</p>
              <p>Singapore inherited the Westminister model of government from
              Britain which is similiar to Malaysia and India. The leader of the
              political party with the most number of seats in Parliament will
              usually become the Prime Minister. For example, Gordon Brown who
              replaced Tony Blair as the Labor Party Chief automatically became the
              British Prime Minister. Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who became UMNO’s
              President last year, became Malaysia’s 6th Prime Minister a month later.</p>
              <p>Unless there are no candidates within the PAP to replace Mr Lee as
              its Secretary-General, it is inconceivable that he will need to recruit
              a successor from outside the party ranks. But again, it will not be
              surprising if we consider the fact that the PAP is all but a political
              party in name only. The present PAP is a pale shadow of its past and
              has become a mere vehicle for the ruling elite to maintain their
              legitimate hegemony over the nation.</p>
              <p>Every political party should have different factions and hence
              centers of power, a proper system of leadership renewal and a political
              milieu for it to operate. China may be an authoritarian one-party state
              ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but the CCP is not as
              monolithic as the PAP.</p>
              <p>There are currently four different centers of power in the CCP: the
              Shanghai clique led by Jiang Zemin’s proteges in the Politburo, the
              Communist Youth League under Secretary-General Hu Jintao and his
              protege Li Keqiang, the Old Guards and their princelings such as Hu’s
              anointed successor Xi Jiping, the son of the highly revered Xi Zhongxun
              and new technocrats rising through the ranks of power.</p>
              <p>The CCP has moved from the one-man rule during Maoist era to a party
              ruled collectively by consensus while the PAP remained literally under
              the thumbs of one man.</p>
              <p>Malaysia’s UMNO is split between loyalists of ex-Prime Minister
              Abdullah Badawi, Mahathirists, supporters of Prime Minister Najib Tun
              Razak and Tengku Razeleigh Hamzah, the odd man out. Again, there are
              opposing forces to counter the political clout of the incumbent unlike
              the PAP where all power is concentrated in the hands of one or few
              persons with no other alternative centers of power.</p>
              <p>In a political party, every single cadre will have the opportunity
              to advance in the party hierarchy and to lead it if he/she is capable
              enough to command the respect and trust of the other members.
              Factionalism will also be an ugly but inevitable aspect of intra-party
              politics with two or more groups emerging to jostle for power and
              support within the party ranks as in the present crisis engulfing the
              Malaysian Chinese Association which is split between its President Ong
              Tee Keat and his deputy Chua Soi Lek.</p>
              <p>There was genuine intra-party democracy, politics and competition in
              the early days of the PAP. It was revealed lately by ex-PAP Chairman
              Toh Chin Chye and Ong Pang Boon that in the aftermath of the PAP’s
              electoral victory in 1959, the PAP’s CEC set out to select who to
              become the next Chief Minister of Singapore. (Source: Straits Times, 5
              September 2009)</p>
              <p>There were two nominations – the PAP’s Secretary-General Lee Kuan
              Yew and its hugely popular treasurer and Mayor Singapore, Ong Eng Guan.
              Lee won by only one vote cast by Toh Chin Chye.</p>
              <p>The present PAP does not subscribe to all the norms of a political
              party. It has lost is vitality and is an empty shell lacking
              competitive intra-party politics to nurture aspiring young politicians
              and to ensure a proper and peaceful transition of power. Its internal
              structure is closer to the “mandarinate” system of ancient Chinese
              dynasties than to a modern political party.</p>
              <p>Under the “mandarinate” system, power is highly centralized in the
              hands of a single person or an inner corterie of persons beholdened to
              him/her. This person, nominally the Emperor in China’s feudal
              dynasties, retains overall control in the selection and appointment of
              personnel to fill important positions of leadership in the system.
              Seniority counts for little and outsiders can be easily parachuted to
              take up positions usually reserved for party elders. There is no
              institutionalized system of party succession or renewal which boils
              down to the word of one man/woman.</p>
              <p>The hierarchy of the PAP can be divided into the following:</p>
              <p>1. The real seat of power centered around the Prime Minister (or some say, his father) and his closest ministers and aides.</p>
              <p>2. Other ministers and MPs.</p>
              <p>3. Ordinary party cadres.</p>
              <p>4. Grassroots support.</p>
              <p>In a typical political party like Malaysia’s UMNO, Japan’s LDP or
              even China’s CCP, party leaders are usually elected directly by
              ordinary party members or delegates. Datuk Seri Najib Razak became UMNO
              President because his challenger Tengku Razaleigh could not muster
              enough votes to be nominated as a candidate. There is a tried and
              tested system put in place for climbing up the ladders of the party
              into positions of power.</p>
              <p>There appears to be no such system in the PAP. In the 1980s, a group
              of PAP stalwarts were dropped rather unceremoniously from the party
              lineup by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Potential MP-candidates are
              not chosen from within the party ranks, but from the now famous
              “tea-parties” organized by the PAP to recruit promising candidates
              (usually successful professionals, technocrats and civil servants)</p>
              <p>Party loyalty, service and seniority counts for little in the PAP.
              One can be a party veteran for thirty years, but will never rise up the
              ranks unless one is deemed capable and trustworthy enough by those in
              power. A newcomer with no prior connection with the party can be easily
              “parachuted” into positions of leadership over others with far more
              impressive party pedigree. Even those already ensconced in positions of
              power are not safe either. They can always be asked to “make way” for
              the sake of “party renewal” as had happened to the PAP Old Guards only
              that the party is not renewing according to the party’s Constitution,
              but at the whims and fancies of one person or a group of persons.</p>
              <p>While the “mandarinate” system will help to keep the PAP highly
              uniform, stable and monolithic, literally bereft of party politics,
              factionalism and in-fighting which plagues most political parties, it
              resulted in a disjointed system where the party and grassroots support
              base are largely disconnected from the ruling elite where most, if not
              all the major decisions are made.</p>
              <p>Ordinary cadres are excluded from the strategic planning and
              decision-making processes. All they need to do is simply to follow
              orders from the top and implement the party’s plans on the ground.
              Hence, though the PAP has a powerful grassroots machinery, it is one
              which lacks initiative, motivation and dynamicism resulting in another
              potental fatal weakness in its organizational structure which I shall
              elucidate more in the second part of this series: – A disconnected,
              disjointed and unmotivated party and grassroots support base.</p>

              <p>LKY will leave Singapore with an unstable political legacy in which there is no proper transition of political power from one government to another, if the next government is formed by any other Political Party.</p>
              <p>The incoming non-PAP government will be hamstrung in every move that it makes, and will practically have no control over the sources of funds, even as Singapore remains wealthy in the Reserves; and the various Government Linked Companies that are capitalised by Public Money will be out of control - as these are headed by PAP appointees as Chairmen, Directors of the Board, and as Executive CEOs.</p>
              <p>Any incoming government formed by an Alternative Political Party will be challenged by the Judiciary, whose positions have been made safe by the PAP politics.</p>
              <p>Will the Attorney-General support the policies and agenda of a new non-PAP Government, when its was appointed during the PAP's Government, and its position has also been made safe by the rubber-stamping PAP dominated Parliament ?</p>
              <p>The Elected President - also a past PAP associate - will create a state of political limbo when he insist on his constitutional rights to delay the programs of the new Government, by taking his time to scrutinise the expenditures of the new government.</p>
              <p>Such a state of paralysis nearly came about when the late President-elect Ong Teng Cheong had only asked for a full accounting of the Singapore assets that his office is supposed to protect with the "Second Key" - and it upset then SM LKY and the Goh Chok Tong Government.</p>
              <p>LKY had planned for all the obstructions and road blocks for any new government formed by any political parties other then the PAP.</p>
              <p>With all the power concentrated in the Prime Minister's Office - to wield his influence over the selection of nominees to the positions of the Elected-Presidency, Chief Justice and Senior Judges, Heads of the Civil Service, Police Chief, SAF Chief, and all Grass Root Organisations - the biggest nightmare for Singaporeans will be a rogue government formed by the PAP.</p>
              <p>This is clearly described in an extract taken from:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgblogs.com/blog/kuan-watch-leewatch-info/2837">‘Send in the Clowns - Alex Au offers a biting critique of Men in White, the PAP and Lee Kuan Yew himself.’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p> <em><em><em>The same newspaper finally addressed the question that people have asked for years: What if a rogue government sprang from the bosom of the PAP? …</em></em></em></p>
              <p><em><em><em>The newspaper noted that of all the scenarios for Singapore’s future, this is about the scariest, and yet, I would add, it is also one of the most likely. </em></em></em></p>
              <p><em><em><em>It is scarier than the scenario of an opposition party winning a general election, forming a new government and then making a hash of things, because this latter scenario would imply that there are competitive elections, which in turn means there is an avenue for the people to throw out the incompetents before long.</em></em></em></p>
              <p><em><em><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">A rogue government springing from the PAP itself is the scariest of all, because it means they will have all the wide powers available to suppress dissent and entrench themselves in power</span>.</em></em></em> </p>

              <p>i think intellectuals will understand the harm of singapore politics if PAP continue to rule another 50years. it will definitely breed corruption within the systems and entrench in our society for sure.</p>

              <p>if the prime minister system do not change to a max. 2-3 terms structure, singapore will never be able to see changes and day we become a true democratic nation.</p>

              <p>From the position of a "hum" stuck in a small shell that remains immobile in the muck, how far and wide is the horizon for a "hum" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we depend on the useless "hum" to spread any intelligence with its ignorance that is too big to contain inside the small shell ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the consistent idiocy in the expertise of the "hum" in showing off its stupidity in such bold ways, is it any wonder that the PAP feel more confident that their propaganda is being accepted ?</p>
