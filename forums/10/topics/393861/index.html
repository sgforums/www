            <div class='col-md body'><p>Gaming consultant warns that Singapore IRs may not be profitable after all<br><br>March 17, 2010 by admin   <br>Filed under Headlines<br><br>Leave a comment<br><br>Written by Our Correspondent<br><br>In a sign that the establishment is starting to have doubts on the profitability of Singapore’s two integrated resorts (IRs), the Straits Times published an unusual article today containing an interview with gaming and hospitality consultant Mr Ronald Tan who sounded the alarm bells of the long-term prospects of the IRs.<br><br>Mr Tan opined that both Genting or Sands are unlikely to exceed their forecasts of US$1 billion each in revenue from the casinos within a year due to the high overhead costs of over $13 billion dollars for both.<br><br>Construction of the two IRs began in 2006 amid a construction boom which saw rising prices of sand and manpower exacerbated by the ban of the sale of sale to Singapore by neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>The grand plan to allow casinos in Singapore was announced and implemented swiftly by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong with no consultation with Singaporeans, a significant proportion remains opposed to their presence here.<br><br>Some are now questioning the wisdom of having two casinos built together at the same time in a small place like Singapore. <br><br>“Instead of allowing both casinos to open in a more relaxed way during the first few years, the IRs are now under tremendous pressure…..the road ahead is ‘no bed of roses’,” Mr Tan said.<br><br>His pessismistic view was echoed a few weeks ago by Las Vegas Sands Chief Operating Officer Michael Leven who told Reuters that LVS will need to generate at least US$400 million in EBITDA from Marina Bay Sands in a bid to meet debt covenants.<br><br>“We’re accumulating cash … the only risk is if Singapore doesn’t do well. We have to do $400 million in EBITDAR to clear covenants. If we don’t do that, we’ve made a bad investment in Singapore,” he added.<br><br>(EBITDAR definition: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent. An approximate measure of a company’s operating cash flow based on data from the company’s income statement. Calculated by looking at earnings before the deduction of interest expenses, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent. Similar to, but less common than, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.)<br><br>LVS will operate the second casino in Singapore at Marina Bay whose opening has been delayed repeatedly due to financial problems faced by the parent company in the United State.<br><br>Ronnie Chan, chairman of Hang Lung Properties Ltd., Hong Kong’s fifth-biggest developer by market value, said last September in a Bloomberg Forum in Hong Kong that the two casino-resorts in Singapore will fail because they won’t be able to attract high-rollers:<br><br>“The big rollers are what make money in casinos, they will never come to Singapore, it’s a family entertainment” location. You think big-rollers will go to Singapore where they have teeth and fangs coming out sideways? There are too many rules. I was in Sentosa island, I really think that it’s going to be a flop…..The whole integrated entertainment industry, I’m worried for them. The good thing about Singapore is that if you flop, you’re given a second chance,” he said.<br><br>Mr Tan warned that not all casinos are profitable quoting the example of Melbourne’s Crown Casino which suffered substantial losses for two years straight after it opened in 1997.<br><br>He also harbored doubts about the profitability of the other non-casino attractions such as the Universal Theme Park:<br><br>“Many Singapore attractions, from Tang Dynasty Village to Haw Par Villa, flopped because of the heat and humidity. The majority of Universal’s attractions are outdoors, which means people have to wait in line under the hot sun. If even Hong Kong, a temperate country, cannot succeed with Disneyland with its huge China hinterland,” he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.<br><br>Mr Tan should not worry too much and remember what Ronnie Chan had said earlier:<br><br>“The good thing about Singapore is that if you flop, you are given a second chance.”<br><br>So long the venture is spear-headed by the PAP, it can afford to flop many times and still given a chance.</p></div>

              <p>The arguement of no high rollers ? Clearly someone analyst from hong kong - forgotten the rich in Malaysia &amp; Indonesia and other south east asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Melbourne’s Crown Casino which suffered substantial losses for two years straight after it opened in 1997. Well it is still around - thus it survive. Asians love to gamble - look at the 4d and toto - you cannot compare that to aust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tang Dynasty Village to Haw Par Villa ? Haw Par Villa - who want to go see hell ? Tang Dynasty - so small and limited - you compare to china - Song city or Ocean park - they have shops , resturants with people in costume.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heat and Humidy ? Hong kong Disney is sucks because it is too small. Why not talk about Ocean park - it is also open, people wait for rides.  It is the concept and attraction. Disneyland with its huge China hinterland - hello china people do not love disney characters, they don't grow up with them ! - they see Mao cartoon last time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore - where parents and kids are starve of places to go - theme park will be full alway .</p>
