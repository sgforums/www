But perhaps the below may be the reason<br><br>1) Perhaps, we continue to want better if not the best things. In general, for technological products it is actually cheaper. A flat TV is cheap compared to years before, a pentium II computer is cheap, an analog camera is cheaper than a digital one, etc.  The newer technological products are getting more and more sophisticated and hence expensive to produce.<br><br>2) What we spend most on are housing, medical, food, utilities which have increased significantly. Perhaps because of stupid screw ups of Mah (he is one MP I can't wait to want to vote against and one big one big bullsh!t!). Because of speculations by rich ppl. Because in general houses are better equipped and more beautiful. Because employee cost is getting more in the government sectors....<br><br>3) Perhaps if you can be more specific in what u mean by cost increase, then we know better in what area this is really happening and then perhaps we can zoom in and catch that PAP culprit hands down!<br><br>In general, I am also getting that general feeling that u say except the point  that salaries are stagnant. If salaries are stagnant, yet I am seeing tons of Singaporeans going for tour. Sometimes it's simply ppl are spending more and perhaps too much into entertainment than their increase in income.</div>

Hahahaha...<br><br>But I can only reduce the politically impact, which is actually what's the game is all about.<br><br>I tell you JJ, trends are a result of human behaviors. Rules are set by gahmen. Power is the gahmen where the duties lie. This trend in Singapore cannot be siamed, and must be fight against. No gahmen worths the salt can siam, especially when it is in a small barren piles of rock.<br><br>You really think we are at the top of the growth...? Hahaha...<br>For those in the 60s, yes. They are seeing what they never imagined in 2007. For those who see Dow Jones at 4000 from 1000, 10000 is ridiculous.<br><br>How can Singapore be already at the top of curve? Can't you see how many heavily invested local talents stuck in zero or minimum capacity? Because of one Wee's attitude and the likes, the entire bunch outside elites are wasted capacity! You call this top of the curve?<br><br>Is this how economics implies? Is this growth peaked out? Look at Singaporeans. Groomy. Stucked. Wanna flee. This is what? Even cockeye should know this means heavily wasted capacity! And our governance is still going to create such happenings. Waste. Loss. Unhappiness. Then chaos.<br><br>We don't have a choice. This is trend that gahmen has to fight. They holds ultimate power, nobody can stop them to do good in Singapore. If this PM cannot wake up but continue with such thinking, no doubt we will have trouble.<br><br>We are not forcing the people. Jobless people want jobs suitable for them. Ambitious talents want positions to glow. Nobody would refuse to upgrade when they can afford to. We invest more than any countries per capita on education, and yet they are FORCED into Mcdonalds, driving taxis, cleaning... and we have totally incapable people in politics, offering shark fins. What is this? This kinda Tan Tock Seng how won't go into trouble?<br><br>Singapore is going the wrong way. And all the elites can do is blame whiners whining. You mean Singapore is paying these elites in political positions to deal with the trend by blaming whiners?<br><br>This is like western medication. They just try to cover the fire here and there and at the end, volcano exploded and they say "Oh... I do alot liao...". The whole basic thinking has to be reconsidered. Now the rentals are edging up again.<br><br>What does that mean? But has the governance improved or the situation different?<br><br>No.<br><br>Income gap will widen to a point where society will end in chaos which will destablise Singapore in the slightest wind. The most to suffer are the honest population, the good core, of every society. Families are broken, human love is undermined, conflicts resulted...<br><br>This is tsunami. It is not easy to swim through. JJ, you can just stand there and wait for tsunami, or migrate. I wanna evacuate. Under such smart elites, where got hope? And they still assume $2000 amonth is enough. And they still want babies. And after 40years of Nation building, we end up still a migrant society not only with foreigners flushing in, but also Singaporeans wanna get out in large scales...<br><br>So why bloat the education budget?<br><br>What direction can we entice the population? In this population, in political sense, it is a direction for both fit and unfit to become fit. Now if going by the norm, we are only aggravating situation. Only fools let such trend goes on becos as if tsunami come we stand here waiting. We have to weed out those not suitable for political offices and gear up for the tsunami.<br><br>We long ago should already be seriously prepared. But... ... Sigh. It's a shame we have kami kazes under the efficient and effective governance of caring MPs from the highest calibre... yahdayahdayahda...<br><br>Now PAP started out in a world of racial conflicts in the region. It was a trend. Last time they could fight for a utopia. Now they cannot? Now they can only say world imperfect? Now MM still calls himself fighter? What is he fighting against? Where are spirits of the old gahmen? All drown in the built up bureacratic culture...?<br><br>There is no utopia, so we go for one lah~<br>Not easy. I taught those kids and dealing with those funny parents and under such ironical situation more uneasy.<br><br>Now you either prepare to charge the walls or let it come crushing. The entire gahmen needs to be restructured! The entire direction needs to be revised! The entire thinking need to be evolved! And Singapore Inc MUST stop. The cross influences of Inc mentality to civil sector has created too negative an impact.<br><br>The only people who can help Singaporeans are wise men and women. The only things they need is not GST but good governance.<br><br>Anyway... ... ... ...<br>Actually since all clueless, we all just wait for things to happen. As it is the norm now. This issue and many others will never stop or remedied before the leader/s for the job rise to the occassion. JJ, disappointed as I may be, I understand we can only wait or run. Hahaha... sad but true, isn't it?<br><br>PAP has finally reached such a state... after the oldies shouted 'medaka'...<br>This era, who will lead us to shout medeka again...<br>I also want medaka.<br>You... got any lobang to work outside for poor Elfred?</blockquote>Elfred,<br><br>I think you have made some good points here about the current state of government, politics and political culture here:-<br><br>(1) The government's basic governing philosophy is flawed. It is aimed at making monies for itself through taxing and recovering all possible costs using all kinds of excuses to do so to good effect so far ..<br><br>(2) The average families (heartlanders staying in 3-4 room hdb flats) need to earn at least S$1,500.00 pm to pay for transport, utilities, schooling, meals and feeding the dependent elders but many are not earning S$1,000.00 pm or are unemployed or under-employed despite possessing educations.<br><br>(3) Such high costs of living were not caused by natural market forces but were caused by the system of government adopted. Many people including ngiam tong dow, active citizens have already given feedbacks which were largely ignored with leaders covering up such problems as Durai has done for the years.<br><br>(4) The taxing and cost-recovering system of government has already been the primary cause of our recessions and local businesses closures. Even with GDP growing at 7%, these local businesses will not turn around.<br><br>(5) Government uses its legal and administrative and the controlled media to bulldoze through all taxing and cost recovering and continue to cover up all the above-stated serious problems and deny feedbacks and stop internal debates with their mighty powers at the MM-controlled cabinet level with all the mps and ministers merely serving as underlings to support their doings and give an impression that everything is well.<br><br>Such a government does not solve real problems. It is merely covering up NKF problems by denials using their legal muscle and the controlled media to do so.<br><br>NFK is a small tsunami which erupted after the stupid sph gaff with durai. If not for this face-saving mistake by durai the whole system would have carried on ad infinitum supported quietly from behind by mrs goh, mm and sm and mrs lee.<br><br>This is a system based on government taking everything away from the people. The people are finding it more and more difficult to live even on necessities ..they can no longer afford to live and pay for the high hdb mortgages they were previously stuck with under gct era and none of our scholars can save the tsunami. Ambitious ministers and newbies like mah boh tan continue to push for more taxing and cost recovery to get into good book of mm and everyone continues to suffer.<br><br>They only made it worse and worse hoping that meritocracy or the education game will one day miraculously offer a cure.<br><br>There is no superman in the whole government who has the mighty prestige or abilities to save this nation.<br><br>I agree that it is a tsunami in the making which will destroy everything this country has built over the past 40 years.</div>
