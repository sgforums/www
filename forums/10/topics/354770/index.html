            <div class='col-md body'><p>Both the IMF and the United Nations have thrown their weight behind proposals to implement a new world reserve currency system to replace the dollar as part of the acceleration towards a global financial dictatorship, in the same week that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CFR globalists that he was “open” to the idea.<br><br>As we reported yesterday, Timothy Geithner initially renounced a Chinese and Russian proposal to supplant the dollar with a new global currency, but he later told CFR elitists, who have consistently lobbied for a global currency as part of a wider agenda for global government, that he was “open” to the idea. Indeed, before Geithner was appointed by Obama when he was still president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he argued for a new global central banking system shortly after attending the 2008 Bilderberg meeting.<br><br>Now the U.N. and the IMF have thrown their weight behind the move and reports indicate that the matter will be a major point of discussion at the upcoming G20 conference, with officials having initially dismissed speculation that a global currency would be on the agenda.<br><br>“A UN panel of expert economists pressed Thursday for a new global currency reserve scheme to replace the volatile, dollar-based system and for coordinated steps by rich countries to stimulate their economies,” reports AFP.<br><br>“A new Global Reserve System — what may be viewed as a greatly expanded SDR (Special Drawing Rights), with regular or cyclically adjusted emissions calibrated to the size of reserve accumulations, could contribute to global stability, economic strength and global equity,” the panel said.<br><br>In addition, “IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that talks on a new global reserve currency to replace the US dollar were “legitimate” and could take place “in the coming months,” according to the report.<br><br>As we have repeatedly warned, the introduction of a new global currency system is a key cornerstone in the move towards global government, centralized control and more power being concentrated into fewer hands.<br><br>A d v e r t i s e m e n t<br><br>The swift and ruthless exploitation of the economic meltdown on behalf of globalists and central banks who caused the problem in the first place revolves around their drive for a global monetary union, which is a directive coming from the very inner core of the CFR and the Bilderberg Group.<br><br><br>The Federal Reserve is already is a private organization and as such unaccountable to the American people. A global central bank, which is effectively what a new global reserve currency system will create, will establish a de facto financial dictatorship which will wield power over the economies of every country on the planet with no accountability whatsoever.<br><br>The ruling elite resolved long ago to force a global currency down our throats. In fact, a global currency is at the very core of their plan to dominate the world. Control money and you control the destiny of states, you eliminate national sovereignty. “The control of money and credit strikes at the very heart of national sovereignty,” A.W. Clausen, president of Bank of America once observed.<br><br>As Georgetown professor and CFR historian Carroll Quigley noted, the goal of the banking families and their minions consists of “nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole… controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.”<br><br>In 2007, Robert Mundell, “the father of the euro,” noted that “international monetary reform usually becomes possible only in response to a felt need and the threat of a global crisis.”<br><br>That very crisis arrived shortly after, providing the elite with the perfect opportunity to ram through a massive program of financial centralization by posing as the saviors - when they created the problem in the first place.<br><br>The very actions of the elite will continue to worsen the financial crisis, providing the necessary political capital for them to institute what they had planned all along - a new global currency for the global government that they plan to implement thereafter.</p></div>

              <p>Conspiracy morons like to quote above passage from Carroll Quigley's book Tragedy and Hope, a book that I myself like to quote.</p>
              <p>But they never quote the whole stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Modifications of productive and commercial organization and of
              financial practices made it almost impossible after 1919 to restore the
              financial system of 1914. Yet this is what was attempted. Instead of
              seeking to set up a new financial organization adapted to the modified economic organization, bankers and politicians insisted that the old
              prewar system should be restored. These efforts were concentrated in a
              determination to restore the gold standard as it had existed in 1914.</p>
              <p>In addition to these pragmatic goals, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the powers of financial
              capital­ism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a
              world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the
              politi­cal system of each country and the economy of the world as a

              arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>apex of
              the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle</strong></span>,
              Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central
              banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank, in
              the hands of men like Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin
              Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the Bank
              of France, and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, sought to dominate
              its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate
              foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the
              country, and to influence cooperative politicians by sub­sequent
              economic rewards in the business world.</p>
              <p>In each country the power of the central bank rested largely on
              its control of credit and money supply. In the world as a whole the
              power of the central bankers rested very largely on their control of
              loans and of gold flows. In the final days of the system, these central
              bankers were able to mobilize resources to assist each other through
              the B. I. S., where payments between central banks could be made by
              bookkeeping adjustments between the accounts which the central banks of
              the world kept there.</p>
              <p>The B. I. S. as a private institution was owned
              by the seven chief central banks and was operated by the heads of
              these, who together formed its governing board. Each of these kept a
              substantial deposit at the B. I. S., and periodically settled payments
              among themselves (and thus between the major countries of the world) by
              bookkeeping in order to avoid shipments of gold.</p>
              <p>They made agreements
              on all the major financial problems of the world, as well as on many of
              the economic and political problems, especially in reference to loans,
              payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the globe.</p>
              <p>The B. I. S. is generally regarded as the apex of the structure
              of financial capitalism whose remote origins go back to the creation of
              the Bank of England in 1694 and the Bank of France in 1803.</p>

              <p>There are a lot of rubbish statements in above report:</p>

              <p><em>As we have repeatedly warned, the introduction of a new global
                                      currency system is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a key cornerstone in the move towards global
                                      government,</strong></span> centralized control and more power being concentrated
                                      into fewer hands.</em></p>
              <p><em>The swift and ruthless exploitation of the economic meltdown <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>on behalf of globalists</strong></span> and central banks who caused the problem in the first place revolves around their drive for a global monetary union, which is a directive coming from the very inner core of the CFR and the Bilderberg Group.<br></em></p>
              <p><em><strong></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The ruling elite resolved long ago to force a global currency down
                                      our throats. </strong></span>In fact, a global currency is at the very core of
                                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>their plan to dominate the world.</strong></span></em></p>
