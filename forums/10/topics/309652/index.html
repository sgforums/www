              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">DINNER in the Duxton Road area turned out to be an eye-opener for MP Christopher de Souza.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He told Parliament he was surprised to see prostitutes lining the streets.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As this was not a red-light district, he felt something had to be
                  done to protect our heartlands from an invasion of street-walkers.</span></p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <div id="imu11">
              <table style="height: 66px;" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="1" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td>
              <p>
              
               <span style="color: #0000ff;"> 
              
              
                
              
              </span></p>
              </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mr
                  de Souza, who represents Ulu Pandan, highlighted the problem in
                  Parliament during the Budget debate yesterday and asked if more
                  financial resources would be available to tackle it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He noted that the number of foreign prostitutes arrested in 2006 was 4,310. This was a 34 per cent increase from 2005.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then last year, the number of foreign prostitutes arrested went up to 5,400, a further 25 per cent rise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said: 'Bids to contain the trade in Geylang have not been
                  successful. An evening drive down Duxton Road and Duxton Hill will
                  prove that prostitutes operate well beyond the artificial borders of
                  Geylang.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">'Prostitution is working itself into our heartlands.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">To laughter, he assured the House that he drove by the area with his wife.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He added that many of these sex workers came on two-week social
                  visit passes, and just before the fortnight was up, they would leave
                  for Johor Baru, only to return to Singapore the same day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The problem was so bad, he had received feedback that sexual services were being offered at shops claiming to offer massage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He asked what concrete steps the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
                  would take to curb this and strengthen the anti-vice squad with
                  additional manpower and intelligence officers to hunt vice syndicates
                  and clamp down on their operations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>OLICE OPERATIONS UP</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Responding to his questions, Senior Minister of State for Law and
                  Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, said it was impossible
                  to completely eliminate vice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said the majority of those arrested for vice activities were social visit pass holders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Prof Ho said that last year, the police conducted 950 vice-related operations, up from the 890 in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And they were focused on keeping vice activities within the traditional red-light district.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Speaking to The New Paper, Mrde Souza said residents had voiced their concerns over prostitution in their backyard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said: 'We should be careful they don't encroach into the heartland areas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">'I don't think it makes for a wholesome neighbourhood if your children have to grow up next to women plying their trade.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Turning to the problem of illegal moneylenders, or ah longs, he told
                  Parliament the words 'owe $ pay $' have stained the walls of many
                  common corridors at HDB flats.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He was not the only one to voice his concerns on the issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">West Coast GRC's Mr Arthur Fong and Mr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang) also shared his sentiment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In January last year, Prof Ho said there were 10,221 reported cases of unlicensed moneylending in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That was a 19 per cent increase over the 8,568 cases in 2005.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mr de Souza said that despite the enhancement of penalties under the
                  Moneylenders Act and the formation of the anti-unlicensed moneylending
                  task force to increase the number of ambush operations, these
                  syndicates have not been deterred.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He urged MHA to adopt a different strategy - consider making it an offence for people to borrow from an unlicensed moneylender.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He added that a borrower who gave a false address to loan sharks,
                  causing innocent residents to be harassed, deserved to be prosecuted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Prof Ho agreed that those who borrow to feed their vices and then abet loan sharks should not be treated as victims.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said they were part of the problem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While MHA had previously rejected the idea of punishing borrowers, ProfHo said they were now seriously considering it.</span></p>
              <p>Taken from the Straits Times ... perhaps this little bit of tibit got overshadowed by the escaped terrorist thingy ...</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/10/topics/OLICE%20OPERATIONS%20UP">linkie=&gt; </a></p>
              <p>Nice to see that not all MPs got their nose stuck in the air and head in the clouds .... he happens to be one of the youngest ( "elected" ) MP in parliament and also works at Lee and Lee's ... (the law firm that is, not the country) ...</p>
              <p>but hey, at least he's bringing up what has been painfully obvious to the peasants for a long time ... the kways have been fanning out into the heartlands ... and so have the loan sharks ....</p>
              <p>just the other day, a friend of mine, incidently also a lawyer, told me how his parents' flat got vandalized by loan sharks, together with all of the neighbours ... and not because anyone in his family borrowed money mind you ! ... no ! ... his doors got vandalized and the walls and gate got splashed with red paint cos his neighbour DOWNSTAIRS borrowed money from the loansharks and chabut'ed ... and so to pressurized and shame the chap into paying up, the loan sharks turned on THE NEIGHBOURS ! ....</p>
              <p>frankly ... I'm not sure if I should be surprise that the terrorist fellow escaped ... cos if the SPF can't even clear the streets of prossies, of ciggie sellers, and our heartlands of loansharks, how can they be expected to hold onto a foreign trained terrorist suspect  ? .....</p>

              <p>Actually ... I do buy into the idea of legalized prostitution ... it's better to have it nice and regulated, than to push the whole enterprise underground, or worse, for singapore men to visit chickens overseas ... dunno what kind of sauce head and bugs they'll catch with their peckers there ....</p>
              <p>but what's happening now is that the whole enterprise is spiralling out of control, with massage parlours rampant, unlicensed kways strutting around everywhere, moving out of their traditional areas, loansharks springing up, getting bolder and bolder etc, and now we have unlicensed ciggy sellers (who also happened to be illegal immigrants, if it's so easy for these chaps to slip in, what more a few JI terrorists ? ) sprouting up everywhere, a couple of weeks ago I was travelling from woodlands down to zheng hua and i saw a bunch of them squatting around just before 10 mile junction ... right after the highly publized police raid ......</p>
