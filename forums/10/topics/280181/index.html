Singapore is physically gorgeous. There's nice scenery and people here are kind and generous.'<br><br>The SDP group included Ms Chee Siok Chin - SDP chief Chee Soon Juan's sister - and party chairman Gandhi Ambalam.<br><br>They and others wore T-shirts with the words 'Democracy Now'.<br><br>They had gathered at Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park, then walked to Parliament and the Istana.<br><br>Mr Gandhi passed a letter, addressed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, to an official outside the Istana.<br><br>Said Mr Cooper: 'I was taking pictures of the President's palace when I saw this group.<br><br>'I was curious about them so I started filming them.<br><br>'Protests are a way of life in Washington. Groups gather to protest for all sorts of things, from farmers' rights to the Iraq war.'<br><br>During our conversation, he touched on themes such as free speech, democracy and the right toprotest.<br><br>DENIES GETTING INVOLVED<br><br>When told that the Government here has a policy against foreigners getting involved in local politics, Mr Cooper claimed he was not doing that.<br><br>He said: 'I'm not that sophisticated to be able to analyse politics in Singapore.'<br><br>Mr Cooper denied being linked with any human rights group and claimed he was working on a political novel.<br><br>Mr Gandhi denied any knowledge of Mr Cooper or of his filming their march.<br><br>He said: 'We posted details of today's march on our website. Anyone could have found out about our event.'<br><br>The website invited the public to see the group off at Hong Lim Park and join them for a candlelight vigil at Queenstown Remand Prison.<br><br>The New Paper later discovered a few things that did not tally with Mr Cooper's words.<br><br>Although he claimed to have chanced upon the group near the Istana, he was spotted near them at Hong Lim Park.<br><br>Checks also showed that he is the executive director of Worldrights, a four-year-old US-based non-profit human rights organisation.<br><br>A picture on the organisation's website showed that he was the same man interviewed by The New Paper.<br><br>Worldrights' website states that Mr Cooper has appeared before many international human rights bodies, including the UN Commission on Human Rights.<br><br>When The New Paper tried to call him on his handphone, he did not answer, but a voice mail response identified him as the Worldrights executive director.<br><br>So, was it coincidence that a human rights activist happened to be present at the SDP protest? Or was the protest stage-managed for the benefit of a foreign audience?<br><br>From the Istana, the SDP members walked to Queenstown Remand Prison, where Mr Chee is serving a three-week jail term. Mr Cooper was no longer with them.<br><br>Dr Chee was jailed on 4 Sep after failing to pay an $8,000 fine for leaving Singapore while bankrupt.<br><br>The SDP members, with Dr Chee's wife and three children, held a candlelight vigil outside.<br><br>When asked if they had a permit for their march, Mr Gandhi said: 'Why do I need a permit when I'm just walking from one place to another?'<br><br>However, the police said the group had ignored their advice not to break the law.<br><br>Mr Gandhi said the demonstration was to mark the first anniversary of the SDP'sattempt to protest during the IMF-World Bank meeting here last year. </blockquote>---The New Paper 17.09.2007.</div>
