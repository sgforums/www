                          world-renowned Times newspaper of London published a report in its July
                          5th edition titled, “Saudis give nod to Israeli raid on Iran.” The
                          story, were it true, would imply a dramatic change in Saudi foreign and
                          military policy whose consequences potentially could lead to a World
                          War III. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A more serious investigation reveals that there are nasty
                          elements of what military psychologists and intelligence specialists
                          term “disinformation” at work trying to foster discord across the
                          Muslim oil-producing world. The question is Qui Bono? Who ultimately
                          benefits from such disinformation?</strong></span></span></em><br></span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>According
                          to the London Times, the flagship paper of the giant media group owned
                          by naturalized American citizen, Australian media mogul, Rupert
                          Murdoch, “The head of Mossad, Israel’s overseas intelligence service,
                          has assured Benjamin Netanyahu, its prime minister, that Saudi Arabia
                          would turn a blind eye to Israeli jets flying over the kingdom during
                          any future raid on Iran’s nuclear sites.” </span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>The
                          London paper went on to report to allege that Meir Dagan, the head of
                          Israeli’s Mossad intelligence service, had held secret meetings early
                          this year with leading Saudi officials and that as well former Israeli
                          Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had held such secret talks. Citing an
                          unnamed “diplomatic source” from an unnamed country, the Times went on
                          to quote, “The Saudis have tacitly agreed to the Israeli air force
                          flying through their airspace on a mission which is supposed to be in
                          the common interests of both Israel and Saudi Arabia.”</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>Were
                          that report accurate, it would be, excuse the expression, a bombshell
                          of a nuclear dimension. The story suggests that war preparations
                          against Iran are very advanced in the wake of the tumultuous elections
                          in Iran last month in which the conservative <span> </span>Mahmud
                          Ahmedinejad was declared the victor against massive opposition
                          protests, protests fanned actively from outside at a certain point by
                          US Government-linked NGOs and by the US State Department. </span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>A
                          recent statement by Obama’s Vice President, Joe Biden with ABC's George
                          Stephanoupolos, where he said in answer to a question: "Look, Israel
                          can determine for itself — it's a sovereign nation — what's in their
                          interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else."
                          Whether we agree or not? The interviewer asked. "Whether we agree or
                          not," said the vice president.” That suggested that the Obama
                          Administration had changed its earlier reported “veto” over potential
                          Israeli military strike in Iran. It was the first time a senior Obama
                          administration official left Israeli the military option against Iran's
                          nuclear sites.</span></p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>Because
                          the Times story was so important and because the implications of a

                          Iranian targets could potentially unleash a Holy War within the
                          one-billion strong Muslim world, I decided to probe more deeply. What
                          emerged was quite different from the Times account.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>I
                          contacted very reliable sources with extensive involvement in Saudi
                          Arabia and who have been reliable in the past, to ask whether the Times
                          story of a secret agreement with Israel over bombing Iran was accurate.
                          The answer I got back was revealing.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>The
                          Times itself cited a denial statement from the Saudi Government, but in
                          a way to leave the impression it was not serious, merely covering up
                          the truth of the Times story of collusion between Israeli intelligence
                          and the Saudi Kingdom.<span>   </span></span></p>

                          to this Saudi inside confidential source, however, “not only have we
                          denied it, it would be absolute political suicide to even contemplate
                          letting the Israelis cross our airspace!”</span></strong></span></span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>That
                          corresponded with my knowledge of years of quiet diplomatic dialogue
                          between, yes, even Ahmedinejad and the Saudi Royal family. Indeed, it
                          was reportedly largely due to agreement between Iran’s Ahmedinejad and
                          the Saudi King Abdullah, during a personal meeting in Riyadh in March
                          2007, that agreement was reached to try to create lessening of tensions
                          between Sunni and Shiite muslim groups in Iraq. Those talks had more to
                          do, according to on-the-ground reports, with the dramatic falloff in
                          killings in Iraq than General Petraeus’ infamous “surge” strategy. <span> </span></span></p>

                          Times of London is one of the world’s best known newspapers. In its
                          better times, during the First and even Second World Wars, it was the
                          newspaper of record of Britain, comparable to what the New York Times
                          also once was in the United States. The Times in those days was one of
                          the most influential propaganda instruments of a little-known and
                          extremely influential elite group that called itself the Round Table,
                          as in King Arthur’s legendary Knights of the Round Table. The Round
                          Table group, initially created out of the will of British mining
                          magnate and inciter of the 1899 Boer War, Sir Cecil Rhodes, played a
                          key role in manipulating British pubic opinion into going to war in
                          1914 against the German “Hun,” in a fruitless attempt to save the
                          “English way of life” as they saw it, to save the declining British
                          Empire.<span>   </span></span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="DE"><br>Since
                          the newspaper came into financial difficulties in the early 1980’s, its
                          then-owners, the Astor family, sold it and Australian media czar Rupert
                          Murdoch bought it, placing it under his News Corporation International
                          which also owns the New York Post, the San Antonio Star, the Hollywood
                          20th Century Fox studios, the right-wing neo-conservative Fox News TV
                          network and until recently the flagship of US neo-conservative William
                          Kristol, the Weekly Standard. In 2007 Murdoch added the prestigious
                          Wall Street Journal to his stable.</span></p>

                          Board of Directors of Murdoch’s News Corp. holding company, owners of
                          the Times of London, is also interesting. It includes, in addition to
                          Murdoch as Chairman and CEO, also former Spanish Prime Minister Jose
                          Maria Aznar, the very conservative and very controversial friend of
                          Britain’s Tony Blair, who split EU opposition to the 2003 Iraq War by
                          backing Blair and Bush. Murdoch’s board also includes Andrew Knight of
                          J. Rothschild Capital Management, the financial holding of Jacob Lord
                          Rothschild, the head of the British branch of the legendary financial
                          family. It also includes Viet D. Dinh who served as an Assistant
                          Attorney General of the United States from 2001 to 2003, under George
                          W. Bush, and who was the chief architect of the USA PATRIOT Act. </span></p>

                          put it mildly, Murdoch’s News Corp. has a distinct political or
                          geopolitical profile. It is clearly in the neo-conservative war hawk
                          camp. It clearly backed Tony Blair, who according to London sources,
                          owed his job to the backing of Murdoch’s Sun tabloid newspaper in the
                          UK, a paper better known for sensational stories than for serious
                          analysis. That puts the “impartiality” of Blair today as official
                          “Envoy of the Quartet” on the Middle East, the Quartet being the motley
                          combination of the United Nations, the European Union, the United

                          Murdoch’s Times chose to cite the infamous former Bush UN “acting”
                          Ambassador, neo-conservative John Bolton, who told the Times that it
                          was “entirely logical” for the Israelis to use Saudi airspace. The
                          Times wrote, “Bolton, who has talked to several Arab leaders, added:
                          ‘None of them would say anything about it publicly but they would
                          certainly acquiesce in an over-flight if the Israelis didn’t trumpet it
                          as a big success.’ Arab states would condemn a raid when they spoke at
                          the UN but would be privately relieved to see the threat of an Iranian
                          bomb removed, he said.” </span></p>

                          right-wing political machine. As Bush Administration State Department
                          official, Bolton was accused by his associates of helping fake

                          against Iran, the false story spreads and sows distrust that functions
                          along the classic lines of Roman military strategy: divide and conquer.</strong></span></span> Whatever internal disagreement in foreign policy between the regime of

                          likely the case is that the Saudis – no matter how much they
                          disapproved of Iran—would always side with a fellow Muslim before they
                          would side with Israel or the US. The Iranian leaders come to Saudi

                          could be very destabilizing, and it is the unintended consequences of
