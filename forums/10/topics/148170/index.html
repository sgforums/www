But our security measures seem to be just for show.  Not even for deterrent effect.<br><br>What kind of stupid terrorist will bomb a place without doing research.<br><br>Those security guards at MRT stations seem to be targetting only people with big bags.  I myself was asked to let them check my duffel bag while on the way to the gym.  Now wait, if it were a terrorist, do you think he'd be so stupid to carry a big bag which will attract undue attention to him?<br><br>And how do those marshalls propose to patrol trains when the bloody profiteering SMRT and SBS have only profit motive in mind and all they can think of is to pack as many people as possible in the trains during the peak hours.<br><br>This shows that the big joke Tony Tan and our highly paid ministers don't know a clue about the state of our "public" transport.  You know, when there's a bomb, hey, they will be safe in their bullet proof and big and comfortable cars!<br><br>And have you noticed those airport and Jurong Port patrols?  THey are NSFs whose only experience with firing live rounds is at the range and the once a year exercise!!  And worse, they use rifles!!  I wonder how Teo Chee Hean proposes to shoot 1 single terrorist with a rifle in a crowded terminal at Changi Airport.  And that is assuming he can shoot with zero recoil!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what our authorities are doing, is just too PREDICTABLE to the Terrorists, because everybody thinks the Terrorists are PREDICTABLE.<br><br>NO. NOT PREDICTABLE!<br><br>It's the other way round; the Terrorists CAN predict us, we CANNOT predict what or where they will target next. This sucks...<br><br>My concern is; (authorities, please OPEN YOUR EYES &amp; EARS!) what if, they strike HDB block of flats just to show their displeasure but not to cripple our economy? Can you imagine the degree of PARANOIMIA a bomb blast at any one of the countless HDB flats in Singapore will do to the general PEACE among our people????<br><br>Blowing up one block is enough to throw everyone into a mad frenzy to stay out of their HDB flats. And the damage and fatality of such an unthinkable thing, would be VERY greivious indeed.<br><br>This is a classic case of ; when opponent covers his face, kick his genitals.</div>
