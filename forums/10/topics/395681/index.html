              <div class="kicker">POLITICS OF DEMOCRACY</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Confrontational model not ideal for S'pore</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the report, 'Chiam's SDP exit: Wife speaks up' (March 29), 
              and Dr Chee Soon Juan's response last Friday, 'No one forced Chiam out: 
              SDP chief'.</p>
              <p>I do not know either of them personally, nor have I voted 
              for them. But I regard Mr Chiam highly as an opposition MP - he has 
              contributed in no insignificant way to Singapore politics.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee, however, seems more intent on introducing a 
              confrontational Western-style democracy in Singapore. While that model 
              may work in some countries, it does not mean it is the best and only 
              model for us.</p>
              <p>In the West, individualism is supreme. But at what price?</p>
              <p>In the United States, something as basic and fundamental as 
              health-care reform has taken years to push through because of bipartisan
               politics.</p>
              <p>Teens continue to be shot at in schools because the right to
               bear arms is more important than the lives and safety of children. 
              Politicians do what is necessary to be elected instead of doing what is 
              right.</p>
              <p>Nearer home, look at what is happening in Thailand. Once a 
              peaceful country, it is now torn apart because of the confrontations 
              between two main parties.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a young country with a multiracial population. 
              While we have enjoyed peace for many years now, our society remains 
              fragile. Harmony is key to our survival and our future. In this 
              scenario, political contests by rival parties based on a confrontational
               approach are not the best model.</p>
              <p>The West may not view this as democracy. But so what? What 
              is more important is that it works for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>There are policies of the People's Action Party (PAP) 
              government I disagree with. And there are many areas it can improve on. 
              But it has to be admitted that the PAP has transformed itself over the 
              years. More and more, the focus is on bottom-up participation.</p>
              <p>Also, under the PAP government over the years, Singapore has
               continued to achieve progress and prosperity. The little red dot is now
               the envy of people around the world.</p>
              <p>To quote Chinese leader Deng Xiao-ping: 'It doesn't matter 
              if the cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice.'</p>
              <p>The criterion should be what works and what does not, to 
              enable Singapore to achieve its best potential.</p>
              <p>It does not matter if we have a full Western-style 
              democracy, partial demo-cracy or socialism that works the Singapore way.
               What is important is that we continue to achieve happiness, prosperity 
              and progress based on justice and equality.</p>
              <p>The opposition parties can and do have a role to play. That 
              is, if they are willing to be constructive, as Mr Chiam has been, rather
               than destructive.</p>

              <p>You got mix up with Dr Chee personnal issue and our politic, how on earth can you said Dr Chee adopt a confrontational model when he has yet to rule here??? Yes, Dr Chee can be tempermental, but that is his personnal style, a person being busy with personnal legal trials and actions tends to be abit tempermental toward the prosecutor who charged him, dun tell me you laugh and smile at the one who is sueing you??</p>
              <p>What, Chiam is constructives??? omg! he and that low are living in a cave, that is why LKY dun care them so much, they are merely local minded politician who knows how to patronise kopitiam and funerals. But people like late Uncle JB and Chee are different, these are the clever ones that can influence the world in a way of looking at Singapore, that is why LKY worry about them and that is why he prosecuted them hard hard...understand!!!</p>

              <p>i would like to disagree with you here..chiam actually made a good move if you can see in my angle that</p>
              <p>1) he did not end up like JBJ which also unearth the "dirty" side of politics</p>
              <p>2)since JBJ did take the full brunt of the warth of you know who, however in a global scale it would put him at a disadvantage where other leaders especially likely the US would brand LKY more to dicatorship rule that what he promised, should he put the same effect to chiam too.</p>
              <p>i hope you think of policies for the sake of the people here and how it affects the country both locally and  on a  global scale s it would be the only option left to seriously challange the "iron fisted" rule here in this country.</p>

But people like late Uncle JB and Chee are different, these are the clever ones that can influence the world in a way of looking at Singapore, that is why LKY worry about them and that is why he prosecuted them hard hard...understand!!!</p>

              <p>What is the purpose of being a survivor in politics and at the end of the day being seen as an inconsequential and ineffective politician ?</p>
              <p>1) What or how did JBJ '<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">unearth the "dirty side" of politics</span></em>' ?</p>
              <p>Politics had been made dirty by the dubious standards of politics practised by LKY that began in 1962 in his desparate attempts to manipulate the population in a false Referendum to fulfill his own ambitions to enter into a merger with Malaysia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Are you suggesting that it is worthless for JBJ to have done what he did, and it is better to follow in the quiet footsteps of Chiam - to be docile and survive ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is Chiam being honest with himself as a politician ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, JBJ died an honorable man, respected at the end even by LHL - who had little choice but to admit his admiration in public even when his publicly expressed view was hypocritically and diametrically against his father - MM LKY.</p>
              <p>Even as JBJ had not achieve any political landmark - he did give his honest best to represent the plights of all Singaporeans suffering under LKY guided PAP policies.</p>
              <p>JBJ was a voice for Singaporeans and had at least served the purpose of revealing the wicked venom in the political animal that LKY had displayed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can Chiam display the same honesty that JBJ had shown in representing the voices of Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p><br>Even if they make a mistake, at least they tried with guts and all rights reserved, and such precedences will set the motion and lesson for the juniors like JB's Son and others to look at it and revise the way of handling PAP.</p>
              <p>PAP had infact never answered a single question post by JB or Chee, whatever they said or asked is consider defamation that came with brutal prosecution that not only put them down and out, but also shown to the public that you dun mess with LKY and his PAP. For LKY, he actually love peoples like JB and Chee, it is for him to show his power and for him to skill two birds with one stone. One to shut up the opposition, the other to draw a clear line to any Singaporean who try to be funny or oppose him. And when no one oppose or take him on, his emperor chair remain warm.</p>
              <p>I like to take LKY as in my young bedtime fairy tales of the Emperor New Cloth, if today LKY is to walk nake on the street, people would still said his clothing is very nice, oppositions should therefore work in a way of getting better understand of the influence of LKY and his PAP</p>

              <p>Yes, they make mistakes in their life, but their struggle for a different, more open and just society is very much appreciated, that is part we feel they deserve some respect, LKY was at JB funeral to respect his courage, his fighting spirit and his believes. The way a Man sacrifice his interest for the benefit of the society is much an honor to call for, and their mistakes helped their successors to learn from it and be wary of not making the same mistakes again. The struggle will never end, and each step, we learn the mistakes we make and improve on it, success will not succeed without failure or mistakes. The Art of war also learn from failure and mistake make in world to spell out the essential needs when dealing with enemy, it is not something that come out of a person mind and put it in writing without experience failure or war mistakes.</p>
