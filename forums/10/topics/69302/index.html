            <div class='col-md body'>While I DO NOT condone with the possession of, and viewing of pornography by students in or out of school, I also DO NOT condone with the way in which the school treated these students. They are NOT TERRORISTS! They are merely young and curious.<br><br>No matter what wrong a student, or a group of students have committed, they are still humans. Which means they should be treated with some basic degree of human rights; such as their need to eat, drink, or relief themselves. According to the news, they were treated like some prisoners or like illegal immigrants rounded up and made to squat under the hot sun without food, or water, and basically denied human needs.<br><br>What is this school trying to show? I truly hope, the parent of the sick child take apprpriate legal action against this particular school, and make them pay for the medical costs!<br><br>I know, that it is a serious breach of any school's regulation to be in possession of pornographic materials, and appropriate punishment and penalties must be metted out to the offender. But the school in question, should also be mindful that they are handling young humanbeings, that needs to be treated with some basic rights. Handing the 14 year old boy to the Police, only ruins his future. Does the 14 year old boy learn COMPASSION like this??<br><br>In today's internet age and time, pornography is easily accessible by anyone young or old. So please, don't so closed-minded. Don't go to the extent of "capital punishment" for the possession of pornography like drug possession in Singapore. Total restriction only further sweetens the forbidden fruit, but by this I do not mean pornography is acceptable materials for the young.<br><br>You want to go global? Then we have to be flexible in these sort of things that comes with going GLOBAL!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The school authority's reaction was over-the-top, unnecessary and ham-fisted. No doubt it is a serious offence, but the punishment must fit the crime, and this is definitely a case of over-reaction if there ever was one.<br><br>Confiscate the material, warn them, inform the parents, suspend them. By all means! But having them wait for 7 hours without food and drink and even calling the police?

            <div class='col-md body'>It was indeed poorly handled by the school administration, notably their principal who gave a feeble excuse like "it was an oversight on our part" or somthing like that.<br><br>And how is it she can claim that the sch admin had no knowledge of the hospitalised student's medical condition after the whole incident was played out? Clearly a breakdown in communication within the sch admin which underlines the lack of interest in any child's welfare.<br><br>While i agree strong punishment shd be mete out to guilty parties, settling the issue as a sch rather than inviting the police would have proven a more diplomatic solution.
