And now we strongly believe that the time has come for us to express our unhappiness to the government.<br><br>First and foremost, there should be an immediate freeze on the number of foreigners allowed into the country.<br><br>The country now has 5,000,000 residents give or take a few thousand, and the social infrastructure is now bursting at the seams.<br><br>Before taking in anymore foreigners, the country’s infrastructure such as public transportation should be upgraded at these new arrivals’ cost, not at locals’ expenses; if they want to come here to earn a living, then they should contribute something to improving the country instead of simply taking from it.<br><br>We are often told that foreigners are a buffer who will be the first to be retrenched in a recession. How true is that really? If anything, the reverse is true; tens of thousands of locals have lost their jobs, replaced by foreigners.<br><br>After all, in a recession, who would the employer retrench, the foreign scholar whose education he paid for, or the local who paid for his own education?<br><br>We are also told that it is in the country’s strategic interests that locals should work in such fields such as construction and shipbuilding instead of depending upon foreigners. Why is this so? Aren’t we always being told that foreigners do such jobs locals shun? And there’s a very good reason why locals shun such jobs too: they’re very dangerous, with high industrial accident rates.<br><br>Furthermore, why are foreigners employed in such a strategically vital field such as the utilities industry? Can anyone imagine what would happen to the country should disgruntled foreigners decide to shut the country’s waterworks down because </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;     ">Singapore</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;     "> got into a major diplomatic spat with their homeland? The entire country will grind to a halt from lack of freshwater if that should ever happen.<br><br>Next, the authorities should take a good hard look at the quality of the so-called foreign “talent” entering the country.<br><br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;     ">Nobody in his right mind would object to someone of the caliber of Professor Stephen Hawking being given a job as an NUS lecturer. However, it’s entirely another matter altogether when the country takes in foreigners to fill up posts that can easily be done by locals.<br><br>Why on Earth should the country take in HR managers from China, Malaysia or India when this is a post that any suitably qualified local can perform<br><br>Moreover, there have been many complaints from locals that these foreign managers discriminate against them at work; what guarantees do we have that they don’t discriminate against locals in favor of their own kind?<br><br>We are constantly being told that the country’s only resources are its people, so we should all continuously go for upgrading classes, almost always at our own expense.<br><br>Even retrenched people for whom cash flow is a major concern are told to upgrade their skills at their own cost to improve their marketability, but what is the use of skills upgrading when all the good jobs are going to foreigners?<br><br>Some of our national leaders have said that local professionals should seek their fortunes overseas as there are plenty of vacancies for them overseas, but good jobs available locally should be reserved for the foreigners as otherwise they would not want to come.<br><br>In the first place, doesn’t the government always claim that </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;     ">Singapore</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;     "> is a meritocracy? If it truly is one, then why should good jobs be reserved for foreigners, or even elite scholars for that matter?<br><br>Shouldn’t everyone compete for jobs on an equal footing instead? And for that matter, why should local professionals look for good jobs overseas so that foreigners can be enticed by good jobs that are reserved for them here?<br><br>Why can’t the foreigners seek their good job opportunities elsewhere instead of here? We are often told that we should allow our parents to move in with us to keep the family unit intact; doesn’t forcing us to seek better prospects overseas run contrary to this? Or are we supposed to uproot our parents from their friends and the land they call home to settle someplace they are unfamiliar with?<br><br>In the past, the government has often denounced locals who migrate in search of a better life elsewhere as quitters; that being the case aren’t the so-called foreign “talents” that the country is taking in also quitters? And why are our own people who seek greener pastures elsewhere being condemned as quitters when foreign quitters are welcomed with open arms, especially since it is government policies that are driving the locals out of the country? </span></em></span></em></p>

              <p><strong>By Tan Keng Leng, Guest Columnist</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are often told that the secret to the US’ success is its ability to attract the best talents from around the world, but even so, companies there that wish to employ foreigners are first required to prove that no American national is able to perform the job the foreigner is being recruited for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another frequent argument given is that foreigners bring in valuable experiences that locals lack. That is true only up to a certain point; a middle-aged foreign professional who has worked in a dozen or more countries certainly would fit this description.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, a 20-something year old China national who has studied here at taxpayers’ expense since kindergarten up to PhD level definitely does not. Whatever knowledge he/she possesses, he/she studied it here, and whatever experience he/she possesses, he/she gained it here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what valuable experience does he/she have to contribute to the betterment of the country? And for that matter, is the country even attracting truly talented foreigners at all? We would like to draw your attention to the following GeBiz tenders below:</p>

              <p><strong>ENGLISH LANGUAGE BRIDGING PROGRAM FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>ENTERING SEC 3 IN 2010</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIFICATION OF DETAILS OF PROGRAM</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Target group: </strong>6 students from China </li>
              <li><strong>Total number of hours of lessons:</strong> 200 </li>
              <li><strong>Duration of program:</strong> November – December 2009 (lessons to be carried out over the 9 weeks in Nov – Dec.) </li>
              <li><strong>Program Objectives:</strong> The program should amply prepare these foreign students for a smooth transition from a Chinese learning environment to the local education scene by teaching them the essential skills to cope with the Secondary 3 ‘O’ level EL Program. </li>
              <li><strong>Qualifications of trainer(s):</strong> The trainer(s) must have at least a university degree in English Language / English Literature and some experience teaching English Language in a secondary school or to foreign students. The trainer(s) should be patient and encouraging in guiding these students. It would also be ideal if the trainer(s) is conversant in Mandarin. [The trainer(s) should submit his/her/their curriculum vitae to the school for consideration.] </li>
              <li><strong>Program Approach</strong>: The program must create a conducive learning environment of diverse learning opportunities to hone speaking, reading, listening, and writing skills in the learners. The learners should also be engaged in a series of writing practices which should be graded and which should consist of constructive feedback on how the learners can improve their language competency. The program must include various forms of formative and summative assessment, such that the students’ learning should culminate in their eventual performance at an end-of-program test. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Are we the only ones, or have others noticed the contradiction in the tenders as well? We are always being told that Singapore is a meritocracy, and that scholarships are handed out only to the best students. Is this really the case here?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all, if the PRC students benefiting from these programs are truly of scholarly caliber, then shouldn’t they already be sufficiently proficient in English so as not to require these additional lessons?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conversely, if they require such extensive English lessons just to keep up with locals as implied by the term “bridging program”, then doesn’t it prove that they are unworthy of their scholarships?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moreover, local students who are good in all subjects except for one or two have to undergo additional tuition lessons paid for by their own parents; why then shouldn’t these PRC students have to pay for their own English tuition lessons as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should we taxpayers have to foot the bill for them, when we would much rather have the money put to much better use by nurturing talented local students to their fullest potential instead?</p>
              <p>Instead of paying for additional English lessons for these PRC nationals, shouldn’t the government provide more bursaries for needy local children?</p>
              <p>

All courses are open to the scholars, except for medicine and dentistry.<br><br>According to a Filipino daily – the Global Nation, the Singapore Embassy will be accepting scholarship applications for school year 2010-2011 starting 16 November 2009. (Source: Global Nation)<br><br>The scholarship covers three to four years of tertiary study depending on the discipline, return airfare, full tuition and a living allowance of $4,300 per year. It has no bond and scholars do not need to work for the Singapore government.<br><br>The scholars will be selected based on their academic merit, leadership qualities and potential to contribute to the Philippines’ development.<br><br>Besides the Philipines, the Singapore Ministry of Education as well as its three varsities are known to award various scholarships to bright college students in other countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, China and India.<br><br>The Schools of Engineering of both NUS and NTU have a sizable proportion of students from India and China. (Your correspondent thought he was in China when he had lunch at the NUS Science Canteen recently after visiting a friend who was warded in NUH)<br><br>Each year, there are a number of Singapore students who fail to qualify for the course of their choice in the local universities and have to pursue their tertiary education overseas.<br><br>While some local undergraduates have to take up part-time jobs to finance their studies, some foreign students studying in Singapore universities on government scholarships offered by MOE have their tuition fees pay for entirely on top of a monthly allowance. They are often enrolled in courses like engineering, computing and science.<br><br>Some of these scholars are guaranteed good-paying jobs upon graduation - they are required to work in approved companies by the Singapore government for between three to eight years. <br><br>While other scholarships like the one above do not require the scholars to serve the Singapore government, they are permitted to stay on to work. A number of them take up Singapore PR and citizenship eventually.<br><br>In contrast, Singapore graduates have to seek out jobs on their own and are burdened with a hefty study loan to repay at the same time. Singapore males are at the losing end compared to foreigners as they have reservist obligations to fulfill yearly.<br><br>First-generation PRs and citizens do not have to serve any form of National Service and they are entitled to the same rights and benefits as Singaporeans, not that they amount to much anyway.<br><br>Attached below is a list scholarships offered by local universities and MOE to foreign students:<br><br>1. National Technological University<br><br>2. National University of Singapore<br><br>3. ASEAN scholarships (full tuition fees covered with an annual living allowance of $4,200, no bond required)<br><br>4. Goh Keng Swee scholarship for Asian students (full tuition fees covered with annual maintenance allowance and one return economy air passage to home country, required to work for three years in approved company in Singapore – essentially a bond)<br><br>5. Singapore Undergraduate Scholarship (tuition fees covered with annual maintenance allowance of $6,000 and one return economy air passage to home country, required to work for six years in sponsoring/approved company in Singapore)<br><br>6. Singapore scholarship for foreign students (tuition fees covered with annual maintenance allowance of $4,300 and one return economy air passage to home country, no bond required.)<br><br>7. C N Yang International undegraduate scholarships (tuition fees covered with annual maintenance allowance of $8,200, guaranteed place in hall of residence for 4 years, 3 years bond with Singapore government.)<br><br>Source: The Temasek Review</div>

              <p> cos they are no longer leaders but pretending to be one now. honestly - 10 or 15 years ago  PAP was a party that was trustworthy and sincere. They were not perfect but they were listening and were willing to talk to citizens of all levels. Now they talk down, dictate and arrogate ability and moreover assume that only they are clever. Well, cleverness is not intelligence lar. It is their elitism - their nemesis</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, sadly it is simply a 'wayang party' (i borrowed this) - which i interpret as no longer trustworthy, reliable and simply out of touch with the common man. When one alienates the masses and try to hoodwink by short-sighted policies/legislation or .... n suppress the lies by controlled propaganda,the truth of ... will sooner or later surface.</p>

              <p>These days, the government will say they favour citizens 1 year before elections.</p>
