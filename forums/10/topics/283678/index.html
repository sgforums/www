            <div class='col-md body'>From SDP website.<br><br>Isn't it the nadir of nadirs when foreigners in Singapore stage a protest when locals cannot?<br><br>A blogsite (http://www.instablogs.com/gallery/SIN10209281000) reported: "Expatriate women living in Singapore wear red T-shirts as part of a global action Friday, Sept. 28, 2007 in Singapore to support the brave in Myanmar. Myanmar's deadly military crackdown prompted protests and warnings from the reclusive nation's Asian neighbors, with China and Japan agreeing Friday to join efforts to help end the strife."<br><br>The photography clearly shows that there were more than five persons in the gathering, that the activity was held outdoors, and that someone was giving a speech.<br><br>According to the police, such an activity is considered an unlawful assembly and also making a speech without a permit.<br><br>Of course the question on everyone's minds must be: Did they have a permit? More important, did the police warn the group like they did with the SDP outside the Burmese embassy?<br><br>Or is the police afraid of engaging Westerners on the issue of free speech and peaceful assembly? It seems easier to intimidate locals and Burmese.<br><br>In any event, the expatriates must be commended for their initiative and courage to defy unjust and oppressive laws that deny people their right freedoms of speech and assembly.<br><br>Singaporeans must also demonstrate such courage. Come down to the Burmese embassy at St MartinÂ’s Drive and sign the petition. The signature campaign is in its fourth day and will continue until further announced.<br><br>Note: For security purposes, only the signatures will be submitted. The signatories names will not be sent in.<br><br></div>

Else, they didn't get loudhailer Chee to hijack and broadcast the possibly short gathering. Thus the police might not have known about it. No placards, no headbands it seems. Just a few ang moh gathering and someone giving a speech. If i were standing opposite them i might not have known they were supporting the burmese cause.</div>

If you looked at the photo, they were well dressed and organised. They stood around while someone was giving a speech. They even had name tags on them. They didn't even look like they were protesting or demonstrating. Basically they might have just gone there, made a short speech to themselves and left.</div>

Dr CSJ's trips were largely to attend international conferences rather than work purposes.<br><br>Then again, not that I support it but I see no reason why the authorities should prevent him from doing so. It lends credence to their stand that he was bankrupted to prevent him from travelling and becoming a threat overseas and if that was not the government's purpose, they would have inadvertently created the wrong impression.<br><br>Bottom line is, I find both the PAP and Singapore government's handling of opposition parties wanton and gives the impression that they are more fearful of losing power than what they claim. Whether it is at the legal or grassroots levels, they tend to overkill.<br><br>Regards</div>
