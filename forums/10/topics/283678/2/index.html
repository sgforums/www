SDP showed extra zeal for Burma's case...... why not Thailand when the coup happened?? Oobviously S'pore govt was their target from the beginning when they planned the petition.....

If you looked at the photo, they were well dressed and organised. They stood around while someone was giving a speech. They even had name tags on them. They didn't even look like they were protesting or demonstrating. Basically they might have just gone there, made a short speech to themselves and left.</div></blockquote>Compare this to the Anti-Odex protest? Come on, it only a group of teens protesting with toys action figures. They don't look like protesting too, look more like a group of anime fan gathering together. Yet, the police sent <strong>4 riot police buses, took down their identities, and video records the group activities</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So, why the different treatment?</div>
