            <div class='col-md body'>Nigerians React Angrily to Execution of Nigerian in Singapore<br>By Gilbert da Costa<br>Abuja<br>27 January 2007<br><br>Singapore's execution of a Nigerian convicted of drug trafficking has provoked some angry reactions in Nigeria. Gilbert da Costa in Abuja reports for VOA, Nigerians are particularly upset that even their president's intervention could not save the young Nigerian.<br><br>Nigeria's leading human rights groups, politicians and opposition figures have issued a strong denunciation of the hanging Friday of 21-year-old Iwuchukwu Tochi.<br><br>Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and international human rights groups had appealed for clemency.<br><br>Dubem Onyia, Nigeria 's former deputy foreign minister, says Nigeria should break diplomatic ties with Singapore. "The Nigerian government has a right to protect the interest of Nigerians abroad, and should immediately severe diplomatic relationship with Singapore. In any case, we don't have a Singaporean Embassy in Nigeria. If Singapore can treat Nigerians the way they treated us, the best thing is for us to severe diplomatic relations with them. It is as simple as that," he said.<br><br>Legal experts in Nigeria have said the trial process was not fair. But Peter Egon, an international relations expert in Lagos, says the conviction was carried out under Singapore's laws and cannot, therefore, be faulted. "Somebody, who leaves his country, goes to a foreign country, and he breaks the law there, and the law of the land says, once you carry drugs you are killed, so, the law has taken its course, in my opinion," he said.<br><br>The Nigerian was arrested at Singapore's Changi Airport in November 2004, carrying more than 700 grams of heroin.<br><br>Under Singapore's tough anti-drug laws, the death penalty is mandatory for anyone caught with more than 15 grams of the drug.<br><br>Another African, convicted of abetting in the offense, was also executed.<br><br>--<br><br><a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-01-27-voa21.cfm?rss=africa" rel="nofollow">http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-01-27-voa21.cfm?rss=africa</a></div>

If we were to abolish mandatory death penalty and commute him to life imprisonment, that might solve one problem.<br><br>The challenge is whether the relative degree of "softness" perceived by ourselves is actually even noticed by the international community.

            <div class='col-md body'>UN expert calls on Singapore not to hang Nigerian on drug charges, says breaches rights<br><br>1/25/2007 1:24:40 AM - (DPM)<br><br>An independent United Nations human rights expert today called on Singapore not to proceed with tomorrowÂ’s planned hanging of a Nigerian for heroin trafficking, charging that the island stateÂ’s Government has failed to ensure respect for relevant legal safeguards under international standards.<br><br>Â“It is a fundamental human right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty,Â” UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Philip Alston said in a statement, noting that the trial judge ruled that although there was no direct evidence that Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi knew the capsules contained heroin ignorance did not exculpate him.<br><br>Â“The standard accepted by the international community is that capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts,Â” Mr. Alston added. <strong>Â“Singapore cannot reverse the burden and require a defendant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didnÂ’t know that he was carrying drugs.Â”<br><br>The appeal court rejected the trial courtÂ’s suggestion that it was irrelevant whether Mr. Tochi had knowledge of what he was carrying but still upheld his conviction, reasoning that under Singapore law such knowledge is presumed until the defendant rebuts that presumption Â“on a balance of probabilitiesÂ” and not merely by raising reasonable doubt.</strong><br><br>Mr. Alston also said that Singapore law making the death penalty mandatory for drug trafficking was inconsistent with international human rights standards, because it keeps judges from considering all of the factors relevant to determining whether a death sentence would be permissible in a capital case.<br><br>Mr TochiÂ’s co-defendant, Okele Nelson Malachy of South Africa, was convicted of having abetted Mr. TochiÂ’s offence and was also sentenced to death. There has reportedly been no date set for his execution, but it would raise similar grave human rights issues, Mr. Alston stressed.<br><br>Â“One of the tasks given to me by the UN Human Rights Council is to monitor statesÂ’ respect for those safeguards in order to protect the human rights of those facing the death penalty,Â” he said. Â“In the case of Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi, the Government of Singapore has failed to ensure respect for the relevant legal safeguards. Under the circumstances, the execution should not proceed.Â”<br><br>Special Rapporteurs are unpaid, independent experts who report to the Council.<br><br><a href="http://www.dpm.ae/doc_cont.asp?id=108959" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpm.ae/doc_cont.asp?id=108959</a><br><br>--<br><br>IMHO, this is one aspect of our legal system that needs to be changed.
