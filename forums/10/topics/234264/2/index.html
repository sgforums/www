            <div class='col-md body'>I do not like the death penalty, but it is a necessary evil given how much damage drugs have taken. But as someone raised this certiainly needs to be looked into:<br><br><blockquote>Â“Singapore cannot reverse the burden and require a defendant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didnÂ’t know that he was carrying drugs.Â”<br><br>The appeal court rejected the trial courtÂ’s suggestion that it was irrelevant whether Mr. Tochi had knowledge of what he was carrying but still upheld his conviction, reasoning that under Singapore law such knowledge is <strong>presumed</strong> until the defendant rebuts that <strong>presumption</strong> Â“on a balance of probabilitiesÂ” and not merely by raising reasonable doubt. </blockquote>I mean we are dealing with life and death here, making presumptions "just to be safe" and hang people on it.<br><br>One method of smuggling involves using an unsuspecting person to act as the drug mule, typically by slipping some drugs into his luggage and have him carry it risk free (to the real smugglers at least) across customs before picking it up again from him. Such smugglers rely on careless or trusting people to pull this off.<br><br>Hanging a person who has no knowledge of if we was really smuggling drugs does little to stop the drug trade... at most the loss to the real traffackers is in the drugs that were discovered. At worst we are hanging a person for being careless or trusting.<br><br>The law needs to be tough on drugs, but at the same time the law must also be applied fairly and squarely. Have we sent some people to the gallows who were unwitting victims of the drug trade? Made a double victim by our legal system? Surely more can be done to protect these people.</div>

[b]Â“Singapore cannot reverse the burden and require a defendant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didnÂ’t know that he was carrying drugs.Â”<br><br>The appeal court rejected the trial courtÂ’s suggestion that it was irrelevant whether Mr. Tochi had knowledge of what he was carrying but still upheld his conviction, reasoning that under Singapore law such knowledge is presumed until the defendant rebuts that presumption Â“on a balance of probabilitiesÂ” and not merely by raising reasonable doubt.</strong><br><br>Mr. Alston also said that Singapore law making the death penalty mandatory for drug trafficking was inconsistent with international human rights standards, because it keeps judges from considering all of the factors relevant to determining whether a death sentence would be permissible in a capital case.<br><br>Mr TochiÂ’s co-defendant, Okele Nelson Malachy of South Africa, was convicted of having abetted Mr. TochiÂ’s offence and was also sentenced to death. There has reportedly been no date set for his execution, but it would raise similar grave human rights issues, Mr. Alston stressed.<br><br>Â“One of the tasks given to me by the UN Human Rights Council is to monitor statesÂ’ respect for those safeguards in order to protect the human rights of those facing the death penalty,Â” he said. Â“In the case of Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi, the Government of Singapore has failed to ensure respect for the relevant legal safeguards. Under the circumstances, the execution should not proceed.Â”<br><br>Special Rapporteurs are unpaid, independent experts who report to the Council.<br><br><a href="http://www.dpm.ae/doc_cont.asp?id=108959" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpm.ae/doc_cont.asp?id=108959</a><br><br>--<br><br>IMHO, this is one aspect of our legal system that needs to be changed.

I'm sure you will see things quite differently in an instant. The law is supposed to protect the innocent, and in this case we are not so sure if it really does so. Hanging the innocent does little to stop the real drug dealers and runners from plying their trade. We are the ones to lose the most from such a thing.<br><br>If a dude was caught with drugs taped to his body and stuff... it's kinda hard to deny knowledge rite?<br><br>However for drugs found in a person's luggage, there are still ways to check. It is possible to run background checks on that guy, find out his contacts, and see if he really has anything to do with it or was simply an innocent and unknowing drug mule. At the end of the day reasonable doubt must be proven beyond... as opposed to this "balance of probabilities" which is as good as saying "we're not totally sure but let's just hang him to be sure".<br><br>Also even if he is really guilty and gets free because he managed to raise reasonable doubt, he's pretty much a dead man walking as he would have to find a way to pay off the drugs that he lost when he got caught. The drug mafia does not look too kindly on people who lose their goods and don't pay. Chances are either he will do more runs to pay off his debt (hence making it possible of him to get caught again), or simply be made to do many other things that will invariably end him up on the wrong side of the law.</div>
