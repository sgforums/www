I do not like the biased laws that they have in some of the middle east countries and even though i'm not living there, i still don't think it is right, i also don't agree with other atrocities like female genital mutilation, that's my own principles. But i really doubt that people would just keep quiet when their own kind gets death sentencing in other countries. Just because a country has got harsh laws doesn't mean that we should stop using our brains and go into 'sheep' mode.</div>

Where do you think laws come from in the first place? anyway, i just gave a very simple scenario, there are many things that can happen to a foreigner in saudi which can get him/her jailed. Something like, getting involved in a road accident, even though you are not the one driving, they can put you in jail while they are investigating, all because you are a foreigner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This should send a clear message to Nigeria and the rest of the world not to fcuk around with the law in Singapore. Singapore should remain steadfast in maintaining its strict laws and not cow to other countries like how Michael Fay from USA was caned. Being strict and impartial also earns the respect of the rest of the world..... so we definitely win more than we lose.
