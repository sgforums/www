            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2.4km run in IPPT for soldiers to stay: Mindef  </strong><br><br>THE 2.4km run that combat-fit soldiers do as part of their annual test looks set to stay as a measure of a person's fitness level.<br><br>The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said on Thursday that the items in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) fitness test are likely to stay unchanged.<br><br>In response to a query from The Straits Times after a reader called for modified running distances, Mindef Spokesperson Colonel Darius Lim, the ministry's Director Public Affairs, explained how standards for the Individual Physical Fitness Test (IPPT) were set.<br><br>The IPPT has five test stations. These are: sit-ups, chin-ups, shuttle run, standing broad jump and the timed 2.4km run.<br><br>According to Col Lim, benchmarks for the Napfa Test, which students also take, were derived from studies conducted by the Singapore Sports Council.<br><br>'The 2.4 km run is a test of cardiovascular fitness and endurance,'' he said.<br><br>Straits Times reader, Rick Lim Say Kiong, has suggested in a Forum Page letter published on Jan 7 that the IPPT running distance be extended to 4 or 5km, with a time limit of 30 to 40 minutes.<br><br>Doing so would focus 'more on the endurance and general fitness than speed'.<br><br>'This should put less strain on the heart and body, while giving the runners some time to warm up and ready their bodies for the run in a less gruelling manner,' Mr Lim said.<br><br>The reader claimed fitness experts recommended that people should engage in a cardiovascular exercise -- any actvity that exercises the heart, lungs and blood circulatory system -- continuously for at least 20 minutes in order to maximise its benefits.<br><br>His letter was triggered by the death of a 41-year-old SAF officer last week after a 1.2km self-paced run.<br><br>Col Lim said all servicemen above the age of 35 must go through a medical checkup, done by the SAF, to assess their physical fitness before they attempt the fitness test.<br><br>He said:'The IPPT is an annual fitness test that every SAF serviceman has to undertake . Servicemen are expected to maintain a basic level of physical fitness as operationally ready soldiers.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think instead of looking at physical training, the Army bigwigs should start looking at soldiers' diet first. Cookhouse food is pretty unpalatable, and I suspect, not as healthy as it should be. There is also the issue of soldiers preferring canteen food to cookhouse food, which exacerbates the poor diet problem further.</div>

Quite likely that they are not doing so, yet still collapse<br><br>2) Play safe and stop when cannot stop, it is obvious. However, there's a reason for using progressive training. You should not wait till a test comes before testing your limit.<br><br>Lastly, how are your consistent trainings like? Which trainings helped you increase your VO2 max and strengthen your heart? FYI, it is a scientific fact that most people actually breathe mainly through 1 nostril, with the other nostril taking less air. In addition, during cardio, you could breathe through your mouth too. Finally, if you really had a serious problem, you could always get the MO to downgrade.</div>
