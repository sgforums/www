            <div class='col-md body'>What to do? We're living in Singapore and people are voting for PAP. Since protest and strike are against the law and the government won't listen to opinions from the people before passing a new rule, everything we do to try to resist seems futile. They have the final say in everything. Our future seems gloomy and people are getting more pessimistic...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So you mean that protests should be allowed? Do you really want to see what we're seeing now in HK? I hope not. Co-operation between the government and the people has always worked well for Singapore and will continue to do so as long as responsible and capable people are leading the country. Staging protests will only harm the image of the country and jeopardise the ability of the government to make decisions which are not welcome by the people but vital in the long-term.

"<br><br>Absolutely true! Imagine, if our leaders let us decide totally on what we want, we most probably will let short-sighted decisions get the better of us. And even if we get to 'see the light', by that time, after all the bickering and what-have-you, we would already be too late. Singapore survives by being nimble. We survive by looking for oppurtunities before others can identify them, and capitalising on them before others can. We could do this in the past due to our capable and visionary leaders (sounds propogandic, but I dont believe many will disagree with this), and our unyielding support for them. I feel that with China being a threat to our economic well-being, its imperative that we should continue our support them.<br>I personally feel that a strong opposition is unwarranted. As long as the Govt is capable and responsible, there should be no need for a strong opposition. In my view, they are more a lialibility than an asset. Why? because they slow things down. Look at the American system. Because of their almost equal balance of power, there is a lot of debates, and even a small bill takes a zillion years to get  passed. "Pork" is rampant in their politics, and as a result, the whole system, at best, gets slowed down, at worst, it becomes corrupt.<br><br>Two many cooks spoil the broth.<br></div>
