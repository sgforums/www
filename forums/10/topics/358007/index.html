              <div class="header hdrArticleL">
              <div class="introText">Nations
              that use torture disgrace themselves. Armed forces and police that
              torture inevitably become brutalized and corrupted. `Limited’ use of
              torture quickly becomes generalized. `Information’ obtained by torture
              is mostly unreliable.</div>
              <div>I learned these
              truths over fifty years  covering dirty `pacification’ wars, from
              Algeria to Indochina, Central and South America, southern Africa, the
              Mideast, Afghanistan, and Kashmir in which torture was commonly
              used.     </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In spite of all the  historical evidence that torture is
              counter-productive, the Bush administration encouraged torture of
              anti-American militants (aka `terrorists’) after the 9/11 attacks.  
              The full story has not yet been revealed, but what we know so far is
              revolting and shameful.  Britain and Canada were also complicit as they
              used information derived from torture and handed suspects over to be
              tortured.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Many Americans and human rights groups are now demanding that the
              Bush administration officials who employed and sanctioned torture face
              justice.  President Barack Obama hinted his new attorney general, Eric
              Holder,  might investigate this whole ugly business.  But the Obama
              White House clearly wants to dodge this issue.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Republicans, who have become America’s champion of war and
              torture, are fiercely resisting any investigation,  and lauding
              torture’s benefits.  Just when it seemed impossible for the dumbed-down
              Republican redneck party to sink any lower, it has by endorsing torture
              as the American way. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>So, too, some senior intelligence and Pentagon officials
              including, dismayingly,  Obama’s new CIA chief, Leon Panetta.  He
              should know better. Many senior Congressional Democrats who sanctioned
              torture, or did nothing to stop it, are equally reluctant that the
              torture scandal be further investigated.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Torture is a crime under US law.  It is a crime under the Third
              Geneva Convention, and the UN’s Anti-Torture Convention, both of which
              the US signed.  Kidnapping and moving suspects to be tortured in third
              countries is a crime. Torture violates core American values. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In 1945, the US hanged Japanese officers for inflicting
              `water-boarding’ ( near-drowning) on US prisoners, which were deemed
              war crimes. Yet this is exactly what the CIA inflicted on its Muslim
              captives.  FBI agents rightly refused to participate in the torture of
              al-Qaida suspects, warning that it violated US law and could make them
              subject to future prosecution.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Republicans and even Obama’s intelligence chief, Adm. Dennis
              Blair, claim some useful information was obtained by torture.  That
              depends on what you call useful.  Al-Qaida is still in business. Osama
              bin Laden remains at large.  Iraq and Afghanistan  became monstrous 
              fiascos costing $1 trillion.   US military and intelligence personnel
              who fall into hostile hands may now face similar tortures. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In 2004, CIA’s inspector general reported there was <em>no proof</em> that use of torture had thwarted `specific imminent attacks.’  This comes from a recently declassified Justice Department memo.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The director of the FBI, Robert Muller, one of Washington’s most
              upright, respected officials, also declared that torture had not
              prevented any attacks against the United States.  Both findings
              directly contradict claims by America’s own Torquemada, Dick Cheney,
              that torture prevented major attacks.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Torture did not protect America from a second major attack, as
              Republicans claim.  In fact, it appears 9/11 was a one-off event, and
              al-Qaida numbered only a handful of extremists to begin with, not the
              worldwide conspiracy claimed by the White House after it was caught
              sleeping on guard duty.  Bush administration claims about imminent
              threats from dirty bombs and germ weapons such as anthrax were untrue.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>CIA `useful’ torture information came from two suspects: Khalid
              Sheik Mohammed was tortured by near drowning 183 times -  six times <em>daily</em> for a month; and Abu Zubaydah, 83 times in August, 2003. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Use a power drill (a favorite `investigative’ tool of America’s
              Iraqi Shia allies) on Dick Cheney, and it would take only minutes to
              get him to admit he’s Osama bin Laden. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A shocking US Senate report just revealed that after the Bush
              administration could not find the links it claimed existed between
              al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein,  it tried, in best Soviet style,  to
              torture its captives to admit that such links did, in fact, exist. 
               That, of course, would have been a much better excuse for invading
              Iraq than the lies about weapons of mass destruction pointed at
              America. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Senate also reported CIA and Pentagon torture techniques were
               adopted from torture methods North Korea used in the 1950’s to compel
              American prisoners to confess to lies about germ warfare.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In fact, North Korea  learned its torture techniques from  Soviet
              KGB instructors.  KGB’s favorite tortures in the 1930’s and 40’s were
              merciless beatings, confinement in refrigerated cells, week-long sleep
              deprivation, and endless interrogations.  I have seen the torture cells
              at KGB’s Lubiyanka HQ in Moscow.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The CIA and US military copied these North Korean/Soviet torture
              methods, but also added contorted positions, and nakedness and
              humiliation, techniques  learned from Israeli interrogators who used
              them to blackmail Palestinian prisoners into becoming informers.  Hence
              all the naked photos from Abu Ghraib prison.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>American doctors and medical personnel supervised torture and
              devised and supervised techniques to mentally incapacitate prisoners
              through isolation, terrifying sensory deprivation, and injections of
              potent psychotropic drugs.      </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Torture was authorized by President George W. Bush, VP Dick
              Cheney, Secretaries Don Rumsfeld and Condoleeza Rice, and carried out
              by CIA chief George Tenet and the Pentagon’s secretive Special
              Operations Command.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Four lickspittle lawyers and two bootlicking attorney generals
              provided sophistic legal briefs sanctioning torture.  All should be
              disbarred and face an independent judicial commission.  Not a
              whitewash, like the 9/11 Commission, but a real, independent legal
              body. Better, send the case to the UN International Court in the
              Hague.       </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>President Obama actually told CIA personnel that he does not want
              to prosecute the torturers  because they were only following proper
              legal advice and orders.  So did Nazi officials who killed millions. 
                 </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Nazi lawyers legally dismembered Germany’s Weimar democracy and
              imposed Nazi dictatorship in only two months after the `terrorist
              attack’ on the Reichstag in Feb. 1933.   Imposition of Hitler’s
              dictatorship followed proper legal channels. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When I served in the US Army, I was taught that any illegal order,
              even from the president, must be refused and that mistreating prisoners
              was a crime. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>President Obama must show the world that America upholds the law,
              rejects torture of all kinds, and that no officials are above the
              law.   Otherwise, there is no other way to prevent the recurrence of
              torture in the future.  </div>

              Singapore is no exception in the use of torture. Psychological torture is deemed as torture by the UN too.

              <div> </div>
              <div>Torture is a crime under US law.  It is a crime under the
              Third Geneva Convention, and the UN’s Anti-Torture Convention, both
              of which the US signed.  Kidnapping and moving suspects to be
              tortured in third countries is a crime. Torture violates core
              American values. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In 1945, the US hanged Japanese officers for inflicting
              `water-boarding’ ( near-drowning) on US prisoners, which were
              deemed war crimes. Yet this is exactly what the CIA inflicted on
              its Muslim captives.  FBI agents rightly refused to
              participate in the torture of al-Qaida suspects, warning that it
              violated US law and could make them subject to future
              prosecution.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Republicans and even Obama’s intelligence chief, Adm. Dennis
              Blair, claim some useful information was obtained by torture. 
              That depends on what you call useful.  Al-Qaida is still in
              business. Osama bin Laden remains at large.  Iraq and
              Afghanistan  became monstrous  fiascos costing $1
              trillion.   US military and intelligence personnel who
              fall into hostile hands may now face similar tortures. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In 2004, CIA’s inspector general reported there was <em>no
              proof</em> that use of torture had thwarted `specific imminent
              attacks.’  This comes from a recently declassified Justice
              Department memo.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The director of the FBI, Robert Muller, one of Washington’s
              most upright, respected officials, also declared that torture had
              not prevented any attacks against the United States.  Both
              findings directly contradict claims by America’s own Torquemada,
              Dick Cheney, that torture prevented major
              attacks.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Torture did not protect America from a second major attack, as
              Republicans claim.  In fact, it appears 9/11 was a one-off
              event, and al-Qaida numbered only a handful of extremists to begin
              with, not the worldwide conspiracy claimed by the White House after
              it was caught sleeping on guard duty.  Bush administration
              claims about imminent threats from dirty bombs and germ weapons
              such as anthrax were untrue.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>CIA `useful’ torture information came from two suspects:
              Khalid Sheik Mohammed was tortured by near drowning 183 times
              -  six times <em>daily</em> for a month; and Abu Zubaydah, 83
              times in August, 2003. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Use a power drill (a favorite `investigative’ tool of
              America’s Iraqi Shia allies) on Dick Cheney, and it would take only
              minutes to get him to admit he’s Osama bin Laden. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A shocking US Senate report just revealed that after the Bush
              administration could not find the links it claimed existed between
              al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein,  it tried, in best Soviet style,
               to torture its captives to admit that such links did, in
              fact, exist.   That, of course, would have been a much
              better excuse for invading Iraq than the lies about weapons of mass
              destruction pointed at America. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Senate also reported CIA and Pentagon torture techniques
              were  adopted from torture methods North Korea used in the
              1950’s to compel American prisoners to confess to lies about germ
              warfare.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In fact, North Korea  learned its torture techniques
              from  Soviet KGB instructors.  KGB’s favorite tortures in
              the 1930’s and 40’s were merciless beatings, confinement in
              refrigerated cells, week-long sleep deprivation, and endless
              interrogations.  I have seen the torture cells at KGB’s
              Lubiyanka HQ in Moscow.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The CIA and US military copied these North Korean/Soviet
              torture methods, but also added contorted positions, and nakedness
              and humiliation, techniques  learned from Israeli
              interrogators who used them to blackmail Palestinian prisoners into
              becoming informers.  Hence all the naked photos from Abu
              Ghraib prison.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>American doctors and medical personnel supervised torture and
              devised and supervised techniques to mentally incapacitate
              prisoners through isolation, terrifying sensory deprivation, and
              injections of potent psychotropic drugs.   
                </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Torture was authorized by President George W. Bush, VP Dick
              Cheney, Secretaries Don Rumsfeld and Condoleeza Rice, and carried
              out by CIA chief George Tenet and the Pentagon’s secretive Special
              Operations Command.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Four lickspittle lawyers and two bootlicking attorney generals
              provided sophistic legal briefs sanctioning torture.  All
              should be disbarred and face an independent judicial
              commission.  Not a whitewash, like the 9/11 Commission, but a
              real, independent legal body. Better, send the case to the UN
              International Court in the Hague. 
                   </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>President Obama actually told CIA personnel that he does not
              want to prosecute the torturers  because they were only
              following proper legal advice and orders.  So did Nazi
              officials who killed millions.     </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Nazi lawyers legally dismembered Germany’s Weimar democracy
              and imposed Nazi dictatorship in only two months after the
              `terrorist attack’ on the Reichstag in Feb. 1933.  
              Imposition of Hitler’s dictatorship followed proper legal
              channels. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When I served in the US Army, I was taught that any illegal
              order, even from the president, must be refused and that
              mistreating prisoners was a crime. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>President Obama must show the world that America upholds the
              law, rejects torture of all kinds, and that no officials are above
              the law.   Otherwise, there is no other way to prevent
              the recurrence of torture in the future.  </div>

              <p>Frankly, nothing beat the American when it comes to human rights violation. The torture at Guantanamo is just the tip of the icerberg. American has fought more wars than any other country in the history of mankind. And a sigificant number of these wars have nothing to do with national security or about protecting American interests.  They are arming insurgents and fighting wars around the world to effect regime change and to push their ideology of democracy (eg, Vietnam war, Iraq war, Bay of Pig invasion, etc).</p>
              <p>The result is thousands and thousands of innocent civillians killed for the sake of "freedom" -  as defined by American politicians.  Even today, there are civilians killed on a daily basis in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. It is about time that the American president be prosecuted for war crimes and for crimes against humanity.</p>

              <p>Frankly, nothing beat the American when it comes to human rights
              violation. The torture at Guantanamo is just the tip of the
              icerberg. American has fought more wars than any other country in
              the history of mankind. And a sigificant number of these wars have
              nothing to do with national security or about protecting American
              interests.  They are arming insurgents and fighting wars
              around the world to effect regime change and to push their ideology
              of democracy (eg, Vietnam war, Iraq war, Bay of Pig invasion,
              etc).</p>
              <p>The result is thousands and thousands of innocent civillians
              killed for the sake of "freedom" -  as defined by American
              politicians.  Even today, there are civilians killed on a
              daily basis in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. It is about time
              that the American president be prosecuted for war crimes and for
              crimes against humanity.</p>

              <p>Wao you caught me offguard i'm not sure how human rights applies to war, I think in war different rules are at play (maybe humanitarian laws?) i was refering to human rights in peace times. </p>
              <p>But even if what u said is true and america is a big monster it still doesnt contradict what i said about Singapore being equally criminal</p>

              <p>Just a correction of that point. If you're considering the history of mankind, Genghis Khan alone fought more wars than all of America ever did. Dont forget Rome, Carthage, Athens, Sparta, Venice, England, France, Prussia, Persia, Russia, China, Spain, India, the Aztecs, Greece, Macedonia</p>

              <p>Well, you could be right. I found that information in an internet article that I read previously. The article could be inaccurate. Anyway, thanks for enlightening.</p>
