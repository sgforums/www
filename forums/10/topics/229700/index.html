            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.crusade-media.com/news40.html<br><br>Source:  http://www.albasrah.net/ar_articles_2006/1206/sadam_261206.htm<br><br>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate:<br><br>'Say: Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector: and in Allah let the Believers put their trust'<br><br>Oh, great people of Iraq. Oh, courageous men of our unrelenting armed forces. Oh, glorious Iraqi women. Oh, sons of our glorious nation, the courageous believers in the brave resistance.<br><br>In the past, I was, as you all know, in the battlefield of jihad and struggle. God, exalted be He, wished that I face the same again in the same manner and the same spirit in which we were before the revolution but with a problem that is greater and harsher.<br><br>Oh beloved, this harsh situation, which we and our great Iraq are facing, is a new lesson and a new trial for the people by which to be judged, each depending on their intention, so that it becomes an identifier before God and the people in the present and after our current situation becomes a glorious history. It is, above all, the foundation upon which the success of the future phases of history can be built. In this situation and in no other, the veritable are the honest and faithful and the opposing are the false. When the insignificant people use the power given to them by the foreigners to oppress their own people, they are but worthless and lowly. In our country only good must result from what we are experiencing:<br><br>'The scum disappears like froth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth'<br><br>God is all knowing.<br><br>Oh great nation. Oh people of our nation and of mankind. Many of you have known the owner of this letter for his truthfulness, his honesty, his purity, and his genuine concern over his people,  for his wisdom, his vision, his justice, and for his firmness in dealing with issues and for his watchfulness over the properties of the people and of the country, and for living according to his conscience and his mind. His heart aches for the poor and he does not rest until he helps in improving their condition and attends to their needs. His heart contains all his people and his nation, and he craves to be honest and faithful without differentiating between his people except on the basis of their efforts, efficiency, and patriotism.<br><br>Here I am speaking today in your name and for your eyes and the eyes of our nation and the eyes of the just, the people of the truth, wherever their banner is hoisted.<br><br>Oh Iraqi people, oh our people and our folks and the folks of every honest and glorious man and woman in our country. You have known your brother and leader as well as his own family knew him. He never stooped to the cruel oppressors. He remained a sword and an authority on what is loved by the honest and abhorred by the oppressors.<br><br>Is this not the position which you would like your brother, your son, and your leader to take? Yes, this is how Saddam Hussein was described, and this is how his positions will be. If his positions did not, God forbid, correspond with his description, then he would despise himself. These are the stands which anyone who leads you and leads the nation must take, after God the Almighty and the all capable.<br><br>Here I am offering my soul as a sacrifice. If the Merciful wants it, he will raise it up whenever He commands it to be with the companions and the martyrs, and if He sees that He wants to postpone His decision, He will, because He is the Merciful and the Compassionate. He is the One who created us, and to Him we return.  'Patience is most fitting.'  It is God whose help can be sought against the unjust.<br><br>Oh brothers, oh great nation. I call upon you to preserve the convictions which made you worthy of the faith that you have and to be the guiding light for civilization. Make your land, the birthplace of the father of the prophets, Abraham of Al-Khalil, and other prophets, and to preserve the values which officially and justifiably gave you the title of greatness for the sake of your country and your people. He offered all his life and the life of his family, young and old from the very beginning to this great nation and its faithful and honorable people and never gave up. In spite of all the difficulties and the storms which we and Iraq had to face, before and after the revolution, God the Almighty did not want death for Saddam Hussein. But if He wants it this time, it is His creation. He created it and He protected it until now. Thus, by its martyrdom, He will be bringing glory to a faithful soul, for there were souls that were younger than Saddam Hussein that had departed and had taken this path before him. If He wants it martyred, we thank Him and offer Him gratitude, before and after. 'Patience is most fitting.' It is God whose help can be sought against the unjust.<br><br>In the shadow of the greatness of the Creator, may He be exalted, and His protection, you must remember that God has bestowed on you different types of characteristics that make you a good example to be followed in love, pardon, forgiveness, and coexistence. The great make up of capabilities and resources which the Merciful had made available to you, was not meant to go to waste. He wanted it to be a test that would refine the souls. Hence there were some who joined your lines and others who joined the North Atlantic Treaty. Others were the Persians who are hateful as a result of their rulers' actions who had inherited Kisra's inheritance in place of Satan. He tempted those who obeyed him to turn against their own people or against their neighbors or tempted the Zionist aspirations and hatefulness to move their representative in the American White House to carry out the aggression and to create animosity that has nothing to do with humanity and faith. On the basis of faith, love, and peace, which bring glory and not bitterness to the glorified, you built the edifice and raised it without any fight or spite, and on this basis you were enjoying glory and peace in your beautiful colors, under the country's flag, not in the distant past, especially after your distinguished revolution, your 17th revolution, on 30 July 1968. You realized victory and you carried it in the color of the one great Iraq as loving brothers in the battle trenches or in the construction fields. The enemies of your country, the invaders and the Persians, found that your unity stands as a barrier between them and your enslavement. They planted and grounded their hateful old and new wedge between you. The strangers who are carrying the Iraqi citizenship, whose hearts are empty or filled with the hatred that was planted in them by Iran, responded to it, but how wrong they were to think that they could divide the noble among our people, weaken your determination, and fill the hearts of the sons of the nation with hatred against each other, instead of against their true enemies that will lead them in one direction to fight under the banner of God is great: The great flag of the people and the nation.<br><br>Oh brothers! Oh mujahideen and fighters! For this I call on you now and I call on you not to hate because hate does not leave space for a person to be fair. It blinds you and closes all doors of thinking. Hate prevents you from thinking straight and from making the right choices and avoiding the wrong. It blocks your vision and prevents you from seeing the variables in the mind of those who were thought of as enemies, including those people who had gone astray but have changed their direction and have taken the right path, the path of the noble people and the glorious nation.<br><br>I also call on you, brothers and sisters, my children and the children of Iraq. I call on you, oh comrades of jihad; I call on you not to hate the people of the other countries that attacked us. You should distinguish between the decision-makers and the people. Just hate the action. Even those whose actions deserve to be fought--do not hate them as human beings. Also, the doers of evil, do not hate them, but hate the evil deed itself and fight the evil with what it deserves. Whoever changes to the better or does good inside or outside Iraq, give him clemency and open a new page for him because God forgives and loves whoever forgives out of willingness. Firmness is necessary if the situation calls for it. To be accepted by the people and the nation, one should base things on the law and must be fair and just. One should not be hostile on the basis of spitefulness and illegal pursuits.<br><br>You should know brothers, that among the aggressors, there are people who support your struggle against the invaders, and some of them volunteered for the legal defense of prisoners, including Saddam Hussein. Others revealed the scandals of the invaders and condemned them. Some even wept profusely and with noble sincerity when they said goodbye to us when they ended their duty. To this I call on you to be one loyal nation, kind to itself, to its nation, and to humanity, and sincere with others and with oneself.<br><br>Dear faithful people, I bid you farewell, but I will be with the merciful God who helps those who take refuge in him and who will never disappoint any honest believer.<br><br>God is great. God is great.<br><br>Long live our nation. Long live humanity in the light of security and peace, wherever it imparts justice and fairness.<br><br>Long live our great unyielding people. Long live Iraq. Long live Iraq. Long live Palestine.<br><br>Long live jihad and the mujahideen. Allah Akbar. And the wretched aggressors shall be repelled.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Saddam Hussein</span><br><br>The President of the Republic and the Chief Commander of the Combatant Armed Forces<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe his last days by New York Times is more interesting:<br><br>Saddam His Last Days<br>As US-Iraqis disagreed, Saddam still believed he might cheat hanging in the end because of crucial negotiations. NY Times.<br>Jan 7, 2007<br><br>By John F. Burns<br>Baghdad Â— When American soldiers woke Saddam Hussein in his cell near Baghdad airport at 3:55 a.m. last Saturday, they told him to dress for a journey to Baghdad. He had followed the routine dozens of times before, travelling by helicopter in the predawn darkness to the courtroom where he spent 14 months on trial for his life.<br><br>When his cell lights were dimmed on Friday night, Mr. Hussein may have hoped that he would live a few days longer, and perhaps cheat the hangman altogether.<br><br>According to Task Force 134, the American military unit responsible for all Iraqi detainees, Mr Hussein Â“had heard some of the rumors on the radio about potential execution dates.Â”<br><br>But never one to understate his own importance, he had told his lawyers for months that the Americans might spare him in the end, for negotiations to end the insurgency whose daily bombings rattled his cellblock windows.<br><br>As Mr. Hussein prepared to walk out into the chill of the desert winter, dressed in a tailored black overcoat, that last illusion was shattered.<br><br>After being roused and told that he was being transferred to Iraqi custody, a task force statement e-mailed to The New York Times a week later revealed, Â“he immediately indicated that he knew the execution would soon follow.Â”<br><br>Â“As he left the detention area, he thanked the guards and medics for the treatment he had received,Â” Lt Col Keir-Kevin Curry, spokesman for the task force, said.<br><br>Mr Hussein was then driven to a waiting Black Hawk helicopter for a 10-minute flight to the old Istikhbarat prison in northern Baghdad, where a party of Iraqi officials awaited him at the gallows.<br><br>Â“During this brief period of transfer, Saddam Hussein appeared more serious,Â” the task force said.<br><br>The time as the helicopter took off was 5:05 am, and Mr Hussein had 65 minutes to live. But as he flew over the darkened suburbs of a Baghdad enduring another winter with only flickering electrical power, he can have known little of the last-minute battle waged between top Iraqi and American officials Â— and among the Americans themselves Â— over whether the execution, fraught with legal ambiguities and Islamic religious sensitivities, should go ahead.<br><br>American opposition to executing him in haste centered partly on the fact that the Id al-Adha religious holiday, marking the end of the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, began for Sunnis at sunrise on Saturday.<br><br>In Baghdad that day, the sun was to rise at 7:06 am Iraqi government officials had promised the hanging would be over before the dawn light began seeping through the palm trees that shade the capitalÂ’s streets.<br><br>The taunts Mr Hussein endured from Shiite guards as he stood with the noose around his neck have made headlines around the world, and stirred angry protests among his fellow Iraqi Sunnis.<br><br>But the story of how American commanders and diplomats fought to halt the execution until midnight on Friday, only six hours before Mr Hussein was hanged, is only now coming into focus, as Iraqi and American officials, in the glare of international outrage over the hanging, compete with their versions of what happened.<br><br>Tensions boil over<br><br>It is a story of the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, trying to coerce second-tier American military and diplomatic officials into handing Mr Hussein over, first on Thursday night, then again on Friday.<br><br>The American pushback was complicated by the absences of Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and the top American military commander, Gen George W. Casey Jr., who were both out of Iraq on leave. The American message, throughout, was that rushing Mr. Hussein to the gallows could rebound disastrously, as it did.<br><br>It is a story, too, of the Americans disagreeing among themselves. After a final call to Mr Maliki at 10:30 pm Friday, American and Iraqi officials said, Mr Khalilzad concluded that there was no prospect of persuading the Iraqis to delay the execution and passed that message to Washington.<br><br>It was not a conclusion that found much favour with the military, who were the ones who had to transport Mr Hussein to the gallows.<br><br>For General Casey and Mr. Khalilzad, close partners here, the messy ending for Mr Hussein was made worse by the confirmation this week that Mr. Bush will soon replace both men as he refashions his Iraq war policy.<br><br>There were disputes, as well, among the Iraqis. At least one senior judge from the tribunal that sentenced Mr Hussein to die, and three American lawyers who worked closely with the Iraqis at his trials, fought their own rearguard battle, telling fellow Iraqis how surprised they were that he received the death sentence in the narrow case that produced it Â— the Â“systematic persecutionÂ” of a small Shiite town north of Baghdad, Dujail, after an alleged assassination attempt against Mr. Hussein there in 1982.<br><br>In interviews with dozens of American and Iraqi officials involved in the hanging, a picture has emerged of a clash of cultures and political interests, reflecting the widening gulf between Americans here and the Iraqi exiles who rode to power behind American tanks.<br><br>Even before a smuggled cellphone camera recording revealed the derision Mr Hussein faced on the gallows, the hanging had become a metaphor, among Mr MalikiÂ’s critics, for how the Â“new IraqÂ” is starting to resemble, albeit in paler shade, the repressive, vengeful place it was under Mr. Hussein.<br><br>The hanging spread wide dismay among the Americans. Aides said American commanders were deeply upset by the way they were forced to hand Mr Hussein over, a sequence commanders saw as motivated less by a concern for justice than for revenge.<br><br>In the days following the hanging, recriminations flowed between the military command and the United States Embassy, accused by some officers of abandoning American interests at midnight Friday in favor of placating Mr. Maliki and hard-line Shiites.<br><br>But for Mr MalikiÂ’s inner circle, the hanging was a moment to avenge decades of brutal repression by Mr Hussein, as well as a moment to drive home to IraqÂ’s five million Sunnis that after centuries of subjugation, Shiites are in power to stay.<br><br>At the Â“White House,Â” as his officials now describe Mr MalikiÂ’s headquarters in the Green Zone, a celebratory dinner began on Friday night even before the Americans withdrew their threat not to hand over Mr Hussein.<br><br>An Iraqi who attended the hanging said the government saw the Americans as wasting time with their demands for a delay until after the four-day Id al-Adha holiday, and for whatever time beyond that required to obtain the legal authorizations necessary to meet the AmericansÂ’ stipulations.<br><br>For the Americans to claim the moral high ground afterward by disavowing the hanging, the Iraqi said, was disingenuous.<br><br>Â“They cannot wash their hands, this is a joint responsibility,Â” he said. Â“They had the physical custody and we had the legal custody. At one point, I asked, Â‘Is it our call or is it your call?Â’ They said, Â‘ItÂ’s your call.Â’ I said, Â‘If itÂ’s our call, weÂ’ve made the decision.Â’ Â”<br><br>In a speech on Saturday, a week after the hanging, Mr Maliki showed that he remains as angry as the Americans.<br><br>Hitting out at governments and human rights organizations around the world that have condemned the hanging, he said they were hypocritical.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re wondering where these organisations were during the crimes of Anfal and Halabja,Â” he said, referring to Mr. HusseinÂ’s persecution of Iraqi Kurds.<br><br>Â“Where were they during the mass graves and the executions and the massacres that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis?Â”<br><br>Differing timelines<br><br>The countdown to the hanging began eight weeks earlier, on Nov 5, as Raouf Abdel-Rahman, the chief judge in the Dujail case, passed death sentences on Mr Hussein and two associates, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Mr HusseinÂ’s half-brother, and Awad al-Bandar, chief judge of Mr HusseinÂ’s revolutionary court, for crimes against humanity in the hanging of 148 men and boys from the Shiite town.<br><br>Â“Go to hell, you and the court!Â” Mr. Hussein yelled, as bailiffs ushered him from the court.<br><br>The widespread expectation was that the appeal of the death sentences would run for months, allowing time for the more notorious Anfal case, involving genocide in the killing of 180,000 Kurds, to be completed before Mr Hussein was hanged.<br><br>American lawyers in the embassyÂ’s Regime Crimes Liaison Office, the behind-the-scenes organiser of the trials, predicted Mr. HusseinÂ’s execution in the spring.<br><br>When the tribunalÂ’s appeals bench announced that it had upheld the death sentences on Dec. 26, three weeks into the appeal, even prosecutors were stunned. Defense lawyers said Mr Hussein was being railroaded under pressure from Mr Maliki, who told a BBC interviewer shortly after the Dujail verdict that he expected the ousted ruler to be hanged before the end of the year.<br><br>The suspicion that the judges had submitted to government pressure was shared by some Americans working with the tribunal, who had stifled their growing disillusionment with the governmentÂ’s interference for months.<br><br>The appeals courtÂ’s apparent eagerness to fast-forward Mr Hussein to the gallows Â— and the scenes at the execution itself Â— broke the floodgates of restraint for at least one of the American lawyers. Â“I am disgusted,Â” said one.<br><br>Â“We had thought the court would be a beacon of light in a very dark landscape. But the way it has come out with the hanging, weÂ’ve substituted one dictatorship for another.Â”<br><br>On the Thursday before the hanging, American military officials were summoned. Both Mr Khalilzad and General Casey were on vacation, so the American team handling negotiations with Mr Maliki and his officials was headed by Maj Gen Jack Gardner, head of Task Force 134, the detainee unit, and Margaret Scobey, head of the embassyÂ’s political section.<br><br>Iraqi officials said neither carried much weight with Mr Maliki, who had learned through bruising confrontations to be wary of alienating Mr Khalilzad and General Casey, both of whom have direct access to President Bush.<br><br>At the Thursday afternoon meeting, tempers frayed. According to an Iraqi legal expert at the meeting, Iraqi officials demanded that the Americans hand over Mr Hussein that night, for an execution before dawn on Friday.<br><br>General Gardner responded with demands of his own, for letters affirming the legality of the execution from Mr. Maliki, President Jalal Talabani and the chief judge of the high tribunal that convicted Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi legal expert said.<br><br>The focus was on two issues: a constitutional requirement that IraqÂ’s three-man presidency council approve all executions, and a Hussein-era law forbidding executions during religious holidays.<br><br>Mr. Talabani, a death penalty opponent, refused to sign off on the hanging, but did sign a letter for Mr Maliki saying he had no objections if the government went ahead.<br><br>The Iraqis, bolstering their case, said that the Hussein tribunalÂ’s own statute, drafted by the Americans, placed its rulings beyond review.<br><br>They dismissed the holiday ban on executions, saying IraqÂ’s death penalty law had been suspended by the Americans in 2003 and that the new Iraqi Parliament, in reviving it in 2004, had not reinstituted the ban.<br><br>An Iraqi participant who opposed the hanging said that Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. MalikiÂ’s national security adviser, said angrily, Â“This is an Iraqi issue,Â” and added, Â“Who is going to execute him anyway, you or us?Â” When the Americans insisted they would not hand over Mr. Hussein without the letters, another Iraqi official exploded: Â“Just give him to us!Â”<br><br>By Thursday evening, pressures for a quick hanging were growing. Esam al-Gazawi, a Hussein lawyer, said by telephone from Jordan that his legal team had been denied a final visit to Camp Cropper, the American detention center, and that they had been told to send somebody to collect Mr. HusseinÂ’s personal belongings.<br><br>Around midnight on Thursday, the meeting broke up, and General Gardner contacted commanders at Camp Cropper.<br><br>By then, the American command had entered what it called its Â“X-hour sequence,Â” a 10-hour countdown to the execution that provided a timeline for everything the Americans needed to do to ensure Mr HusseinÂ’s Â“secure and dignifiedÂ” delivery to the execution site.<br><br>Negotiations resumed Friday morning. In Phoenix, ten time zones away, General Casey was monitoring the exchanges in signals traffic from Baghdad.<br><br>American military officials remained opposed to an immediate hanging, telling Mr Maliki that beyond the legal issues, there was a question of his governmentÂ’s need to gain international support by carrying out the hanging in a way that could withstand any criticism.<br><br>Â“We said, Â‘You have to do it by international law, you have to do it in accordance with international standards of decorum, you have to establish yourselves as a nation under law,Â’ Â” an American official recounted.<br><br>When Mr Maliki said the Americans should respect IraqÂ’s right to decide matters for itself, American officials said, one of the Americans said: Â“Forget about us. YouÂ’re in front of the international community here. People will be watching this.Â”<br><br>The arguments continued deep into the Iraqi night. General Gardner and Ms Scobey returned at one point to the former Republican Palace, the American headquarters in the Green Zone, seeking WashingtonÂ’s advice. Workarounds for the legal problems were discussed.<br><br>At 10:30 pm, Ambassador Khalilzad made a last-ditch call to Mr Maliki asking him not to proceed with the hanging.<br><br>When the Iraqi leader remained adamant, an American official said, the ambassador made a second call to Washington conveying Â“the determination of the Iraqi prime minister to go forward,Â” and his conclusion that there was nothing more, consistent with respect for Iraqi sovereignty, that the US could do.<br><br>Senior Bush administration officials in Washington said that said that Mr KhalilzadÂ’s principal contact in Washington was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and that she gave the green light for Mr Hussein to be turned over, despite the reservations of the military commanders in Baghdad.<br><br>One official said that Ms Rice was supported in that view by Stephen J. Hadley, Mr BushÂ’s national security adviser.<br><br>Â“It literally came down to the Iraqis interpreting their law, and our looking at their law and interpreting it differently,Â” the official said.<br><br>Â“Finally, it was decided we are not the court of last appeal for Iraqi law here. The president of their country says it meets their procedures. We are not going to be their legal nannies.Â”<br><br>Mr Khalilzad had suggested that the Iraqis get a written ruling approving the execution from Midhat al-Mahmoud, the chief judge of IraqÂ’s Supreme Judicial Council; Mr. Mahmoud refused.<br><br>Then, the Iraqis played their trump card: a call to high-ranking Shiite clerics in the holy city of Najaf, asking for approval from the marjaiya, the supreme authority in Iraqi Shiism. When his officials reported that they had it, Mr. Maliki signed a letter authorising the hanging. It was 11:45 pm.<br><br>The Americans suggested that foreign reporters be invited to the hanging, along with UN observers. American commanders feared the concern for procedure might be swept away by the urge for revenge.<br><br>Â“Anybody whoÂ’s been involved in a firefight will tell you thereÂ’s a moment when rage takes over,Â” one American official said.<br><br>The Iraqis dismissed the idea of outside observers, and assembled an execution party of 14 Shiite officials and a Sunni cleric invited to help Mr Hussein with his prayers.<br><br>The Â‘X-Hour SequenceÂ’<br><br>At Camp Cropper, the X-hour sequence was running for a second night. Helicopters were positioned. Special security measures went into effect along the flight path.<br><br>The Americans dispatched sniffer dogs along the route of Mr HusseinÂ’s final steps and into the execution chamber, the only time any American set foot there.<br><br>Before he left the camp, Mr Hussein bade farewell to American soldiers who guarded him during the latter stages of his 1,110 days in solitary confinement.<br><br>There, and again after the helicopter carrying him landed at 5:15 am at Camp Justice, the American military post in the Kadhimiya district of northern Baghdad that encloses the Istikhbarat prison, the former dictator went man to man, thanking each of the Americans for looking after him.<br><br>At 5:21 am, he was led into the prison, a forbidding, four-story concrete building that previously housed the headquarters of Mr HusseinÂ’s military intelligence agency, and now serves as a base for an Iraqi Army brigade.<br><br>The Americans took him to a holding room, and exchanged papers formalizing the handover with the prison governor.<br><br>Â“At that point, he was dignified,Â” Maj Gen William B. Caldwell IV, the American commandÂ’s chief spokesman, said at a briefing later.<br><br>Â“He said farewell to his interpreter. He thanked the military police squad, the lieutenant who was the squad leader, the medical doctor we had present, the American colonel who was on site.Â”<br><br>He added, with emphasis, Â“And then we had absolutely nothing to do with any of the procedures or any of control mechanisms or anything from that point forward.Â”<br><br>At 5:30 am, the Iraqis took over. An American official who watched the handover said Mr HusseinÂ’s demeanor Â“changed in the Iraqi prison when the Iraqi governor assumed control of him.Â” Mr Hussein had long since told his American captors that he trusted them, but not the Iraqis.<br><br>Â“He was still dignified, but he was scornful,Â” the American official said.<br><br>Mr Rubaie, the security adviser, said that when Mr Hussein stepped into the execution block, an ill-lighted concrete structure behind the main prison building that witnessed thousands of hangings under Mr Hussein, he seemed composed.<br><br>Â“He made some joking remarks,Â” he said. Â“He said to me, Â‘DonÂ’t be afraid,Â’ as if I was going to be hanged. I didnÂ’t reply, but one of the guards shouted, Â‘You did bad things to Iraq.Â’ And he said, Â‘I made this backward country into an advanced and prosperous nation.Â’Â”<br><br>After that, the story is taken up by the illicit cellphone video that has caused an uproar among Iraqi Sunnis and across the world, showing Mr Hussein erect on the gallows in his black overcoat and gray beard, staring ahead, and answering back, as the taunts flow from the Shiites gathered in front of the platform.<br><br>Mr Hussein, praying, got halfway through the most sacred of Muslim prayers. Â“There is no God but God, and Muhammad...Â”. The trapdoor clanged open. It was 6:10 am.<br><br>Securing the body<br><br>Before 7 am, helicopters ferried Iraqi officials back to the Green Zone, along with Mr HusseinÂ’s body.<br><br>For nearly 17 hours, Mr. Maliki and his officials remained locked in a dispute with Sunni officials and leaders of Mr HusseinÂ’s Albu Nasir tribe, with Mr MalikiÂ’s officials refusing to release the body, saying they wanted no shrine to him.<br><br>Throughout, the body, in a white shroud, remained inside the ambulance in the parking lot behind Mr. MalikiÂ’s office.<br><br>For the last time, the Americans intervened, flying a delegation from Mr HusseinÂ’s hometown of Tikrit to Baghdad, and returning them 110 miles north again after Mr Maliki, at close to midnight, agreed to let the body go.<br><br>It was transferred to a pine coffin, loaded onto the open back of a police pickup, and driven back to Landing Zone Washington, the Green Zone helipad.<br><br>Upset by events in the execution chamber, and concerned at attracting any fresh anger from Iraqi Sunnis, the Americans ordered their troops not to touch Mr HusseinÂ’s body after the execution, even as it was loaded and unloaded from their helicopters.<br><br>This left Iraqi officials to unload the stretcher carrying the body when the execution party returned to the Green Zone from the prison. Mr Rubaie, the security adviser, said he helped carry the stretcher bearing the corpse from the helicopter to a waiting ambulance.<br><br>Â“We werenÂ’t walking, we were joggingÂ” to the ambulance, he said. Â“This was a chapter we wanted to get done and finished with. We just wanted it to be over.Â”<br><br>This article was reported by John F.
