              <p>Posted by admin on 
              				September 23, 2008</p>
              <h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">EDITOR’S
              NOTE: On 20 Sept 2008, Lianhe Zaobao ran an article entitled “çª¥æŽ¢ç½‘ç»œä¸–ç•Œ”,
              or “Exploring the Blogosphere”. It was written by æ¸¸æ¶¦æ�¬ (Ms You Lun
              Tian). This is an English translation of the article which my friend
              did. This translation, as well as the original Chinese article, are
              also found at <a href="http://wayangparty.wordpress.com/">Wayangparty.wordpress.com</a>.</span></h3>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr Brown
              (Blogger Lee Kin Mun)’s hilarious “Bak Chor Mee” blog post shot to fame
              two years ago just before the General Elections. This incident made
              Chinese paper readers who usually do not surf the internet start to
              notice the presence of new media.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since PM Lee
              Hsien Loong announced the intention to liberalise the internet and new
              media hemisphere in the National Day Rally, the government-commissioned
              new media working group has also expressed in their report that the
              government should pay more attention to the voices of web users. In
              addition, they also recommended that the government should examine how
              to better use the new media communication channel to connect with web
              users.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The newspapers
              readers who do not participate in online forums may have the impression
              that web users have a uniform voice, just like the government uses a
              uniform approach to propagate its ideologies and policies. Some readers
              are only aware of the existence of Mr Brown or assume that most
              bloggers are similar to him.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On the
              contrary, the blogosphere and mainstream society are the same. They are
              a common space formed by people with varied viewpoints, inclinations,
              parties, objectives and temperaments.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If newspaper
              readers receive emails occasionally from their friends which includes
              hyperlinks to certain blogs, short videos or critiques that claim to
              shed the light on certain issues or uncover the wrongdoings of certain
              political figures, please do not believe them readily, or assume all
              web users think the same way. Other web users may also have strong
              opposing opinions, and thus various conspiracy theories and personal
              attacks abound.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Local English
              current affairs website “theonlinecitizen.com” is a recent example.
              This blog was set up after the last General Elections and covers news,
              interest topics, current affairs comics, columns and even translates
              part of the articles to mandarin to enlarge its reader base. It offers
              an alternative view to politics and mainstream media reports and is one
              of the top local websites of its kind.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, this
              week someone resurfaced the conspiracy theories that were the hot topic
              in february earlier this year in the forum sammyboy.com. The user
              claimed that the persons in charge of “theonlinecitizen.com” are
              secretly put in place by PAP to act as internet spies. Allegedly, they
              offer alternative opinions on the surface, but in reality do not attack
              the key government blog sites.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The writer went
              on to claim that mainstream media were listening to instructions from
              ‘above’ to support “theonlinecitizen.com” and help it to gain
              popularity and therefore cause the genuine anti-government blogs to
              lose favour with web users.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These writers
              also pointed out that the person behind “theonlinecitizen.com” , Andrew
              Loh had switched allegiance from the PAP to WP and now no longer with
              WP. The other founder, Choo Zhengxi (NUS Law Faculty undergraduate) had
              previously worked as the speech writer for the West Coast GRC nominee
              Ho Geok Choo, drawing a salary of $500 for five consecutive months.
              Last but not least, one of the editors of “theonlinecitizen.com”,
              Ephraim Loy (SMU Political Science undergraduate) is a member of Young
              PAP and have participated in various grassroots activites and maintains
              the same blog with the Foreign Affairs Minister.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The writers
              also highlighted that since the last elections, PAP has established a
              new media working group headed by the education minister and one of its
              objectives is to establish 20 communications representatives to
              participate in online forums and blogs to deflect and object to
              anti-government messages. It’s claimed that “theonlinecitizen.com” is
              one of its products.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This sounds
              like an exciting scene right out of the popular Hong Kong movie
              “Infernal Affairs”. When interviewed yesterday, the founders of
              “theonlinecitizen.com” denied that they were a propagation tool set up
              by PAP. Andrew Loh mentioned that they always used their real names in
              these activities and had nothing to hide, in contrast to the forum
              writers who hide behind anonymity. </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is just
              one of the methods on the internet to ‘dish dirt’ on and slander
              others. The real truth is of no interest to non web users. However,
              such online furore has brought to question the issue of whether web
              space can tolerate moderate, non-extremist opinions.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">People who are
              anti-government likes to congregate in web forums, because they feel
              that mainstream media does not give them an opportunity to air their
              views. Hence, they are intolerant of any pro-government voices in such
              forums. Political blogs and forum topics are frequently critical
              towards policies, the government and PAP. On top of this, some web
              users feel that moderate viewpoints have no ‘marketability’ and the
              arguments that draw the most attention are the most harsh and extremist
              arguments. Thus, sites like “theonlinecitizen.com” which are moderate
              and non-confrontational are thus labelled as pro-government.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Highly
              anti-government web users not only gauge blogs by such benchmarks, they
              also ask the same of opposition parties. The Workers Party, who
              successfully placed two members in Parliament, is widely acknowledged
              as the most successful opposition party, but in the internet world, it
              is slammed by a small group of web users. They claim that giving WP a
              vote is equivalent to giving PAP a vote.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the last
              elections, Ng Eng Hen nicknamed the Workers’ Party the “Wayang Party”
              (Wayang Kulit Party) which prompted blogger Fang Zhi Yuan to set up a
              blog named wayangparty.wordpress.com to criticise WP, along with all
              the other Singaporean opposition parties as putting up a ’show’ for
              Singapore citizens to watch. Fang felt that the opposition parties do
              not dare to seek redress for the citizens and do not have concrete
              opposition tactics. They are merely there to help PAP validate their
              claim that Singapore parliament is not a one party monopoly.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, when
              some bloggers who blog on current affairs were interviewed, they opined
              that they will not be demoralised by the small group of extremist views
              and do not agree that fierce online arguments showed that local web
              users were immature.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">National Solidarity Party leader Mr Goh Meng Seng</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">said
              “Extremist viewpoints may draw the attention of people and garner the
              support of other extremists, but most web users will still want to hear
              balanced, moderate, mature arguments. This is also the reason why the
              SDP website is rapidly losing its readers.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr Goh was
              thrust into the web forums arguments more than one year ago and was
              forced to leave the “Worker’s Party”, but he does not feel that such
              extremists online arguments will hinder the general development and
              maturity of web forum users. “If the web only allowed one form of
              viewpoint, then it would be no different from communism”.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr Choo has
              adopted a calm attitude towards the personal attacks against him on
              online forums. “When someone criticises my opinions of current affairs,
              I will treat their opinions seriously and debate with him actively.
              However, I will not be bothered if they launch personal attacks.” </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You can support Dr Chee's cause even if you do not support the man..especially since you are from the opposition camp, but apparently Chiam and Low are not fighting for democracy but supports depotism.</span></span></p>
