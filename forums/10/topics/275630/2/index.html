            <div class='col-md body'>So how did the petition and protest went?  Seems to me that this is like a 'life &amp; death' issue.  I have posted in two other similar  threads, am doing the same here.<br>I tried to sieve something out of the many posts plus reading the petition. I can't find any sense other than this gripe: "I want to withdraw all my CPF money at age 55. Unable to do so it damn frustrating. Give me back, give me back!" The rest of mumbo jumbo are not only nonsense but smack of political vendetta.<br>OK, so you want to take all your hard-earned savings out. That is acceptable. What do you do with the 'windfall'? Buy a car, cigar, concubine? Many said they can manage or invest their monies. That is well and good. What about those who can't? Do you know how many people already have lived beyond their means? How many have borrowed from loansharks? How many had been made bankrupts? I have a relative who borrowed from me, now a bankrupt and waiting to withdraw CPF money to pay me back!<br>It seems to me that the petition and many postings here supporting it are not well thought out - no brainer at all. Just a lot of whinnings and unhappiness. And a lot of misconceptions, misunderstanding and mistakes!<br>It is one thing to support a good cause and another to support some sort of personal 'grievance', or someone who has an axe to grind.<br>If anyone wants to protest or petition against the compulsory annuity, might as well protest against the idea of CPF. Aren't you already required by law to contribute to CPF?<br>So, some misgivings and misunderstanding of the purpose of annuity requires petition and protest? Damn silly. Has anyone been kidnapped, killed, persecuted, robbed, raped, thrown out of the street?  How come there was no petition to free the Korean hostages in Afghanistan?<br><strong>Now I see, it is your money that was held hostage, rite?</strong><br></div>

Life offices give very conservative rates (often change weekly i think) to protect their profits as a wrong move will lead to a loss for them. The proposed one however i think is payout after age 85. Today not many will live past 85, in future dunno. But we risk-pool and get a much much better rate. The ppl who die early pay for those who die later. If one of us somehow very suay live until age 92, it is unlikely we have savings to tahan 30yrs after retirement, thus the compulsory annuity. Payout not much but still money.</div>
