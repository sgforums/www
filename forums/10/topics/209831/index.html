            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore government's reason for banning the 28 civil group activists is there will be similar occurrences of riots as has happened before.<br><br>IMF/WB meetings are big events for showcasing of civil groups' respective concern. Even if their expressions of concern are passionate and may cause certain degree of riots such riots will be localised to the immediate causes and groups and usually not against the general population or government.<br><br>All must really understand that basically people need a certain degree of freedom to be able to take part or be part of the social or world orders including expressions of their concerns or passions.<br><br>These civil activists do not come to the host nations with an agenda to overthrow governmen where the rioters have certain reasons to get agitated.<br><br>Their targets are not necessarily the police or the government. Will such riots lead to general uprising ? So why not there be more understanding of the limited purposes and isolated nature of any such expressions of passionate views of the particular activists for attention of the world press and nothing more.<br><br>So if police overreact and started to cause reprisals by heavy handed measures, of course that will definitely lead to spillovers.<br><br>If Singapore wants to host further world conferences then it should understand the true nature of such civil activists' showcasing of concerns with particular global or social problems.<br><br>Their actions will in the long run benefit all in upholding democracy thorughout the world and lead to stability and fairness, progress and future prosperity of all people.<br><br>Only closed systems which have caused pent-up populations are afraid of such civil activism. Let these controlled societies ponder again and see how in time they could liberalise and loosen up and get everyone on board instead of only working to serve their own self-serving agendas.<br><br>A time table will need to be set to free up controlled societies so that they will have no fear at all of any civil activism and will not have to keep giving law-and-order excuses to perpetuate in their undisclosed self-interests.</div>
