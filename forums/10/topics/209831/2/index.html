            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Negative publicity? It's a plus for Singapore brand</strong><br>I AM surprised to read in your articles on the upcoming International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank meetings that the controversy over the ban on demonstrations will result 'in negative publicity'. That may be true only for a very select group, namely, anti-globalisation protesters.<br>For Singapore as a brand, its 'strict, no-nonsense reputation' could actually be positive. Which are the target groups that Singapore wants to attract? Mainly two: tourists and foreign talents.<br><br>Tourists want a safe and clean environment, beautiful scenery (which the TV pictures from the conference will show), good food, great bargains and a wide choice of goods. They want stunning beaches and to be welcomed by smiling, caring and courteous Singaporeans.<br><br>Foreign talents want job opportunities, as little red tape as possible, low taxes, great entertainment, good food, a superb transportation infrastructure - and all in a safe and clean environment.<br><br>So if in articles about the IMF/World Bank meetings the brand Singapore comes across as a place that is safe and where work and play are not endangered by violent demonstrations (but where activists are instead given a designated air-conditioned space), then this would be an attractive part of the brand positioning that we need to attract the target groups we want.<br><br>Jorg Dietzel<br><br>(Straits Times 12 Sep)</div>

Lee said police have detained 900 people and were determining whether to formally arrest them. 'If necessary we will make arrests. We will not let them go easily,' he said.<br><br>Police used water cannon, tear gas and pepper spray to repulse protesters - mostly Korean farmers - who tried to break through their lines with iron bars, wooden poles and battering rams made from steel security barriers.<br><br>With the clashes spread out over several hours and locations, there were numerous injuries, including several Koreans and police with bloody head wounds, and a woman who lost consciousness amid a thick, acrid cloud of tear gas. At one point, protesters smashed their way through police lines and entered the outer buildings of the convention centre. However, they were quickly driven out by police using truncheons - and according to one unconfirmed report - rubber bullets.<br><br>Miles of roads were cordoned off in the emergency, preventing trade delegates - at least temporarily - from entering or leaving the conference hall at a crucial stage in negotiations. 'The enemy have gathered near here,' explained one young police officer. 'There are hundreds of them, so we have blocked the roads.'<br><br>The fighting transformed a whole stretch of the city. The red-light strip of Wan Chai was eerily deserted. Instead of the usual Saturday-night hustle and bustle of prostitutes, strippers and punters, the area was locked down by thousands of grim-faced riot police.<br><br>The shopping and dining area of Causeway Bay was similarly blocked off. Instead of traffic and shoppers, the streets echoed with ambulence sirens, the buzz of police helicopters, the rhythmic drumming beaten out by Korean farm women in traditional dress, and the occasional dull crack of a tear gas round.<br><br>'We had a permit to protest, but midway along our route the police blocked our way. That is why there was violence,' said Rex Verona of the Asian Migrants Forum. 'Now is a critical moment in the negotiations. We will not allow governments and negotiators to sell us out.'<br><br>The demonstrators' anger has been stirred up by reports that negotiators are moving closer to a compromise package that does not include the key demand of many NGOs: an end to European and American agriculture subsidies that are destroying the livelihood of farmers in poor countries. Although there may be a small aid package to ease the disappointment, the most important issues related to global inequality are likely to be deferred to a make-or-break meeting early next year, while the main demands of wealthy nations - related to the service and manufacturing sectors - are pushed to the fore.<br><br>It is still far from clear that a deal can be agreed before tomorrow's deadline. The demonstrators want wavering countries - particularly Venezuela, Indonesia, Cuba, South Africa and the Philippines - to veto the plan.<br><br>'This protest is geared to strengthen the resistance of developing countries inside the conference centre, so they can block the awful deal that is being discussed,' said Walden Bellow, director of Focus on the Global South, who held out a copy of the proposal on the front line of the demonstration.<br><br>Despite the conservative and peace-loving reputation of Hong Kong, many local people who saw the clashes sympathised with the demonstrators.<br><br>Dozens joined the protests, some wearing surgical face masks for the first time since the Sars crisis, but this time to conceal their identity and protect themselves against tear gas.<br><br>'I'm ready to join the front line,' said one 20-year-old student who gave his name only as Z. 'I've never done this before, but I listen to the anti-globalisation lyrics of bands like Franco American. I'm angry at the WTO.'<br><br>Late last night hundreds of protesters were still on the streets: some lying down, some chanting, some drumming, many promising to stay there until morning if that was what it took to get their message across to the delegates.<br><br>'We would just like to march to the front of the convention centre so that we can express our opinion,' said Lee Chang Eun, of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions<br><br>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1669943,00.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong>[b]Negative publicity? It's a plus for Singapore brand</strong><br>I AM surprised to read in your articles on the upcoming International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank meetings that the controversy over the ban on demonstrations will result 'in negative publicity'. That may be true only for a very select group, namely, anti-globalisation protesters.<br>For Singapore as a brand, its 'strict, no-nonsense reputation' could actually be positive. Which are the target groups that Singapore wants to attract? Mainly two: tourists and foreign talents.<br><br>Tourists want a safe and clean environment, beautiful scenery (which the TV pictures from the conference will show), good food, great bargains and a wide choice of goods. They want stunning beaches and to be welcomed by smiling, caring and courteous Singaporeans.<br><br>Foreign talents want job opportunities, as little red tape as possible, low taxes, great entertainment, good food, a superb transportation infrastructure - and all in a safe and clean environment.<br><br>So if in articles about the IMF/World Bank meetings the brand Singapore comes across as a place that is safe and where work and play are not endangered by violent demonstrations (but where activists are instead given a designated air-conditioned space), then this would be an attractive part of the brand positioning that we need to attract the target groups we want.<br><br>Jorg Dietzel<br><br>(Straits Times 12 Sep)[/b]</blockquote>No foreigner would label him/herself as foreign talent. This article basically repeats everything ad naseaum the government says, without much in the way of addressing the negative sentiment that is building up outside our shores.<br><br>Rigidity comes at a price.We could certainly do without this international sentiment ..</div>

We work with these representatives of civil society and we value their role - even when we disagree with what they say."<br><br>But several of the charities blamed the World Bank for allowing Singapore to host the event given its record on human rights.<br><br>It also warned of a repeat at the 2009 meetings in Istanbul.<br><br>Martin Powell at the UK's World Development Movement, who was of the 28 banned from entering Singapore, said the issue was wider than just the individuals involved.<br><br>"The key issue is that the World Bank and the IMF knew about Singapore's appalling record on dissent and public assembly and they ignored warnings as this is not the first time this has happened," he said.<br><br>He called on the British government to make a public statement condemning to actions and to take it up with the Singapore government.<br><br>"The Bank and IMF are allowing Singapore to get away with this. They are sending the message to other countries that they can ignore civil society.<br><br>"This underlines their lack of commitment to accountability and transparency. The Bank should not hold meetings in Turkey if they cannot guarantee access for civil society participation."<br><br>Max Lawson, a policy adviser at Oxfam, said it was joining 14 other bodies including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth International in pulling out of a programme of 40 public meetings they had set up with the World Bank.<br><br>"We have decided to cancel the two events to support the boycott," he said.<br><br>"The Singapore government should have allowed in those who were accredited." Olivia McDonald, a senior policy officer at Christian Aid, said it was poised to join the boycott.<br><br>"I get the feeling that having it Singapore is about the businesses and the banks and if there's not the same access for civil society groups that leaves a real question mark hanging over the validity of the meetings."<br><br>However she said Christian Aid was torn by the fact that a boycott would also punish small Asian groups that would not benefit from the planned events.<br><br>The World Bank defended its decision to hold the meetings in Singapore pointing to the memorandum of understanding signed by its deputy finance minister that committed the government to allow in anyone approved by the IMF or the Bank.<br><br>- INDEPENDENT<br></span><br><br><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10401270" rel="nofollow">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10401270</a></div>
