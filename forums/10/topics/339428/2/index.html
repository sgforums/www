              <p>Again, you did not answer my question, nor do you seemed to read the announcements from our govt carefully.</p>
              <p>Qn 1. Do you agree with the govt, that the increase in Electric Charges is dependent mainly on the increase in crude oil price? This is THEIR own words, becoz that's how everyone on the streets sees it. Crude oil increase = our bills increase. There is no talk about how to manage the other 50% of costs to help to offset the increase in crude oil</p>
              <p>Qn2. Do you agree with the govt, that the decrease in Electric Charges becomes dependent on a combo of all factors, not just crude oil price decrease? So the decrease is limited coz ONLY NOW do they consider the other 50% of costs.</p>
              <p>That's all I am asking, whether you accept the way they manipulate data to justify their own means.</p>
              <p>So far after so many posts, you haven't replied this yet.</p>

              <p>I agree to the point that they decrease too little. Crude oil at 40+ and they only lower 25% from the super high charges they are charging us.</p>
              <p>But just to bring to your attention, to be fair, the decrease is more than 3%. Coz the difference btw increase of 22% of a lower base, versus a decrease of 25% from a higher base, is &gt; 3%. Someone in this forum wrote its close to 8.5%.</p>
              <p>To me that's still unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Oil Price hit a HIGH =&gt; Electricity charges hit a HIGH</p>
              <p>Oil Price hit a LOW =&gt; Electricity charges DID NOT hit a LOW.</p>
              <p>Someone in this forum can still accept the above, which is very interesting for me. I would like to question that person whether is he paying for the utility bills, or is someone else paying for it? Coz somehow I feel a lot of people who aren't paying the utility bills aren't as scrutinizing as those who do.</p>

              <p>When Crude Oil was trading around US$95 in Jan 2008, the price of electricity charged by SP was 22.62 cents per kwh.</p>
              <p>When Crude Oil was trading at around US$150 in Jun 2008, the price of electricity charged by SP was 25.07 cents per kwh.</p>
              <p>When Crude Oil was trading at around US$75 in Oct 2008, the price of electricity charged by SP was 30.45 cents per kwh.</p>
              <p>Come Jan 2009, they will reduce the price of electricity to 22.93 cents when the current Crude Oil price is below US$40. They are still overcharging us by using around US$95 Crude Oil price. Shouldn't the price of electricity be 16 cents per kwh?</p>
              <p>The best part of their pricing strategy is that, THE MAJORITY (80%) OF OUR ELECTRICITY GENERATION COMES FROM NATURAL GAS AND NOT CRUDE OIL. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>They can have the knowhow, they certainly have the knowledge to make things more efficient they still cannot ignore geological differences and physical constraints (How much barrels you can squeeze on an oil tanker and how much oil tankers you've got)</p>
              <p>One main difference between Singapore and the other countries (Taiwan, Hongkong, Korea)  is that Singapore relies on LNG and oils for its energy generation while Taiwan, Hongkong and Korea relies on the cheaper, but far more polluting coal fired power plants. You can look this up if you want to, Singapore doesn't use coal fired power plants.</p>
              <p>That is the main reason of the difference in power prices. This point here is crucial, because it also account for why our air is not as badly polluted as Hong Kong's.</p>
              <p>{editted] I did a quick check, and it turns out the Hua neng owned Tuas Power is planning to build a supposedly 'clean' coal power plant. Whether it is truly clean or not i am not sure. But i just like to say this since i said Singapore doesn't used coal fired power plants.</p>
              <p>I already stated the reason why it's at 90 now. Because the oil that we're using now was bought at $90. You need to pre order them a few months before to ensure you do not run out before the next shipment. Unless of course, that they do not furthur adjust the prices next year than your reasoning would hold weight.</p>
              <p>How much could they make from the inflated charges? You forget they also had to pay more for the oil too, how much more could they have made?</p>

              just like to say this since i said Singapore doesn't used coal
              fired power plants.</p>
              <p>I already stated the reason why it's at 90 now. Because the oil
              that we're using now was bought at $90. You need to pre order them
              a few months before to ensure you do not run out before the next
              shipment. Unless of course, that they do not furthur adjust the
              prices next year than your reasoning would hold weight.</p>
              <p>How much could they make from the inflated charges? You forget
              they also had to pay more for the oil too, how much more could they
              have made?</p>

              <p>I don't know why you want to help the ministers think. I also do not know why you want to help the power companies explain this fiasco.</p>
              <p>I am a Business IT Expert, my paid job is to ensure my company's processes are optimized. I am not paid to think for the govt. I am not paid to help the power companies explain this fiasco.</p>
              <p>All I see, as a layman, and as an honest citizen PAYING my utility bills (which I am not sure you do, since you aren't even scrutinizing the other supposedly 50% of costs as to whether they are optimizing those costs properly or not), is that when other countries electricity bills are lowered, ours went up.</p>
              <p>All the talk above about supply chain doesn't concern me. I only see prices down so much, and our charges are still so high. And our electricity bills is one of the highest in the world.</p>

              <p>Wow, someone who presume they know who i am. Just for your information, i do help with the family utility bills and groceries, and i make a point of keeping track of my monthly electrical bills to adjust my usage.    </p>
              <p>I am not paid to think for the government and i don't see why your job position as a Business IT Expert has anything to do with this discussion. Quite frankly, i'm actually disappointed that such a highly educated individual would fail to see how the world's supply chains would affect us.</p>
              <p>Supply chains should concern us because we have to import every single thing we use. Considering that more than 90% of what we own is foreign made, what gives you the conclusion that supply chains would not and should not concern you?</p>
              <p>And i've already answered the question of the higher electrical prices. Because we're using LNG for power generation, rather than the cheaper coal. Or would you accept my explanation better if i just said the Singapore ministers want to squeeze more money from us?</p>
              <p>I merely offer a more objective reasoning to the raising electrical prices other than "the government is out to get us". If you feel my reasoning is wrong, point out what you feel is wrong.</p>

              <p>Again, you did not answer my question, nor do you seemed to read
                  the announcements from our govt carefully.</p>
              <p>Qn 1. Do you agree with the govt, that the increase in Electric
                  Charges is dependent mainly on the increase in crude oil price?
                  This is THEIR own words, becoz that's how everyone on the streets
                  sees it. Crude oil increase = our bills increase. There is no talk
                  about how to manage the other 50% of costs to help to offset the
                  increase in crude oil</p>
              <p>Qn2. Do you agree with the govt, that the decrease in Electric
                  Charges becomes dependent on a combo of all factors, not just crude
                  oil price decrease? So the decrease is limited coz ONLY NOW do they
                  consider the other 50% of costs.</p>
              <p>That's all I am asking, whether you accept the way they
                  manipulate data to justify their own means.</p>
              <p>So far after so many posts, you haven't replied this yet.</p>
