            <div class='col-md body'>i was reading an article on taiwan in ST today. The writer of the article always seems to be able to meet people who thinks Taiwan system is bad and lot of praise for Singapore system. Most of the Taiwanese i met knows Singapore as an excessively strict country with heavy punishments.<br><br>If i called their country "a society in chaos" they would think i am crazy. I agree that their politics is a little messy, but their society is functioning well. Their Arts and music scene is vibrant, their R &amp;D are contributing to their economy. The country is clean without fines, the commuters give way to leaving passengers, and their sales staff are very polite.<br><br></div>

Buy local products, support local companies especially those who hire mainly locals and not "FTs".  Spend money know you are spending to feed someone else's children in SINGAPORE.<br><br>It starts with eating less fast food and more hawker food too.<br><br>I wonder if it can get radical and we discourage "foreign" maids and hire local people who are willing to work as one.
