            <div class='col-md body'><br>The following article is not the first or second such incident related to commuting by bus. This has nothing to do with bus service standards, but a lot to do with attitude of SOME public menbers...<br><br>What do you think can be done, or is it because the Police can't do anything with Non Seizable Offences? I already said, such public violence can escalate because it was publicly made know, Police can't do anything....<br><br>===========================<br><strong>'Hold bus until I finish smoking'<br>Man punches driver who says no<br>By Hedy Khoo </strong><br><br>June 10, 2007<br><br>HE flagged a bus but didn't board it immediately after it stopped for him.<br><br>The reason - he was still puffing away at his cigarette and he wanted the bus driver to wait for him until he was done.<br><br>When the driver told the man he couldn't do so, he grudgingly stubbed out the cigarette and boarded the bus with a friend.<br><br>While on board, he created a ruckus.<br><br>Then, he bashed up the driver.<br><br>According to one witness, he hit the driver while the bus was moving.<br><br>The attack happened last Wednesday around 7.55 pm.<br><br>The man appeared to be in his 30s.<br><br>He boarded the number 124 bus opposite Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Moulmein Road.<br><br>According to SBS Transit, the man, who was smoking, asked the bus driver to wait for him to finish his cigarette before boarding.<br><br>Bus driver Wong Hing Keong, 44, explained he couldn't, as that wouldn't be fair to other passengers.<br><br>The man then put out his cigarette, boarded the bus with a friend and sat in the front.<br><br>Soon, he started to scold Mr Wong using vulgar language.<br><br>SBS Transit said he got up and kicked the door of the driver's cabin. He also grabbed the driver and hit him.<br><br>Mr Wong stopped the bus by the side of the road.<br><br>SBS Transit said the man walked up to Mr Wong, caught hold of his collar and continued to hurl abuse.<br><br>Two of Mr Wong's shirt buttons were ripped off.<br><br>The passenger punched the bus captain on the back of his head. The man's friend then pulled him away and they went back to their seats.<br><br>One passenger, who wanted to be identified only as Tom, said he witnessed the incident.<br><br>Tom, 27, a restaurant supervisor, told The New Paper: 'I heard the bus driver explain to him why he couldn't stop the bus to wait for him to finish smoking. The bus driver was quite polite.'<br><br>Tom, who was seated on the left, in the second row from the front, confirmed that the man, who wore a singlet and bermudas, shouted vulgarities at the driver.<br><br>According to him, the bus driver became upset and asked the passenger why he had used vulgarities on him.<br><br>An argument started.<br><br>'The man suddenly got up, went to the bus driver and started raining punches on him, hitting the driver on his head and body,' said Tom.<br><br>'I was shocked because the driver was driving at that time, and the bus was moving in the middle of the road,' said Tom.<br><br>Tom said there was a scuffle after the bus pulled to a stop.<br><br>'The man's friend tried to pull him away, but he was too violent, and the friend simply went back to his seat,' he recounted.<br><br>Tom added: 'Nobody else did anything because all the passengers were too shocked and the scuffle lasted for only two minutes.<br><br>'The fight ended when the bus driver shouted at the man to stop and said he would report the matter to the police.'<br><br>The driver stopped the bus opposite Quality Hotel on Balestier Road, and called for assistance from the control centre, keeping the doors locked.<br><br>According to SBS Transit, Mr Wong alerted the operations control centre and a traffic inspector was despatched to assist him.<br><br>POLICE NOTIFIED<br><br>The police were also notified. They said the alleged assailant will be helping in the ongoing investigations.<br><br>The New Paper was unable to reach Mr Wong as he was on three days of medical leave.<br><br>After the assault, he had been sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for observation and an X-ray, because he had complained of pain in the head and dizziness.<br><br>This latest incident brings the total number of assault cases on bus captains this year to 16.<br><br>SBS Transit said there were 14 such cases last year.<br><br></div>

If I am doing a job serving the public and my salary already afew hundred thousands a year, I might forgo the raise. Give me so much money, I also don't know where to spend, I can't take it with me when I die leh. It's very subjective also, if the person is greedy, the more the merrier, you give them $10 million a year, they will gladly take. Greed don't know what is paiseh.</div>
