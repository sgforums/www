              <div class="top_headline"><strong></strong></div>
              <div class="top_headline">A <strong>FEISTY</strong> exchange between Dr Lily Neo and Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon on the issue of aid for the poorest households took place during question time yesterday.
              <p>Dr Neo, an MP for Jalan Besar GRC, appealed to the Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports for more help for those with long-term problems in making ends meet.</p>
              <p>She also asked the minister to confirm a survey's findings that there were 100,000 such households.</p>
              <p>Mrs Yu-Foo replied by citing a list of help schemes for the poorest 20 per cent of Singaporeans and, in some cases, those earning more.</p>
              <p>Mrs Yu-Foo also said: 'Our ministry's concern is...how far you want to cover.</p>
              <p>'You want to cover up to 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent?'</p>
              <p>Just as Speaker of Parliament Abdullah Tarmugi was moving on to the next question, Dr Neo rose and insisted on her right to reply to what she saw as Mrs Yu-Foo's challenge to her.</p>
              <p>'I have to come in here because I was asked a question,' Dr Neo said.</p>
              <p>'I'd like to object to the fact that I was asked...what I wanted the assistance for; wasn't 20 per cent enough, 30 per cent enough?'</p>
              <p>She added: 'I definitely never asked for 30 per cent or 40 per cent of assistance to Singaporeans, and I object to being asked that kind of question.'</p>
              <p>Mrs Yu-Foo then clarified that her question was not directed at Dr Neo in particular, but at Singaporeans in general.</p>
              <p>'I didn't say Dr Lily Neo asks for 30 per cent...My question was generally to Singaporeans, whether we want to cover beyond 20 per cent.'</p>
              <p>The exchange took place as the Trade and Industry Ministry released figures that showed rising prices in the first half of this year had hit the bottom 20 per cent of Singaporeans the hardest.</p>
              <p>They faced an inflation rate of 7.4 per cent in the first half of this year, compared to 6.9 per cent for the middle 60 per cent and top 20 per cent of households by income.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is media value in this article? Is there an absolute need to publish these insignificant squabbles? Or are Singaporeans getting more interested in the drama than the Government's primary role. </p>

All the MCYS minister need to do is to confirm with her, why turn so big round and NOT answering the question, and instead shot back with a rhetorical question.. <br>It seems that be minister, you need to be able to concoct rhetorical questions and utter utterly useless question as answers to questions... <br><br>To me it shows that at least there is someone in PAP that is wiling to stand up for people.. and not all of them are "YEs sir" people<br><br></p>

              <p>Who would believe a Singapore tyrant has the means to know what's in the head of other people?</p>
              <p>Actually there are many who know the use of psychic in intelligence ops such as remote viewing. entering the mind of people is a kind of remote viewing on a person.</p>
              <p><br>I know because I'm one of this rotten Singaopre tyrant victim. I've refused medication to prov I'm not crazy and has since graduated from a local university in 7 semesters. I'm looking for lawyer to sue the NUH for their defamation or at least false diagnosis on me which caused me considerable psychological torment.</p>
              <p>Any brave and rather insane lawayer willing to help me PM me! Let's put a light in Singapore and cast away the darkness that has gripped many into silence.</p>

              <p>There seems to be a controversy in the justification for the high renumeration package that senior and/or promising public servants draw.</p>
              <p>PM Lee had mentioned this many times, emphasizing the need for retaining talents within the Govt, so that the quality can be kept to a world-class level. However, members of public see this package as a "Prince John (vs Robin Hood)" package - taking from the poor and pay more to the rich.</p>
              <p>Policy making (in my limited understanding of the process) is a long-drawn one and the effect may or may not be noticeable within a short span of time. Other than giving out monetary handouts to the public, the rest of the efforts will take time to tell.</p>
