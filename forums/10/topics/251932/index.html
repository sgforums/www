            <div class='col-md body'>Ya i agree about that.I am a Buddhist too.And i believe what you create is what you get.Not forgetting what those MIW are creating now....! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>So, hope those really greedy MIW(hehe not all MIW are bad anyway)<br>get what they deserve.<br>But ..., if you really go and study fengshui deeply, fengshui can make you 180 degree from a poor chap to a richy rich.But you must be lucky too lar.And this is what karma is... if you got good karma you will met with good fengshui master and he will guide you all the way to good fortune.Of course if you do bad deeds, only fake fengshui master will follow you.So, that explain Karma and fengshui works hand in hand.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Feng shui masters and astrologers were key advisors to the emperor in many aspects of governing the empire. Few people know that feng shui was a vital tool used throughout Chinese history allowing imperial families to maintain their power and reign over billions. One of these secrets was ensuring their ancestors were buried in a prime feng shui location. This creates a positive effect on their future generation.<br><br>More information can be found here...<br><br><a href="http://www.awarenessmag.com/marapr07/ma07_feng_shui.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.awarenessmag.com/marapr07/ma07_feng_shui.htm</a></div></blockquote>Its one thing to practice fengshui and Its another to be superstition as to how far fengshui really help.<br><br>However the Elment of "Luck" is ingrained in the chinese culture. The notion of locating this great burial site to having ancestor buried that helps the future generation is also part of this lucky fortune that they found the site. So the entire notion keep spining.<br><br>Does it mean that we are doomed in Singapore because the future generation only have ashes in a Jar.  But the future generation would probably creamate the bones and converted into Diamonds and wear it as an immediate fortune.</div>
