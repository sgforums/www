That will give them more time to do community service.<br><br>Don't think they need allowance for transport etc. cos I'm sure they won't mind helping if they have the time.<br>Less red tapes &amp; rules, give them a free hand to organise activities they like rather than just selling flags.<br>Also those who volunteer a lot should get extra bonus points for priority to get into U.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Chief Justice held the book in his hand and administered the oath to the incoming ministers one by one that "I affiirm that I ...shall bear my true faith and allegiance to the republic ..."<br><br>The words "true", "truth", "faith" and "allegiance"  were sworn to or affirmed by minister after minister many times. They struck me as awesome words of honour of men of the greatest talents in the country attested in the presence of all dignitaries and administered by the CJ.<br><br>Perhaps, going by the oaths and the honours of these words, plans will now be announced to improve all aspects of governance...to truly serve all Singaporeans with true faith and allegiance to all Singaporeans (Republic)<br><br>Since feedbacks were given on many occasions in the past through various channels. Did the ministers truly and faithfully understand problems and will attend to them truly and faithfully to all. Why is there a need for another different round of feedbacks from the young or anybody else. Perhaps, by now the problems of the young were already recorded in past feedbacks given on so many occasions. Were there true understanding and faithfully discharge of talents to understand all their problems?<br><br>Must we wait for more time and more committees to go through the motion of justification or presentation or will there be true and faithful understanding of problems reported previously in order to remake ourselves.<br><br>Which is which? More feedbacks or more solutions of problems already presented previously by the youths on many occasions including some on TV debates. If ministers are to bear true faith and allegiance, then forthright answers to such queries may be in order.<br><br>The youths perhps will want to know what true faith and allegiance will be served in the face of earlier feedbacks on many occasions. They are now being called upon to serve the nation and will need to know many unanswered questions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
