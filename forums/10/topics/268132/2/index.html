            <div class='col-md body'>me travel to china for business trip reg. hence i must say some of the comment here are not quite true. i freq. shanghai and sometimes peking. most of the pekining and shanghainese arent that bad. their quality is much better than those found in the singapore streets who tends to come from the rural area or developing part of china?such as Hunan, hubei, henan, hebei,liaoning etc. i think there aint much guangzhou or zhejiang ppl coz these provinces are developing much faster and offer better job opportunity.<br><br>What singapore can attract is only those from developing province as mention above. Hence the quality of such ppl will be lower. In the first place who let them into singapore? our very govt! why blame them, it is our natural human instinct to take advantage of any system.<br>if you can migrate to australia, would you like to bring along all family should their migration system allows you to?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>look, there will always be bad eggs. Its just that China is a big place with a huge population. Hence, number of evil-doers will definitely have a multiplier effect. And have u ever noticed that people tend to fixate on negative news? Bad news such as school shoot-outs, fake baby milk powder, terrorism acts gets eaten up by the public and debated about for days, months even. World changing news such as India's micro-credit system gets a cursory report and gets forgotten nearly as soon as it was out. To better prove my point, listen to this song by black eye peas. I believe its called " where is the love " .<br><br>another point is, China is seriously, under the spotlight nowofdays. Too much i must say, its taking up space in the news that are better suited for other events.<br>Sad to say, there are much worse atrocities still in Africa, and if you would just browse through the newspaper, the coverage on it is simply pathetic, it having just a fraction of what is dedicated to China despite having a near equal population. Anyone ever heard of Uganda, Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)? i guess not many actually would, not even in this Speaker's Corner where it seems to be more cool to criticise rather than praise governmental / organisation policies without even considering the rambifications of them</div>

No economic development ??<br><br>Which country went through industrial revolution did not face these fucked up things ?? China now is where America was in the 30s<br><br>Just give them time, things will change. The Chinese government is paying a lot of attention to the food safety issue, they cracked down illegal factories, small stores, announce that most of domestic products dont even meet the national standards after an inspection, all manufacturers now have been told to put quality first. And recently China central television CCTV went undercover and discovered the tainted steamed buns and reported to the nation and the world, highlighting China's food problem. At least, these safety, food problems are not being ignored but being addressed instead. I have to say that the recent food, products scares worldwide is not really bad for China at all, it actually help China to realise its problems and correct them.<br><br>And how many developing countries are better than China ?? I am pretty sure there are many other developing countries having problems like China or even worse but they are gonna have to live with those problems forever because nothing there to warn or alert them like these global food scares recently.</div>
