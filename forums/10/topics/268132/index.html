            <div class='col-md body'>No disrespect to China peoples.But truth is truth,i still have to say this....,not all China peoples are bad.But MOST are.And China girls especially those from the village, will do all thing of funny things to get money.<br>And, just look at all the recent news about the FAKE IN CHINA stuff.<br><br>Ok, my grandparents came from China too.But that is the past China.The recent China i know, can say frankly, most are all out to make money but doesnt really care about moral act or care about human life.I say again MOST and not all.<br><br>Back to my main topic.I dont know why most of you guys doesnt mind the government grant more China people here.I do mind.MOST of them will not think themselves as Singaporeans.And consider China a Billion populations,just 10% of them wanting to migrate here will really flood all of us Singaporeans out of our own land.<br>If most migrate here is of good moral and good behaviour, i dont mind.<br>But for what i have seen around, if i got a video cam in hand, i confirm take it down and share with you guys what i have seen with my own eyes, most of them are not the kind of talents or moral people we want to live with.<br><br>I know of this China fren who already getting a PR soon.Mind you, he is just a operator.And he intented to get all his families here to stay.<br>I called the ICA and check it out with them how come a operator here can get a PR so easily.The reply is, it's not up to them to decide.It's up to the person who interview him.What???? So, no rules and regulations to follow?<br>And that China guy fren of mine, smoke drink and pros in the geylang.<br><br>During my break time, sometimes i wonder if i am in Singapore or in China.<br>All the operators are from China.Even now most white collar office workers, i can heard from the tones that they are from China when they sit beside me eating.Last time there are mostly only China girls operators.Now i can see more Male China factory operators or workers of other jobs too.<br><br>Really frankly speaking, the trend of our current situation cannot really say because we need more babies so just let in any cats and dogs.<br>China is a big country i know that.But their moral behaviour is still a big question mark.Will they make Singapore a fake land too?What if more than 80% of our population is from China?Wait a minute, worst of all is what if they bring in their fake culture that is all the fake things they like to do?And, from what i know they will only bring their culture into our homeland and not become part of our culture.<br><br>I really hope, please please do think of the real problems we Singaporeans will be facing if China peoples or whoever really get PR so easily in Singapore.And with PR, they can also get Red I.C more easily.<br>Imagine this, one come here and get PR then red i.c.Bring in whole families.<br>Then relatives... then relatives son come get P.R and red i.c then bring in wifes... on and on.<br><br>To all Singaporeans who support the current PAP bring in more China people policies, don't cry when our motherland and culture wll be tainted dirty by those unmoral China peoples fake culture.<br><br>Lastly, i really dont mind good China people with good moral background.<br>But how many are there in China these days with the kind of bad social enviroment China is facing now???Think about it!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing against FT, but Singapore really is too desperate for so-called "foreign talent".  Fact is, even some of these FT (friends of mine) are admitting that the govt's being very stupid by opening the floodgates indiscriminately because "everyone knows" that the citizens are on the losing end.  Some even call it "Spreading Singapore's legs".<br><br>*shakes head* Singaporeans are being made to pay for mistakes made 25-30 years ago in the form of poor/fickle child policies.

            <div class='col-md body'>Almost every product in Singapore going to be China product. From Malaysia to China. Example NTUC detergent, Ginvera nutri white hydrasoft cleanser, etc. All label product of china, made in china or produced in china.<br><br>Worst still the label of the package is written in japan or Korea, but when you look at the label carefully where it is made, it is made in China. some time there is no label where it is made or cover by a sticker. You can't even trust the label.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spinsugar:</div><div class="quote_body">Nothing against FT, but Singapore really is too desperate for so-called "foreign talent".  Fact is, even some of these FT (friends of mine) are admitting that the govt's being very stupid by opening the floodgates indiscriminately because "everyone knows" that the citizens are on the losing end.  Some even call it "Spreading Singapore's legs".<br><br>*shakes head* Singaporeans are being made to pay for mistakes made 25-30 years ago in the form of poor/fickle child policies.  And as usual, it's our fault not the policy makers'.</div></blockquote>Heard this sentiment from foreigners 10 years ago. Ang Moh Sniggered at our kowtow to them and calling us Chinks stupid while they laffed all the way to the banks while they discussed how loose our women, how stupid our country for not taking care of its people, negative comments about this place and knowing they cannot make it back home are just happy to sap Singapore for whatever it is worth and etc. PRCs all laffed at our naive-ness as they will make use of the place to gain a step up through us because we subsidise their education 100% or get promoted up many levels because they can smoke their way up and return home to better life. PRCs know that as more of their kind comes, this place will rot. So they all want to make a fast killing.<br><br>We are soon becoming a old prostitude.
