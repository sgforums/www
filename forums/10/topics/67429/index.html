Wat is there to conplain about if they are able to help provide us with the living we have now. Who cares if the prince is willing to be the PM, he have made to be a DPM for so many yr, he isn't shout of stepping down...<br><br>Anyway, his ability should be judge by the people not only by the people in government, people will be able to sense if they don think DPM Lee is to be of standard. We are not people who just suffer in quiet, we complain when we don feel happy about it, but now the majority still approve of it.<br><br>Moreover, u don expect the future PM Lee passing the throne to his dear daughter rite? The person taking over should have the abiltity, no one will pass something such important like the future of singapore to someone who don even know how to protect it.<br><br></div>
