HDB is always blindly upholding their blinking POLICIES protecting and preserving their own rules, oblivious to people's unique circumstances?<br><br></div></blockquote>All the problems happening to our society e.g. high costs, unemployments due to foreigners being allowed to compete for jobs against citizens, and class discrimination and elitism siphoning away opportunities only to the upper echelons and a few rich people are all problems genuinely affecting our citizens whether they see them or not.<br><br>These problems are attributable to a system where government collects the highest direct and indirect taxes using creative accounting method while stinging on spending to benefit the people e.g. their high costs of living or doing business.<br><br>Such a system is basically wrong and immoral - shylock-like sucking of monies from the people through creative accounting in selling of HDB flats and recovering every cost to the fullest extent and triple-taxing on vehicles using the fear factor about traffic congestions.<br><br>All the above-stated problems are causing great sufferings to the people.<br><br>Yet, given these problems were brought about by the making of decision based on assumptions of all kind which as events have shown, were fallacious and attributable to self-centred top-down wrongful governance.<br><br>Yet, the leaders even with the latest NKF revelations, refuse to see or understand the problems and their causations.<br><br>The leaders still try to keep a false front of having done no wrong in the NKF to refuse to see the causations in NKF. They are still claiming success through the media presentations of justifications and hypocrisy.<br><br>The latest relenting on their over-reactive anti-welfarism stand proved one point - such a policy was wrong. By going to the extreme of recovering costs to avoid welfare, all the taxes got accumulated into reserves which at the end did not benefit the citizens and only resulted in high costs created by various creative accounting and witholding of spending the monies to give some returns back something to citizens.<br><br>The most hypocritic attitude of all is while it will avoid welfarism at all cost, the leaders will not hesitate to splash on extravagance or accumulate them as reserves or spending extra billions on politicians' own salaries and bonuses.<br><br>Yet, despite such big problems being created through propaganda on all sorts of hypocritic policies, it still wants to pretend there is no problem by refusing to acknowledge problems.<br><br>In other words, welfarism is now not being practised but only workfarism. Reserves are not used for benefits of citizens but investments overseas to benefit others and not our own citizens. That is the gist of my post - that hypocrisy about dangers of welfarism is simply a hypocrisy as monies accumutated will be spent on something totally out of line with aspirations and needs of people.<br><br>Now the latest Workfare is being used as propaganda to win votes but while we welcome help to the needy and citizens as a whole, the way it is being done is questionable and citizens must know the difference - sincere or not sincere or was it another hypocrisy just to win votes.<br><br></div>

It is so serious that<br><br>(a) Lower income families cannot pay utility, public transport, housing and medical not to mention the meals. Smaller assistance will not help this group to tie over current subsistence-living problems.<br><br>(b) Middle-income families cannot make ends meet usually incurring credit cards debts and will have to downgrade. Smaller assistance will also not help this group tie over problems.<br><br>The urgency to help the lower-income group is there. The middle-income group too is in a quandary.<br><br>To the first group, the proposed $1 billion workfare assistance will help.<br><br>To the middle-income earners who are squeezed by dropping assets and the high costs of living due to double-charging on land, triple-charging on vehicles, etc, help will be welcome if there are not at the expense of creating a deficit.<br><br>How to collect just the necessary taxes and fees without burdening the middle-class with exorbitant excise duty on vehicle even after it was agreed that COE and/or ERP would be the final measures to cope with road traffic congestion.<br><br>We need leaders who can understand how the economy works and who will realize that by over-taxing and over-recovering costs in all kinds of fee increases, there economy will not grow and there will be no jobs.<br><br>Our great leaders, who keep trying to claim themselves as world best, our Ministers, MPs, grassroot leaders, who are supposedly scholars and our oppositions should fight for the citizens and not hide behind some hypes about welfare or wrong assumption that paying our highest ministers' salaries will prevent or reduce corruptions.<br><br>Many past assumptions behind our major government policies such as pointed out remain assumptions. I am sure Singapore can do with less and less extravagant spendings on concrete arches or more rain shelters or other big projects unhelpful to job creations to be scaled down or stopped.<br><br>I am sure given the will be many good solutions e.g. not to over-spend and collect only the necessary taxes without bankrupting the middle class.<br><br>The middle-income group is presently suffering from severe drop of asset values due to bursting of asset bubble caused partly by government's own mistakes in pushing up public sector salaries under Dr. Goh Keng Swee's doctrine...which is a doubtful doctrine on hindsight.<br><br>Citizens may argue ceaselessly and uncertainly among themselves on a lot of issues because of pros-and-cons and cannot come to conclusive views but leaders must surely have the larger perspective and visions to see larger picture and not use citizens' dilemma over necessary help to the middle class.<br><br>Solutions lie in not over-taxing the people, over-paying the public sector salaries or over-spending on extravagance. Both lower-income group and middle-income group stand to benefit if costs of living are not pushed up unnecessarily by these past wrong policies which should be corrected fast..if economy is to grow again.<br><br></div>
