              <h1>Yew Tee Zone “9″ RC starts free English classes for new citizens and PRs</h1>

              <p><span class="time">December 30, 2009</span></p>
              <p>A grassroots organization from Hong Kah GRC has started free English classes - “Let’s learn English together”, funded entirely by Singapore taxpayers for new citizens and PRs two months ago.</p>
              <p>The three-month course is catered mainly to new citizens and PRs from China, Myanmar and Vietnam and are held every Monday at Choa Chu Kang Way Blk 785 Yew Tee Zone ‘9″ Residents’ Committee office.</p>
              <p>Singapore is the only country in the world known to conduct free English courses for immigrants and even PRs.</p>
              <p>In other countries like Australia, Canada and United States, foreigners who cannot speak English are not even qualified to find work there in the first place.</p>
              <p>Due to its declining birth rates, the ruling party of Singapore has opened its door to immigration in recent years. Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>According to the Home Affairs Ministry, there were over 20,000 new citizens and 90,000 PRs last year. Two out of every three PR applicants are successful, an astonishingly high acceptance rate for a small country like Singapore.</p>
              <p>Unlike other first world countries who are very selective about who they accept as PRs, it appears to be relatively easy for foreigners to get PRs in Singapore especially if they come from certain countries.</p>
              <p>Even construction workers, cleaners and masseurs are given Singapore PR and citizenship, much to the chagrin of the local populace.</p>
              <p>Despite widespread resentment and anger on the ground at the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy, its leaders continue to insist that immigration is “essential” to Singapore’s continued growth and development.</p>
              <p>In a frank interview with journalist Mark Jacobson from the National Geographic magazine, Singapore’s geriatrician leader Lee Kuan Yew spoke about the ruling party’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies as if he was their principal architect.</p>
              <p>Though Lee said he was aware of the fact that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants”, he continued to insist that it is for “good” of the nation:</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee described the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that Singapore’s ruling party does not care how the locals are coping with the relentless influx of foreigners. In fact, it is more than happy to welcome more newcomers to increase its support base for future elections since new citizens will tend to support the ruling party.</p>
              <p>The ruling party has been going all out of its way to woo the new citizens and PRs such as organizing free parties, buffets and language classes for them. They are also roped in to “serve” as grassroots leaders.</p>
              <p>The language course organized by Yew Tee Zone “9″ RC for the new citizens and PRs is probably funded by the $10 million Community Integration Fund unveiled by Minister of Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan lately to make the newcomers feel “welcomed” in Singapore.</p>
              <p>While the ruling party has no qualms splurging on the new citizens using public monies, it has blatantly refused to do more to help needy Singaporeans in financial distress.</p>
              <p>After all, there is no political pressure for it to do so since there is no opposition in parliament and it is guaranteed to win the next election hands down again.</p>
