              <p>Hi I am an Indian and I just wanted to share with my fellow singaporean brothers how much I love our country's racial harmony attitude.</p>
              <p>No need to put tamil subtitles for shows on channel 5, even though there are malay and chinese subtitles. Because after all we Indians speak English, and I mean all of us. Even the foreign workers and senior citizens. Its okay you dont need to put tamil signboards because we all only go to Little India, isnt it? Oh its also okay, that for chinese there's lunar new year holiday and christmas, for malays there hari raya haji and hari raya adilfitiri as public holidays and for us theres deepavali and also vesak day because we indians also pray to buddha alot, infact there are more indian than chinese buddhist isnt it?</p>
              <p>Oh and I love how in this year's nation day theme song video the Indian was a newspapers delivery man. Yes! we matter! We put your newspapers and we sweep the streets!</p>
              <p>And recently one of our most respected indian celebrity, Vadi PVSS was introduced in Channel 5's Calefare. We loved how he acted and his famous verse "you owe money! you pay money!" while wearing a lungi without underwear and showing his crotch although dont worry you were spared of the eye sore as his dower was blurred.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's right we can keep bending as much as you want us to. Hey right now, I can even see my asshole. Cool huh? :D</p>

              <p>Use your brain bro, Indian majority is hindu, then muslim, then sikh and then christians/catholics. How many buddhist Indians do you know? Only Singhalese are buddhist. This does pertain to ethnicity. The government delegated two public holidays for the 4 major ethnic groups. But since eurasians tend to follow the ethnic religion eg Chinese Eurasians celebrate Lunar New Year AND Chinese in Singapore also tend to be mostly Buddhist and Christians. Where is the second Indian public holiday? Vesak day benefits the Chinese more so than Indians. If we Singaporean Tamils had it our way then it would be Thaipusam or Pongal. Since Tamils are the largest of the Indian minority in Singapore our priorities preceede those of Sikhs and Sindhis. Besides Malayalees also celebrate Thaipusam. I'm a Telugu and I don't even celebrate Thaipusam. But I belief that since Tamils make up the largest Indian ethnic group to the point that Tamil is synonymous and representative of Indians here in Singapore then their preferance should be taken into consideration.</p>

              <p><br>Yah, yah. Dutch are part of the 4 major ethnic group. Chinese, Malay, Dutch and Eurasian. Infact since tourist come to Singapore they will remember than the Dutchs are a crucial part of the community.</p>

              <p>The holidays are really just a token gesture to appease the so-called majority races, ultimately it is impossible to provide so many national holidays for the increasing numbers of ethnic groups. But I agree that Tamil is not treated right as compared to the other national languages</p>

              <p>If you could say something like this, doesn't it ring a bell when you try to compare between races in Singapore? Likewise, even if a considerable number of Chinese and I were to migrate and live in India, I wouldn't expect street signs there to have a Chinese translation, would I? It's would be like building urinals for the male teachers in the toliets of an all-girls' school.</p>
              <p>Look, there are people staying in foreign lands, living among people who look entirely different from themselves, celebrating festivals where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatina">people throw tomatoes at one another</a>, on streets whose names look like the word "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorificabilitudinitatibus">honorificabilitudinitatibus</a>" spelled backwards. Yet these people are willing to call the place they live in: their home. If a lack of tamil subtitles, a tamil signboard and a tamil public holiday is all it takes to make you feel any less sense of belonging towards Singapore, and think that you're bending your back all over the place, I really doubt it would make a difference even if they were there.</p>

              <p>Use your brain bro, Indian majority is hindu, then muslim, then
              sikh and then christians/catholics. How many buddhist Indians do
              you know? Only Singhalese are buddhist. This does pertain to
              ethnicity. The government delegated two public holidays for the 4
              major ethnic groups. But since eurasians tend to follow the ethnic
              religion eg Chinese Eurasians celebrate Lunar New
              Year AND Chinese in Singapore also tend to be mostly Buddhist
              and Christians. Where is the second Indian public holiday? Vesak
              day benefits the Chinese more so than Indians. If we Singaporean
              Tamils had it our way then it would be Thaipusam or Pongal. Since
              Tamils are the largest of the Indian minority in Singapore our
              priorities preceede those of Sikhs and Sindhis. Besides Malayalees
              also celebrate Thaipusam. I'm a Telugu and I don't even
              celebrate Thaipusam. But I belief that since Tamils make up the
              largest Indian ethnic group to the point that Tamil is synonymous
              and representative of Indians here in Singapore then their
              preferance should be taken into consideration.</p>
