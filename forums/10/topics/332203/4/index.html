              <p><br> Unlike you, my threat is just a joke to humour only.</p>
              <p>I prefer guys with a better sense of humour and can tahan my
                      jokes.</p>
              <p>You should at least seek advice from Osama Bin Laden before you
                      come to the virtual world and migrate terror from your real
                      world.</p>
              <p>No wonder Osama go into hiding now, cos nowadays terrorist
                      wannabes and rebels are all CMI standard.</p>
              <p>I believe terrorists and rebels also deserves to enjoy a good
                      laugh once in a while and remember some of the humour in this
                      virtual world before they set and activate the timers on their
                      balls. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
