            <div class='col-md body'><br>I read many sad stories in the papers, and in every one of them, it is the public that steps in automatically to offer financial aid and donations. Never have I read about gov helping these unfortuante souls!<br><br>===================================================<br>Readers offer help to woman dying of cancer<br>'Her plight touched us deeply'<br>By Maureen Koh<br><br>January 07, 2007<br><br>IT was a story about a mother's love that touched many hearts.<br><br>Madam Leong seen here with her 5-year-old son, is grateful for the help she has been offered. -- MOHD ISHAK<br>Madam Lena's struggle to bring up her three children struck a chord with readers who got to know about her ordeal through a report in The New Paper on Sunday last month.<br><br>She is suffering from terminal brain cancer and is going blind.<br><br>So far, more than 20 people have offered help to the family through their welfare counsellor.<br><br>For instance, a group of professionals working in a top accounting firm said they wanted to help set up an education fund for her children, aged 5, 15, and 17. Some readers also offered to adopt the children should anything happen to Madam Lena, 38.<br><br>She told The New Paper: 'It's such a beautiful feeling. We're so grateful to the many kind souls.'<br><br>Businessman Larry Lew, 48, visited her at her flat on Christmas Day.<br><br>The father of two young boys said: 'Madam Lena is a very strong woman, I was very touched when I read about her experience.'<br><br>DONATIONS<br>He added: 'I was shocked by the deplorable state of her flat and I really feel sorry for them.'<br><br>He brushed aside his $200 contribution, saying: 'It was to buy a present each for the children. Madam Lena needs long-term help, not a one-off donation.'<br><br>Yet that sum brought immense joy to the children. Said Madam Lena: 'I gave $30 to Gerald (elder son) to get what he wanted. He took advantage of the festive sale to buy a pair of jeans for Tim (younger son). I could also finally afford to buy a satchel bag for Crystal.'<br><br>Said Crystal: 'Yes, I was so happy because I had been using the old bag for the past two years even though the strap had come off.'<br><br>Another kind soul was Mr Jackie Ng who has contributed $1,500, the highest sum so far.<br><br>He said he would like to continue donating money towards Crystal's education.<br><br>Arrangements for funding the children's education are being worked out.<br><br>Social worker Valerie Oh from the Family Service Centre, which is helping to manage the finances for the family, said: 'We've asked Crystal (Madam Lena's eldest child) to furnish details of the expenses necessary to see her through her tertiary education.'<br><br>Ms Oh, 27, said this would give the donors an idea about how much they need to contribute.<br><br>She added: 'At this critical point, whatever donation that has come in will be used to pay outstanding arrears. The offers of help, however, are timely given the start of the new school term.'<br><br>SOCIAL SUPPORT<br>For Crystal, the unexpected kind acts have come as a relief.<br><br>She said: 'I'd become so used to the taunting from classmates because of my situation. Now, I've realised that there is still love around us.'<br><br>But it had not been easy to make Madam Lena tell her story. 'I did it because now I'm more emotionally stable. I'd hoped that my story would encourage those who are in despair. Remember, no matter how tough life may be, don't ever give up. Always think of your loved ones.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do you even expect the government to help the down and out? The "govern-ment" is a administrative tool that the elite class uses to "govern" the other classes of people. If the elite class feels there is no benefit to helping a certain class of society, or preceive any drawback in ignoring it, then that class of society won't be helped. Without any social mobilization, what special "powers" do the other classes of society have that can impel the elite class to do anything and therefore why should the elite class do anything for anyone else? There's a difference between being progressive minded and being idiotically naive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the possible reasons for the government inability to help are<br><br>1. the family refusal to ask for help<br>2. the number of red tapes that the family had to go through before being given the help<br>3. the amount given is too little to be of any assistance<br>4. the government refusal to help unless the family help themselves eg. work bouns given only if you are working<br>5. the government think that everything is OK.<br></div>
