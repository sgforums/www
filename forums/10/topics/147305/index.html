            <div class='col-md body'>foreign investment?......One thing i find it very strange,why must the government keep on raising the cost of living so fiercely n trying every means to alter the CPF withdrawing regulations so as to "lock" our money inside the CPF board,are they losing alot of money in foreign investments?[]<br>[]<br>Let me elaborate further.....If let say i am a boss n setup a company,if let say my company is doing well,i will of coz generously raise the salary of my workers n year of end bonus.But conversely,if my company is not doing well,then i will have to cut the pay of my workers or even retrench them.If let say my company is doing fine n yet i cut the paid of my workers n bonus,that will mean that i am a "miser boss",which we rarely met in reality.[]<br><br>From what i observed of those ministers n government linked companies doings,they keep on retrenching workers or cut the pay n invite foreign workers to work in the GLC so as to cut the cost of expenditure.All these make me feel that the government are actually losing alot of money in foreign investments.Otherwise,they have no reason to raise the cost of living n yet retrenching workers without any logical explanation!!![]<br>[]<br>Of coz,if the government is earning money n yet doing all this dirty retrenching thing,then our ministers might be so-called "miser ministers".But no matter what is the reason,both scenerio will lead to bad reputation of our ministers.So,what is the god damn reason for our government to retrench n employ foreign workers so as to cut cost.Are our government linked companies earning money or losing money in foreign investment,post ur view here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The last I heard about Tamasek Holdings treasure chest was - Tamasek has more than $50 billion cash (not including assets) stashed in the bank.<br><br>It really hurts to think that PAP Government is not sharing so much of their wealth with ordinary Singaporeans.<br><br>They sucked all our savings through HDB, CPF, all sorts of taxes, high PUB charges,ERP, COE etc..   and hundreds of miscellaneous taxes like GST...<br><br>Only people who benefitted from Tamasek's wealth are the the big bosses, MPs ,  ministers, foreigners.  They get big directors fees, bonuses and massive GLC company  share options.<br><br>The real people who contributed to Tamasek Holdings fortune DO NOT GET TO ENJOY even a small portion of it.<br><br>And PAP dare to call this a just and equal society !

When the new fuel - 'kerosene' - was discovered in the 19th Century, many of the whalers were skeptical to the new challenge, which finally overwhelmed the whalers to the benefit of the whales in our ocean.<br><br>Who will benefit when our refinery complex shuts down, as the New Fuel become the STAR PERFORMER ?<br><br></div>
