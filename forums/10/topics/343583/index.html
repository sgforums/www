              <p>Noted I was born in Australia and a Australian citizen. I
              just feel that you are looking down to Australia, just
              because you couldn't apply for a PR or wasn't given a chance
              to. You shouldn't tell others not to go to Australia.</p>
              <p>Students who go overseas to study in the US, Canada, UK,
              Australia and other countries go to further their
              education. It's up to them whether they want to get PR or
              not. It all depends whether you do well for that english test
              (forgot what's it's called - only for international students).</p>

              <p>singapore has shortage of workers in the lower end of the working sector, so need to import foreigners. But again , there is no discrimination in singapore, for hiring them. Unlike Aus, which ask for PR.</p>

              <p>Even experienced professionals like Doctors, Judges, and Registered Nurses have to go through the rigorous processes involved in getting PR.  One Migration Agent from Singapore even told me how this Singapore Judge who has written countless legal books and is highly regarded in the Singapore Judiciary had to go through the IELTS exam as well when he decided to retire in Australia!  No one is exempted from the at times horrible rules and ridiculous regulations of the Immigration Dept here.  But you know what... nobody here forces people to apply.  If you choose to apply, you'll just have to meet their requirements.</p>
              <p>I know of lots of Singaporeans who faced the same angst you have when we first migrated here.  But we have slowly, in our own ways, learnt to deal with it.  The thing is, if you choose to visit someone's house and stay there, you don't go around tearing their curtains down and re-decorating their place.  Sure initially you will fret and complain and whinge, but in the end, what matters is that you roll up your sleeves, have dinner together, and then help wash the plates as well.  We do our part to integrate.  It's not a perfect place to be - I don't think Utopia exists anywhere here on earth.  But since we have chosen to come, we make-do with whatever we have, and try to make the best of it.  If we really cannot tolerate things here, no one is stopping us from packing up and going. </p>
              <p>So the issue is, unlike back in Singapore where you have the rights of citizenship and can kpkb, over here, you can kpkb all you want and no one will really bother to listen.  PR is a privilege and the country has the right to issue or refuse your application for whatever reason, reasonable or otherwise.  The entitlement mentality that is nurtured in Singapore soil won't hold here. </p>
              <p>Say, what do you think you have to offer to Australia that they die-die HAVE to issue you a PR without you having to lift a finger anyways?!  I have paid an astronomical amount in taxes since I've arrived here, and I'm a professional with years of experience under my belt and yet, the onus still remains on them if they will issue me with a PR or not because very simply put, I'm not on home soil so I'm subject to their laws.</p>
