              <p>your dad got Gordon Blue, or Hennesy XO inside the store room or not? check from the bottom of the bottle, if it is not clowdy, then it is worth lots of money. I once sold 2 bottles, don't know how old already, the boxes full of cockcroach shits, but $450 per bottle of 750ml type.</p>
              <p>Singapore too hot too humid, have to buy wine refrigerator. Check again, clowdy throw away. not clowdy can send over to me. I prefer Italian and French then Australian, no offence. don't keep or feed dogs.</p>

              <p>Why do you blame them for having stringent PR rules..?</p>
              <p>And why do u compare it to their international students program in their universities...?</p>
              <p>I think your conclusion is very illogical. There is nothing unethical or hypocritical about it.</p>
              <p>They want to attract international students for their own benefit, to fund their universities, raise their profiles, and produce other trickle down benefits. It benefits them and suits them, so why not. PR is another thing, they have the right to implement whatever rules they want to. It is never promised or included in the package that when you are an international student you can get PR easier.</p>

              <p>Even so, Australia has far more opportunities than you can find in Singapore.</p>

              <p>individual countries have their own strength and weaknesses. as you have seen in germany, and many other places. but in this modern age with concept of being a global citizens and ever more increasing individual rights and dream to expand beyond ones' own country, the sg govt should adapt to the modern world of thinking and accomodate the changes, instead of oppressing independent opinions and voices. i still feel pap govt is a stumbling block to the advancement of sgporeans, both in individual and in society.</p>
