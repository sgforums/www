Don't jump into conclusion like that.<br><br>What Caramon meant was the declined in ownership of vehicles had dropped tremendously.  The scraping of vehicles were resulted due to many bankruptcies where people failed to sustain their monthly instalment; why scrape??? Cos, who wants to buy their second cars with high COE, and without enforcement of scraping it, how are these poor people going to settle with their outstanding loans? the ball may roll bigger and bigger!!!<br>Majority of the average income who owns cars were the worst hit.<br><br>Many rich people scraped their vehicles too and in exchange for getting new vehicles with lower COE and interest rates; these are common sense!!!<br><br>Look around all HDB carparks nowaday; then you will understand why COE biding had been dropping so much.  This is one of the major factor.<br><br>And in TV News today also reported that vehicles ownerships have been declining too. The gov are not stupid to release more quota of vehicles and to allow decrease of COE price if people are still rich enough to afford.<br><br>Although the government had promised to reduce the import tax and others but they(gov) are getting people to pay more in other means.  The gov are not that kind to help we the citizens lah...; ultimately, they will suck more blood from us for their own good. </div></blockquote>As stated earlier, the changes in the vehicle structure recently and the lower COE encourage scraping of cars. Not because of bankrupcies or other reason that you maybe thinking of.<br><br>FACT1: Average scrap car a month recently ~ 9000 (Dec04 - 9772, Nov04 - 9330).

If you own a car and do your sums, you will know very well why it makes sense to scrap the car now. My brother just ordered his new car and his4 years car will be scrap in 2 months when he receive his new car. So does his friend who is ordering his new car and scrapping his 3 years car. So, stop saying the scrapping of cars is due to whatever factors you believe it to be. There are many reasons for people to scrap cars. Bankruptcy may be one. But in this case, it is definately not the main cause of the number of scrap car. In fact, it's impact on the number of scrap car may not be even noticable at all compared with the toal number of scrap car.<br><br>Also, I had heard this rumour of dropping population of cars as well from a friend who heard from another friend. But a simple check with LTA (as shown above) shows that the car population is still increasing, though it may be increasing slower than before. And ohh.. if you want to tell me your car park being empty, the car park in my area is still full every night. I live in Woodlands in case you are wondering and I don't think the people here are rich in any way.<br><br>The point I am making is that if you want to complain, complain about the right things and don't pull unrelated figures together. Because going by the author's logic, it seems that raising cost is a good thing. If you like, complain about your salary not increasing. I have no problem with that. But please don't complain that the price is not increasing. I hate it when people complain that the housing price is down, car price is down etc. For me a good economy is when all these prices are down while my salary is going up. Not one where salary is going up but cost goes up even faster. Now, which is better, pay go up 2%, inflation 4% or pay stagnent inflation -1%?</div>
