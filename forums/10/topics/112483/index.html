            <div class='col-md body'>The once bankrupt and restructured KENAIR travel has again gone into closure, a well known travel agency that existed for 35 years ....<br><br>Go around any kopi-tiam, you will see many old folks selling packets of tissue and collecting empty soft-drink cans as their main souce of income..<br><br>In HDB estates, the situation is even more terrible. So many shops have closed down. Sole proprietor are dividing their small HDB shop into four microscopic parts and letting them out for a measy few hundred dollars, just to substain their rent..<br><br>Savings in the bank doesn't yield as much interest as in the past.. The advice from our parents that keeping money in the bank for our future doesn't apply to our kids.. its not a people's bank as proclaim any more, with 2 dollars deduction for accounts less than 500, and some bank 1000..<br><br>Go to Jalan Besar, China town and you will see the Living wretched old man lives by scrapping and sleeving off old electrical wires of appliances to sell the copper as scrap,cutting out old carton boxes to sell etc...<br><br>They struggle just to earn enough money for a days meal. It is a day to day survivor for many peasants out there.. everything seems to be going down-hill..  It doesn't help with our very own propaganda state controlled sh*t times, where information is often doctored, and people are mis-inform of whats the real situation..<br><br>We can see many tents being put up at east coast, where those poor peasants call it their home.. something that does not happen in the past..Look around your neighbourhood blocks at night. See how many flats remain dark.. With many unemployed, bankruptcy is at a record high..<br><br>All is definately not well with sinkaporeans.. But NO.. many still live in self denial mode and put on blinkers of cosmetic to show... With only a small minority who flash their high lifestyle, it is often depicted as the lifestyle of the general sinkapore population as a whole...<br></div>
