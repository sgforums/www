Likewise, malaysia have got many disasters free areas too.  Your comparing is out of what Caramon is viewing in this forum.<br><br>Neither I am patriotic. Lately I've been quite disappointed with things are getting on now.  Just look at our wages are being down graded since the financial crisis till today.  I've been observing many families with total take home pay of <strong>S$2000 or S$2500 </strong>and below and with two or three three kids and at their primary school level now. (mind you not secondary school yet)<br>Now, let me ask you guys, if you were to fall into these less fortunate family....what is your feeling???<br>Every new day, you are face with pressure of water, elect, gas bills, housing instalments if you have insufficient fund in CPF, property tax, conservancy charges, sanitation charges, personal expenses, household expenses, garments, monthly hair cutting expenses, education fees, school transportations, children daily needs and school allowances, medical expenses, insurance, 5%GST, TV licence, food expenses, telephone bills and etc..... and even you have pay to have salt for your cooking!!!<br>These are the basic requirements in live here!!!<br>These families will left with no extra money for other entertainment except confine themselves at home and watch watching TV programmes or strolling at nearby their homes.  Don't talk about extra tuitorial lessons if you still wanted to have your children to cope up with their studies and obtain good results; if both parents are working with that sort of income. And if your children are still small, who is going to care for both you when both of you are working?<br><br>So...my words of advice. Please don't tell people off !!! Just becoz you maybe the more fortunate ones here in Sinagpore.<br>Most people don't just bring things out with no evidence or facts.  Please be more compassionate!!!<br><br>So I don't mind people to thrown temper or anger in this forum here; in fact is good for them to release their frustration.<br><br>For what I have observed, people with fourties and above with secondary level to A-level or diploma holders are worst hits of among all. Most of them have family with two to three kids to support or maybe even supporting their old parents.<br><br>Our leaders claimed that no body will be left out with advancement in  economy...but in reality of the above less fortunate families these are what happening now.  ERS??? eventually goes to GST so what benefits do they (less fortuante) get from the futher improvement of our economic?<br><br>No doubt, our securities are good. But a little dot with only 40 kilometres in total lenght and if our police cannot manage;then something must be very wrong with our security system.<br><br>All I wish ard earnestly hope that our Government would review and redesign the job requirements for people at age of fourties and above.  Don't forget, they are the people are bringing up the next generation which is an asset of our "great Singapore"!!!  Isn't it ??? What you guys have to say about it?<br><br></div>

Many ppl, esp those in their 40s, who used to earn $3,000 to $5,000 per month had lost their jobs.

They are also young and grew up in the "golden age" of Singapore and thus think a world of Singapore.<br><br>I tend to agree that the golden age of Singapore is over. Many ppl, esp those in their 40s, who used to earn $3,000 to $5,000 per month had lost their jobs. They were told that their jobs were gone for good and advised to "change their mindsets" and accept lower paid jobs. And what are those lower paid jobs available? Mainly cleaners and taxi drivers!<br><br>Previously the starting pay for grad was around $2,000 to $3,000, now, $1,500 to $2,500. And the employment landscape has been challenging.<br><br>So, with ppl losing jobs and getting lower pay and CPF contribution is not considered regression, what then is, languishing like the tsunami victims?<br><br>cheers!</div></blockquote>dear pearlie,<br><br>Yes.. But sadly, most singaporean choose to look only at face value... they can't differentiate what's truely wrong in singapore..<br><br>With post like this, most forumers think its bull-sh*t, they only look things at<br>surface.. when in fact we are not progressing at all.. all those talk of working towards swiss standard of living is pretentious, it was never fulfill... and some forumers still thought low COE is good... yes.... it is good if you only look at surface... But you can't deny the fact that why its so LOW....<br><br>How many graduates was face with unemployment , when their places was taken up by FT ?  They emphasis on education, but was given a tight slap in terms of employment...<br><br>A land of opportunity should be one when people are improving their lifes... Sad but true, its happening in singapore, where we call it our home....<br><br>Caramon</div>

Don't jump into conclusion like that.<br><br>What Caramon meant was the declined in ownership of vehicles had dropped tremendously.  The scraping of vehicles were resulted due to many bankruptcies where people failed to sustain their monthly instalment; why scrape??? Cos, who wants to buy their second cars with high COE, and without enforcement of scraping it, how are these poor people going to settle with their outstanding loans? the ball may roll bigger and bigger!!!<br>Majority of the average income who owns cars were the worst hit.<br><br>Many rich people scraped their vehicles too and in exchange for getting new vehicles with lower COE and interest rates; these are common sense!!!<br><br>Look around all HDB carparks nowaday; then you will understand why COE biding had been dropping so much.  This is one of the major factor.<br><br>And in TV News today also reported that vehicles ownerships have been declining too. The gov are not stupid to release more quota of vehicles and to allow decrease of COE price if people are still rich enough to afford.<br><br>Although the government had promised to reduce the import tax and others but they(gov) are getting people to pay more in other means.
