All that is is speculation by economists, and a corrected news article on CNA because MOM said it was some 10-20% less than the quoted figure. Mind you, during a period of one year, 66% of jobs created went to foreigners. By no means is this a small sum.</div>

If the FT comes here and takes a job that a Singaporean could provide with the same capability, this is blatant discrimination and not acceptable.<br><br>If the FT in question comes here and settle down, fine. At least he adds to the population numbers and contributes to the economy.<br><br>If the FT here in question provides a service that no one here can, that is also fine. At least the service he provides contributes to the benefit of the locals indirectly.<br><br>Remember that our small economy does not allow us to soak up foreigners like a sponge like the US or Europe.

You receive subsidized education and medical care, not the FT. You get subsidized housing, not the FT.
