Does the enviroment and policies play no role?<br><br>The government created a scholar-elite culture that places more importance in getting academic results than developing other skills. This indirectly shapes how parents bring up their child, the peer expectation of their children. I think its quite rare to hear someone aspiring to strike out on their own.<br><br>The other thing is the cost of doing small business in Singapore. Its quite costly to advertise in the Straits times because it has no competition for classified ads.(The price of state control press). Billboards in some obscure unknown area can cost up to $900-$1200 a month in Singapore. In Taiwan where billboard are plastered all over the country, it is definitelymuch cheaper. Business broadband used to cost $150/month. In Taiwan, it would have been easier to access wireless broadband at $18 a month.<br><br>I forgot to add shipping on express parcels are much cheaper in both Taiwan and Japan.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>You do not sack people on a whim, especially since classification of whether an FT is 'better' than a local is subjective. And if you do, and by your arguments, then there are plenty of people in SG that deserve the sack. Yet they are still holding onto their jobs. </strong></blockquote>You do not sack people on a whim, it's based on their performance and value to the organization. I cannot speak for the bosses who still want to keep their deadwood floating around but these companies will lose out eventually in the rat race. The economy will prune them away.<br><br><blockquote>Did the radiologists get sacked after the hospital 'experts' decided bangalore specialists could read and diagnose X-rays better than locals? Or did they get a <strong>job re-alignment</strong> and be re-assigned to other duties? </blockquote>It is not true that bangalore radiologists are better, but they are cheaper and can provide an acceptable level of quality.With the business gone to India, the government does not need so many radiologists, so recruitment is cut down. Existing radiologists undergo re-training to handle higher value work such as therapeutic radiolology. If anyone is unable to upgrade and switch to a new field, they will not be able to find a job and have to go further afield where their skills are still needed.<br><br><blockquote>Surely such high-earners eating away company funds, doing less than satisfactory results compared to mainland Indians who are paid a fraction of their wages should be immediately shown the door? </blockquote>If the boss is like Shtterbug, he will keep them as a matter of principle. He can run his business anyway he likes, but those who are not competitive will be pushed out eventually.<br><br><blockquote>Isn't it more likely some people are simply better than others in certain fields? Should we then sack all the locals and outsource FTs based on this warped assessment?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></blockquote>This is business, not charity. If you are a talented singer but not good with figures, you have no place working as an accountant. Employers don't care about how good you are in 'certain fields'. If your area of expertise is not needed for the business, why should anyone care?</div>

I heard the argument that it is  related to the fact that most websites surfed at in the US and possibly Europe rather than in Singapore. Not sure about that but I think with more competition prices will drop.

There is always something they lack, be it language barrier or a willingness to do overtime.<br><br>Even the stone-cold managers i knew went soft when they had to handle people who couldn't cope with the new changes; they preferred to isolate them in the hopes that they resign on their own, a simple but effective ploy.<br><br>The other alternative is to absorb the MVC of locals who are underperforming as a warning to buck up or ship out.<br><br>The only real reason why people are terminated with immediate effect is either pure incompetence or violation of company policies.<br><br>Otherwise, the reason why terminations are rare, is simply because it's the hardest thing to do, especially if the grounds are contentious.
