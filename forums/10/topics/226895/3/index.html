That is common sense and is happening in every field. Indian radiologists can read plain X-rays as well as our doctors, so we outsource these X-rays to Bangalore. Our radiologists have to undertake higher value work in therapeutic radiology or be jobless. That's a fact of life. If that happens to the highly trained medical specialist, what makes the ITE graduate so special that he should be exempted from the realities of the global economy?<br></div></blockquote>You do not sack people on a whim, especially since classification of whether an FT is 'better' than a local is subjective. And if you do, and by your arguments, then there are plenty of people in SG that deserve the sack. Yet they are still holding onto their jobs.<br><br>Why this strange phenomenon?<br><br>Did the radiologists get sacked after the hospital 'experts' decided bangalore specialists could read and diagnose X-rays better than locals? Or did they get a <strong>job re-alignment</strong> and be re-assigned to other duties?<br><br>Surely such high-earners eating away company funds, doing less than satisfactory results compared to mainland Indians who are paid a fraction of their wages should be immediately shown the door?<br><br>Isn't it more likely some people are simply better than others in certain fields? Should we then sack all the locals and outsource FTs based on this warped assessment?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think anyone who has come out of his/her shell and seen the world has seen lots......try running a business yourself where you have to worry where the next business deal is going to come from.....<br><br>When you are employee, you worry only about your own specfic scope of work. When you run your own business, you have to take care of logistics, accounts, sales, marketing, everything....<br><br>Yeah I've worked overseas and done some business with overseas companies as an employee and employer....<br><br>I'd say this to Sillyporeans....buck up or get eaten by FTs....yes we all need a helping hand and what we as business people do is try to create jobs for employees like you..but fact of the matter is life is getting tough here....IF you say you are employee, think for a moment where your company gets the money to pay your salary...think very hard...<br><br>We don't agree with the gahmen and that I do agree....but what can you do...speak up more, incite a riot, break into the MPs' homes and steal their money, act like robin hood.....C'mon get real....Yes its human to complain but stop after a while and work for your own success instead of griping about how much MPs earn...why don't you run for parliament????<br><br>Sillyporeans, when will they ever learn that its tougher in Vietnam, China, Thailand.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Ministry of Manpower isn't doing anything coz they r not the ones who tinker with policies. They just regulate labour. If anything must be done, I think it will be if written to the Prime Minister's Office.<br><br>However, if your letter is just to complain about your job being taken over by an FT, you can forget about them sitting up to take note.<br><br>However, if you not only can highlight the problem AND propose viable alternatives to solve the problem and highlight the potential benefits of your proposals, it might get you notices lor.......
