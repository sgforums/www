            <div class='col-md body'>my anyhow translation for non-chinese ppl.<br><br>I lost my job again. I am a true blooded Singapore, graduated from ITE as a Computer Technician. I worked from an apprentice for 10 years till foreman position. Even my wage was as low as a thousand plus, I couldn't compete against foreign talent. Their wages and costs are dirt cheap, willing to work long hours. Something that locals cannot accomplish.<br><br>When they arrived, they know nuts about anything. Our boss ordered us to train them, teach them and when they mature in their skills, it will be our turn to be jobless. Locals lost in demanding higher wages, shorter work hours. Our employers simply pay the tax. No wonder they favour foreigners over locals .<br><br>Using locals to train foreigners and promoting them to replace local talents is simply cold blooded. I don't know if the government is aware of the situation. Singaporean jobs are robbed by foreigners. China chinese and indians especially. Their cheap wages, have become an recruitment attraction for employers till they even allowing them to acquire training in ITE. Once they attain their NTC3 certification, they can milk them for all their worth.<br><br>Hence, I don't understand why the government do not put a control to the number of foreign talents, but letting local companies have such ease in employing foreign workers. Now employers are smart, they used Singaporeans to help companies recruit from Malaysian, China, India, etc. We complaint to the Ministry of Manpower, and their response was they could do nothing to restrict local companies from employing foreigners to replace local workers.<br><br>And the government is pushing people to upgrade themselves, taking up courses and yet they release working permits to foreigners like a machine gun. Isn't this contradictory? Somebody suggested reducing CPF contributions to retain our rice bowls, but if we do that, how will workers have enough money to buy flats, retire or pay for our medical expenses?<br><br>Rather than cutting down on CPF contributions, why not increase the cost for employing foreigners. Or, requiring a minimal number of local employees in a company before allowing them to employ foreigners? As of now, Manpower isn't taking this situation seriously enough.</div>

He said his current salary is only $1000 plus only, yet he can't compete with foreign talents, he said foreign talents are cheap and work long hours, which Singaporeans aren't able to do.<br><br>When these "foreign talents" came, they know nothing about computer servicing, they were told by the boss to teach these "foreign talents", the day the foreign talents master his skills, he became redundant (retrenched). He said we loss on salary, working hours and CPF.<br><br>He said companies who use this tactic of employing locals to teach "foreign talents", then after imparting their skills to these foreign talents, retrench him, are despicable. He wonders if the government took notice of such situations. (I think they too busy counting how much they will be taking home next year, where got time.) He said this is how Singaporeans lose their jobs to "foreign talents".<br><br>He said he doesn't know why the government instead of controlling the influx of "foreign talents", made the hiring process easier through liasing with ministry of manpower. He said nowadays Singaporean bosses are smart, they use Singapoeans to hire foreign workers. He lodge a complain with the Ministry of Manpower, their reply was, they cannot restrict the any companies from hiring foreign workers.<br><br>He said government keep asking Singaporeans to go for skills upgrading, on the other hand gives out more employment passes to foreign workers, isn't it contradictory. He said someone suggested cutting our CPF rate to make it more competitive, but such measures would affect Singaporeans ability to pay for housing, medical treatment and retirement during old age.<br><br>He said instead of reducing CPF rates, why not just increase the foreign workers levy. He suggest that every company that employs foreign workers must have a certain number of Singaporeans working there, at this moment, he said monitoring within this area is lacking from the ministry.<br><br></div>

Their policies are the real reason for the widening of income gap.<br><br>And because they failed to create an enviroment to grow the local SME, Singapore is over reliant on MNCs to create jobs unlike countries like Taiwan and South Korea.

            <div class='col-md body'>If foreigners can pick up the skill in a couple of months and do the job as well, you have to show your boss why you deserve a higher salary. This story just goes to show that we have to constantly upgrade our skills. Foreign workers may know nuts when they first started, not because they are dumb but because they lack the training opportunities available in Singapore.<br><br>Knowing well that you are training these foreign workers to take over your job, you should be undergoing trainng yourself to take over your supervisor's job. The other point in this story is that it is not just about salary. The writer admitted that foreign workers are willing to work much longer hours. If you are not able to do more and still insist on working shorter hours, employers will go for foreigners. If the government bans all foreign workers, employers will move their businesses elsewhere and Singaporeans will lose more.</div>
