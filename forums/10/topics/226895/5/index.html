            <div class='col-md body'><strong>If foreigners can pick up the skill in a couple of months and do the job as well, you have to show your boss why you deserve a higher salary. This story just goes to show that we have to constantly upgrade our skills. Foreign workers may know nuts when they first started, not because they are dumb but because they lack the training opportunities available in Singapore.<br><br>Knowing well that you are training these foreign workers to take over your job, you should be undergoing trainng yourself to take over your supervisor's job. The other point in this story is that it is not just about salary. The writer admitted that foreign workers are willing to work much longer hours. If you are not able to do more and still insist on working shorter hours, employers will go for foreigners. If the government bans all foreign workers, employers will move their businesses elsewhere and Singaporeans will lose more.</strong><br><br>sorry i dont buy the story from the govt. cmpany that choose to invest in singapore should know we are never able to compete salary with country like china , malaysia and thailand. and yet they still come here because of our political stability, low crimes, ease to conduct business. with such great advantages why do we still need to lower our wages to compete with foreign worker. govt just give in to the investor and employers too easily. to make matter worse, our unions are on the side of the govt.<br><br></div>
