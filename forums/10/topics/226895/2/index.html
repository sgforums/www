The other point in this story is that it is not just about salary. The writer admitted that foreign workers are willing to work much longer hours. If you are not able to do more and still insist on working shorter hours, employers will go for foreigners.

They are not charities after all. But likewise, businesses are not daft. If a local can contribute more to the business financially despite his higher pay, he is still valued.<br><br>The CEO of Morgan Stanley has been given millions of dollars as bonus this year. Why not hire someone cheaper? Because he can bring in billions to the company.<br><br>So you agree that if the local worker is more productive than the foreigner despite his higher pay, it doe snot make sense to replace him. Of course that's right! If the local employee can add more value than the foreign worker, which employer would want to get rid of him? Any business who looks only at the manpower cost without regard to the productivity of the workforce will ultimately lose out in the competitive economy. The fact is, the local employee in question probably does not add more value compared to the cheaper foreign worker.<br><br>Btw, employers need not inform employees that if the new foreign worker can perform as well as they do, their jobs would be in jeopardy. That is common sense and is happening in every field. Indian radiologists can read plain X-rays as well as our doctors, so we outsource these X-rays to Bangalore. Our radiologists have to undertake higher value work in therapeutic radiology or be jobless. That's a fact of life. If that happens to the highly trained medical specialist, what makes the ITE graduate so special that he should be exempted from the realities of the global economy?<br><br></div>

There are those who would say that you should not train the new foreign worker then. If that happens, it will create a new industry: companies that provide training for foreign workers. The local worker who is a quick entrepreneur will find that he will not only have a job but a better one.</div>
