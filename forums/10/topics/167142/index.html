But then I was always of the opinion that Singapore govt placed a little too much emphasis on that.<br><br>What was good however was that they interviewed Fong Swee Suan and showed the videos of Lim Chin Siong's public speeches, as well as making mention of Operation Coldstore. All these will not be present in a local video on teh History of Singapore; FOng Swee Suan will definitely not be a source a local documentary-maker would put in his documentary, for fear of having his film labelled as a "political film".<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

It didn't elaborate or I may have missed it. However, it also said that since Singapore had managed to solve those challenges in the past, we should be able handle those same challenges in the future.<br><br>IMO, the past challenges was solved by the colonial rulers. They promoted free trade and build up the country from scratch.  When the current govt took over from the colonial rulers, they create new set of problems which they have to solve.<br><br>What if LKY has not fight for independence? Would we face those problems that arises after independence? Would we need to merge with Malaysia if we have no desire to be independent? Which lead to the chain of events that cause the racial riots.<br><br>IMO, if we have continued to let the Bristish govern the country, we wouldn't be much different like Hong Kong now.  Free trade will still be the order of the day as compared to now where 60% of the businesses are state controlled.<br><br>However, kudos should still be accorded to the current ruling party for providing housing and finding jobs for the people together with tight social control.</div>
