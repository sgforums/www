Also,I doubt if simulators can reproduce certain things such as the Gs of high-speed air combat... this means that flying the actual aircraft to combat will be a different feeling for the pilot ... the stress and pressure is also much higher in actual flying, especially combat, and all these will mean extensive training for the pilots before they go to war.<br><br>and to Oirschwarrior:<br>Of course no theres no offence taken, dun worry.  i'll go check again but thanks for pointing out a mistake...</div>

Obviously, you don't know what you are talking about.<br><br>When it comes down to dogfight (I presume this is what you are talking about when you said "one to one situation", the flight paremeter is usually in the high subsonic (or transonic, eg. Mach 0.8-1.0 about 600kt). No one will start fighting dogfights above Mach 1.4 and certainly not in the Mach 2.3 region.<br><br>Furthermore, MiG 29 Mach 2.3 is a a quoted speed of a clean Mig at high attitude doing a quick dash (probably with full afterburner). You won't see MiG 29 doing too many Mach 2.3 flying. And F-5E (or S version for Singapore) top (dash) speed is Mach 1.63 and not 1.2.<br><br>Either case, all these figures mean nothing except when a fighter is seriously in trouble and trying to escape (if a heat seeking missiles (Mach 2.5-3.0) haven't got to their hot afterburner jet nozzle first) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>All in all, given a very experience F5 pilot and a pretty inexperience MiG29 pilot on a WVR dogfight, I think they will be equally match if F5 is also carrying off-boresight missiles and the pilot is wearing HMS. In terms of airframe, both F5 and MiG 29 can stress up to 7Gs only and thus, tactics and who has the first look and first thumb on the button win.<br></div>

Stop humiliating yourself and talking rubbish if you don't know your facts lah. Nobody in their right minds will compare R-73s with Sparrows. Thats like comparing apples and oranges. R-73 is a within-visual-range, agile heat seeking IR missile while Sparrow is a med-to-long range Semi active radar homing beyond visual range missile. They were designed for totally different roles and operating in totally different parameters. The closest thing the MiGs have to a Sparrow is the R-27 (AA-10 Alamo) which is also a BVR med-to-long range SARH AAM, which to be honest, has performance specs and kill ratio more akin to the Vietnam era Sparrows rather than the much more modern AIM-7M Singapore uses.<br><br>Get your facts right</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by brotherlone:<br><br>About MiG-29 vs f-16 or f5 its a grey issue , no point giving blind statements<br>[/b]</blockquote>It seems that you are very interested in the Mig29 and F16 comparison. There was this excellent article in the Air Force Monthly a while back (approx 2 to 3 years ago) precisely about comparing these 2 planes. Of course some things have changed since then including the avionics, radar capability and of course we also know that the SMT version of Mig29 has an enlarged fuel tank in the formed of an enlarged dorsal spine.<br><br>Anyway, in short, the conclusion (based on purely air to air combat since you are most interested in these area and I assumed you are not comparing them on strike roles), is that Mig29 is slightly more superior in slow speed manoeuvrability (around 400 kts),  but in the high subsonic, transonic region, F16 is more superior.  I think this also translate to F16 vs F18. I have spoken to my RSAF pilot friend about his experience fighting the Hornets, well he indicated that they usually do not slow down to fight them, the Vipers are the most potent when they have a lot of energy and their pointability being not as good as Mig29s or the Bugs / Superbugs (due to their better Alpha handling). However, with the introduction of 4 gen off-boresight WVR missiles like Python4, ASRAAM and AIM-9X, the gaps have closed so much that dogfighters today or in the future does not necessary depend on the pilots skills. It really goes down to technology and who has the first looks. It is when looks can kill really.<br><br>Thus, in an F5 vs Mig29 situation, and lets put BVR engage aside, if both are piloted by equally skilled pilots and both are carry off-boresight missiles, given say the F5 has either AIM-9X or Python 4, plus both have HMS, I think the outcome is equally matched. I think technology here play the key role, ie. the off-boresight capabilities of the missiles, the track rate of the seeker, HMS capabilities, radar capabilities and maybe a bit of tactics and a lot of luck !!!!!<br></div>

Sorry pal!, RSAF already has AIM-9S, go check the FAS site. RSAF got approval for the AIM-9S purchase in 1994. In fact we also have the AIM-9M version (not just the downgraded S version). However, the M version are all based in the US for training.<br><br>How do you know RSAF doesn't have off-boresight weapon, and please lah, stop boasting how good the Archers are. Don't forget, they are good but not THAT good. Furthermore, are you sure RMAF has HMS already? Go check your facts with a RMAF pilot. Or easier still, go and check any pics of the helmets the Mig pilots are wearing. I don't see any HMS yet!!! RMAF Migs are capable of all these but do they have it yet? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hee hee</div>

Look at your own sources in you post about Malaysian ORBAT.<br><br>Lots of photos exist of RSAF F-16s carrying AIM-7Ms and AIM-9M/S. The 4 F-16C/D which came back in 1998 carried them at the press session, they appeared at the RSAF Open House again in 1998 and 2001. Photos of RSAF F-16C/D with AIM-9M/S have appeared in publications as diverse as Janes(UK), Air Forces Monthly(UK), Combat aircraft(US), Australian Aviation(Australia), Koku Fan(Japan). A check with the horse mouth(better known as US DoD) will reveal the 1994 contract for the RSAF F-16C/D contain AIM-7M and AIM-9S<br><br>Meanwhile, I've yet to see a pic of RMAF MiG-29s carrying AA-12. Just a pathetic attempt at deception by www.aeronautics.ru by showing a MiG-29N carrying a training R-27(AA-10) and passing it off as an AA-12.<br><br>Mana ada credibility?</div>

The Mach Meter, the base newspaper of the 27th Fighter Wing USAF at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, showed a picture of a RSAF F-16 firing a AIM-7. And that was in 1999<br><br>And another magazine which carried photos of RSAF vipers with AIM-7 is Jets of France<br><br>Don't malu yourself lah...whos the one whos clueless and getting his info from the Net? *snigger*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HARIMAU, we have solid reasons, backed by verifiable proof when we state a point. We don't go around saying we have this and we have that when we don't know anything. We do not have AMRAAM in Singapore, we are not afraid to tell you that. Why hasn't USA released them to us? Because Malaysia does not have R-77s, and thus AMRAAMs are unwarranted in the region.<br><br>Now, what i want to ask you is, can you accurately identify a mock up missile from a live one? Are you qualified in any way to make such a judgement? If you can't, please do not make such groundless claims, and make it sound like you have hard facts to base your words on. I know a friend who works in the RSAF, and he is an armourer. I understand that a mock up, if painted in "live colours", is impossible to differentiate from a live one.<br><br>BTW when you are typing a reply, look for a button labelled "Img". Thats how you post a pic, read the FAQ for more info.[/img]</div>
