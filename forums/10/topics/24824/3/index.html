            <div class='col-md body'>Sure......MiG29s are cool....but are the pilots competent? And longer range weapons are not necessarily accurate. If I am not wronmg, in real combat, the AARAM was fired 4 times. Thrice by the israelis and they have to ground their entire air force to do that so that there be no other targets in the sky except enemy panes. You need superior IFF to do so. Furthermore, throughout history of missle combat, most kills are by cannons and this require pilot skill.....doubt Msian pilots are good thanz 2 shortage of flight time :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha.. about Mig-29 and F-16.. there was a news report once about a tacitical simulated air warfare between a USAF F-16 and A Germany Air Force MiG-29. This was done to see which aircraft is better in terms of air-to-air capability. In the end, the MiG-29 won the battle.. not b'cos it had superior avionics or air-to-air weapons, it depends on the pilot skills to bring the mazimum advantage out of their fighter jet. Knowing what your plane can do for u and using it, is half the battle won.<br><br>The RMAF have AA-12 Adder Medium Range missiles... i'm not too sure about russian equipment...due to the lousy quality sometimes...like the pair of Su-27 Flanker which crashed recently... it shows to tell u how bad are the maintenance on russian equipment...<br><br>I trust our RSAF has adequate training to protect our skies in times of conflict. that's what i can tell.our pilots have good training abroad, attend during schools (e.g Top Gun Academy..etc..) participate in different exercises... we have one of the best combat proven fighter jets too... the F-16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>'The MiG-29 has a few advantages over its more electronically advanced American counterparts. At about 40 miles apart, the American planes have the advantage because of avionics. At 10 miles the advantage is turning to the MiG. At five miles out, because of the MiG weapons sight and better maneuverability, the advantage is to the MiG. The weapons sight is a helmet-mounted system that allows the missile to follow the line of sight of the pilot's helmet. Where the pilot looks is where it goes'<br><br>Got this from the net<br>MiG-29 is superior , but not Malaysian MiG-29s<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of pilot technology Russian planes have the advantage. Did Malaysia accquire the Helmet Mounted Sights as part of the deal? Do they have the capability to use it to its full potential? Lastly, do they have a chance to use it at all?! The 5 miles cap of the HMS is very limiting, in aerial battles nowadays, the missiles are locked on and fired before the pilots can see each other. (note, this does not imply BVR capabilities.)</div>

You can boast about how good the system is but if it is not combat proven it is not a fully functional weapon. Remember about the Patriot Missile? It was said to be very efficient to stop the scud missile. One shot one target.

The rest will be sitting ducks or strip as spare parts.<br>Due to parts problem, maybe some of the combat ready plane cannot use afterburner burn, in case they burnt out the engine, cannot use their super duper helmet mount sight because the sensitive gadget went ko-ya and need to buy new one.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
