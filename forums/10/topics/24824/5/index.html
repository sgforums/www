            <div class='col-md body'>More from http://www.sci.fi/~fta/MiG-29-2.htm<br><br>In the Flight International (15-21 Jun94, pg 22), ex-Mikoyan Deputy Designer, Alex Velovich (see Code One, April 1993) reported from Moscow that Russian Prime Minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, has held discussions with the Chinese to overcome an impasse which has stopped the second batch buy of Su-27's. Chernomyrdin visited Beijing and tried to help negotiate on behalf of the Chinese who were stuck with a demand from the Russian State Arms Export Agency, Rosvooruzheniye, who has insisted on being paid mostly in cash (US dollars). The PLA wants a follow-on 24-26 aircraft with an eventual license for manufacture and payment based on goods-barter, not cash.<br><br>Russia's withdrawal from a "barter" or "counter-trade" solution also delayed the signing of the MiG-29 contract with the Malaysian Air Force, but it was finally signed in Kuala Lumpur on 07Jun94, by Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets with Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. According to Vladimir Kuzmin, then General Manager of the MAPO Production Plant, less than half of the value of the contract would be paid in barter goods (around 25% palm oil, clothing, &amp; fabric). The original agreement with Malaysia was worth $600 million for 18 x Fulcrums, and the Russians would honor a $220 million offset arrangement. All eighteen aircraft (16 single-seat and 2 dual-seat) will be delivered within 12 months which is why we have seen the re-start of the production line in Moscow move so quickly. This should also loom in the western leaderships mind of what could happen if the Russian nation mobilized again. The industry sits waiting, it is not dead and removed.<br><br>A no-cost pair of MiG-29's have already been provided to a joint-venture customer service center for maintenance technician training and research. A MiG-29 simulator is being produced by CAE Electronics, a Canadian company. The Malaysians are expected to get the full weapons fit for the MiG-29 and the importance of the sale has raised the possibility of helicopter and transport sales. Regionally, Mikoyan would now be in a better position to seek sales in Thailand, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.<br><br>The Malaysian MiG-29's were at first considered to be a "fat back" Fulcrum A mod 1. By the time the aircraft started delivery in July 1995 it became clear that the RMAF MiG-29's would be basic Fulcrum A (non-fatback variety), but with MiG-29S flight control, suspension, and weapon system upgrades. Unique to Malaysia is the new reliability gear box on the engines and the flight control roll limiter and rudder enhancer. Malaysia's requirement for a multi-role fighter brought in a new MiG-29 multiple-ejector rack, similar to the one seen on the MiG-25 Foxbat, that will carry four 250 of 500 kg. bombs or stores. In the air-to-ground mode, the RMAF MiG-29's utilizes laser or radar ranging for a "Dive-Toss" type solution. No pure "CCIP" or "CCRP" like modes have been seen.<br><br>In an interview with Chris Pocock (Aviation International News) at the 1995 Dubai Air Show, Kuzmin stated that all 18 Malaysian jets were delivered on time and that each aircraft has now surpassed 100 flying hours as the RMAF pilots undergo intensive training. He also said that not one negative word has been said by the RMAF HQ or MoD.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm... says a few things but not much...<br><br>a) the Russians don't like selling hardware for palm oil (who could blame them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>b) the Russian arms industry is very much alive indeed... but since Sg was never in the habit of buying Russian hardware (except for the Iglas), i don't see how that impact us directly. Our neighbours could buy all they want... it is their money. Arms have always proliferated the world from different sources.<br><br>c) the MiGs were fine and their capabilities were decent when they were delivered... it was Malaysian logistics that did them in later... how many of them are left flying again? I forgot the numbers...<br><br>Conclusion: You can buy anything from anyone, but it takes more than that to maintain your equipment. They've always seemed rather sloppy in this respect to me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Russian equipment is certainly up-to-standard these days, look at their Su-27, MiG-31 fighters and R-77 AAM.  Good stuff, but i think Malaysia lacks the ability to train their people properly.  I saw someone post in one of the threads some time ago about Malaysian pilots still having to argure about who shot who during training... not sure if its true, but if it is, it speaks volumes about their training... i'm not sure how they train their ground crew too, but i doubt it's very extensive, anyone have info about Malaysia airforce training pls comment cos i can't find training info except from forums... thanx in advance</div>

Good stuff, but i think Malaysia lacks the ability to train their people properly.  I saw someone post in one of the threads some time ago about Malaysian pilots still having to argure about who shot who during training... not sure if its true, but if it is, it speaks volumes about their training... i'm not sure how they train their ground crew too, but i doubt it's very extensive, anyone have info about Malaysia airforce training pls comment cos i can't find training info except from forums... thanx in advance</div></blockquote>Its not the capabilities of Russian equipment. Its the problem of integration with our mainly Western systems, as well as design and production philosophy. Russian equipment are generally built to lower QA standards than Western systems, and life expectancy is significantly shorter than Western equivalents. Although they are generally more rugged than Western counterparts. What it means is that maintenance costs will almost be certainly higher than Western equipment, especially over time. Add this to the costs of bringing the equipment in line with the rest of Singapore's western equipment, the higher long term costs might actually negate the initial lower start up costs, as our neighbours are finding out.</div>
