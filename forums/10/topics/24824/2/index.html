            <div class='col-md body'>OK... everyone... there was a time when i told everyone on this forum that the malaysian MIG-29N is actually a hog wash... its bullshit lah...<br><br>THe MIG-29 'N' that malaysia claimed to have recieved was reported in jane's defence magazine as actually retrofitted MIGs using the OLD OLD USED (aka... second hand) MIG-29 'A' airframe which was actually supposed to be cut down and turn to scraps......<br><br>Thanks to malaysia stingy 'barter' trading system where they force the ruskies to drink palm oil as part of the payment for the Fulcrum... the ruskies happily send malaysia fulcrums with airframes actually meant for the scrap yard!!!<br><br>As a result of that ... the RMAF FULCRUM cannot carry the R77AE missile because its airframe isnt strong enough!! and the FULCRUM needs to have its system upgraded and airframe reinforced in order to carry the R77AE... as such was the case... the RMAF fulcrum DOES NOT have BVR capability since the MIG was delivered way back in 1995... its been a 7 LONG LONG year wait... and still we see no R77!!<br><br>Unfortunately, i was not able to pinpoint the janes' defence weekly magazine issue where this news was reported... BUT lucky us... i found a similar report from the internet which i would like to share with you all.... the following are the excerpts for those too busy to visit the web page....<br><br><strong>"The Malaysian MiG-29's were at first considered to be a "fat back" Fulcrum A mod 1. By the time the aircraft started delivery in July 1995 it became clear that the RMAF MiG-29's would be basic Fulcrum A (non-fatback variety), but with MiG-29S flight control, suspension, and weapon system upgrades. Unique to Malaysia is the new reliability gear box on the engines and the flight control roll limiter and rudder enhancer. Malaysia's requirement for a multi-role fighter brought in a new MiG-29 multiple-ejector rack, similar to the one seen on the MiG-25 Foxbat, that will carry four 250 of 500 kg. bombs or stores. In the air-to-ground mode, the RMAF MiG-29's utilizes laser or radar ranging for a "Dive-Toss" type solution. No pure "CCIP" or "CCRP" like modes have been seen."</strong><br><br>the following are the web address....<br>http://www.sci.fi/~fta/MiG-29-2.htm<br><br>To have 2 non - related sources of information providing more or less the same information... clearly seems to me that the news is quite reasonably trustworthy....<br><br>THAT is... that the fulcrum that the malaysia revered sooooo... much..... is little more then a rojak plane using a second hand airframe built probably more then 15 years ago!!! and had it not been salvage... those airframe are supposedly meant to be turn to scraps!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

ADJ is a malaysian defence journal.... they very biased when it comes to reporting about malaysian military stuff...  i have been following their publishing for over 2 years liow... know it like the back of my hand....<br><br>In my view... it doesnt even qualify to be a respectable defence journal... 3/4 of the book is full of commercial bullshit from various manufacturer of defense equipment... you are not (i repeat NOT) gonna get a balance view out of that magazine....<br><br>in just one year... 12 publishing.. they can featured as many as 3 to 4 times interview with MAF!! crap .....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think overall, the RSAF will win in a battle with RMAF.  BY sheer numbers alone, Malaysia has about 37 planes to carry out intercept, while Singapore has about 87 planes for intercept.<br><br>In terms of strike aircraft as well, SIngapore has 68 A-4SU for strike (air-to-ground) attacks (should take care of the MLRS).<br><br>This is compared to Malaysia's 27 Hawk 100/200, which are normally used for training and 8 F/A-18s, which are also interceptors and have been counted above as well.<br><br>Singapore also has the E-2C which will be able to coordinate Singapore's aircraft in the air based on up-to-the-minute information.  They also buy time for Singapore's planes to scramble in event of any attack by detecting approaching enemies very early. (E-2C's tech is still classified by US).</div>

Bear the following in mind though - 1)overseas trainings with the missile doesn't count - that doesn't show malaysia has R-77s on hand. 2) No one can tell the difference between a dummy missile or an live one. Link this with the abovementioned US example.<br><br>The hawks have limited combat value and are "basic" fighters. The F/A18Ds are indeed superior to what we have, but there are only 8 of them. Do not forget that they will have to face our interceptors before they have a chance to drop their loads effectively. Put the dogfight scenario first. I still don't think the RMAF can win the RSAF in dogfights. AWACS will not be an issue as RSAF has AWACS platforms already.</div>
