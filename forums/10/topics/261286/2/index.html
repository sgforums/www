I absolutely donÂ’t agree with you.  The presence of strong government does not mean lack of democracy, prosperity, good public education and transport, security . . .  .  .    Other countries have strong government and yet they are also given democracy.

Oops, is PAP known as a good and reliable brand to the people of Singapore, we have the answer!!  Brand - a good brand will always do more and more to improve on their quality, carry out research, find out feedback from its customers and ask customers how can they improve to serve them better.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">The Constitution usually sets out the basic rights of citizens and defines the role of government and its component branches.<br><br>The constitution of Singapore however has not established or clearly defined the respective rights of citizens and government allowing the government of the day to interpret its provisions to suit its own convenience. Such vagueness therefore provides a loophole for circumventing the rights of citizens and usurping the powers of the other component branches to suit its own private agenda e.g. tweaking of right of citizens to choose the representatives of their choice by imposing Greater Representation Constituency in the election process where citizens are unable to exercise their right to vote for the individuals of their choice as candidates are required to form themselves into blocks or slates of representatives with others before they could offer themselves to stand for election.<br><br>Group representations have deprived the right of citizen to vote freely a representative of their choice in a one-man-one-vote process provided in the constitution. The GRC supersedes the basic right of citizens to elect their representatives freely or offer themselves as candidate for election in the democratic election process.<br><br>In addition, there is a lack of clear definition of roles, authority and responsibilities of the respective branches of government allows the executive to use administrative power to supersede or suppress the right of other branches of government therefore depriving the citizens of their right of proper representation.<br><br>In view of the above-stated problems and shortcomings, it is urgent to revamp the current constitution to prevent any party in power from exploiting the loopholes created by the lack of clear definitions of roles, authority and responsibilities of component branches of the government.<br><br>By defining the roles, and authority of component branches of government clearly it will then create the necessary conditions for development of social, cultural and moral character and vibrancy of its people essential to development of nationhood in the long-term interest of the nation.<br><br>Only when there is such a safeguard against abuse of power over the other equally desirable aspects of nation building will it bring about the necessary conditions supportive of development of active citizenship.<br><br>While it has often been argued that government has the right to maintain law and order but it is equally important if not more so for the government to govern with accountability and transparency to prevent wrong doings which cause instability and breakdown of law and order.<br><br>The foremost objective of the government therefore is not to suppress the people using the excuse of maintaining law and order but it is to bring about social, cultural as well as moral conditions to facilitate mass participation of citizens in all endeavors of nation building.<br><br>A good government is one which will govern the country not for their own sake but with good corporate governance critical to such nation building.<br><br>It should govern the country holistically so that it will check the abuse of power, corruptions or wrong doings for creative economic development of the nation.<br><br>In the absence of such clear definition and safeguard, it will lead to a situation of legalistic wrangling of laws and regulations resulting in over-controls, over-regulations, autocracy, tyranny to suit their own narrow agenda of staying in power using the excuse of meritocracy or pragmatism at the expense of larger aspect of nation building and stifling of creativity and enterprises of society.<br><br>In the larger long-term interest of the state or the people, it is therefore critical and urgent to revise the current constitution so as to bring about conducive conditions towards governing the country for the greatest good for the greatest number?<br><br>To do so it is essential to maintain clear overview of the basic principles or objectives of good Government.<br><br>To run a country competitively and successfully, it is essential that there government should be elected by the people through free election without affecting or usurping the unalienable and unencumbered right of citizens to elect the best individual candidates of their free choice like GRC block representation which has jeopardized the free and democratic election process.<br><br>The government is elected to carry out the following essential functions:-<br><br>(1) administration,<br>(2) legislation - passing of laws and regulations for fair and just administration,<br>(2) justice,<br>(3) maintaining a free election process to enable citizens to elect their representatives or offer themselves as candidates to stand for election,<br>(4) implementing policies and decisions in objectively defined work processes to ensure good corporate governance i.e. governance with accountability and responsibility essential to development of citizens' social, cultural and economic vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>Specifically the constitution should clearly define (a) An effective executive, (b) Independent legislature, (c ) An independent judiciary.<br><br>Each of the above-stated three component branches of government has its own critical roles and responsibilities to play. By spelling out such roles and responsibilities as well as power or authority it will then lead of development of good corporate governance to serve the greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>When such a constitution is established, it is then possible to bring about condition for citizens and government to work with cooperations, coordination and efficiency. All government policies and decisions will then gain the fullest support and participation of its citizens in nation building ?<br><br>The current vagueness due to lack of clear definition of rights and privileges of citizens and component branches of government has created a situation where the executive has accumulated too much discretionary power to pass laws and regulations to suit its own narrow agendas avoiding accountability and curtailing people's right to speak up, and participate in governing policies, appointments of government etc.<br><br>Read more about the current problems and shortcomings of the government in "20 major policy errors of government" and "review of performance of government under PM Lee Hsien Loong" as posted to the forums and the feedback unit.<br><br>With such vague and uncertain constitution will the government be able to bring about a cosmopolitan and inclusive society. Will it govern the nation for the greatest good of the greatest number?<br><br>Or will it continue to govern the country by taxing and recovering costs of government from the citizens to the fullest extent resulting in taxes being accumulated as surpluses for spending on extravagant projects like the 7 wonders or shin corp.<br><br>There is obviously more critical to balance between the need for law and order and and facilitating the conditions for full and uninhibited participation by the citizens in good corporate governance essential to competitive and vibrant development of nationhood.</div></blockquote>you think the constitution can anyhow update like your postings ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
