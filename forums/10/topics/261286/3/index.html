Who should change first - the executive who gerrymandered the existing constitution due to its vagueness or generality of provisions or the people's behavior and conduct.<br><br>We may have to argue till the cow comes home if we adopt such an approach in any arguments.<br><br>One thing is for sure though - the constitution has been rather vague about rights or citizens or definitions of respective roles and responsibilities of the three component branches of government so much so that the executive is impinging a lot into the judiciary and legislative resulting in lopsided policies being pursued to suit the narrow agendas of the ruling party.<br><br>For the long term, this may be highly undesirable as power corrupts and absolute powers corrupt absolutely.<br><br>For the above-stated facts and logics, it is essential to recognize the shortcomings and weaknesses of the current constitution and do something to set the tone and direction for better nation building. The citizens could then be influenced and mature accordingly being better guided by a more entrepreneur pro-people and pro-progress constitution.<br><br>Left to the natural development of people character and human nature it is doubtful the situation will change and any future government will simply continue to exploit whatever loopholes they could find and citizens will only suffer more.</div></blockquote>Who/which should change first, doesn't really matter, because this will lead to a better or worse Singapore.<br><br>As you've said, the constitution is vague. Since it's vague, it means either you can do it or cannot do it. Look on the brighter side, you probably can do something because the constitution is vague. On the other hand, if the government pursues, this vagueness becomes what they deem as illegal.<br><br>Trying although may harm, more harm is done when nobody bothers to try, because their words will become ultimate.<br><br>The government is not us, neither are we the government. However, collectively, both form the society, and the core of a society is her people. When people improves, so will the society. Top-down changes may be effective, but bottom-up changes are more permanent and flexible as we are not as restricted.</div>

I think you have written many times too about the need to change the constitution with proposals to institutionalize citizens' involvements in social and cultural aspect of participation and creating a youth parliament etc. These are good works for it signaled that citizens are now coming out to speak up on wrongdoings or unfair government policies one by one like the little red dots in forums.<br><br>We will need many more little red dots, for they will make the difference and even they cannot have the power to change they can paint the whole town red to make the sea change eventually happen.</div></blockquote>Robert,<br><br>Unfortunately I am almost the only one making those calls. As someone pointed out, changing the Consti is not necessarily the solution. This is because the Consti reflects what the majority of Singaporeans - swayed by "practical" considerations - believe. We need to tackle the root of the problem, which is to educate Singaporeans to have a different mindset. And thus, what we need first is a redesign of the education system.
