            <div class='col-md body'>The Constitution usually sets out the basic rights of citizens and defines the role of government and its component branches.<br><br>The constitution of Singapore however has not established or clearly defined the respective rights of citizens and government allowing the government of the day to interpret its provisions to suit its own convenience. Such vagueness therefore provides a loophole for circumventing the rights of citizens and usurping the powers of the other component branches to suit its own private agenda e.g. tweaking of right of citizens to choose the representatives of their choice by imposing Greater Representation Constituency in the election process where citizens are unable to exercise their right to vote for the individuals of their choice as candidates are required to form themselves into blocks or slates of representatives with others before they could offer themselves to stand for election.<br><br>Group representations have deprived the right of citizen to vote freely a representative of their choice in a one-man-one-vote process provided in the constitution. The GRC supersedes the basic right of citizens to elect their representatives freely or offer themselves as candidate for election in the democratic election process.<br><br>In addition, there is a lack of clear definition of roles, authority and responsibilities of the respective branches of government allows the executive to use administrative power to supersede or suppress the right of other branches of government therefore depriving the citizens of their right of proper representation.<br><br>In view of the above-stated problems and shortcomings, it is urgent to revamp the current constitution to prevent any party in power from exploiting the loopholes created by the lack of clear definitions of roles, authority and responsibilities of component branches of the government.<br><br>By defining the roles, and authority of component branches of government clearly it will then create the necessary conditions for development of social, cultural and moral character and vibrancy of its people essential to development of nationhood in the long-term interest of the nation.<br><br>Only when there is such a safeguard against abuse of power over the other equally desirable aspects of nation building will it bring about the necessary conditions supportive of development of active citizenship.<br><br>While it has often been argued that government has the right to maintain law and order but it is equally important if not more so for the government to govern with accountability and transparency to prevent wrong doings which cause instability and breakdown of law and order.<br><br>The foremost objective of the government therefore is not to suppress the people using the excuse of maintaining law and order but it is to bring about social, cultural as well as moral conditions to facilitate mass participation of citizens in all endeavors of nation building.<br><br>A good government is one which will govern the country not for their own sake but with good corporate governance critical to such nation building.<br><br>It should govern the country holistically so that it will check the abuse of power, corruptions or wrong doings for creative economic development of the nation.<br><br>In the absence of such clear definition and safeguard, it will lead to a situation of legalistic wrangling of laws and regulations resulting in over-controls, over-regulations, autocracy, tyranny to suit their own narrow agenda of staying in power using the excuse of meritocracy or pragmatism at the expense of larger aspect of nation building and stifling of creativity and enterprises of society.<br><br>In the larger long-term interest of the state or the people, it is therefore critical and urgent to revise the current constitution so as to bring about conducive conditions towards governing the country for the greatest good for the greatest number?<br><br>To do so it is essential to maintain clear overview of the basic principles or objectives of good Government.<br><br>To run a country competitively and successfully, it is essential that there government should be elected by the people through free election without affecting or usurping the unalienable and unencumbered right of citizens to elect the best individual candidates of their free choice like GRC block representation which has jeopardized the free and democratic election process.<br><br>The government is elected to carry out the following essential functions:-<br><br>(1) administration,<br>(2) legislation - passing of laws and regulations for fair and just administration,<br>(2) justice,<br>(3) maintaining a free election process to enable citizens to elect their representatives or offer themselves as candidates to stand for election,<br>(4) implementing policies and decisions in objectively defined work processes to ensure good corporate governance i.e. governance with accountability and responsibility essential to development of citizens' social, cultural and economic vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>Specifically the constitution should clearly define (a) An effective executive, (b) Independent legislature, (c ) An independent judiciary.<br><br>Each of the above-stated three component branches of government has its own critical roles and responsibilities to play. By spelling out such roles and responsibilities as well as power or authority it will then lead of development of good corporate governance to serve the greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>When such a constitution is established, it is then possible to bring about condition for citizens and government to work with cooperations, coordination and efficiency. All government policies and decisions will then gain the fullest support and participation of its citizens in nation building ?<br><br>The current vagueness due to lack of clear definition of rights and privileges of citizens and component branches of government has created a situation where the executive has accumulated too much discretionary power to pass laws and regulations to suit its own narrow agendas avoiding accountability and curtailing people's right to speak up, and participate in governing policies, appointments of government etc.<br><br>Read more about the current problems and shortcomings of the government in "20 major policy errors of government" and "review of performance of government under PM Lee Hsien Loong" as posted to the forums and the feedback unit.<br><br>With such vague and uncertain constitution will the government be able to bring about a cosmopolitan and inclusive society. Will it govern the nation for the greatest good of the greatest number?<br><br>Or will it continue to govern the country by taxing and recovering costs of government from the citizens to the fullest extent resulting in taxes being accumulated as surpluses for spending on extravagant projects like the 7 wonders or shin corp.<br><br>There is obviously more critical to balance between the need for law and order and and facilitating the conditions for full and uninhibited participation by the citizens in good corporate governance essential to competitive and vibrant development of nationhood.</div>

Yes, we have to be united!!  United we stand!<br><br>Notice that ever since that LEE HSIEN LOONG becomes the PM, many things have increased non stop.  This fellow seems to be more interested to earn lots of $$$$ rather than take good care of the people of Singapore.  He has been raising the cost of living for the people of Singapore.  Earn lots of $$$$ out of the people of Singapore to satisfy his greed.  He is only good at treating us as kids Â– love giving Â“sweetsÂ” to Â“pacifyÂ” us.  Come on, we are not 3 year old kids!  He knows that we are in no power to get him out, thus cease opportunities in his position as PM to do whatever to please himself at the expense of the nation.  CanÂ’t wait to see someone take over him!!<br><br>Hope people of Singapore will gradually vote the ruling party out of power.  The present ruling party is very protective over themselves and their own interest.  Believe they will change constitution only when they want to gain more advantages to themselves!  Probably we are just nothing to them in their hearts, we are just to be used by them for money making, using us to gain advantage to meet their selfish needs and desires.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

In the last election campaign, they did mention that Singaporeans still want the PAP to rule but at the same time want to have more oppositions in parliament.  So for this reason they are rather rest assured no matter how they will still be in power forever because Singaporeans despite the way we are treated by them still vote for them.  So from here they know how to work their way to manipulate the people.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   So I supposed this is how "sillyporeans" come about!!<br><br>It is a waste, my estate is always walkover!!</div>

The GRC supersedes the basic right of citizens to elect their representatives freely or offer themselves as candidate for election in the democratic election process."<br><br>"By defining the roles, and authority of component branches of government clearly it will then create the necessary conditions for development of social, cultural and moral character and vibrancy of its people essential to development of nationhood in the long-term interest of the nation."<br><br>"Only when there is such a safeguard against abuse of power over the other equally desirable aspects of nation building will it bring about the necessary conditions supportive of development of active citizenship."<br><br>"While it has often been argued that government has the right to maintain law and order but it is equally important if not more so for the government to govern with accountability and transparency to prevent wrong doings which cause instability and breakdown of law and order.<br><br>"The foremost objective of the government therefore is not to suppress the people using the excuse of maintaining law and order but it is to bring about social, cultural as well as moral conditions to facilitate mass participation of citizens in all endeavors of nation building."<br><br>"A good government is one which will govern the country not for their own sake but with good corporate governance critical to such nation building."<br><br>"It should govern the country holistically so that it will check the abuse of power, corruptions or wrong doings for creative economic development of the nation."<br><br>"In the absence of such clear definition and safeguard, it will lead to a situation of legalistic wrangling of laws and regulations resulting in over-controls, over-regulations, autocracy, tyranny to suit their own narrow agenda of staying in power using the excuse of meritocracy or pragmatism at the expense of larger aspect of nation building and stifling of creativity and enterprises of society." </strong></span><br><br>What is politics for. Is it no good for citizens to play a part in the political development of a country? Instead of talking about their own talents why not talk about development the collective talents of all the citizens so that the government will succeed in transforming the economy to a knowledge-based and value-adding economy with the fullest participation by all?<br><br>Is there not enough evidence given by forumers that the government has failed to achieve the higher and more desirable goals and empowering its citizens to play a part in nation building because of its own narrow-mindedness which was finally exposed by NKF and Shin Corp due to their own self-centredness and arrogance.<br><br>By resorting to GRC and legalistic wrangling of laws and regulation in running  the country in a narrow-minded manner to serve its own hidden agenda of staying in power, is it still a good corporate governance? Is it still governing for the greatest benefits of the greatest number?<br><br>If you cannot rebut these evidences then it is clear that the government cat is no longer catching mice and it is time to change the cat.<br><br>A black cat which catches the mice might have grown so fat that is no longer catches any mice. It is time a white cat is brought in to catch the mice.[/u][/i]</div>

I think you have written many times too about the need to change the constitution with proposals to institutionalize citizens' involvements in social and cultural aspect of participation and creating a youth parliament etc. These are good works for it signaled that citizens are now coming out to speak up on wrongdoings or unfair government policies one by one like the little red dots in forums.<br><br>We will need many more little red dots, for they will make the difference and even they cannot have the power to change they can paint the whole town red to make the sea change eventually happen.</div></blockquote>How exactly is our constitution interpreted? Whereas in the US and UK and other European countries, there is a proper interpretation of the law and the chief justices or some other body of the land comprising of judges or lawyers selected to enact the law of the land, in Singapore, it is murkier more so when even Govt ministers don't seem to know the constitution too well either.</div>

In the last election campaign, they did mention that Singaporeans still want the PAP to rule but at the same time want to have more oppositions in parliament.  So for this reason they are rather rest assured no matter how they will still be in power forever because Singaporeans despite the way we are treated by them still vote for them.

In fact they are now getting all the backlashes from such manipulations in that the 20-40% of citizens who know how to think out problems clearly are asking for change and refusing to listen to any more bullshits.</div>
