              <div class="bigArticleText12">
              <p>For the first time ever, Georgian President Mikhail
              Saakashvili has admitted that his country started the military conflict
              in South Ossetia in August. But the Georgian leader is adamant the
              action was justified. He was testifying before a parliamentary
              commission investigating the five-day war.</p>
              <p>According to Saakashvili, the attack on the South
              Ossetian capital, which involved night shelling of residential areas
              with multiple rocket launcher systems, was aimed at protecting Georgian
              citizens. He said it was a response to Russia’s “intervention” in the
              region.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“We did start military
              action to take control of Tskhinvali and other unruly areas. But we
              took this difficult decision to fend off our territory from
              intervention and save the people who were dying. It was inevitable,”</span> Saakavili said.<br><br>The Georgian President claims Russia moved tanks into South Ossetian territory before Georgia launched its attack. <br><br>He said: <span style="font-style: italic;">“The
              issue is not about why Georgia started military action – we admit we
              started it. The issue is about whether there was another chance when
              our citizens were being killed? We tried to prevent the intervention
              and fought on our own territory.”</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“I used to like Putin”</span><br><br>Mikhail
              Saakashvili said the deterioration of relations between Tbilisi and
              Moscow had nothing to do with his personal relations with Vladimir
              Putin. There was some speculation in the media that Putin bore a
              personal grudge against Saakashvili after he allegedly insulted Putin
              when he was president several years earlier. <br><br>The Georgian President said: <span style="font-style: italic;">“I never insulted him [Vladimir Putin] before anyone, that’s a lie.”</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“All the gossip that the differences between our countries are based on personal hostility is an invented thing,” </span>he said.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ex-ambassador’s allegations ‘groundless’</span><br><br>Mikhail
              Saakashvili dismissed as nonsense the allegations voiced earlier this
              week by the former Georgian ambassador to Moscow, Erossi
              Kitsmarishvili. The diplomat said Tbilisi had been preparing the
              military campaign against South Ossetia for several years and put the
              blame for the bloodshed on Mikhail Saakashvili.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">“Kitsmarishvili’s
              allegations are groundless; his status was not high enough to attend
              the Security Council meetings where the country’s foreign policy was
              decided. He could not know our plans, and those certainly have nothing
              to do with his version,” </span>the Georgian leader said on Friday.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition: EU should treat Saakashvili like Zimbabwe’s Mugabe</span><br><br>The
              opposition Labour Party in Georgia has called on the EU to freeze the
              bank accounts of Mikhail Saakashvili and several other top officials.
              According to party secretary, Georgi Gugava, such a move would stop
              them from fleeing the country.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“The
              Saakashvili administration have packed their suitcases and hope to flee
              and live a quiet and prosperous life abroad on what they’ve stolen and
              looted,”</span> he said.<br><br>The proposed sanctions would be similar
              to those imposed against more then 100 Zimbabwe officials, who had
              their bank accounts frozen by the EU in June.</p>
