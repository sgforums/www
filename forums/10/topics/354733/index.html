              <p>The world population has growned from 3.5 billion in 1965 to the current (to my knowledge) 6.8 billion in 2009.Projected to peak around 8 billion at 2050.</p>
              <p>Oil has been accumulating from the remains of plant and animals 10 to 160 million years ago. Meaning all the oil we're burning now has been accumulated since then and though there has been rumours of abiotic oil there has been no evidence that oil has been replenishing at anywhere near the rate that we're extracting and using it.</p>
              <p>Inflation is dependant on how abundant the particular resource is. We're extracting something that accumulates on a timescale beyond human civilization, to imply we can never run short would be insane.The same time scale would also apply to mineral resources.</p>
              <p>Even trees require a few years to be extractable as usable, high quality wood like teak would need 1-2 decades to mature for industrial use. And we need them to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere as well.</p>
              <p>All of this hinges on abundant oil/NG/coal or in other words - Cheap Energy. WIthout it, food production and mineral extraction would plummel as well.</p>
              <p>Now, even just 6.8 billion is going to consume an immense amount of resources per day. There has been no historical precedent that we can draw upon for such an huge population increase, it has never happened and when it crashes we have no idea how hard we would crash.</p>
              <p>This is an extremely dangerous path we're heading on to and i refuse to let some joker misdirect the public into thinking that it's some scam to dominate the world. One billion humans left living as slaves would actually be an acceptable outcome.</p>

              <p>You are right. Entire dead zones in the oceans and seas have replaced many fertile fishing grounds. Where the fish used to thrive, Jellyfish and squid are now taking over. I saw the discovery channel documentaries "Jellyfish Invasion" and "Squid Invasion" and was amazed.</p>
              <p>A new world order is definitely coming after the big crash due to Man's overpopulation and irresponsible actions on the planets. I think anywhere from 100-million to 1 billion will be the new population.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Supranational Currency in Literature and Religion<br><br>See main article Number of the Beast - Mark of Commerce.<br><br>Futurist Christian eschatology typically holds that the rise of a supranational currency could be a hallmark of the End Times. The prophetic statements in Revelation 13:16-17 are believed, to imply that that the Antichrist will acquire and exercise power over the Earth during the period of the Tribulation in connection to a supranational currency. Since religious difficulties with a supranational currency currently exist (see Political difficulties above), it is implied that the Antichrist would use forced religious syncretism (in the name of counterterrorism and world economic stability) to enable the creation of the supranational curency, overcoming religious objections. This power would apparently be acquired by requiring all people to receive the Mark of the Beast (χÎ¬ραγμα = branded mark, character, coin or money[12]) in their right hands or foreheads in order to buy or sell, making survival for those on the run (i.e opposers of the religio-economic hegemony) much more difficult. A possible translation of the meaning of the number 666 may be: the number 666 will be the number that all currency will be based upon. The interpretation of the meaning of the number varies widely, but is often referenced to relatively nascent technogies such as tattooed bar codes and implanted RFID tags. If this view of the prophecy turns out to be correct, then the coming of the said world currency will have been predicted in prophecy with a lead time of approximately 2000 years.</p></div>

              <p>All these are unnecessary fear mongering, but fortunately, no one takes such discussions seriously. We aren't gonna go extinct anytime soon. There are more who are fighting for survival than the selfish ones who are hell bent on destroying the world from their own self centredness, either individually or nationally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. One world currency - what's new? It had already happened. We had been using US currency and based reserves on US currencies. Simply because it is the richest and strongest country in our world. You want to use Libya currency for international exchange?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. One world domination? - It's the greatest joke for 6000 years of recorded historical civilisation. There is absolutely no way even in hell for 2 persons to agree on anything, even if their lives depended on it, let alone nations that have diverse self interests.</p>
              <p>The only way for one world domination is through armed conflict - it's the only way nations can be dominated - thru the sword as Alexander the great had found out, and every mother's son of a ruler that conquered unarmed states. Even that had proven a failure after initial successes. History is your data base for facts and not presumptions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Planet Earth cannot support 6.8 billion people? Another joke. Once people said Singapore with only 700sqkm cannot support 3.5million people, let alone the targetted 6 million. Today we have already surpussed 3.5million living comfortably in stack up concrete boxes closer to rarified air.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People claim deserts cannot be turn into cultivated plots. The Israelis show how you can do it. People claim seawater cannot be harvested into potable water. Have a talk with Hyflux. People say rice cannot be harvested more than once a year. Right now in labs, researchers are looking towards 5 to 6 harvest per year on improve strains and better fertilization.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To assume that our world's resources will dry up is to base such assumptions on 19th century technologies. WE are no longer living in the 19th century. Science and technology is catching up, and there is a need for each and everyone of us to contribute towards survival of our planet for the next generations - Education and progress will ensure the survival of our world and the future colonnisation of space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, drop those worries and pandering to conspiracy theorists but instead focuss your minds on how we can improve today's science and tech to leap into the future. It isnt as fearful or difficult as you may think it is.</p>
