              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><strong>Discussion
              				in Parliament on voting secrecy misses the point</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Singapore
              				Democrats<br>3 Mar 08<br><br>Given the gravity of the problems
              				surrounding the election process in Singapore, it is astounding
              				that the debate in Parliament on the matter during Budget 2008
              				was completely devoid of substance and sense. <br><br>The
              				declaration that the vote is secret (see </span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><em>Straits
              				Times</em></span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"> report below) misses the point. Whether there is in fact ballot
              				secrecy is not for the Minister to assert or MPs to agree; it is
              				for an independent commission to enforce and ensure.<br><br>The
              				fact that the ballot slip is numbered sets up the possibility for
              				the authorities to trace the vote. Such a possibility compromises
              				the principle of secrecy. <br><br>This problem takes on a much
              				more sinister complexion given the atrocious record of the PAP
              				when it comes to democratic practices.<br><br>The opposition must
              				insist that serial numbers be removed from the voting slips. Mr
              				Wong Kan Seng's excuse that the numbers are to prevent ballot
              				stuffing is limp. <br><br>The Australian vote, for example, does
              				not carry any identification. Yet, stuffing of ballots is not a
              				problem there. <br><br>This is because there are many ways to
              				prevent such cheating: Votes should be counted at the polling
              				centre instead of being transferred to another venue thereby
              				reducing opportunities for ballot boxes to be switched or added,
              				watchdog groups should be allowed to monitor the voting and
              				counting processes, voters' fingers could be marked with
              				indelible ink after they vote, an independent commission should
              				be in place to conduct elections, and so on.<br><br>Many
              				countries have adopted such procedures and their systems have
              				much more credibility than Singapore's. Numbering of voting slips
              				is just a convenient excuse for the PAP. <br><br>Pretending that
              				the numbering is not a factor so as not to exacerbate voters'
              				fears is wishful thinking at best. <br><br>Singaporeans have
              				repeatedly indicated that they fear voting for the opposition
              				because they may get found out. Sticking our heads in the sand
              				and wishing for the problem to go away is not a solution.<br><br>Even
              				if the opposition keeps quiet about this, it is not beyond the
              				PAP and its so-called grassroots people to start a whisper
              				campaign that such-and-such a person was victimised by the
              				Government because he or she voted for the opposition. <br><br>During
              				our walk-abouts, many Singaporeans have approached us asking
              				whether such scenarios are true and whether the PAP really checks
              				how they vote. Real or imagined, the fear is there.<br><br>For
              				example, a taxi-driver told us that he had on one occasion
              				approached his MP for assistance on a matter. When he returned to
              				enquire about the outcome of his request, he was asked why he
              				voted for the opposition and not PAP. <br><br>Whether his story
              				was real or whether he was fear-mongering, no one knows. But
              				stories like these make their rounds in the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><em>kopitiams</em></span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"> and housing estates.  <br><br>Why allow such stories to be
              				circulated when there is a solution which is to remove the
              				numbering on ballot slips? In this way any doubt that the voting
              				may not be secret is once and for all eradicated.<br><br>Take the
              				bull by its horns. Confront the problems and work to change it.
              				The short-term pain will build the necessary foundation for free
              				and fair elections in the decades to come. <br><br>The longer we
              				try to take the easy way out and not demand a genuinely secret
              				vote, the more advantageous it is for the PAP.<br><br>This is why
              				the SDP has called on opposition parties to come together to
              				demand reform of the election process. We will continue to do so.
              				<br><br>With the other many problems that beset our electoral
              				process, there is no doubt that Singapore's election system is a
              				sham. That there was no substantive debate in Parliament on the
              				issue is a shame.<br><br></span></p>
