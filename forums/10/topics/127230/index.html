            <div class='col-md body'>A bloody revolt in a tiny village challenges the rulers of China<br><br>Friday April 15, 2005<br>The Guardian<br><br>Jonathan Watts<br><br>Smashed police cars and buses after the battle in Huankantou<br><br><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2005/04/15/Huankantou150405.gif"><br><br>There is a strange new sightseeing attraction in this normally sleepy corner of the Chinese countryside: smashed police cars, rows of trashed buses and dented riot helmets.<br><br>They are the trophies of a battle in which peasants scored a rare and bloody victory against the communist authorities, who face one of the most serious popular challenges to their rule in recent years.<br><br>In driving off more than 1,000 riot police at the start of the week, Huankantou village in Zhejiang province is at the crest of a wave of anarchy that has seen millions of impoverished farmers block roads and launch protests against official corruption, environmental destruction and the growing gap between urban wealth and rural poverty.<br><br>Article continues<br>China's media have been forbidden to report on the government's loss of control, but word is spreading quickly to nearby towns and cities. Tens of thousands of sightseers and wellwishers are flocking every day to see the village that beat the police.<br><br>But the consequences for Huankantou are far from clear.<br><br>Having put more than 30 police in hospital, five critically, the 10,000 residents should be bracing for a backlash. Instead, the mood is euphoric. Children have not been to school since Sunday's clash. There are roadblocks outside the chemical factory that was the origin of the dispute. Late at night the streets are full of gawping tourists, marshalled around the battleground by proud locals who bellow chaotic instructions through loudspeakers.<br><br>"Aren't these villagers brave? They are so tough it's unbelievable," said a taxi driver from Yiwu, the nearest city. "Everybody wants to come and see this place. We really admire them."<br><br>"We came to take a look because many people have heard of the riot," said a fashionably dressed young woman who had come from Yiwu with friends. "This is really big news."<br><br>Although the aftermath is evident in a school car park full of smashed police buses, burned out cars and streets full of broken bricks and discarded sticks, the origin of the riot is hazy.<br><br>Initial reports suggested that it started after the death of two elderly women, who were run over when police attempted to clear their protest against a chemical factory in a nearby industrial park.<br><br>Witnesses confirmed that the local old people's association had kept a 24-hour vigil for two weeks outside the plant. Many said they had heard of the deaths, but no one could name the victims. The local government of Dongyang insists there were no fatalities.<br><br>Like many of the other disputes that have racked China in the past year, frustration had been simmering for some time. Locals accused officials of seizing the land for the industrial park - built in 2002 - without their consent. Some blamed toxins from the chemical plant for ruined crops, malformed babies and contamination of the local Huashui river.<br><br>The village chief reportedly refused to hold a public meeting to hear these grievances. Attempts to petition the central government also proved fruitless. Locals said they had lost faith in the authorities.<br><br>"The communists are even worse than the Japanese," said one man.<br><br>Memories are still fresh of the fighting on Sunday. "It was about 4am and I was woken up by an unusual noise," said a Ms Wang, a shopkeeper who lives next to the school where the fiercest fighting took place. "When I looked out of the window, I saw lots of riot police running into the village. Many men rushed out of their houses to defend our village."<br><br>Accounts of the conflict differ. Residents say 3,000 police stormed the village, several people - including police - were killed, dozens wounded and 30 police buses destroyed. But the Dongyang government says about 1,000 police and local officials were attacked by a mob, which led to 36 injuries and no deaths.<br><br>The outcome is also unclear. Locals say the village chief has fled. In his place, they have established an organising committee, though its members are a secret. This suggests a fear of recriminations, but the public mood is one of bravado.<br><br>"We don't feel regret about what we have done," said a middle-aged man. "The police have not come back since they withdrew on Monday. They dare not return."<br><br>Some, however, admitted to anxiety. Among them was an old woman - also a Mrs Wang - who reluctantly opened her doors to visitors who had come to see her collection of trophies from the battle.<br><br>"I am scared," she said, as she showed two dented riot police helmets, several empty gas canisters, a policeman's jacket and several truncheons and machetes. "This is getting bigger and bigger."<br><br>But there have been no arrests and no communication from the authorities. The current leadership will be keen to avoid a Tiananmen Square-style confrontation, including prime minister Wen Jiabao, who pleaded with the Tianan men protesters to leave before the tanks came. At the same time, the authorities are committed to social stability.<br><br>According to government statistics, protests increased by 15% last year to 58,000, with more than 3 million people taking part. In many provincial capitals, roadblocks occur more than once a week. Last weekend, anti-Japanese demonstrators rallied in three cities, including Beijing.<br><br>But in Huankantou, villagers do not seem to realise that although they have won the battle, they may be far from winning the war.<br><br>Amid a crowd of locals beside a wrecked bus, one middle-aged woman won a cheer of approval by calling for the government to make the first move towards reconciliation.<br><br>"It's up to them to start talking," she said. "I don't know what we would do if the police came back again, but our demand is to make the factory move out of the village. We will not compromise on that."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More on this..could it become a domino effect?<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Despite claims to be opening up to the outside world, pledges to allow greater freedom and autonomy for foreign press operation in China that was made as part of ChinaÂ’s pledge towards the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing, there are still many issues that Beijing things that to become common knowledge in the outside world; unsurprisingly the increasing number of volatile protests is one such issue.<br><br>Although there have been a number of reports have been from locations such as Huankantou; where violent protests erupted early on Sunday morning, after an attempted by security forces to suppress a peaceful demonstration resulted in the deaths of two elderly women, there have also been numerous reports of obstruction of foreign media access, as well as the destruction of material gathered by members of the foreign press.<br><br>An Encounter<br><br>The difficulties encountered by foreign journalists, and journalists writing for foreign consumption, were highlighted in the aftermath of the Huankantou Â‘incidentÂ’.<br><br>After conducting a series of interviews in and around Huankantou, Didi Tatlow, a noted Associate Press writer with an impressive record, was detained and forced to relinquish all of the material that she had gathered.<br><br>Tatlow was stopped by police as she left Huankantou; her notes were confiscated and destroyed, the content of her camera was erased, and she was then forced to sign a confession stating that she had been engaged in illegal reporting activities because she entered the village without government permission.<br><br>The treatment measured out to domestic journalists is often far worse, and can include, an official prohibition on reporting, long periods detention of detention for Â‘questioningÂ’, and even imprisonment.<br><br>Recently tightened press laws also leave domestic journalists open to harsh sanctions for neglecting to display their press card prominently enough, and for offences such as bribery; which are can be almost impossible to defend against given the Chinese legal system.<br><br>Domestic journalists have also reported beating and other forms of intimidation when reporting on sensitive issues like domestic unrest.<br><br>Freedom of the Press, Chinese Style<br><br>Under tight laws governing foreign media, Beijing requires members of the foreign press to register their presence and their movements at all times. In most cases journalists require permission to give interviews and to working in different areas in addition to permission to report from China.<br><br>Regulations are also often so vague that they can be interpreted in many ways so as to keep authorized foreign journalists at a distance from stories.<br><br>Permission to report on a story in Beijing does not equate to permission to report on a story in Shanghai, and permission to interview a factory owner over an industrial incident does not always equate to permission to interview the workers involved.<br><br>Typically, Chinese officials can demand at least one months notice from foreign reporter before they are allowed to report from the scene of an incident. This is enough time for physical evidence to Â‘changeÂ’ or removed and for steps to be taken to ensure that only those with favorable accounts are available for interview.<br><br>Often, members of the foreign press are legally only able to access government officials carrying approved versions of events.<br><br>It is known for Chinese officially to view material gathered by foreign reporters Â‘to ensure its accuracyÂ’, and for authorities to confiscate or destroy material that may be damaging, or that may contradict official accounts of an event.<br><br>Foreign journalists are also ever wary of acquiring material that could be used to identify dissenting Chinese citizens in case the citizenÂ’s identities are revealed to Chinese authorities.<br><br>During official screenings of a the highly acclaimed documentary Â“What remains of usÂ”, which contained the stories of many Tibetan Citizens forced to live under Chinese rule, all recording media was prohibited from the theatres, and gust were screened to ensure that they would not reveal information on participants identities to Chinese intelligence.<br><br>Who cares what Foreigners think?<br><br>While Beijing often dismisses the importance of stories carried by foreign media; claiming them to be bias, politically motivated, or purposefully anti Chinese, it is still concerned about the reporting of domestic unrest.<br><br>In the case Huankantou and other similar incidents, there are two main reasons for this concern.<br><br>News of domestic disturbances, and their often heavy handed suppression, is considered to be highly damaging to ChinaÂ’s reputation. Stories of Rural and urban unrest in China largely present an image of a government that is battling to control discontent citizens by force, rather than moving to act against the reasons for their restiveness, and that is unwilling to enact the changes required to ease tensions if such changes mean a relinquishing of central authority or the admittance that problems and discontent exist.<br><br>Stories of unrest not only rouse the ire foreign human rights activists and pro democracy campaigners, they also create waves among would be investors who might think again if they thought that their workers might revolt, that their domestic investors and consumers might associate them with a regime that suppresses its own population or accuses them of assisting in human rights abuses, or that investments of time and money might be destroyed during incidents of unrest.<br><br>The latter reason is of mounting concern to Japanese investors and potential investors since news was released of the ransacking of stores Japanese owned Ito-Yokado and Aeon during anti-Japanese protests earlier this month.<br><br>More pressingly for ChinaÂ’s propaganda ministry, many Chinese now see the foreign press as being far more accurate than their own; those with a good proficiency in English, Japanese, or other foreign languages, and access to the internet are now increasingly able to bypass ChinaÂ’s state controlled media all together. Allowing them to search out news on China from foreign sources or to use the foreign press to augment the information contained in an increasing number of secretive Chinese language news sites, blogs and discussion boards which are hungrily consumed by Chinese speakers who do not or cannot directly access foreign news sources.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While international media attention was fixed on Beijing this weekend, where thousands of demonstrators marched in support of a toughened stance against Japan, an entirely different protest was unfolding in a village in South ChinaÂ’s Zhejiang Province.<br><br>The scene of the latest incident was the village of Huankantou, where a group, consisting of approximately 200 elderly women, had been protesting against pollution being caused by local factories<br><br>The female protestors had been maintaining 24 hour picket outside an industrial complex, containing about a dozen chemical factories, which resident blame for industrial contamination that has polluted drinking water and rendered local crops unfit for consumption.<br><br>Violence Erupts<br><br>The demonstration had been running peacefully for two weeks, but violence flared when security forces attempted to suppress it by force.<br><br>Villagers reportedly overturned, or otherwise destroyed police, 10 cars and stoned security forces; forcing them to retreat into a local school. Villagers then stormed the school, forcing security forces to retreat further.<br><br>It is thought that about 3,000 paramilitary police arrived at the scene at around 3 am on Sunday morning, only to come under a sustained attack from villagers, who destroyed or damager 50 busses and injured an unknown number of their occupants.<br><br>The total number of police and villagers involved can not yet be confirmed, but reports suggest that upwards of 20,000 villagers and over 3000 member of the security forces, including riot police and paramilitary units, were involved.<br><br>Casualties<br><br>More than 50 members of the security forces were reported as being hospitalized, 5 were said to be in a serious or critical condition.<br><br>Two villagers, both elderly women, are known to have been killed. Initial reports suggest that they were run down by one or more police vehicles.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“They are <strong>the trophies of a battle </strong>in which peasants scored <strong>a rare and bloody victory against the communist authorities</strong>, Â…Â” Â“ Huankantou village in Zhejiang province is at the crest of a wave of anarchy that <strong>has seen millions of impoverished farmers block roads and launch protests </strong>against...Â”  It is indeed true that "Media reports have a sense of sensationalism to them too.." whether they are China Daily or the Guardian. We choose who we believe and what we believe.<br><br>Fortunately, there is still government statistics on protests in China, for "According to government statistics, protests increased by 15% last year to 58,000, with more than 3 million people taking part. In many provincial capitals, roadblocks occur more than once a week. Last weekend, anti-Japanese demonstrators rallied in three cities, including Beijing." I am surprised such statistics is available in a communist country, even to a democratic western journalist.<br><br>Apparently, this journalist spent  long enough time in this place Huankantou, interviewed at least four persons, Ms Wang, Mrs Wang, the middle age man and the taxi driver. Not bad in a place where there is no press freedom. I still can't find the place Huangkantou on the map, apparently it is somewhere in Zhejiang province but you certainly need CIA intelligence to alert you to be there to get first hand report.<br><br>It is also fortunate that "The current leadership will be keen to avoid a Tiananmen Square-style confrontation, including prime minister Wen Jiabao, who pleaded .........At the same time, the authorities are committed to social stability." So given that the communists country police has the power to do anything they like, this problem is not likely to get worse since they are committed to social stability. I think Singaporeans have also made a lot of sacrifices for the same reason. the locals in China ought to learn from us<br><br>What is the reason for all these riots and demonstrations? are they justified?<br>In Huankantou, the protest was against "against official corruption, environmental destruction and the growing gap between urban wealth and rural poverty. " I think this is noble and the protests are justified. What about the anti Japanese demonstrations, the protestors were against "japanese whitewashing the history to justify their war atrocities, against China and Korea." Is this a good reason for protests,or should the chinese and the koreans keep quiet just because there are other problem in china? No, if Chinese and Korea don't make noise, no westerners or singapore would speak on their behalf.<br><br>Anybody who log on to China.com and other chinese websites, watch cable TV ch 49 to 56  will know that every little incident in China will get their way to the news and I don't see how any news can be hidden, the people know it, the chinese govenment know it, may be the western choose not to believe it.<br><br>A little black out of news in china? yes, even now the government is trying to downplay the anti jap protests, it may be necessary for any kind of protests, like any government; I remember my dad told me that when racial riots broke out in singapore, our phone went dead. Was the black out mean to prevent situation from getting worse or it is a lack of "press freedom"? To each his own interpretation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China is practising selective censorship and it is indeed true that they have a big problem on their hands when it comes to the suburban areas.They should face up to them and since they apparently choose to welcome some "leakage" of the Anti-Japanese protests to further their own agenda, bit by bit, they should also beware that selective actions like these may not stem the tide for long.You cannot choose to let ppl demonstrate in the city and try to shut them up in the villages.<br><br>I sometimes wonder why so many people are so eager to jump to China's defence so quickly? What have they done to benefit us anyway?Go and ponder and realise that they have a long way to go.<br><br>Protesting against Japan might have a noble root cause, but suppressing otheres who believe in that same concept of free speech is pure hypocrisy, bullcrap about social stability notwithstanding.Engage these people, not send riot police into an area when you already know why they riot.It does not solve anything but rather makes you distant from the people and just reeks of moral bankruptcy.Too bad if some of you feel that you precious China is being slammed..criticism is good for a nation if it wants to mature.<br><br>Too bad we can't say the same about this place though..seems like the thin-skinned have taken over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In developing countries like China, there are bound to be protests that would inevitably end up in violence. However compared to other developing nations, China is indeed better off. Look at how democratic nations such as India suppress dissidents and I can't help but feel that China is so better off. Look at this link:<br><br>http://www.indiatogether.org/peace/kashmir/articles/indhr.htm<br><br>I am living in China right now. Generally speaking, China is indeed progressing as a whole and the majority of the people are happy with and want to maintain the status quo.  In fact more and more people around the world see China as a good place to live in and are migrating there in large numbers. There are people who think that the chinese government is fueling hatred towards Japan in an attempt to divert the attention of its people from its internal problems... Since there are so many "internal problems" in China, why are there so many people around the world emigrating to China? Which sane man or woman would want to emigrate to a country where there are so many internal problems is beyond me...<br><br>Corruption problem in China is also improving. It still exists but it has reduced drastically over the years. In fact if one compares China with other major developing nations such as Russia, India, Indonesia etc, China is indeed better off. Take a look at this:<br><br>http://www.transparency.org/cpi/2004/cpi2004.en.html<br><br></div>
