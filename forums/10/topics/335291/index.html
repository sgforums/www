              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The sinking funds under all 14 PAP-managed town councils are safe and not significantly affected by the failed Lehman Brothers products. <br><br>Town councils said only a small percentage of their total investments were spent on those affected products. <br><br>Town councils use their individual sinking funds to carry works such as repairing damages at HDB (Housing &amp; Development Board) common areas or maintaining an HDB elevator. <br><br>Every PAP town council has between S$30 million and S$150 million in their sinking funds. <br><br>Under current guidelines, each town council can use 65 per cent of their sinking funds to invest in government bonds, while up to 35 per cent can be invested in other financial instruments like corporate bonds and equities. <br><br>Although some of the town councils have purchased Lehman Brothers-linked products, the investments are minimal. <br><br>"Maybe a couple of percentage out of the total investment portfolio (were used in those investments), so the exposure will not affect the overall investment portfolio or the sinking funds per se. There's definitely no fear that any of the PAP town councils' sinking funds will be wiped out. All the supporting PAP town councils' sinking funds are in safe hands," assured Dr Teo Ho Pin, Coordinating Chairman of the 14 PAP Town Councils. He is also the mayor of North West District. <br><br>For Jurong Town Council, it has not invested in any Lehman-linked products, but explains that it only spends about 18 per cent or S$15 million of its S$84 million sinking funds in slightly riskier products. <br><br>Even then, that investment guarantees the principal amount. <br><br>"The position that we've taken is really to be very cautious with our investments because we're very clear that these are public funds, and therefore we decided to err on the side of being conservative in our investment policy. The public do not have to worry... there will not be enough funds in order to take care of their needs," said Jurong MP Halimah Yacob. <br><br>Many agree the current financial turmoil has taught the town councils that they should further diversify their investments in the future. <br><br>Going forward, town councils are expected to exercise even greater prudence when investing their sinking funds. But it's hoped that they will still be able to get up to 4 per cent of returns on their investments annually. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p>I was wondering who gave them the right to speculate our money. The higher the returns the higher the risk.</p>
              <p>Why kept so much money and not lowering the charges.</p>

              <p>just being smart nowadays after lesson learnt from the Lehman boo boo of the ultimate kind where investors TRUSTED blindly and never insisted on salesmen typing it down what they claimed or promised in legal contract and signed.</p>
              <p>Now, if a mee siam man tells me he promise / guarantees / will ensure / will help / will look into the matter / will give you rebates , I tell him straight off, "show me a legal contract that indicates clearly beyond reasonable doubt what you just said" .</p>
              <p>If everyone follows this method, I guarantee you will not suffer as badly as the 10000 private investors. I do not know who are the public investors. But you should ask me to write down in black and white and signed to play safe and being due-diligent.</p>

              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PM Lee says buyers of Lehman-linked products should seek resolution with banks first</span></em></p>

              <p><span class="update">"I think this is a very difficult and not very satisfactory way in the long run. First of all, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">government should not be making decisions for individuals</span></span>; individuals should have the right to decide for themselves, their circumstances, their preferences, their needs. And secondly, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the government is not in a position to guarantee what is safe and what is not safe because there is nothing which is 100 per cent safe</span>," he said. <br><br>Prime Minister Lee said the government's role is to make sure that the financial system proceeds fairly and properly, <span style="color: #ff0000;">not to guarantee the outcome but to make sure that its people know what they are doing</span>. For the investors, this would mean that they are <span style="color: #ff0000;">properly educated and understand the products they buy</span> and their rights as consumers. "     ", <em>unquote</em>.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="update">By this, I like to clarify, does he mean the same for TC's Lehman investments as well?</span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Recently, a TW political commentator praised Singapore to have the ability<br>to use the People's CPF related money to invest. She/He admitted that such things<br>could never have happened in TW.  I wonder what does she mean by that ? </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Ok,  investments cannot be guaranteed safe is one thing, but who is <span style="color: #ff0000;">RESPONSIBLE</span>  and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ACCOUNTABLE</span> for an investment success ? Likewise, WHO is <span style="color: #ff0000;">RESPONSIBLE</span>  and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ACCOUNTABLE</span> for an investment  fiasco?  Is this a logical question begging to be asked?  If you know better than me, kindly reply.</span></p>
              <p><span class="update">As I feel that it would take a while or long time,  for our alternative party to raise this question, I wonder is it a way to better utilize our Hong Lim Park  by holding a discussion with the public on this topic which seems like a topic of public interest.</span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Unfortunately, I am not an eloquent speaker. I hope the Linguistically Bombastic, ABLE, CAPABLE, Knowledgeable and Compassionate and BRAVE could kindly step forward and contribute to the discussion. Else, things will remain as it is, as in no one from the public will discuss the issue to get clarifications.</span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Ideally, I hope the authorities can send their representatives who has the power to make decisions to discuss on 'live' TV, unrehearsed. </span></p>
