A house divided is a house doomed to failure.<br><br>If they as leaders govern with a big heart and willing to forgive political foes or people for criticisms of their wrongful NKF practices is there still the need to speak to media to blame people, prempt criticisms of international communities or other bigger problems due to their narrow-minded self-serving governing.<br><br>If the fundamentals in governing are not clearly tackled with systems offering better and accountable checking on their wrongful policies of taxing and profiteering then they will continue to have to blow their own trumpet to justify all kinds of mistakes and deny solving problems.<br></div>

Silicon can be converted to semi-conductors for computers. The crude oil is refined in Jurong Island to form the different kinds of fuel.</div></blockquote>Yeah an educated workforce needs employers and employers need good reasons to relocate operations here. Amongst others, Low tax, relatively cheaper labour, political stability, talent(including FT if shortage), minimal union interference  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">, less demand on corporate social responsibility etc etc. What better place to go than "heartless and capitalistic" Singapore ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You protest because you are angry! Anger is like the knife. If you let out your anger at home, where nobody sees, then it's your business. But if you take that anger and bring it out in public and you protests. Then its like bringing a knife in public. Then people think you want to rob them, so they call the police. Same as protest, you do it in public, wait monkey see, monkey do, then more people protest. so its bad! for society. There is no such thing as peaceful protest, got protest means got chance of chaos, we are a small country, cannot take chances, so got to stop them all</div>
