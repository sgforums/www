            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..Ive always wanted to voice out my opinion on this.<br><br>Its clearly impossible to do that in singapore. 1st of all the state is already so small and the police force is in control. 2ndly 'people' itself, they are not really unity enough to go up against 'them', but can't blame when ur living in Singapore. Actaully I feel that Singapore itself is no difference from being in the control of a military regiment (just that its not really a military controlled state )where citizens can't really choose to voice their displeasure with things. This is one of a democratic state which is not really democratic afterall. Ive only started to notice when busfare goesup, CPF system changes and increases in GST. As for the gst thing ive no idea how are they going to help the poor? Don't tell me when the poor goes to a supermarket they just voice out they are the poor and with an approved acknowledgement from the government and they will get discount or won't have to pay the increased GST? 'IF' things are really like this then it's discrimation. Of course its not like that, they still have to pay the full like all others then i wonder how the government is actually assisting them? (Frankly speaking I do not know) By giving them $200-$300 per month? then will it make a difference if they never increase the gst instead? unless in between they get some profit out of it. We do not know ! Its true that they really did 'good' to the state. ('TO' the state, not 'for' the state). Actually sidenote abit, I agreed with people when they say if not for the governement, do you think we will be living in peace? look at other country so many disruption and choatic going on. But we have to look deep into it, 1st of all you have to see the size of the country 1st and the population of the people and the state they are in then you make the judgement. As i said singapore is very small state, it is being closely scrutinize by. How can any Tom, Dick or Henry start a breakout that easily?<br><br>Sometimes when people said that I do agree with them but when i think again, what 'IF' the country is bigger, like malaysia, thailand, indonesia or CHINA? and have the same team of governemt running the country like the way they are running it now, with the increases of this and that, system change of CPF. Would things have been the same or slightly different? I don't know... what do you guys think?<br><br>Of course afterall Im like anyone, everyone.. We can't make any choices and just have to accept it as this way. Its just that the last straw was the changes in their CPF system, not say im ok with them just suka suka increase their pay by so 'much' !!  just like how that TT Indian man get his bonus.<br><br>Sometimes I felt sad for those people who slog so hard every hour, every week, everymonth and every year and in the end what did they get in return? Not saying Im any better, and I may end up like them too. I just think when you reach the retirement age, it'll be good when you can take out all your CPF money and use it on doing enjoyable and relaxing things, maybe travelling, buying things they like and using the money on meaningful purposes, but from the way I see how many more lesser people can actually enjoy all that now? Last month Mum and I went to visit our grandaunt, She was close to her retirement age, they allowed her to take out $30 K and kept the $90 K. why not the opposite? anyway as u all know the $ 90K later on will be distribute to her $300 per month and the sad thing is she is staying alone without anyone, worst it is her hard earned money. I imagine what can $300 do for her per month in the near future? prices are sure to increase? even 'BUS FARE' sometimes I totally freaked out when I have to top it so soon after just using it a few trips.<br><br>Of course the people 'higher up' won't have to worry about such a thing, even without the CPF they can still survive and enjoy a very blissful life. I just think 'IF' there is something call 'miracle' in this world ! haha I really wished the Goverment people switches place with these people and let them at least lick the feeling of how hard a blow it is when it is your money (possesion) and you have no right to decide on it, how tough it will be when you'r sick and you do not have enough money to pay for the bill or how disencouraging it is when people don't respect you and do not involve you in their decision making. =)<br><br>As to TS, there is nothing for them to feel guilty about. It is the law of doing 'business'. "You give to the people a piece of chicken of course you want back a whole roasted pig".<br><br>REN BU WEI ZHI JI NA HUI WEI LE SUI NE?<br><br>Kitkat_</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyone who still thinks singapore is a democratic gvmt has gotta be kidding me..but like quincy said as we rely on human resources, we simply cant afford to have major outbreaks in this peaceful society..look what SARS did to our nation already..everyone was so petrified and all and economy suffered as well(mb not a gd example but still you get my point)...at most the gvmt can do is to relax the law for peaceful protests to voice out concerns...likewise to whatever political fightings we wish to see like in the US because we simply CANT afford to have them... true singapore has lots of policies which needs reviewing and changing but like having a political framework like normal democratic countries is gonna help in our little red dot of a country...</div>
