              <p><strong> The people drive us on</strong></p>
              <p>Friday, 02 May 2008	
                  
                  
                  Singapore Democrats<br><br>Our bodies
                  ached and our skins were tender. Standing at Toa Payoh Central for
                  seven hours, at times under the scorching sun, would do that to your
                  bodies. Our spirits? They never flagged.<br><br>What kept us going were the people who took our flyers, many standing rooted on the spot poring through the pages.<br><br>There were no speeches, no focal-point events and defintely no goody bags to get them to sign the <em>Tak Boleh Tahan!</em> petition. Yet, more than one hundred did.</p>
              <div class="img_caption right" style="float: right; width: 250px;"><img class="caption" title="They made it all worthwhile" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/TBT/tbt%20signing%20petition.jpg" border="1" alt="They made it all worthwhile" width="250" align="right">
              <p>They made it all worthwhile</p>
              </div>
              <p>Two
                  who got everyone talking were genteel grannies. They saw what we were
                  doing and didn't hesitate to put their names to paper. They even stayed
                  to chat.<br><br>Unfortunately for every one of them, there were ten
                  others who exhibited the fear syndrome that Singaporeans have come to
                  be known for. Everytime one of our photographers and videographers
                  trained their cameras on them, they quickly turned away.<br><br>One
                  even told us that she couldn't accept our flyer because her MP, Mr Ho
                  Peng Kee, would not be happy if she did. Another man in his 60s was
                  cursing the Government until he noticed the videocamera. He very
                  aggressively turned on the cameraman until we told him he was one of
                  us. Even then he was clearly uncomfortable and we stopped filming.<br><br>One
                  who was not afraid to speak up was a man by the name of Orlando. He
                  talked to us on tape and said described the difficult situation that he
                  and other Singaporeans were facing. We'll upload the interview shortly.
                  It's a must-watch.<br><br>Still the T-shirts, buttons and books sold
                  briskly. A couple of young ladies came up repeatedly first to see what
                  the fuss was about, then to get a flyer, then to make hefty donation.</p>

              <p>Jufrie Mahmoud meeting residents</p>
              </div>
              <p>A
                  few of the activists took turns to visit the kopitiams and shops. We
                  even covered the bus interchange. Later in the afternoon, a few of us
                  trotted up to the blocks to pay the residents a visit in their homes.<br><br>But
                  every bright cloud has a dark patch. <strong>A female reporter shocked everyone
                  when she said: "I don't think our Constitution says we have the right
                  to freedoms of speech, assembly and expression."</strong><br><br><strong>No wonder, she
                  was from Radio 93.8 Live.</strong> She was politely told to look up Article 14
                  of the Singapore Constitution and reminded of the National Pledge which
                  exhorts citizens to build a "democratic society."<br><br><strong>To this
                  reporter, the activities of SDP are against the laws of the country and
                  as such they are illegal. What's more these freedoms that the Singapore
                  Democrats were fighting for are airy-fairy Western concepts, not suited
                  to Singapore. With reporters like these, who needs propagandists?</strong><br><br>SDP's
                  activities are illegal? Not so, according to our police who said that
                  the activity was not "an unlawful assembly." Baloney!</p>
              <div class="img_caption right" style="float: right; width: 180px;"><img class="caption" title="Radio 93.8 Live reporter (left)" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/TBT/tbt20.jpg" border="1" alt="Radio 93.8 Live reporter (left)" width="180" align="right">
              <p>Radio 93.8 Live reporter (left)</p>
              </div>
              <p>If
                  this isn't an unlawfully assembly, then why are some of the activists
                  being questioned for the petition signing event conducted last
                  September outside the Burmese embassy? Both events involved petitions
                  and both clearly exceeded the four-person limit.<br><br>The police said
                  that the Tak Boleh Tahan! campaign yesterday could be a case of illegal
                  hawking. Illegal hawking? What about the other opposition parties when
                  they sell their party newspapers? What about Mr J B Jeyaretnam selling
                  his books outside Centrepoint? What do you call those?<br><br>It's clear that Mr Wong Kan Seng and the police make up the rules as they go along.<br><br>And speaking of Mr Wong, the signatures collected for his resignation came close to one hundred. Not bad for a start.<br><br>And a start it was. The <em>Tak Boleh Tahan!</em> campaign is set to continue. The folks whom we met yesterday were
                  clearly looking for a voice. We, the Singapore Democrats, will be that
                  voice.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>With this type of mainstream propaganda media, how on earth are Singaporeans going to get informed?</p>
              <p>How on earth to be politicised?</p>
              <p>It is totally worthless.</p>
              <p>This type of useless media drags the whole society down.</p>
