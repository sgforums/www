            <div class='col-md body'>To:tspg,<br><br>If government is accountable and transparent, and more willing as demonstrated by the way Khaw Boon Wan did a turn-about on past high cost policy of the MOH, it will do well in the future.<br><br>I agree with your clarity of thought on this matter. It is hoped that there will be changes including setting up of work processes to incorporate such quality-time-cost parameters as posted in "HOW TO DO IT". This is a more proactive and hands-on approach which will no doubt bring more improvements in the next phase after GCT.<br><br>If government continues to persist in the past assumptions insisting that people must not keep mentioning old problems, and continue to rely on presumptuous abilities of scholars to take care of all problems or major problems, then it will be mistaken again for the next 14 years.<br><br>Mr. Khaw Boon Wan went on TV recently to assure that MOH will study the Toyota Production System to see how to cut down costs and wastages which were identified as the main features of success of Toyota. This is a good approach.<br><br>However, locally, many people have given suggestions to the government to apply hands-on results-oriented doable work processes to improve implentation efficiency. If government is prepared to use some of its people's own ideas instead of relying on ISO or other world renown gurus, may be we will be out of the wood sooner. After all, SPRING has admitted that its past 20 years of training schemes did not quite produce a more productive economy. For now, with China and India competing strongly, we just need to have our loss of competitiveness recognized with new ministers getting the acts together without the constant past justifications for past policies. People must have a view if not at the end, they themselves are the ones to blame of loss of competitiveness and high costs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
