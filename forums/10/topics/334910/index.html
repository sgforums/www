              <p>It is time for me to seriously considering whether to continue to read our local papers.</p>
              <p>I had read the following article dated on Malaysian Sin Chew Jit Poh dated 24 October (å·¥å•†æ—¶æŠ¥ dated 23 October 2008). </p>
              <p>Our local papers (from SPH) however is quick (on 25 October) to seek a more optimistic numbers for the most pessimistic outcome (6% drop in private properties price from SPH vs 30% from å·¥å•†æ—¶æŠ¥) from a distinguished NUS professor.</p>
              <p>Our stock market has halved it market market, i can't help but to believe that 30% may be true, and the 6% prediction by that professor was just overly optimistic.</p>

              <p>What else can we expect from a parasite but to live off the hives from others ?</p>
              <p>For Singaporean properties to fall by 30% - most home owners will be continuing to pay for mortgages that will exceed the current values of their homes.</p>
              <p>Banks will soon make calls for home owners to rationalise the loan accounts to the new values.</p>
              <p>This is the same scenario that the Singapore Government had feared if it had taken any actions to rationalise the property market; and had instead preferred to let the speculative bubble to grow.</p>
              <p>It is crunch time soon, and Singapore will have our own version of the US sub-prime fiasco.</p>

              <p>Let's look at the property prices in perspective and macro-economically.</p>
              <p><br>Many who don't look at the fundamentals but view only the figures will be easily misled or mislead others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What props up the local property market?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have a small landmass and need to house the 3.2million and growing population in high rise buildings. Another few million citizens will be comming along the way in the next few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The law of market demand and supply will determine that properties in Singapore will always face an upward trend, no matter turbulent recessions comes our way.</p>
              <p><br>We all need houses to stay and be sheltered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike other countries with big land mass like China, USA or even malaysia, their properties will always face bubbles, driven by greedy speculators and developers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many citizens there don't realize that if an area is hot, another plot is ready to be developed at even lower prices. What is hot soon turns cold due to the massive amounts of land they have.</p>
              <p><br>We don't have such plots, and are even running out of plots and willl have to tear down 10 storeys to build it 30 storeys, increasing its value.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Price is largely placed on our income levels. As properties are scarce, thus a premium is required both by developers and our society ( govt )(which uses it to compensate other citizens thru reduced prices for public housing and leftover amounts to help future generations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should economic conditions worsened, there will be a small portion who may default, but that is because of their greed - over-extending themselves with credit terms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But on the whole, many pragmatic singaporeans can still pay their loan obligations due to the avaliability of jobs that are still avaliable, as well as future jobs in the pipeline due to the planning done years ago in the events crisis such as these comes along -such as bio-tech, hi-tech, and low level industries  such as IR projects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for those living in HDBs, in 97 the govt gave rebates and extended loan repayments delays scheme to help those really down and out ones, providing training to help them get better jobs so that they may have a place to stay. Such schemes will be repeated should the economic takes a turn for the worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these will help to prevent the market from becoming a 'bubble'. But there will still be panic selling, as well as rumour mongering by clueless individuals and greedy speculators as well as a small portion of defaulters that will drive the sentiment a few percentages down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I too would like to purchase depress prices of Spore properties, but to be fair, do understand the value of what you are holding on before you listen to rumours or panic and do make attempts to resolve any payment issues, otherwise you will only be making losses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in the end, properties are a sure bet in Singapore, unless our country becomes uninhabitable. But then there's nothing to worry about cos we'll all be dead anyway.</p>

              <p>THeir banks offered loads of cash to anyone to buy property. Here in Spore, only those who have good credit ratings are allowed loans. For those who have bad ratings, they could not so much as even loan a bed, let alone million dollar homes.</p>
              <p><br>Furthermore, banks check if their customer has the income to support such loans before granting approval.

              <br> <br> AFTER rising steeply for several years, prime office rents are on the
              way down as landlords move to retain good tenants in uncertain economic
              times. In the wake of the global financial crisis, which erupted in
              mid-September, these prime rents are now back to levels seen about 12
              months ago. <br> <br> They fell 5 per cent last month and could fall another 10 to 20 per
              cent over the next six months, according to consultancy Cushman &amp;
              Wakefield. <br> <br> Office rents in general started falling in the third quarter ended Sept 30, given the weaker economic outlook. 
              <br> <br> But the fall in net effective prime office rents was even more
              pronounced last month as landlords became more flexible in negotiating
              rents, experts said. <br> <br> 'It is almost as if it was the landlords who blinked first,' said
              managing director Douglas Dunkerley of Corporate Locations, which helps
              firms find office space. <br> <br> 'The reason we saw such a swift change is that landlords have gone out
              of their way to retain their current tenants who have lease renewals
              coming up over the next six months.' <br> <br> He said the search firm is not seeing many 'distressed' relocations by
              tenants as many had moved to take advantage of cost-saving
              opportunities. <br> <br> 'But now, more landlords are recognising the market has changed and are determined to keep their tenants,' he said. 
              <br> <br> Latest estimates from Cushman &amp; Wakefield show that gross prime
              office rents dropped 5 per cent from September to reach $14.05 per sq
              ft last month. This cut prime office rents to levels of a year ago,
              said its head of research services, Asia-Pacific, Mr Ang Choon Beng. <br> <br> 'The difference though is that a year ago, rents were being adjusted
              upwards every month and now rates are being adjusted downwards at
              almost the same speed,' said Mr Dunkerley. <br> <br> Cushman &amp; Wakefield already noted a quarter-on-quarter fall in
              prime office rents in the three months ended Sept 30 - a reversal from
              straight quarterly gains for more than four years prior to that. <br> <br> The rent rises - which reached nearly 95 per cent a year in Raffles
              Place last year - slowed this year. Rents peaked around late August. <br> <br> Government data also showed that office rents fell in the third
              quarter, though by a smaller 0.8 per cent. Knight Frank said earlier
              those figures reflected growing resistance by some tenants to renew
              leases at higher costs, given that the current economic uncertainty
              will impact business profits. <br> <br> DTZ executive director Cheng Siow Ying said landlords are prepared to
              look at creative lease packages with rent-free periods so the effective
              rental rates are lower. Landlords have not had to give rent-free
              holidays in over two years, said Mr Dunkerley, adding that nearly every
              landlord cut asking rents last month. <br> <br> But the market is generally more subdued now, with tenants in a wait- and-see mood, experts said. 
              <br> <br> Supply-wise, there are more choices now than just a few months ago, but
              the bulk of the fresh office space supply will come onstream from 2010.
              So, while the downward slide in office rents is expected to continue,
              the speed should slow temporarily till nearer to 2010, said Mr
              Dunkerley. <br> <br> Still, Cushman's projection is for prime office rents to fall by up to
              20 per cent in the next six months. 'Given the sharp run-up in prime
              office rentals over the past two years, we are circumspect about the
              current downward trend of prime office rentals,' said Mr Ang. <br> <br> The rental moderation is 'ultimately healthy' for Singapore's long-term
              prospects as it lowers the overall cost of doing business here. The
              slide is also a signal to firms that the office rental market is
              efficient and can adjust quickly in a changing market, he said. <br> <br> Mr Dunkerley is looking at a fall of possibly 20 to 30 per cent over
              the next 18 months, which would ensure Singapore remains an attractive
              business location and in good shape to compete with other major
              regional centres</span></p>
