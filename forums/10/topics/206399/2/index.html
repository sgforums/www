The demonstrators for WTO and IMF are not interested in demonstrating in any HDBland, for what? they don't fly all the way here to demonstrate for the sake of demonstration. Any demonstration will be around Suntec where the participants to the convention could see, where their voices could be heard from inside the meetings (hopefully). Unless we only allow them to speak at the Hong Lim Park or the speakers corner, which, for singaporean, should be situated next to the parliament house.<br><br>Many of the demonstrations that turned violent with destruction happened because locals hooligans joined in to vent their frustration for other reasons. In america even a 10 min blackout you will find looting. WTO demonstrators don't fly here to loot chap huay tiam. Check with the people in HK, you even find some very interesting stories about encounters between HK lady police and the demonstrators.<br><br>WTO and IMF meetings come with the freedom of expression, and demonstration is an integral part of it. We cannot just want the money and reputation for hosting the meetings but disallowing opposition to speak. Singapore ways are for Singaporean only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  WTO and IMF is an international event.<br><br>Hours after the demonstrations in HK, life was back to normal, business as usual, but what happened there was an illustration that the decisions makers for the world and those affected by their decisions and disagree could meet, in their different ways. HK has not suffered any incurable damage from the demonstration. HK police have proven themselves capable of facing the south korean farmers. HK society was resilient enough to absorb some disturbance to their busy life. Such is an international city.<br><br>What about Singapore? is our society likely to collapse as a result of the demonstration or our riot police not capable of facing any major event?? may be they are trained to handle local opposition only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I was there in HK during the WTO, I walked by the demonstrators, I saw how the HK police encountered the demonstrator from about 50 meters. I would be ashamed of the singaporean leaders if they think they could not handle similiar situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is the reputation of good law and order in Singapore coming from strong arms and at the expense of freedom? or as part of an educated and civilized society?<br>Are Singaporeans proud of being treated the way we are treated, cannot demonstrate, no gathering of more than three, as long as the government treat eveybody the same? if you do, I have nothing to say.<br>But, if demonstration at the convention were allowed and turn out to be ok for everybody, may be this could lead to more relax enforcement of the no demonstration rules for Singaporean in the future, you never try, you never know.<br>It is not about bowing to the pressure of anybody. If no demonstration allowed then WTO would reduce the scale of convention by having some meetings like those on farm produce subsidies, outside of singapore, then I say there is pressure.<br>If you open a pub, you want to sell alcohol but you want every customers to speak softly as if in a western restaurant, you are certain to drive away some customers. It is different people wanting to come to you house and you want to enforce your house rules.<br>Sure we want to enforce our rules, I wont be so loud if I am not proud of the rules myself.</div>
