            <div class='col-md body'>I find it hard to empathise with the author's poor financial planning.<br><br>5-years ago, when he decided to buy the private property, a 3-room resale flat in a popular estate can be bought at around $150-180K, while a 4-room would have cost him around $250K.  A 3-room flat is enough room for 2 persons, as it is around the same size as a studio apartment in a private condo.  If he was serious about having children, this would have been a prudent decision.  One wonders why there is a need to consider the 5-room or condo option if calculations show that paying the mortgage would leave one with little savings.<br><br>Given those figures, and the fact that he and his wife started out with little savings, it is hard to argue how buying a condo would be financially more rational, IF there was genuine intention to plan for children.<br><br>He has to learn to learn to deal with his expectations first before crying for government help.<br><br>Incidentally, I have a friend who used to hold a director position in an MNC, easily making more than $150K a year.  He recently decided to enjoy his life and took a lower paying job.  All along, he was staying with his wife and 2 kids in a 3-room flat, and only recently 'reluctantly' upgraded to a 4-room because his area kena 'en-bloc' by HDB. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a junior staff with my company but i always stress one thing with my subordinates or co-workers whenever we encounter a pproble. i tell them i prefer to solve the problems on our very own and establish an agreement or work process so that we can work upon. its better than sitting around and pointing fingers when the same prob resurfaces and having our bosses come down eventually to breath down our necks and giving us lectures and setting standards we hate to complie with. there's a wise man and leader amongst us all and there's just a thin yet impassable barrier between us to unlocking it. and that barrier is our mindset.<br><br>if u can't manage it on your own and eventually hav to be declared a bankrupt..then i guess its better to have the government do the financial planning for you with your CPF.</div>
