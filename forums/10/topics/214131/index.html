            <div class='col-md body'>I really have a hard time coming to terms how the author of this article is justifying his position to the government.<br><br>I would say that a combined income of S$8,000 would be considered better-off to the average singaporean and not just the government.In terms of housing options, there is a choice between private and resale HDB is there not? What about Executive Condominiums introduced to cater to Singaporeans, especially young graduates and professionals who can afford more than an HDB flat but find private property out of their reach?<br><br>Now if the author who has no kids and who has a personal salary of $4,000 is not "wealthy enough" to live a comfortable life, that would paint a rather sad picture for the rest of the average singaporean with salaries around $1K wouldn't it? And instead of "reluctantly" buying a private property, wouldn't it have been better to be realistic and practical and considered other options?<br><br>Now if a Double Income family with the combined income of S$8,000 find it hard to move out of the "no Kids" status, what about those single income families with kids?<br>However I do agree with the author that what the government says about having kids does not matter. At the end of the day, it is a personal decision that requires commitment and some amount of sacrifice. If a young couple were to based that important life decision on such benefits, then I think they need to get their priorities straight.<br><br>Of course I am certain the author played a role in contributing income taxes. But so do most other Singaporeans. To imply the success of our country has to do with his contributions is a blatant overstatement. Prehaps, the author might like to receive benefits meant for the lower income families while he's at it?<br><br>At the end of the day, the marginalised people will continue to increase if all families earning $8,000 and more feel that they are losing out. I believe the role of the government is to take care of Singaporeans one and all and not a select few discontented upper middle class. Prehaps it is time the government should relook, not into income levels but into teaching some Singaporeans how to manage their own self-centred expectations.<br><br>A more fitting title for the article should have been " Centre of the Universe".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The article from the Straits Times Forum on 07 Oct 2006</strong><br><br>WHEN my wife and I read about the Housing Board's first public-housing project by a private developer, our eyes lit up with hope - until we learnt that the same qualification rules apply.<br>To the Government, my family is one of the better-off ones. With a combined income of more than $8,000, we are deemed to be well off and, thus, not eligible for any subsidies. The only housing options available to us are private housing and older, yet more expensive, HDB resale flats.<br><br>My peers and I belong to a group who are not wealthy enough to live comfortably - despite what many think - yet not poor enough to deserve any benefits from the Government. Should misfortune strike, we are not eligible to downgrade our housing immediately because of the 30-month time-bar.<br><br>My family, rather reluctantly, bought a private property because we were making slightly more than $8,000 a month when we needed a new home five years ago. None of us really had any cash savings then and we ended up with a huge loan from the bank.<br><br>After five years of paying more than $30,000 in interest per annum, we hardly have any savings. Meanwhile, our property has depreciated by $200,000 while our loan remains slightly above $500,000.<br><br>My wife and I would like to expand our family. We did our calculations and planned our future but still found it difficult to move out of our Dink (Double Income, No Kids) status.<br><br>What the Government said about making it easier for couples to have kids, the need to have kids, and the need to retain talent meant nothing to us.<br><br>We played a role in Singapore's success, contributing to the government coffers via income tax, but we always feel left out where benefits are concerned.<br><br>Not so long ago, I broke out in cold sweat after hearing some minister propose means testing.<br><br>In Singapore, it is neither the Malays nor the Chinese that are marginalised; it is the families earning $8,000 and more.<br><br>Perhaps it is time the Government relooks income qualifying levels to more accurately reflect today's standard of living.<br><br>Lee Wee Chong<br><br><span class="small"></span></div>

Unfortunately, they don't seem to realise that there is no ONE MAGIC formula for all. There are always exceptions, just like statistical analysis, that defy the norm.<br><br>What our 'infallible' govt should do is include exceptional cases and qualifying criteria for those that are evidently left out. To do this, the govt must have dilligently study every facet of the problem first.

Government policy maybe well covered, but the flexibility is not there. Base on young couple, 30yr x 1-2k loan is common. The point is buying house is very different from buying a car.
