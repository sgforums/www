Have anyone considered that?<br><br>Both parent continue to work. Hire a maid? So the children can learn to speak bahasa better English? Or let them grow up with grandparents and become child deliquence? Look at the current society and look at how many problem child comes from families where they do not get attention from their parents.<br><br>Like what BillyBong said, analysis and read between the lines. I think this couple knows what they are doing and don't want to have kids for the sake of having it. They probably have no problem with their current lifestyle without children but read that they are facing these challenges now because they want to have children. They may be thinking of downgrading for the sake of the child but kenna jammed by HDB ruling.<br><br>If they are as educated as BillyBong says, they probably did a lot of planning for what's best for their kid. And what's best needs money. These are acts of responsible parents.<br><br>Of course, anyone can live reasonably well with $8000. Our bloody Gahmen gives us only $350 a month when we retire. But should we go back to the stone age? People progress, not regress.<br><br>As for the thread starter. I think you should improve your English and read carefully. Where did the author claim credit for Singapore success? He is just saying that he did his part also and should deserve the same benefits as others. Maybe you're just jealous about them earning $8000.<br><br>We should not be blinded by anger just because this couple makes "slightly" more than $8000 a month. If he makes like $20k then he should go to hell but throw at stone in Raffles Place and there's a 90% chance it'll land on someone earning more than $4000 a month.<br><br>$8000 alot or not I don't know lah. Depends on how you spend. But for a MacDonald's meal to cost between $6-7 nowadays and $1.50 for a freaking mug of coke, I think that $8000 mark that has been there for ages need to be moving upwards.<br><br></div></blockquote>Since as pointed out the couple are educated and wise people so i guess bringing the child out of the 'bahasa' and child deliquence shhould not be a problem. moreover it depends on how a family plans time off with kids so that they stay attached to the mother and father. the couple is wise so that should rule out this minor problem. like i wrote before if you can't even take care of kids like u manage your staff, how the hell will yr boss pay you to raise your status to an '8k duet'?<br><br>the government is not intersted in raise the income level of the rich...itsup to the individual rich to be resourceful ennough to make themselve richer. the government is concerned about the widening income gap of this as compared to the poor.</div>
