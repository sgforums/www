Take the ST article case if the cause can be justified i don't believe the authority will not work a way out for the couple. But a rigid and forceful law and statement has to be in place to hidder any higher income group from abusing the previleges thatare meant for those who are truely in need. Until the 8k figure has been reviewed again there is nothing much we can do. This thread also rooted out many individuals whom are naive, young and most probably have not been through hardships and poor living conditions. People who refuses to face up to reality.</div>

He has only 4 passes at O level and is making more than 5k every month.<br><br>There are tons of people out there who earns more than 4k. Can all of them afford to buy private? let alone landed?

Which private estate today cost 500k and less? So far, the only 500k housing I know of are ECs and resales. Unless you are looking at a studio apartment, most private homes are going at $600k above.<br><br>At this rate, that poor couple can't even afford to buy a 5 room HDB resale in Bedok. Throw in parents as dependents, living expenses...<br><br>Now I'm beginning to see why they have problems.<br><br>Maybe they did stretch themselves further than they should, may not. We don't know. If they did, I am sure there's a valid reason for it. For example, why pay over $500k for a 99 year, 5 year old HDB.<br><br>But regardless of whether they buy a private or a resale. It really does leave them with not much savings. And if they are thinking of having kids. I can see why they are feeling the crunch.<br><br>I say the govt should relook this issue and remove or increase the 8k ceiling. They can also pin a age limit (like below 28 ) to avoid abuse.<br><br>I mean, here is a couple who wants to have children and genuinely has difficulties. Why not help them out. After all, the govt does want people to have more children.<br><br>Btw, just out of curiosity. Anyone knows how long that ceiling has remained at 8k?</div>
