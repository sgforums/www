We pay taxes to the government, we expect them to make good use of our money. If they allow the investment branch to squander the nation's resources, then are they fit to even handle the nation's resources? They should well be aware of every cent that is being spent instead of raising taxes and collecting money so freely.<br><br>or could it be they are trying to push all responsibility to Temesek.<br>Comon', we're not fools. everyone makes mistakes. if it was a bad investment, just admit it and move on. im sure singaporeans are forgiving.<br><br>its like a kid being caught eating on the train, and the parent says: its not my fault, fine the kid, dont fine me.<br></div></blockquote>You right!

The govt has decided to maximise your money and grow your money for you. So what is wrong with that?<br><br>And again you ignore the track record of Temasek. They have acheived 18% total returns since inception. Temasek top management people consist of Senior fund managers and experienced CEOs of listed companies like Koh Boon Hwee. Ho Ching herself is an economist and an engineering graduate. Are they not people with entrepreneurship and investing experience?<br><br>This set back will erode the profits for FY2006, but does that mean everybody on Temasek board of directors should resign? I would think that the entire board has learned a valuable lesson from this set back and as such it does not make sense to demand the resignation of the BOD in Temasek.<br><br>At the end of the day, Temasek Holdings is still liable to its shareholder.</div>

I was so amused by it that I couldnt resist replying to your post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You really make me laugh. Firstly, you should get your facts right. There are no politicians sitting on the Board of Temasek Holdings.<br><br>Secondly, 18% returns were based on total shareholder return. If you cant trust that figures, why dont you lodge a complain with the MoF and ask them to launch an investigation into Temasek Holdings blance sheets?<br><br>The fact remains that one needs a good education in order to be a much more capable person. Accumulating Knowledge is a never ending journey which every person should undertake. And studying is one of the methods one can employ in acquiring knowledge.<br><br>Also, I suggest you take up an employment with Temasek as an investment manager if you think you can do a better job than their investment managers.<br><br>I do not see a basis for Temasek Holdings to lie about their results. They are a large investment firm with key stakes in strategic companies in other parts of the world. Lying about their corporate results is a lose-lose situation that does not benefit the company in the long run.<br><br>So dear sir, I suggest you continue to go back in your own world of fiction and daydream more about fictitious conspiracies which serves no real purpose for anybody other than yourself. Kindly do not rebut with fiction in future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
