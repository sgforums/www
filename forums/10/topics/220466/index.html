            <div class='col-md body'>The very first sentence of Today's headline reports blared: Did the Government of Singapore agree with Temasek's investment in Shin Corp?<br><br>assuming they didnt agree because temesek is independent of government.<br>Well who do we pay taxes to? We pay taxes to the government, we expect them to make good use of our money. If they allow the investment branch to squander the nation's resources, then are they fit to even handle the nation's resources? They should well be aware of every cent that is being spent instead of raising taxes and collecting money so freely.<br><br>or could it be they are trying to push all responsibility to Temesek.<br>Comon', we're not fools. everyone makes mistakes. if it was a bad investment, just admit it and move on. im sure singaporeans are forgiving.<br><br>its like a kid being caught eating on the train, and the parent says: its not my fault, fine the kid, dont fine me.<br></div>

They employ people to do that. Our country follows a system of capitalism, if you want the govt to control everything, we might as well switch to a system of communism.<br><br>Since the mistake was made by Temasek Holdings, shareholders have every right to voice their displeasure at the management and fire them if they no longer have confidence in their performance.<br><br>But I think, everybody makes mistakes, nobody is perfect. And as such, MoF isnt calling for anybody to be axed at Temasek yet. Like what Tharman Shanmugaratnam said " Temasek has been riding the risk well and its returns since 2002 were well above 18%".<br></div></blockquote>who are the shareholders?<br><br>the 18% profit is merely hearsay.<br><br></div>
