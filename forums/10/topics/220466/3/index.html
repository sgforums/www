They have now changed their objective to that of a leading world class investor. So I suppose you got to give the company some time in establishing itself.</div>

Terroism nowadays strikes not only in Bombing... Can oso strike speculating our currency... Our government would need those reserves to stablize our currency in case of any attacks...<br><br>Do you see Y Temasek is agressively buying into other countries' Banks, Air Line, Telcos recently...? Do u tink it is for $$ returns only? I tink it is oso for Defense purposes... I stress again my view that Nobody would expect The Man In Power to lose His Power overnite.. And many businesses are clinched not going by the front door... Nonetheless I tink someone has to made responsible for the case of Shin Corp.</div>

The govt has decided to maximise your money and grow your money for you. So what is wrong with that?<br><br>And again you ignore the track record of Temasek. They have acheived 18% total returns since inception. Temasek top management people consist of Senior fund managers and experienced CEOs of listed companies like Koh Boon Hwee. Ho Ching herself is an economist and an engineering graduate. Are they not people with entrepreneurship and investing experience?<br><br>This set back will erode the profits for FY2006, but does that mean everybody on Temasek board of directors should resign? I would think that the entire board has learned a valuable lesson from this set back and as such it does not make sense to demand the resignation of the BOD in Temasek.<br><br>At the end of the day, Temasek Holdings is still liable to its shareholder.</div></blockquote>Ok brader...or sister...I got your point....Yes 18% seems like a big sum...but brader, it still cannot be ignored that they made a lost with using <strong>PEOPLE'S MONIES</strong>. And even if they have fund managers, could the FUND MANAGER be the CEO? Why? An economist, is not an Investor. A Engineer is not an Investor. Economists studies behaviours in market and market changes. Engineers are well...engineers. so really cant we have someone more credible?<br><br>A valuable lesson yes...But what makes you so sure that this mistake wont be made again...I'll say again...It's not their money they're handling...That's why, if a loss occur, She'll just say...hey i dont regret it...I cant say that she say so cause its not her money. But really, thats what makes normal people pissed about the whole situation. What makes you so sure after, suzhou, Optus and Shin corp....Three by the way...they'll not do the same...<br><br>Yes i do not claim to be a fortune teller. And i do not claim that i know how the market would change over the next few years...Hence, i salute you for really being able to support your arguments well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But then it still makes me wonder, after these three events why is she still there in the first place...Really, if you want to make an investment company, put a fund manager as CEO. Yes, maybe the presence of employees-type-of-people is to make sure the employee side is represented. But again, shes not earning from the investment...shes earning a stable amount of salary per month...irregardless of the losses...</div>

Its a well known fact that we must admit, eventually.<br><br>How transparent you want Temasek to be? Like how they dig NKF ah? Dream on la. Most of us agree that it impossible to send people in to check on their sums.  They say 18% increase then 18% lor.. If you know the truth, is your tax gonna get cut? In the end also squeeze ballx and kanna tax. Money go gahmen.<br><br>I know $4Billion is bloody alot. Can change into many 10cents and flood SG.

Why argue if she gonna get sack or resign. Face the real world of SG, HC will never kanna sack nor will she resign. FULL STOP. No need evidence or proof or quote from watever magazine. Its a well known fact that we must admit, eventually.<br><br>How transparent you want Temasek to be? Like how they dig NKF ah? Dream on la. Most of us agree that it impossible to send people in to check on their sums.  They say 18% increase then 18% lor.. If you know the truth, is your tax gonna get cut? In the end also squeeze ballx and kanna tax. Money go gahmen.<br><br>I know $4Billion is bloody alot. Can change into many 10cents and flood SG.
