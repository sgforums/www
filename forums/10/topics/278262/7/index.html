I don't know why people expect the people to gather and carry banners and whatever, knowing this is illegal and people are not given the democracy in doing so.   I want to say that those who turned up at least they prove they care by their action, they are better than people who keep talking and do nothing and some are so damn good to communicate about their unrealistic expectation and condemn the silent protest .   I suggest these people to start their own protests by carrying banners and all and see what the outcome is.<br><br>In general, people of Singapore are fearful and some inhibited.  Many are so afraid they will get caught if they wear  black for shopping.  Knowing this fact, we did not expect thousands to turn up.  As such, the move was a small success on its own.   Many of us believe as they plan more of such events, more will come to join afterall we went and came back safely, nobody was arrested.  The fear of being caught while wearing black to shop is unfounded.<br></div>

It was circulated through the net and not in other form of communication.    Hope the next time, they will do more on publicising the event.   Just to add, event was extended to other shopping malls as well but again with limited publicity not many know about it.   My friend told me he went to Raffles City and saw many wore black, Raffles City was one of the venues for the move.</div>

That is why the event was meant to be a shopping trip with people wearing black to send the intended message to the gahmen.  Imagine if yesterday the people were to wear black carry banners and march in groups, were they not get caught and blacklisted?  So to carry out the event silently is the only sensible way for a start.</div>
