They want to let the gahmen know that Singaporeans are not happy with what they are doing, making buying annuity compulsory, making policies without consideration for the people.   To go there in groups with signboards and so on are illegal, that is the reason why they rather be there in black, do it in silence to alert the gahmen.   There is already publicity by REuters on this event and by now the gahmen is aware of it.</div>

I agree with you that it is important to have a <strong>strong </strong>message to pass across. The <strong>strong</strong> message can come in form of uniform of loud Slogan, banners with clear message display, gestures, body language, dress code and even road march.<br><br>Protesters have to keep themselves close together and express themselves clearly. When this is done, if police want to disperse them the leader have to decide to carry on or not.
