They want to let the gahmen know that Singaporeans are not happy with what they are doing, making buying annuity compulsory, making policies without consideration for the people.   To go there in groups with signboards and so on are illegal, that is the reason why they rather be there in black, do it in silence to alert the gahmen.   There is already publicity by REuters on this event and by now the gahmen is aware of it.</div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>I agree. However, Singapore is a country where unapproved protests are illegal and they have never given a permit to anyone who applied.

Just be prepared for disappointments. Case in point was the casino issue. One casino was planned. After public feedback and 3 opposition party's disagreements, the PAP decided to go ahead - with *two*.<br><br>Regards</div>

In the past two years, petitions against a pay-and-perks scandal at a national charity and against the introduction of casino gambling drew thousands of signatures.<br><br>Saturday's protest -- announced on political blogs and online forums -- is set to test Singapore's limits on freedom of assembly, as organisers merely suggest participants turn up at 4 p.m. at the Centrepoint mall, dressed "partly" in black.<br><br>Law student and online activist Choo Zheng Xi told Reuters he does not expect a strong turn-out, as other small-scale protest actions in the past months have drawn a massive police presence as well as plainsclothes policemen filming protesters.<br></blockquote>Police states are the safest places on Earth, aren't they?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> They even seek to protect the interest of the public from being caught up in the demonstrators' actions...</div>
