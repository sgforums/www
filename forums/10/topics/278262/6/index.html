The main reason why many did not wear black is because they are still fearful though they are told wearing black to shop is not illegal.    ON our way, we saw many in black outside Centrepoint, and along Orchard.   I am so surprised to see so many aunties in black.    Saw groups of teenagers wearing black in groups of less than 5, saw many couples in black, saw single ladies in black.<br><br>This is just the beginning.</div>

Taken to extreme, it means you can do anything as you wished, not just protest. Protest would be considered mild in relation to the freedom to kill, rob and squat in your room. And again, the term democracy is often quoted left and right without knowing its full meaning, the history, the development and the socio-political context. You have a long way to go before you realised the correct meaning and its implications. I don't mean to be condescending ..... I would have mis-used the term democracy and freedom years ago when I was fresh out of school!</div>

"If i have to shoot 200,000 ignorant students to save 1.3billion chinese from another 100 years of sorrow and poverty, though it pains me through and through.....let me alone bear the price and sins"<br><br><blockquote>''Supposing Catherine Lim was writing about me and not the prime minister...She would not dare, right? Because my posture, my response has been such that nobody doubts that if you take me on, I will put on knuckle-dusters and catch you in a cul de sac... Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle dusters. If you think you can hurt me more than I can hurt you, try. There is no other way you can govern a Chinese society.'' </blockquote>rephrase... "I am not fighting for myself.... as a leader of singapore, i fight for everyone who rallies to my banner......In the real world... we cannot expect mercy from our opponents... naviety and a heart of innocence sounds hollow and cannot be used as an excuse when you fail your people and those who place their lives and their family in your hand."<br><br><blockquote>"Put it this way. As long as Jeyaretnam [Workers' Party leader] stands for what he stands for -- a thoroughly destructive force -- we will knock him. There are two ways of playing this. One, you attack the policies; two, you attack the system. Jeyaretnam was attacking the system, he brought the Chief Justice into it. If I want to fix you, do I need the Chief Justice to fix you? Everybody knows that in my bag I have a hatchet, and a very sharp one. You take me on, I take my hatchet, we meet in the cul-de-sac. That's the way I had to survive in the past. That's the way the communists tackled me. He brought the Chief Justice into the political arena." </blockquote>rephrase... "we all fight to win... even a bird fights to survive by catching the early worm... who wants to loose?"<br><br><blockquote>"Political reform need not go hand in hand with economic liberalisation. I do not believe that if you are libertarian, full of diverse opinions, full of competing ideas in the market place, full of sound and fury, therefore you will succeed." </blockquote>repharse... "there are many systems of govt, each have its pros and cons... there are no perfect system... ultimately its the qualities, the character and the skills of the leaders in power that decides if a system succeed or fail."</div>
