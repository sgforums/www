            <div class='col-md body'>In Jan 2003 this year I was arrested for a crime I did not commit (along the lines of molest). I was released a few hours later on bail as the so called Victim claimed that I touched her about 2 years + ago in a lift. No evidence, No Nothing and yet I have to be arrested  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  as she claimed to positiely identify me 2 years later near my HDB blocks as I later found out that she stayed in my block too... It's a new neighbourhood with new flats so we don't often meet.<br><br>Now I'm constantly worrying about the outcome of the case even though I know nothing will probably happen to me as I REALLY hate to remain a Suspect!!! The police have recommened "No Further Action" and all I'm waiting for right now after 2 statements taken is for the DPP to reply and return the IP(investigation papers) to the police to recomend them what to do. Sigh I found out police have to listen to them.<br><br>Can any kind police or lawyer guys or just anyone give me advice on what I can do except wait wait n wait ...  Do the police really take that long to close a case like this or just all cases in general. It has been about 5 months and still no confirmed news...<br><br>Thank you,<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

It was to my own good fortune that there was a Neighborhood Police Post at the void deck of my assailant's block; and I managed to convince the Station Sergeant to take the particulars of my assailant.<br><br>One would have thought that the Investigating Officer's Department would have the initiative to act on the information from me that the assailant has been positively identified by myself, and that his particulars are with a specific NPP station. To my surprise, I was advised by the colleague of the Investigating Section to inform the NPP Sergeant to contact the Investigating Section.<br><br>This is the problem with what an average Singaporean can encounter, when one has no influence, connection, or fame; and this is despite the fact that I am educated and know my own rights under the law.<br><br>What will the treatment be to an average housewife, or anyone from the lower income group, who are largely lesser educated ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trust me I know excatly what u mean.... I had to contact the AGC myself to get the fax numbers so I can actually fax a request to check the status of my case. Shortly which I was replied with a mail saying that they will "start ???" to take notice of my case. Imagine what would happen if I never even bother to search for help. I know that everyone is busy in his or her own way, but keeping an innocent person in the shadow of doubt isn't excatly justice to that particular person.... I do know a friend who know a particicular DPP but I don't really want to go that far to clear my name.</div>
