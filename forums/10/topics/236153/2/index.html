Singapore air force simply does not require KC-135s for the time being. KC-135 seen to serve more to aid US military operation. Singapore now boasts a broad array of military paraphernalia  spying-satellite?, submarine, F-16 jet fighters, Apache helicopters, Rapier missiles and AIM-120C. Is this what it takes to defend an island country?<br></div></blockquote>Unless your defence plan involves only having enough of an army to put up a resistance in war but is effectively dumb and blind in times of peace and is not really a deterrence to the determined agressor, that would not be the way to go.<br><br>There is a difference between a defence, and a deterrence. In our case we need to have a deterrence... indeed if you have armed forces that are only enough to protect the physical aspect your nation, but not your interests, you will not last long as an independent player if you are a nation like Singapore.<br><br>As Dr. M said, there are more then one ways to skin a cat. Even if an invasion is unfeasible, an agressive nation could find a lot of ways to make life miserable and difficult for Singapore without outright war. If we do not have some form of power-projection, given our size and location... what's to stop other nations from playing real big punk?<br><br>Our old defence was based on the "poisioned shrimp" idea, where we had a defence force strong enough to inflict damage to an agressor even if we were finished in the end, but quite long ago people kinda of realized that this idea was incomplete, for a much larger enemy with more resources could simply do other things to mess up your nation without firing a shot. Without an effective armed forces that proves power-project is possible... would not many nations already mess around? It is difficult to rely on the goodwill of others when often what they want might be very different from what you want.<br><br>So our KC-135s, and what have you obviously exist for a good reason. Singapore needs a big bite, enough to make one consider many things before going too far on their own plans which might be bad for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put it this way: We have no strategic depth, aside from the body of water that separates us between any potential enemy. If one of our armies gets obliterated, there will be no way we can raise another, and equip it. We have no significant manufacturing capability and it is difficult to retool any factory for the job. Essentially, if we don't build up now, we will not get the chance to build up in wartime. We will be at the mercy of any superpower we choose to align with, and if the said superpower decides to sacrifice us, we are deep in shit. So either we do a Malta like what the Maltese did in WWII, or we fall as we did to the Japanese as the British felt that they could not afford to sustain operations in the Far East. It was only in 1944 did they actually send a carrier battlegroup to Cylon only to play cat and mouse with the Japanese navy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know a case to point was the Royal Navy. It was too focused at anti-submarine warfare vis a vis the Soviet Union and when it came to the Falklands, it lacked the capability to commit to amphibious and air operations, so much so it had to call upon an old and creaking aircraft carrier and even cargo ships to do the job. Worse, defence cutbacks resulted in destroyers and frigates that actually flammable; one hit from an Exocet sent them flaming because of the flammable Aluminium they were constructed of. I guess that is what you want with our ships?</div>
