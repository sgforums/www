A fully professional army? We simply don't have enough manpower to create a professional army. The full strength of the SAF is to the order of 300000++ men. If you want a professional army of that size, not only is it going to cost lots, but it's going to drain massive manpower from the economy.<br><br>Some may say that technology nowadays allows wars to be fought with the push of a button. I say that's a very naive and short-sighted perception. With all the technology that we have, we still need the troops on the ground to fight and win the war. You still need sailors to man the ships. No war has ever been won by pressing a few buttons.<br><br>I won't deny that NS does have its share of problems. However, I see it as a necessary evil we must have in order for the greater good of keeping the peace and prosperity we have worked so hard for. The function of the SAF is not just to go to war if the need calls for it, but to also make any potential enemies piss in their pants and think twice about playing punk with us. Having a professional army is an alternative, but it is one we can't afford.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only other alternatives to conscription that I can think of are these: fully professional army, and mercenaries. I think we can discount the second, for even though we have a small contingent of Gurkhas, when it comes to defending the country, you cannot rely on mercenaries.<br><br>As for a fully professional army, I doubt that the majority of the personnel in that kind of army would really be serving for the sake of patriotism/honour/glory alone. Most people would rather do other jobs than soldiering. Army regulars are mostly people who lack the education and skills to survive in other jobs outside. So in the end mostly you'll still get reluctant and worse still, incompetent, soldiers in your army.</div>

The answer: when the enemy arrives at your door an you are not amond the elite who can get away, you will fight. Most will not be able or want to to go away. Most will remain to fight. NS is necessary to train our men so they know how to fight.<br><br>As for those who would dodge NS, leave them and their families to be raped and killed....serves them right!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Under the current conscription scheme, national service duties are imposed on only a section of the adult population. Like many, I feel that it is discriminatory and needs to be changed. In my opinion, all citizens and even permanent residents should perform "national service" in Singapore. It should be an obligation for all to contribute to the good of our society, and the nation. In order to impose that, we need to re-examine what "national service" meant to us, and re-evaluate our conscription policy.<br><br>In my opinion, "national service" is an obligation imposed on the residents of a country to perform a duty to the nation. National service should not be confined to services in the military, police or civil defence force. It should encompass the entire framework of public and social services to society, and the nation. Beside the defence forces, services in healthcare, education, welfare etc can be made to be part of the broader scope of national service. This will further extend and broaden the concept of "Total Defence".<br><br>After having re-defined "national service" to a broader concept, we need to re-evaluate our conscription policy. As the saying goes, you can bring the horse to the water, but you cannot force the animal to drink it. Having reluctant soldiers will put Singapore at a bigger risk. Having reluctant NS policemen will not make our society any safer from criminals. We should scrape our current conscription policy, and look for new ways where all the residents can perform their national service with motivation and commitment. This new national service scheme must be made flexible enough for all adult residents (male, female, PRs) to perform, as well as options available for them to undertake the services that they believe in and are committed to. With this form of "compulsory volunterism", national service will no longer be discriminatory, divisive and nonmeaningful to the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I'm a "reluctant soldiers" being force to enter the Ns, have no choice. But come to think of it. Singapore is so small with so little population. Could we really can have a huge force of regular amry? If we did have a huge force of regular amry than how about the private sector? will we have enough people to run the econmy of the country? i Dun think so.<br><br>Yes most of the soldiers has the thinking of serving and faRK off. But at least we did learn some basic military skill in which in time of war as least we know how to handle the weapon that is handle to us.. rather than not serving and not even knowing about basic military stuff. When the end is near, do we have a choice? We have no choice, either surrender or fight. Some will fight, some will surrender. But it better than having a whole population of men not knowing how to handle their weapon and basic military stuff.</div>
