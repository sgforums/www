              <p>There is always a salary gap but not necessary a low and high spectrum of society, for society is not divided according to your salary. and those will high income, whether by salary or inheritance, are by no means 1st class!!! you drive BM I drive toyota and sometimes take MRT, you think you are 1st class?</p>
              <p>A diamond jewelry with the original price of $5000, and you get it for $2000, that is cheap. A costume jewelry by a designer costing $200 is a low cost jewelry, but if they want to sell you for $250, then it is expensive.</p>
              <p>In Thailand, where you pay 300 babt or S$15 per day for a construction worker,  is it cheap or expensive? Low salary doesn't mean cheap!! You father told you not to be obssessed with $, but he should teach you the value of money.</p>
              <p>You also should wonder why in Thailand 300 babt a day people can raise a family.</p>
              <p>Now Holden is leaving oz, a name that is iconic to oz, a company that is employing over tens of thousands of workers. to the workers now the difference is between 1st class citizens in developed country or no job as low class citizens in developed country.</p>

              You are correct in saying that there will always be a salary gap. The question is how wide is the gap. There are articles suggesting that the gap has widened, the topic has also been discussed in paliarment by some female opposition MP and in this case i feel that the oppositions stand has merit.
              
              Yes holden is going down and Oz govt has stated that they will be concentrating efforts on placing the staff into jobs..that is for their people/govt to decide. As for the no job part...in Oz its more to do with not wanting to work since the govt provides an interim salary if you cannot find work...some abuse it. As long as you want to work the minimum wage policy they have will protect their people. That 40k salary u mentioned further up the thread is like entry lvl...ill giv a better e.g. the cashier in yer NTUC Fairprice....40k in Kmart. So after tax is what did u say 35k? Anyway this is sidetracking we r not debating wbhich country is betta remember?
              
              As for leaving SG alone...who am i to even be able to influence SG. You mean to say the forumners here have no mind to think for themselves? Trust me they definitely have the ability to read....understand....and draw their opinion. If it happens to be similar good if not also good...at least they have thought abt it. Democracy dude. So le de yi.

              <p>no argument with you on your latest post. As long as it is not something Singapore should do because developed countries like oz are doing it, I am fine. The situatiosn in different countries are different so we don't have to follow any example if we don't think it is relevant to us.</p>
              <p>There have been many discussions about minimum wages and I don't intend to do it again. income gap widening is happening everywhere, and in Singapore, we are not concerned about how much the richer ones made, the concern is whether we can make a living as long as we work.</p>
              <p>The measures we take is not to protect citizens with handouts, but to help them to be competitive. Minimum wages mean nothing if it cannot cope with high costs of living. How to keep the cost of living down? increase wages is definitely not the way.</p>

              <p>It all depends on your definitions. Income gaps are widened in practically every country involved in global economy, we don't see any social unrest that is directly related to income gaps. Look at the countries with social unrest in recent history, unrest resulted from corruption of officials, dictatorship, intolerance due to religious belief. Unless the poor really have no chance of a decent living, then they also don't care how high your income is, unrest, especially against the so called higher spectrum of the society.</p>
              <p>What is overpopulation? when there isn't enough housing, food supplies, hospitals and infra structures to cater for the population, even 2 million is overpopulated. If there are enough space created for 5 million, there is no overpopulation. Why should over population cause tension among races? some specific race not treated equally, left behind in the development?</p>
              <p>Hatred of FT, hmmm...very popular subject, what is Foreign Talent to you? the indian construction workers, the kopi xiao mei from PRC, the pinoy salesgirls, or the australia accountant, american executives, the british engineers?</p>
              <p>In the history of singapore, after independence, we experienced the british withdrawal in the 70s, we survived the asian financial crisis, we went through the impact of the us subprime crisis....

              (Reuters) - Every day, through eyes clouded by glaucoma, Peter witnesses the spending power generated by Singapore's economic success, knowing he can only afford to look.
              
              The 54-year-old shopping mall security guard is part of Singapore's hidden problem - a growing number of poor living on the margins in one of the world's most expensive cities.
              
              The party that has run the city state since independence in 1965 has always preached the virtues of self-reliance, but for some the cost of looking after themselves has moved beyond their means.
              
              Peter fears that he cannot afford to treat his glaucoma, a condition that could threaten his sight, despite being eligible for subsidized surgery and other state benefits.
              
              He was told treatment would cost over S$4,000 ($3,200), but the ailment only qualifies him to take up to S$1,700 from his state-administered healthcare savings.
              
              Peter, who wanted his surname to be withheld as he did not have his employer's permission to speak to media, earns around S$1,600 ($1,300) a month working in the glitzy Orchard Road area.
              
              Half of his salary goes paying off S$20,000 of debts run up when his wife broke her ankle two years ago, and they are also still paying off their small flat in a public housing block.
              
              "We have no savings," he mumbled, recounting how he had borrowed from 18 moneylenders after his wife's accident.
              
              COMPULSORY SAVINGS
              
              Singapore operates a system of compulsory savings, supplemented by employer contributions, for retirement and healthcare through its Central Provident Fund (CPF). Private insurance schemes are also available.
              
              Yet, Mindshare, a global media and marketing services firm, found in a survey last year that 72 percent of Singaporeans felt they "cannot afford to get sick due to high medical costs".
              
              Data for 2002 to 2011 shows the government paid for less than one third of all healthcare costs, whereas the average for developed countries in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development was between 60-70 percent.
              
              Mounting unease over the number of voters who feel excluded from the comforts of living in Singapore has persuaded the People's Action Party (PAP) to re-set its goals.
              
              At a convention this month, the ruling party issued its first new resolution in 25 years, promising to improve living standards for all, create quality jobs, and provide affordable healthcare.
              
              Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing said the government is ready to help citizens struggling to meet medical costs, but some were unaware of the support available.
              
              "Very often, the people who are most in need may not read the newspapers, access the Internet or even understand English," he told parliament last month. "They need people who can talk to them in their language, people who will knock on their doors, check on them to see whether they are okay, and explain some of these assistance schemes to them."
              
              MORE MILLIONAIRES, BIGGER GAP
              
              The city-state has seen a huge rise in wealth over the past decade as it positioned itself as a luxury low-tax base for ultra-wealthy people from across the world.
              
              Per-capita GDP of S$65,048 exceeds that of the United States and Germany. And surveys highlight how Singapore, with a population of 5.4 million people, has more millionaires per capita than any other country. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranks it as the world's sixth most expensive city.
              
              But data published by the CPF shows the proportion of Singaporeans earning less than half the median income - an international yardstick for measuring the proportion of poor people -- rose to 26 percent in 2011 from 16 percent in 2002.
              
              "As one of the world's richest nations, we can afford to do better," Caritas Singapore, the Catholic Church's social outreach arm, said at the launch of an advertising and social media campaign to highlight the plight of the poor.
              
              About 12 percent of the 2 million Singaporeans at work earn less than S$1,000 a month. Whereas, Hui Weng Tat, an associate professor in economics at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, reckons a typical worker needs a minimum S$1,400-S$1,500 a month to cope with living costs.
              
              The city-state's Gini co-efficient, a measure of income inequality, hit 0.478 in 2012, according to government figures, higher than every other advanced economy aside from Hong Kong.
              
              Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore has not set an official poverty line, and the government has rejected calls to introduce a minimum wage.
              
              What PAP has done is to make it harder for firms to recruit low-cost foreigners, tighten requirements to boost wages at the low-end, and amend labor laws to give more job security.
              
              There are also plans to expand social protection and increase spending on healthcare. And while Singapore isn't going to raise income tax anytime soon, it has raised taxes on bigger cars and luxury homes.
              
              "There's more to be done," Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said during a recent dialogue with diplomats and university students. "I'm not satisfied with the situation in the way it is."

              Success? Sincerely doubt it. Sgdie is so blinded by his arrogance and ego to see Singapore for what it truly is. From his posts, he considers his words to be the golden, undisputable truth and any alternate views are unacceptable and just totally wrong (to him).
              On the bright side, he has shown strong potential to be a PAP candidate. After all, he does possess the qualities of a PAP politician.
