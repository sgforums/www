              <p>Yeah dun take my opinion too srsly it is after all just one
              persons perception.</p>
              <p>Well in australia i dun think we have chaipng but i guess a good
              comparison wud b yong tau foo which in china town is like 10aud.
              But then the cost of labours higher as well so it sorta evens out.
              I guess if someone from the lower spextrum wanted to save $ they
              cud always cook their meals.</p>
              <p>Its been a good exchange of viewpts thx.</p>

              <p>You have a very interesting sense of economic and logic. rich people pay less tax so poor people share heavier burden, as if it is a zero sum game. Food is cheap here because there are cheap labour here. this one lagi best, your government tax rich people to pay the poor..hahaha...modern robin hood.</p>
              <p>Your cheapest food is like 10aud, "but the the cost of labours higher as well so it sorta evens out", now what the hell do you mean? higher labour cost justifies higher food costs?</p>
              <p>we don't have lower or higher spextrum of people here. Here we make our money with our head high (with our own skills without social security, special priviledges, concessions) and we live our own life. some eat plata some eat rice, nasi lemak or chaipng, sometimes we eat chaipng with copi 0. sometimes ramen with green tea, and sometimes pasta with wine.  cooking at home could be more costly than eating at food court, if we really want to save $ we go home eat with our parents. who the hell care if you call us first world country or fourth world country.</p>
              <p>By the way, when you arrived at oz, did they complain you took away their job, even as cheap labour? and what spextrum do you think you belong in oz now?</p>

              <p>the mathematic is very simple.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we don't pay tax for the first S$20,000, you start paying after A$18,200.</p>
              <p>here for the next S$10,000 we pay 2%, or S$200. You pay A$2242, or 19 cents for each A$1 over A$18,200.</p>
              <p>if i make S$40,000 a year in Singapore, we pay a total of S$550 in income tax. you pay A$4,547!!</p>
              <p>here we are taxed up to 20%, you are taxed up to 44.9%, you like working for your country, belly patriotic.</p>
              <p>Your country is certainly first world, no poor people, all higher spextrum, the government tax everyone of you, to pay the poor, and who are they? those who are inefficient and no jobs.</p>

              <p>It is not a Singapore australia debate. We are a small country, you are a big continent. and we do think differently. We do what is relevant to us, not to follow the queen or the big brother the US.</p>
              <p>What passport do you hold? if you are holding australia passport, you are oz, not Singaporean. Born in Singapore means nothing if you don't contribute to Singapore.</p>
              <p>No, we tax the poor a lot less than Australia tax yours. Read my comparison carefully. We don't have high spextrum or low spectrum in our society. We are different from you.</p>
              <p>Rich people can go many places, like england (where those from the middle east like to go), or states (where rich Chinese like to go), they come to Singapore because we are a safe place to race family, a multi - racial place where they live at peace with people of different races, a harmonious place where they can worship freely...to the rich people, what is paying more tax.</p>

              <p>Yes I understand that it is staggered, it is the same in

              <p>I once had kopi with a uncle at kopitiam who chatted me out of

              <p>Uncle:"boy... I dun mind if I'm taxed 50% or even 99% over
              here.....agar the the 1% left enough for me to get along with my
              lifestyle can liao."</p>

              <p>It is staggering in Australia!!! not in Singapore.</p>
              <p>What is the use of raising the wages only to be taxed by the government. If I make S$40,000 a year, or around S$3000 a month, I only pay S$550 in income tax. with the money, I can pay S$2.50 for a cheap meal. In australia, you make A$40,000 a year and you have to pay A$4547 in tax, and you have to pay at least A10 for a meal.</p>
              <p>and you pay a 10% GST while we pay 7%.</p>
              <p>Every working people in Singapore want wages increases, and we get what is due. We don't get it because the food is expensive, for it is not. We get because we work hard and smart and we deserve it.</p>
              <p>With the strong S$ our buying power is strong, at this time of the year Singaporeans are all out of the country, you don't see us in australia meh?</p>
              <p>the uncle you talked to gia mm zai loh, wait till you kena tax 50% then he think he got disposable income or not.</p>
              <p>In case you do not know, we pay very high costs for cars and condo here, but our disposable income is a lot more than you think.</p>
              <p>when was the last time you were in Singapore?</p>

              <p>what you have in Singapore is really of no interest to me. But it sounds like you think you are in the high spectrum of the society you are in, and you gladly pay tax to help the poor. good the australian.</p>
              <p>Like I said, in Singapore, we are proud of who we are, how we earn our money, how we live our life. If we don't earn so much, chaipng is good enough, 3 room HDB is comfortable as long as we keep them clean, MRT can still take us places, go malaysia or thailand or hong kong for holiday by budget airlines very good liao. wage increase? who pay, how much? free money of course I want.</p>
              <p>I am not angry, don't get me wrong, this is how I write. We have our our problem in Singapore, like any places where there are people. But I have seen many friends who have migrated to places like Australia and thinking that we in Singapore are still living on trees.</p>
              <p>Make a trip to Singapore and see for yourself, I am sure you can afford it.</p>

              <p>hi Ocean Army, been to most parts of oz, including 1 month in Perth, enjoyed the places very much, but think it is better to bring $ there and enjoy rather than having to work there. I don't have a specific skill that is demanded in oz.</p>
              <p>agree with you, I don't entertain anyone who think they have moral high ground to teach us what we should do.</p>

                                Wasn't it a discussion to begin with. Why do use the word "teach"...inferiority complex much?
                                
                                ...know alot more than incoherent crap&gt; something i hav to admit.
                                
                                Ok ill admit. I think you cannot grasp the discussion, got angry and started vomiting verbal diarrhoea.

              <p>I didn't use the word "teach", you do. Here in Singapore we are 
              always prepared to learn, so that we can improve, even from other's 
              mistakes. But do you make mistakes so that you can teach others?</p>
              <p>We
               talked about many things in this exchange, but one important thing you 
              should know, here in Singapore we don't have the higher or lower 
              spextrum of people like you have in oz! you said you are not as 
              successful as your parents, but you think you are more successful than 
              others, with your houses in the best oz suburb, you are therefore in the
               high spextrum of you society.</p>
              <p>I live in Serangoon in one 
              house, and I am very happy, not obessed with money, like your parents 
              said, because I have enough, don't have to pay high income tax, can 
              settle a meal with 10S$, food and drink. Cheap labour? low salary 
              doesn't mean cheap! also having one house in Singapore doesn't mean less
               successful because 1 house here in Singapore is worthed more than 1 in 
              oz.</p>

              Replace teach with learn my typo.
              
              There is always a low &amp; high spectrum in any country. The important thing is the income gap. Ill use an easier example. You cannot have 100% of a class be 1st class hrs.
              
              Low salary doesnt mean cheap...then what is yer definition of cheap labour.
