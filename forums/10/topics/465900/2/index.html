              Fully agree, only the FT will dare to go on strike, climb up the crane to stop operation, mistreat the patient (for the healthcare) as all this was publish in the media before.  Whereas the local when face with work bully, they are still willing to work overtime and take the crap (again as publish in the media).  Thus the company of course is more willing to hire "FT".

              It is due to KPI, it is easier to screen local as most records of the local can be easier pull out.  Whereas for FT, more work will need to be done for screening.  And the way thing is show is always figures only (a way that our elites love to present as it can hide the true story).  Figure show that 10% of the staffs are being screen (I don't need to show are they local/FT), so who will you screen?  Not to mention that many doing the screening are FT themselves.

              NO PLACE FOR FOREIGN LOVING TRAITORS IN SINGAPORE:
              Finally, on 24th Sept., the PAP govt finally gave way and decided to adopt THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF EMPLOYING CITIZENS I.e. An employer cannot hire a foreign national unless a qualified Singaporean cannot be found to do the job - and this only applies to jobs paying below $12,000. It is long overdue that Singapore adopted this policy which is practiced by every country in the world incl. First World countries like the United States, Japan and the EU. For those of you Singaporeans who have been living all your lives in Singapore and have been brainwashed into allowing employers to hire on the basis of merit regardless of citizenship, may we suggest that you travel out of Singapore and tryout for an interview for a professional job in some First World country. You'll be so badly disappointed how foreigners can so easily interview for a job in Singapore.

              For the rest of those foreign-loving traitors who have promoted the hiring of foreigners and giving out PRs to every white collar foreigner in Singapore in the last 2 decades, there should be a death bounty on their heads - starting with Goh Chok Tong. They have opened their mouths in complete favor of hiring foreigners and betrayed the people of Singapore by spreading the so very common FT policy. So while we celebrate the change in the employment policies in Singapore which is more in line with the terms of employing citizens in all other countries, let us not forget the traitors who have drowned our country with foreigners, giving away professional jobs to foreigners instead of qualified Singaporeans and opened their mouths for equal or better treatment of foreigners over Singaporeans - They are enemies of the people of Singapore and to our beloved country. Always remember, they have committed treason and we the citizens of Singapore have every right to hunt down these traitors and exterminate them.

              It is all about timing.  The govt already once mention that this is a guideline and they won't come out legal law for this.   Thus already know that this policy won't work as there no legal law enforcing it.   Think when will be the G.E, it will be around 2015-2017 (The govt can call an Election 1 year early which is 2015).  Therefore 2014 Aug is a good time to implement this law.  It make the voters happy (even the policy won't work but voters won't know it, as the timeframe is too short to truly understand that this policy is just for show only).

              For every Singaporean who can do a job, you can always find a foreign national who can be more efficient and who is willing to work at half the wage somewhere around the world. All the govt. needs to do is to bring him/ her here to displace a Singaporean and force the Singaporean to leave Singapore. 
              Have you ever bothered to work in the US or EU. You will not believe how inefficient the people over there are. But it is the duty of a government to provide jobs to its citizens first - and if there are any leftovers, then those jobs are then open to foreigners. It's not a question of hiring on the basis of efficiency or meritocracy regardless of citizenship.

            <div class='col-md body'>All you need to do is pay a visit to the US. You will find that your bags take 3-8 times longer to come out in their airport than in our Changi airport. Does this mean the US airlines should replace their American cargo staff with Singaporeans so that the passengers won't have to wait so long for their bags? At the end of the day, it will be the less efficient, not-so-hardworking employed Americans (who are being paid first world wages) who will have the last laugh seeing inefficient Singaporeans put out of jobs and forced out of their own country by super efficient, lower wage foreigners.</div>

              This guy has a point. Govt should protect locals jobs.
              
              However i feel that the govt is more concerned that the companies will move out of singapore hence locals jobs are not as protected.
              
              They will need to understand that to protect the locals job is a duty and should not be sacrificed due to the threat of companies leaving for cheaper alternatives.

              <p>Most Singaporeans earn high salaries because we are more efficient, 
              more hard working, than any foreign talents. We have needed no bumi 
              policy to protect our jobs. That is our pride!!</p>
              <p>If you bothered to
               go to places like Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta or even Yangoon, you will 
              find thousands of Singaporean who are working there as expatriates or 
              doing their own ventures, they learn Chinese and Indonesian, they live 
              among the locals, and they earn higher salaries than them, nobody 
              complain they are there taking over jobs.</p>
              <p>All you need is to know
               some working people in EU or US, you will know how they like paying 40 
              to 50% income tax and yet get substandard public services, ask them and 
              they will tell you how proud they are of their system.</p>
              <p>If you are 
              good enough to in the position to recruit staff, then you will know that
               salaries and efficiency are not the only consideration for the right 
              candidate. Human relationship, expertise in the relevant fields, and 
              attitude of life and work are important factors too. If I interview 
              someone who feels he has the right to the job, I would tell him I have 
              the right not to recruit him.</p>
              <p>Who were forced to leave Singapore? 
              With due respect to many who have migrated, people left for their 
              greener pastures for a better life style, not for a free meal.</p>
              <p>It 
              is the duty of the government to look after the handicapped, the 
              underprivileged , the old aged. It is the duty of the government to 
              provide an environment for better learning, give every citizen the 
              opportunities to be educated and learn skill. It is their duty to teach 
              you how to fish, not to give you fish eveyday, sooner or later you will 
              complan why everyday fish.</p>
              <p>If you think you are inefficient, then
               ask if you are hard working. If you are not then you would be replaced,
               sooner or later, if not by foreign workers, by computer or robots.</p>

              <p>At the higher spectrum "skills in demand/educated professionals or the rich", singapore has to compete with the world to keep them in singapore simply becus they are mobile "many countries want them" and it has nothing to do with them being singaporeans or not. Whilst it is good that you harbour such pride.... the world really cudnt care less.</p>
              <p>In countries where you say the tax is 40%-50%. I cannot say for the other western nations but for australia this only occurs to the rich. The lower your salary the lower your tax. In a way its similar to "taking $ from the rich to give to the poor".</p>
              <p>In singapore it is different.... they want the rich to come to singapore....so they say we will tax you less.....similar to "taking less $ from the rich to give to the poor." So the poor has to shoulder a bigger burden.</p>
              <p>On another front you have industries/companies that depend on cheap labour to subsist. So labour is imported to keep wages lower or "to stay competitive with china" (more supply... pull factor of wages goes down).</p>
              <p>Therefore a) poor has to shoulder more tax since the rich is taxed less + b) wages on the lower spectrum have to stay coompetitive/cheap + c) cost of living in singapore as charlize wud say "chaipng veli asspensive" of cos i noe she baydeh lar</p>
              <p>= very unhappy lower spectrum + widening income gap</p>
              <p>And really.... don't you find it farnee that here we are trying to emulate 1st world countries there we are trying to compete with others to be cheaper/competitive and more efficient?</p>

              <p>you a Singaporean, living in OZ? you obviously are out of touch with what is happening here!!</p>
              <p>Singapore
               has long gone pass competing on cheap labour!! we are not in the 
              traditional labour industries such as textile, shoes, toys or electronic
               anymore, for such industries, even China sometimes lose out to Vietnam 
              and Bangladesh. We import cheap labour from China  "to stay competitive 
              with china" ? What economic theory is that?</p>
              <p>If you talk about the 
              people "At the higher spectrum" with "skills in demand/educated 
              professionals
              or the rich", the fact is that many singaporeans are already in this 
              catogory and are also present in many countries especially in the Asian 
              region. We are proud not because we are Singaporean, but we are who we 
              are today, because of what we did. If you need to have the government to
               ensure you are employed, you are pathetic and the world really don't 
              give a shit.</p>
              <p>You know what is the tax system in Singapore? you 
              should read about it first before you compare your australian system 
              with anywhere in the world. sometimes I think oz is too far and you need
               to swim a long way before you see the world.</p>
              <p>Singapore do not attract foreigners by taxing them less..."since the rich is
              taxed less and as a result the poor has to shoulder a bigger burden"...you know what are you talking about?</p>
              <p>In
               Singapore we still can pay S$2.50 for a plate of wanton noodle, $0.6 
              for a cup of soya bean drink, we can also pay $S8.50 for a bowl of 
              ramen, $2.5 for a soft drink, we can also pay $S15 for a pasta and $4 
              for a drink. you  pay $2.8 for chaipng with one vegie and one meat, 
              Charlize want 2 vegie 2 meat and 1 fish chaipng of course it costs more 
              lah...how much you need to pay in Australia for chaipng?</p>
              <p>"And 
              really.... don't you find it farnee that here we are trying
              to emulate 1st world countries there we are trying to compete with
              others to be cheaper/competitive and more efficient?" I find it farnee 
              you ask question like this, we are 1st world country, not trying to 
              emulate, and what is wrong with competing to be more cost effective and 
              efficient?</p>

              Yeah dun take my opinion too srsly it is after all just one persons perception.
              
              Well in australia i dun think we have chaipng but i guess a good comparison wud b yong tau foo which in china town is like 10aud. But then the cost of labours higher as well so it sorta evens out. I guess if someone from the lower spextrum wanted to save $ they cud always cook their meals.
