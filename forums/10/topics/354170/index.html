              <p><strong> Singapore PM: Core of 4th generation leadership not fully assembled</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Prime 
                      Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday that Singapore has not fully assembled 
                      the core of fourth generation leadership, local media reported. </span></p>
              <p><span>    According to TV broadcaster Channel newsasia, Lee 
                      said that the recent cabinet reshuffle is another step in the long process of 
                      self-renewal, and the critical task now is to identify, gather and prepare more 
                      people for the core of future leadership to assure Singapore's long-term future. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Lee told local reporters at the Istana, office of the 
                      president, that there is no change to the total number of office holders in this 
                      reshuffle, adding that he is keeping some of the older ministers to provide 
                      experience and advice especially during the economic crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Lee announced on March 26 to reshuffle his cabinet as 
                      part of continuing leadership renewal and testing out of younger office holders 
                      for broader responsibilities. Among the appointments, Defense Minister Teo Chee 
                      Hean will be appointed Deputy Prime Minister with effect from April 1. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Singapore's last general election was held in May 
                      2006 and the next general election is expected to take place by 2012. </span></p>

              <p>TS, if you're not aware, Singapore has been in the hands of foreigners since day 1.  Out of the old guard of 7, 6 of them were not born in Singapore.  LKY was the only Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Hence, I think there is little reason for restriction on "foreigners" who decide to settle here and take up politics here. </p>

              <p>Singapore was founded as a by an Indonesia prince some time between 1200 and 1300. It was known as Tumasik or, Singapura (the lion city). However, along with other parts of the Malay Peninsula, it was overrun and destroyed between 1360 and 1365 by Majapahit, a powerful Javanese kingdom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That time, there were many animals and lots of monkey until the prince set sail and step foot on it, it does not belong to the malay or anybody, so to speak, it belongs to the animals and the monkeys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then suddenly, more malays came in, follow by ang mos, then indians, then chinese, then babas, then my uncles....etc etc...so, actually hor, all we singaporeans are foreigners too, like me, from taiwan. So, who govt us is not important, the most important is that they must govern us to peace, healthy, harmony and prosperity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually hor, there is not much different, just like last time, alots of monkey here, now there is also alot of monkey business going on...</p>

              <p><span><strong>Kuan Yew says happy to rejoin Malaysia if...</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Bernama) - Some 10 years after remarking that
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore might rejoin Malaysia if the island state's economy faltered
                  and if Malaysia pursued meritocracy, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has
                  again spoken on the subject.</strong></span></p>
              <p>"They have got all the resources. If they would just educate the
                  Chinese and Indians, use them and treat them as their citizens, they
                  can equal us and even do better than us and we would be happy to rejoin
                  them," Lee said.</p>
              <p>Lee made the remark in an interview on Sept 27 with syndicated
                  columnist Tom Plate of the UCLA Media Center and new-media expert
                  Jeffrey Cole of the USC Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future.</p>
              <p>The transcript of the interview is available online on the UCLA Asia Institute website.</p>
              <p>In June 1996, Lee spoke about the possibility of Singapore rejoining
                  Malaysia, raising a storm on both sides of the Causeway with then
                  Malaysian prime minister Datuk Seri (now Tun) Dr Mahathir Mohamad
                  saying <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that he did not think that the time had come for that yet.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Dr Mahathir had also described the remark as just a means "to jolt Singaporeans" into their senses.</p>
              <p>- MORE<br> <br> The latest remarks by the Singapore founding father came after he was
                  asked about Singapore's "sense of endangerment"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> and why the island
                  state was worried about survivability in the long run.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Lee replied: "Where are we? Are we in the Caribbean? Are we next to
                  America like the Bahamas? Are we in the Mediterranean, like Malta, next
                  to Italy? Are we like Hong Kong, next to China and therefore, will
                  become part of China?</p>
              <p>"We are in Southeast Asia, in the midst of a turbulent, volatile,
                  unsettled region. Singapore is a superstructure built on what? On 700
                  square kilometres and a lot of smart ideas that have worked so far -
                  but the whole thing could come undone very quickly".</p>
              <p>To a question on who would come after Singapore, Lee replied: "When
                  (Malaysia) kicked us out (in 1965), the expectation was that we would
                  fail and we will go back on their terms, not on the terms we agreed
                  with them under the British.</p>
              <p>"Our problems are not just between states, this is a problem between races and religions and civilizations.</p>
              <p>- MORE</p>
              <p>"We are a standing indictment of all the things that they can be
                  doing differently. They have got all the resources.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> If they would just
                  educate the Chinese and Indians, use them and treat them as their
                  citizens, they can equal us and even do better than us and we would be
                  happy to rejoin them," he said.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analysts here do not see any possibility of a Malaysia-Singapore merger.</strong></span></p>
              <p>"The chances of a re-merger in 1996 and in 2007 are the same -
                  zero," said Dr Ooi Kee Beng, coordinator of the Malaysia study
                  programme at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and best-selling
                  author of 'The Reluctant Politician: Tun Dr Ismail and His Time'.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"The very idea of a re-merger on Singapore's terms is appalling to
                  most Malays (in Malaysia) and any move in that direction would be
                  political suicide for a Malaysian politician to take," Dr Ooi told
                  Today newspaper.</strong></span></p>

              <p>I doubt so, Singapore generals &amp; colonels are so emasculated and connected to the ruling party to the extent that they might not be capable enough or find it of a benefit to stage a coup.</p>
