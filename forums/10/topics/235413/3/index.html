I used to work at a place where we had to pay for our own food and transport. Essentially stayout. Monthly costs just to go to work tops off 100 over bucks a month. Yet, we are asked to pay for that silly AHM when the % of our pay we have to deduct is far more than the NS officers etc. If by anything, The army is insanely the pinnacle of all things that can be possibly bad with the govt.</div>
