Is giving 5% of their annual salary to the needy too much, I absolutely dun think so. It's always like this, for many years already, these people like to talk the talk but not walk the walk. Are their pockets filled to the brim with money that they cannot walk the walk??? Bloody hell!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By means of artful and dubious arguments, ministers have gone to the parliaments and got their own mps to recommend and vote for their own salary jumps from peanuts (S$600,000.00 pa) which were already too high in the early days (1070s) to S$2,000,000.00 pa not to mention the other rewards like super-bonus of 6 months which the citizens were not entitled to and annuities at 2/3 of S$2,000,000.00 pa for life after two terms.<br><br>The ministers seem to think that as long as they can command the mps and influence them into passing the motions or laws, they could be justified in such self-rewards.<br><br>This type of passing of relevant motions in parliaments to benefit themselves is against the company acts and regulations and have been deemed conflicts of interest, illegal and unlawful in the running of management corporation where chairman who spend on public funds on dining were made to return to the management corporation. Government MPs who sit as directors on public listed companies were open to prosecution for self-approving of loans to their associates.<br><br>If our ministers want to maintain their dignity and reputation and have the moral and legal right to sue anyone for defamation, in the first place they should desist from such self-approval and self-recommendations and lead by example.<br><br>Such self-rewards might have been approved by parliament by voting but the comparisons with private sector's highest paid CEOs are flawed and illogical and were made without proper apple-to-apple comparisons as many of these private sector ceos were entrepreneur investors who stand to lose their millions of investments should their business fail whereas our ministers and public servants do not incur such risk of their own monies. Many CEOs have proven their worths to their own board like having invented or originated a successful product before they were granted their ceo salaries or bonuses.<br><br>It will be wrongful to claim that our ministers of civil servants were like Osim or Venture Manufacturing bosses and deserve to be paid their equivalent of salaries.<br><br>Independent salary assessments should have been made by an independent panel of experts which will provide all facts which can be vetted by the people.<br><br>This kind of conduct or behaviour by the ministers themselves appears to have been copied by NKF/Durai as testified in court last week which were described as shameful, hypocritical, and abuse of public donation monies for their own benefits.<br><br>Our ministers and their wives have openly praised Durai and supported his various actions from paying only 4 cts per charity donation dollar towards patients' treatment costs to hoarding of donation monies into 30-year  reserve thereby depriving patients of their entitled treatments.<br><br>Such super-peanut salaries like S$2,000,000.00 pa should be brought down to size or re-assessed by independent panel and excesses refunded back to the people before SM Goh donates 0.5% of it to charity or the the poor and deprived.<br><br></div>

Many CEOs have proven their worths to their own board like having invented or originated a successful product before they were granted their ceo salaries or bonuses.<br><br>It will be wrongful to claim that our ministers of civil servants were like Osim or Venture Manufacturing bosses and deserve to be paid their equivalent of salaries.<br><br>Independent salary assessments should have been made by an independent panel of experts which will provide all facts which can be vetted by the people.<br><br>This kind of conduct or behaviour by the ministers themselves appears to have been copied by NKF/Durai as testified in court last week which were described as shameful, hypocritical, and abuse of public donation monies for their own benefits.<br><br>Our ministers and their wives have openly praised Durai and supported his various actions from paying only 4 cts per charity donation dollar towards patients' treatment costs to hoarding of donation monies into 30-year  reserve thereby depriving patients of their entitled treatments.<br><br>Such super-peanut salaries like S$2,000,000.00 pa should be brought down to size or re-assessed by independent panel and excesses refunded back to the people before SM Goh donates 0.5% of it to charity or the the poor and deprived.<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: red;"><strong>Our ministers and their wives have openly praised Durai and supported his various actions from paying only 4 cts per charity donation dollar towards patients' treatment costs to hoarding of donation monies into 30-year  reserve thereby depriving patients of their entitled treatments.<br><br>Such super-peanut salaries like S$2,000,000.00 pa should be brought down to size or re-assessed by independent panel and excesses refunded back to the people before SM Goh donates 0.5% of it to charity or the the poor and deprived.</strong></span><br><br>Well done!!!

            <div class='col-md body'><br>1. 2% increase in GST is to help the poor isn't it?  So LHL mis-calculated?<br><br>2. Trust in the charity bodies, government bodies are broken by the very people who ask us to donate : Peanuts for salary, GCT wife denies everything, ministers in Singapore are best paid, high pay =/= no corruption rubbish, and many many more lies. Who knows who really build Singapore .. everything that happened might just be lies, and empty shell without substance.<br><br>3. When the ministers donate, are they not taking our tax dollar and donating back to us? This feels like a slap.<br><br>4. If the ministers donate, would they approve for a further increase to their million dollar salary to cover for the loss of monies due to donation?<br><br>5. Once again, appealing the public to donate. The public to give. But the government is so tight fisted. Poor people have to jump tracks. LHL is always talking about a wonderful future where the the money will be used. So isn't now time?<br><br>6. The government tell us there is "No Free Lunch!",  Welfare state is evil. We have to tell them, they are having free lunch off our blood and sweat.<br><br>7. Prices of common goods keep increasing. Transport, erp, coe, housing, water, electricity, more fines and etc.  These could easily be diverted to help the needy.<br><br>8. Its time to be more humble.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been thinking about some thing recently.<br><br>In other countries, some politicians MAY practise corruption, but maybe the amount that they embezzle or get out of the whole thing might be $900,000 (just to give it a figure).<br><br>In Singapore, they just openly give themselves a high salary, pegging it to the top income earners in the private sector. Say maybe they get $1 million a year... so to compensate the 0.5% given to charity, a 2 months bonus will compensate everything.<br><br>So can I safely say that corruption is totally none existant in Singapore, as in no favorism given to any particular companies or individual, no particular policies or situation being more advantageous to certain companies or individual?<br><br>Another thing to think about...<br><br>I am quite surprised that companies like Temasek Holdings can accept blunders by their top guys so graciously, or is it they cannot do anything to the top honchos?</div>
