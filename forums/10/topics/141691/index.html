            <div class='col-md body'>One brilliant award that is seldom mentioned is that Prof Koh, during his post-graduate days, had written a thesis about the questionable legitimacy of many legislations passed into laws, which were hurriedly passed WITHOUT due parliamentary processes through the Parliament of Singapore.<br><br>Try digging up his thesis in the archives of the Law Society and it will be quite an interesting read.<br><br>Now the big question - was his overseas posting to the United Nations a "reward" for his academic brilliance, or was it more sinister then it was seen on the surface ?<br><br>A brilliant legal mind in an unsettled political turmoils of the 1960s can easily be tapped and capitalised by any Political Party.<br><br>It so happened that the Ruling Party spotted this talent early enough, moved him off the local political scene, hence neutralizing a talented potential threat, and put this talent to good use for the interest of Singapore.<br><br>Professor Koh had a bigger international stage to display his talent, and which in the process provided him with worldly recognition and challenges that this island could not have provided for a talented person like him.<br><br></div>
