              <p>Supposedly written by a trader, found on CNA forums</p>
              <p>This is for a certain moron here who tried to tell me before that cycles are not accurate ways to predict the trend of the economy when I questioned on why GST increased in 07 although the we had a major recession in 97/98.... It is this power of cycles which led me to look for a job (with a bond) in 2005 because I graduate in 2008.... Everyone just appears to forget about cycles when the economy is booming...</p>
              <p>=====================</p>
              <p><span class="postbody">Cycles have been repeating from the beginning of
              time. The use of our clock is a cycle. There are sixty seconds in a
              minute, sixty minutes in an hour, two twelve hour cycles or twenty four
              hours in a day. The ancients used the moon cycle which is a twenty nine
              day cycle. The four seasons are a cycle of roughly ninety days for each
              cycle or season. Cycles are endless and the ancients seem to have been
              most fascinated with time and cycles of time. This was their clock. The
              ancient Egyptians, Mayans, Greeks and countless other civilizations
              based everything that they did on cycles to keep track of time. They
              used the cycles for the planting of food, harvesting, and even
              reproduction. Since we know cycles repeat, do they effect the markets,
              or even sports? Perhaps they do. <br> <br> Lets first examine the 17 year cycle (cicada cycle). In 1991, the
              United States of America was in a recession. The recession occurred
              after a long bull market run that started in 1982 and lasted 7 years
              until 1989. The president at the time was George H.W. Bush. The United
              States had just entered a Gulf War which was against Iraq. The NFL New
              York Giants football team won the Super bowl against the Buffalo Bills
              that were located in the north east part of the United States. 17 years
              later in 2008 the President is George W. Bush, the United States is
              fighting another war in the Gulf against Iraq. The NFL New York Giants
              win the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots(NE Patriots are
              located in the north east of the United States). Perhaps this is just a
              coincidence or maybe there is something more to the cycles.
              <br> <br>In 1907 the stock market had a one year crash that was very similar
              to what we are seeing today. Please note that this is 100 years. The
              stock market peaked in October of 2007. We have now approached the one
              year anniversary from that 2007 high. In 1907 and 1908 the Chicago Cubs
              baseball team made the playoffs in consecutive years. The Chicago Cubs
              repeated that feat in 2007 and 2008 by making the playoffs in
              consecutive years, exactly 100 years later. The irony of the story is
              that a cub is is a baby bear. This market is a bear market. In 1907 it
              was JP Morgan who came to the rescue and in 2008, exactly 100 years
              later it is JP Morgan Chase who is again coming to the rescue. <br> <br> The Mayan civilization used a very advanced calender and cycle system.
              As most of us now know the 2012 cycle is when all the Mayan cycles
              converge. This event signals the end of an age and a beginning of the
              next age. However, there is one cycle that stands out to me. It is
              called the 'Mayan long count'. This is a 52 year cycle that ends
              naturally in December 2012 with the rest of the Mayan cycles. If we
              subtract 52 years from 2012 we get 1960. This was a pivotal time in the
              U.S. If we subtract 104 (2*52) from 2012 we get 1908. As we all know
              this bear market is very similar to the 1907 stock market crash which
              ended in 1908. You can draw your own conclusions.
              <br> <br>The last cycle that I will examine is the 10 year cycle. Ten is
              known as a perfect number, hence perfect 10. Therefore, I personally
              watch the 10 year cycle and multiples of ten. In the year 2000, major
              stock indexes began a new bear market. 2010 will be the 10 year
              anniversary from the 2000 bear market. The market also sold off in 1910
              . This is also 100 years from 2010. Many times market tops are formed
              in the ninth, and zero, years of decades. For example 1929, 1910, 1920,
              1980, 1990, and 2000 just to name a few. Realizing how important the 10
              year cycle is I decided to multiply it to the Mayan 52 year
              cycle(10*52=520) and we get 520 years. The next Mayan 52 year cycle is
              completed in 2012. Therefore, if we subtract 520 from
              2012(2012-520=1492) we get the year 1492. This is certainly a pivotal
              time in history as this was when Columbus discovered America. <br> <br> Whats the conclusion? This is a severe bear market without question.
              Short term traders appear to be the only people benefiting from the
              volatile market. This type of environment should last for several years
              to come. If you are going to invest or trade it is imperative to know
              and understand the mechanics of the market and not the Wall Street
              Hype. Cycles are apparently one of the more important ways to
              understand when the major trends are about to change. Perhaps cycles
              can even predict who is going to win the next Super Bowl. </span></p>

              <p>That's a rather unadvisable way to see market forces.</p>
              <p>Undoubtedly, the world economy has its ups and downs, and it is also more or less cyclical and predictable. Downturns and booms dont just occur overnight.</p>
              <p>The danger of seeing the world economy as cycles is it will lead to apathy.</p>
              <p>It's a double-edged sword. Being able to see the cycles will lead either to: Apathy, or preventive measures for downturns.</p>

              <p>Yes, it's a cycle.</p>
              <p>But most people think that cycles are stupid theories, that there's no basis to it.</p>
              <p>The basis is that of human nature. I remember someone in psychology saying that our natural mechanism is of forgetting and moving on - to protect us from too much emotional load.</p>
              <p>However, I believe its that same nature that is causing the cycle. People forget about the lessons they learnt after some time, and then we are back to the same old issue again.</p>

              <p>"It's a double-edged sword. Being able to see the cycles will
                                      lead either to: Apathy, or preventive measures for downturns.</p>

                                      that downturns are  necessary pains that will somehow lead to

              <p>That view leads to unnecessary distress, eg. refusing to
                                      restructure a troubled company in the belief that market forces
                                      indicates that the company should go thus freeing up resources for
                                      more productive works. The ensuing unemployment and chaos that
                                      follows usually have far-reaching repercussions."</p>
              <p>I feel that downturns are necessary pains to weed out those that are fundamentally weak. Companies that survive grow stronger and better able to cope, resulting in a company built to last. It's like our body. We get struck by flu, but yet getting struck by flu helps to ensure that our bodies get stronger as time goes by.</p>
              <p>That said, I am on the agreement with her that refusing to restructure is not acceptable as well. However, we should not be throwing $$$ without the proper justification (Look at AIG, they are still spending lavishly even though taxpayers' money have helped to avert their collapse)</p>
              <p>My thought is to ensure that the trouble makers get punished (CEOs lose their jobs without package, board of directors get replaced, etc), and the company name is replaced (removing the company's brand, culture and reputation that is a direct blow to any long-standing company), so that they get punished adequately. And at the same time, jobs get preserved.</p>

              <p>Yes, it's a cycle.</p>
              <p>But most people think that cycles are stupid theories, that there's no basis to it.</p>
              <p>The basis is that of human nature. I remember someone in psychology saying that our natural mechanism is of forgetting and moving on - to protect us from too much emotional load.</p>
              <p>However, I believe its that same nature that is causing the cycle. People forget about the lessons they learnt after some time, and then we are back to the same old issue again.</p>
              <p>Coming back to 16/f/lonely (I hope you are not as lonely as what your nick is telling us) pt on</p>
              <p>"It's a double-edged sword. Being able to see the cycles will lead either to: Apathy, or preventive measures for downturns.</p>
              <p>The danger of the latter is well-documented....and many believe that downturns are  necessary pains that will somehow lead to future growth.</p>
              <p>That view leads to unnecessary distress, eg. refusing to restructure a troubled company in the belief that market forces indicates that the company should go thus freeing up resources for more productive works. The ensuing unemployment and chaos that follows usually have far-reaching repercussions."</p>
              <p>I feel that downturns are necessary pains to weed out those that are fundamentally weak. Companies that survive grow stronger and better able to cope, resulting in a company built to last. It's like our body. We get struck by flu, but yet getting struck by flu helps to ensure that our bodies get stronger as time goes by.</p>
              <p>That said, I am on the agreement with her that refusing to restructure is not acceptable as well. However, we should not be throwing $$$ without the proper justification (Look at AIG, they are still spending lavishly even though taxpayers' money have helped to avert their collapse)</p>
              <p>My thought is to ensure that the trouble makers get punished (CEOs lose their jobs without package, board of directors get replaced, etc), and the company name is replaced (removing the company's brand, culture and reputation that is a direct blow to any long-standing company), so that they get punished adequately. And at the same time, jobs get preserved.</p>

              <p><br>The laws governing capitalism protected the businessmen/employers much much more than the employees. That is a fact and part of a capital system we are living in...therefore, unless you change the system, CEO or directors can go scotchfree, because capitalism defined business or company as a different entity of another living thing.</p>

              <p>You see?</p>
              <p>Many have already fallen into the trap of seeing cycles.</p>
              <p>The goal is simple. To sustain booms (if any), and make shallow any downturns.</p>
              <p>Easier said than done. Downturns tend to be caused by bubbles, and bubbles when detected are typically too late to deflate without any form of pain.</p>
              <p>This is what's causing the periodical bear/bullish markets.</p>
              <p>If somehow we can bridge the gap of imperfect knowledge which is the major cause, then we will be able to control the "cycles" better.</p>
              <p>Bubbles are difficult to detect early-on because few would know if the increasing prices (prices can be seen as an indicator of consumption) is caused by increasing aggregate demand due to optimism, or over-optimism. Both are separated by a thin-line and the latter leads to unsustainable bubbles. If we are able to better find out which is occuring at any given time, we would be able to take steps eg. regulating the problem-making market (something usually unpopular).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, even when the information points to bubbles forming, countries are typically reluctant to burst them early because it is understandably unpopular. Worst of all, many politicians simply choose to pass it on to their successors so that they would leave with a "unblemished" record. </p>
              <p>Why should we choose to see booms and busts as cycles? Why not choose to see them as man-made and avoidable or at least, minimised with the correct damage control?</p>

              <p>I think everything in life has a process. Whether or not this process is cyclical remains subjective. Besides, time cycles and economic cycles are two distinct ideas, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

              <p>The theory of cycle has been around for ages. What I think is that the cycles will become shorter . Probably from 10 years cycle to 8 years cycle or even shorter. It may also be a series of small cycles before a big 1.</p>
              <p>Why do I think so ? From a big picture point of view , I think that now that world are more interconnected with each other. This visibility allows the people to jump onboard any new innovations / business practise without considering its real worth. Its much like when information flows , the good part is exagerated a few times when its passed from 1 party to another.  Eg , Company A have a certain success because it has come out a technology that suits a certain demand . Company B replicates the idea and achieve success too . Companies C , D , E , F pops out . Then a lot more pops out. A lot investors jumps into the bandwagon and over rated the actual worth of the services.</p>
              <p>The problem comes in when the "preceived worth" of innovations / business practice becomes much bigger than the real output that a dip finally come in to open the blinds to wake the people up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do I think so again ? I think that there a lots of "successes" in the making throughout the world that these different "successes" explodes in their own time frame. So actually its a graph with multiple waves instead of only 1 sin wave. Any of the wave can cause a dip. If their dips coincide , then we have a bigger recession.</p>
