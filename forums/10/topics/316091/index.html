              <p>=================================</p>
              <p><strong>2 new flu strains expected to hit Singapore<br></strong>Tan Hui Leng<br> <br>TWO new strains of the flu bug are expected and together with a prevailing strain, they have been identified by the World Health Organisation as being the most likely to cause the flu this year. <br>.<br>On Tuesday, GlaxoSmith-Kline announced that its updated vaccine for the circulating flu strains this year had arrived in Singapore. <br>.<br>This is just as 15,761 cases of acute upper-respiratory infections were reported at polyclinics last week — the second week in a row that the number has breached the warning level. <br>.<br>General practitioners (GPs) told Today they have seen more patients down with the flu recently but attributed it to the seasonal surge. Still, not all patients come down with just a cough and runny nose. <br>.<br>"My impression is that more patients are getting flu complications," said Dr Chong Yeh Woei who has been a GP for 13 years. "The strains seem to be getting stronger in recent years." <br>.<br>The complications include tracheal inflammation, sinusitis, dizziness and, in rare instances, the paralysis of vocal chords due to nerve damage. <br>.<br>Usually, there is an annual flu surge here from April to July and from November to January. Infectious disease doctor Wong Sin Yew said that high-risk patients — the very young, the elderly and the chronically ill — should be vaccinated as they are prone to more serious flu complications. <br>.<br>"This is especially important now as two out of the three influenza strains in this new vaccine are new and those patients vaccinated a year ago would need to be re-vaccinated," he added.</p>

              <p>With easy air travels, this is becoming a global phenomena.</p>
              <p>A friend just returned from a ten day visit to Egypt, and despite being a ''vitamin fanatic'' - he returned with all the signs of a severe flu strike.</p>
              <p>Air travel is not merely restricted to humans taking to the planes, but also to the migratory patterns of the birds at this time of the year - flying from the cold as the southern hemisphere gets into the winter period, and the north gets into summer.</p>
              <p>These migratory birds bring with them the biological threats that are undetected until a severe outbreak occur.</p>
              <p>CNA reported on Tuesday, that two migratory birds were found dead in the remote province of Akita in north-western Japan and had symptoms of the deadly bird flu disease - even when there were no chicken farms within 50 kilometers from where the dead birds were found.</p>
              <p>One should question where did all these deadly strains come from since the SARS outbreak in 2002, when all these newly named epidemic were unheard since the 1950s.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Because each time the virus replicate itself, it mutates slightly. <br><br>The rate of mutation is more significant if it comes into contact with molecular stuffs like other virus, bacteria, prion, chemical (like weak antibiotic). Virus is able to exchange or uptake genetic material for its advantage. In short, it is constantly changing.<br><br>By the way, the antibiotic that you take from the GP is really meant for bacteria infection and not for virus infection. <br><br>For virus infection, no cure yet. That is, the vaccine is not cure but more of a symptom suppressor or immune booster in nature.  </p></div>

              <p>1)Like Cleaning after 'CLEAN' S'poreans like you after you eat, shit.... etc.</p>
              <p>2)Or work for long hours under the sun, so that 'CLEAN' S'porean like you could live in your Bio-Sphere home. </p>
              <p>3)Work on weekends, Public Holidays, past office hour..... so that 'CLEAN' S'porean like you could enjoy life.</p>
              <p>*And yes.... we could always pay unwilling S'poreans 'More Pay' in doing dirty Jobs. I'm SURE those company force to do so <strong>WON'T</strong> rise the cost of their service.... <strong><em>which IMHO, is already High enough</em></strong>..... and the forumrunner here <strong>WON'T</strong> see a Thread soon about how much things cost these days....</p>

              <p>Yes Singapore is indeed overcrowded, even without the foreigners. <br>But we should be thankful this tiny overcrowded place is doing what she could to keep hygience level high, you jus have to cross the causeway to see the situation on the other side. It is ultimately to the govnt own advantage to keep singaporeans healthy, an epidemic like sars can do alot of damage to their wallets. This problem I believe is a problem of singapore physical size, and there is not alot the PAP can do to curb the spreading of viruses.</p>
              <p>While thinking abt these Fts, perhaps it is also wise to think of our uncles who takes a trip by Penguin boat down south every weekend.</p>

              <p>=================================</p>
              <p><strong>2 new flu strains expected to hit
              Singapore<br></strong>Tan Hui Leng<br>
               <br>
              TWO new strains of the flu bug are expected and together with a
              prevailing strain, they have been identified by the World Health
              Organisation as being the most likely to cause the flu this
              year.<br>
              .<br>
              On Tuesday, GlaxoSmith-Kline announced that its updated vaccine for
              the circulating flu strains this year had arrived in
              Singapore.<br>
              .<br>
              This is just as 15,761 cases of acute upper-respiratory infections
              were reported at polyclinics last week â€” the second week in a row
              that the number has breached the warning level.<br>
              .<br>
              General practitioners (GPs) told Today they have seen more patients
              down with the flu recently but attributed it to the seasonal surge.
              Still, not all patients come down with just a cough and runny
              nose.<br>
              .<br>
              "My impression is that more patients are getting flu
              complications," said Dr Chong Yeh Woei who has been a GP for 13
              years. "The strains seem to be getting stronger in recent
              years."<br>
              .<br>
              The complications include tracheal inflammation, sinusitis,
              dizziness and, in rare instances, the paralysis of vocal chords due
              to nerve damage.<br>
              .<br>
              Usually, there is an annual flu surge here from April to July and
              from November to January. Infectious disease doctor Wong Sin Yew
              said that high-risk patients â€” the very young, the elderly and the
              chronically ill â€” should be vaccinated as they are prone to more
              serious flu complications.<br>
              .<br>
              "This is especially important now as two out of the three influenza
              strains in this new vaccine are new and those patients vaccinated a
              year ago would need to be re-vaccinated," he added.</p>
                            </div>
                          </blockquote><br>
              
              Ft policy indeed brings about many problems but to link all new virus or bacteria strains to ft is a bit far fetched. New diseases and new virus and bacteria strains are caused by several factors. Some of these include globalization, climate changes, misuse of antibiotic.

              <p>Many foreign workers are paid low wages and could not afford GP's services. They either see doctors in company's medical centre or polyclinics. Medicine is quite useless. Also , many of them hesitate to take MCs because they are not paid salaries if they are on sick leave.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">For instance, Hougang town council does not object to its contractors deploying foreign workers in the estate, it said in a statement signed by the party's organising secretary Yaw Shin Leong.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Mr Seng, assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, had on Thursday taken the opposition party to task for its May Day message.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">The WP had questioned if Singaporeans 'truly benefitted' from the job boom as six in 10 new jobs went to foreigners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Rebutting the WP, Mr Seng told reporters on the sidelines of the May Day rally: 'We should take a pragmatic approach on this foreign worker issue.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">He also challenged the WP to match its words with deeds, by ensuring the Hougang Town Council did not hire any foreigners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">On Friday, the WP reiterated its views on foreigners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">'The issue here is not of foreign workers' employment per se but rather how the Singapore Government and the labour union will ensure that the dignity and societal position of Singaporean workers are not compromised,' the party said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Government's attitude, it added, should be to put Singaporeans first and 'resist any erosion of Singaporeans' societal standing'.</span></span></p>

              <p>* That HFMD always pops up around young kids at child care schools..... are you suggesting that alot of FT/FW hang out around child care schools <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Then <strong>WHY IS IT NOT</strong> spreading like wild fire in little India where alot of the FW hangout <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Following your thinking..... shouldn't families with children stay in such areas.... all should have came down with HFMD already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>

              <p>Give you a clean place to live.... you complain that it lowers your resistance....</p>
              <p>Don't clean up your HDB landing..... you complain HDB not doing their job....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone who like a 'dirty' place to build up your resistance to sickness..... feel free to move yourself to Malaysia as the <strong>Uncle Ver SG</strong> has suggested , instead of Aust or NZ...... cause these 2 country is clean too. Btw..... deep inside JB, the cost of living is much lower....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>therefore you could -</p>
              <p>* live a better/richer life with your SGD.</p>
              <p>* live in a less crowed place.</p>
              <p>* dirty enough to 'Train Up' your resistance.</p>
              <p>* be away from the control of PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All you have to do is to go...... so, what are you all waiting for <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> </p>

              <p>Maybe TS should take your scientific fact and put it into pratical..... since he think FT/FW is spreading the sickness around.... then he could mix with them more to build up his resistance.</p>
