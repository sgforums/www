            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No place in sports school </strong><br>By Sandra Davie and Lynn Lee<br><br>WHEN Muhammad Safuwan Baharudin, 12, got a provisional place in the Singapore Sports School, he thought his dream of becoming the next Fandi Ahmad was about to come true.<br><br>He only managed an aggregate score of 126, putting him in the Normal (Technical) stream and firmly out of the Sports School.<br><br>Although the boy was among 106 Primary 6 pupils and 44 Secondary 1 and 2 students selected for its pioneer batch next year, the Sports School wants all its students to be good enough to get into the Express stream.<br><br>Muhammad Safuwan said: 'I was so happy and proud when I passed the trials and my name came out in the papers. Now I am sad.'<br><br>His father, Mr Baharudin Abdul Ghani, 42, a production superintendent, admitted that his son may not be good at his studies, but 'give him a football and you can't beat him'.<br><br>The boy's former coach, Mr Kunju Jamaludeen, 47, said the father is not exaggerating.<br><br>'The boy is talented. I have no doubt he will make it to the national team one day. In fact, in my opinion, he has the makings of a star footballer like Fandi Ahmad.<br><br>'It's a pity.'<br><br>Another disappointed pupil was swimmer Ng Yi Qing, 12, of Red Swastika School, who was a finalist in this year's national inter-primary schools championships.<br><br>Crying after getting her results yesterday, the swimmer, who dreams of being the next Joscelin Yeo, told The Sunday Times that she had received a good progress award from her school on Friday.<br><br>So she did not expect to do only well enough to get into the Normal (Academic) stream.<br><br>'I want to go to the Sports School so badly. I'm very disappointed.'<br><br>Her school principal, Mr Ong Kian Hin, said imposing the minimum academic criteria will mean the school misses out on talented children like her.<br><br>He suggested that the Sports School should take in all 106 students, whatever their results, and work on helping them to become better students.<br><br>The school's officials, however, have always maintained that, because the yearly student intake is small, it has to have a cut-off mark.<br><br>Those who qualify for the Normal (Academic) stream will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>But pupils who make it to the Normal (Technical) stream, meant for the weakest students, are definitely out.<br><br>The Sports School in Woodlands, built at a cost of $75 million, offers a unique form of education: It aims not only to nurture sportsmen but also to pay attention to their academic studies, so that promising athletes will not have to choose one over the other.<br><br>Sports School spokesman Gerard Wong would say only that for the Normal (Academic) students, the door has not been slammed shut.<br><br>He said school officials would meet them this week to take another look at their results.<br><br>'If it was one particular subject that pulled down the scores, or if the child had been doing well all along but for some reason faltered in the PSLE, then we will reconsider,' he said.<br><br>'As long as we satisfy ourselves that the child can cope with the O-level curriculum, we will take him in.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>while we like to groom our sporting talents, we are still sending the message that they cannot run away from paper qualifications.<br><br>as much as we wish to develop all rounded talents, are we not limiting ourselves by doing so?<br><br>are we implicitly sending a signal that a successful sporting career in itself is not sufficient in singapore?<br><br>what are the downsides of admitting all students who qualified for the sports school regardless of their academic results? would that make them less motivated to put in efforts in their studies as they know they have secured a place in the school?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our society places too much emphasis on paper grades. This is our problem. As a result, the parents of talented individuals follow the grade system and believe that it will give their child a decent life next time.<br><br>How many soccer stars can manage their own finances? How many are as educated as our masses? To my knowledge, Denis Irwin is one of the few who does not engage an agent.<br><br></div>
