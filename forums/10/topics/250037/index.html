What sort of reasoning is this?  What about those low income who earn such low salary and their families are the ones who suffer.  They the ministers' pay are how many times more than us and the low income people.  Let him be lah, let him go on to talk.  Economy doing well must have increment and when economy is not doing well - will they deduct their pay.    Anyone knows if they also base on their performance to get increment or just merely depends on the economy?<br><br>Politicians exist to serve the people - and so it is up to the people of the country to decide and judge how they perform.   Didn't they take into consideration the declining winning percentage of votes they got during the last couple of elections when talking about fat salary increment?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Without the raise of their salaries, how are they able to upkeep those high class living?????<br><br>Us, the low salaries earners are definitely a goner to upkeep with the ever growing cost of living in Sing just to upkeep those living standards of those b*****ds....<br><br>How can they think of increasing their salaries when they are so many folds than those leading countries? What right???<br><br>It is just like the NKF thingy... They are ripping us off!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>No wonder someone mentioned that 300k is peanuts....<br><br>All Sing'reans had been kept in the dark all these while...<br><br>Having a huge treasury such as Singapore but tax is always increasing...

            <div class='col-md body'>According to MM Lee, there is no talents or enough talents even among Singaporeans who have migrated due to past excessive policies which caused slow down of the economy.<br><br>So people like Tang Liang Hong or Francis Seow are not talents and only those who are following autocratic commands in the ruling party are the talents.<br><br>So his assumptions is that we will never make it if we are applying ordinary solutions like the broad-based knowledge application to our governing system.<br><br>So according to his unproven assumption, because of our small size we should let him or his ruling party to run the country in a autocratic manner to allow easier decision making and IR etc when economic restructuring to value-adding model talked about finally was not workable for a small popultion.<br><br>The truth is even if we have enough talents to renew ourselves, the government has already driven them off with narrow-minded policies which serve only their own narrow party interest to cling on to power and reward themselves excessively with writing of their own pay checks and creating a group of yesman to faciltiate a system of autocratic government based on self-centred and unproven assumptions.<br><br>So all the citizens do not contirbute to nation building and building up of surpluses and it is only his type of self-centred policies meant to suit mentality of autocrat which will work in the globalisation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>opposition party said about Sacrifice. LKY said my generation Sacrificed. it was a time of crisis. But  times have changed, and it would be unrealistic to expect such selfless sacrificed now.<br><br>So what about the recent korean guy who killed 30 person, the teacher sacrificed himself to protect the students. Whatever LKY done in the past has been drain by his statement above.<br><br>I can't believe he would said that. That mean he will not sacrifice himself but sacrifice the public in time of crisis. All the talking is for himself and his family, to him the public is just a tools to make more money. he is not going to sacrifice, the public is the first to sacrifice. He sacrifice us for the sake of retain talents and pay rise.<br><br>Now, we keep on hearing Ex-MP become corrupted when resigned. Didn't he said outside pay 5 times higher, why they still commit corruption crime. Or outside pay 100 time lower  than what the govt offered.</div>
