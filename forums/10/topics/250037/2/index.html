But you need top-grade government," Lee said.<br><br>The pay hikes for ministers and top civil servants, which take effect this month, have triggered a rare public outcry from normally reserved Singaporeans, who enjoy Southeast Asia's highest standards of living.<br><br>The pay increase boosted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's annual salary to 2.04 million dollars, five times more than the figure US President George W. Bush earns and more than eight times the salary of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.<br><br>The prime minister -- the son of the elder Lee, who now makes 2.01 million dollars -- said he will freeze his salary for five years and donate the pay increase to charity.<br><br>Ministers' salaries are calculated using a formula pegging them to the earnings of top business executives and professionals, including lawyers and bankers.<br><br>Officials have long maintained that high salaries are necessary to attract talented managers into government service and preserve Singapore's reputation as one of the most corruption-free countries in Asia.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>"The biggest mistake any Singaporean can make is to believe that Singapore is an ordinary country and can behave like an ordinary country like Malaysia, like Indonesia, like Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark," he was quoted by the Straits Times as saying over the weekend.<br><br>woooo...syiok!</div>

Its economy was predominantly agricultural and the island was largely left behind during the industrial revolution. Not too long ago, in 1949, it had virtually a "peasant economy" in which approximately 46% of the working population was involved in agriculture. Because of this, it could be said that itÂ’s chief export was its people as millions migrated off the island in pursuit of a decent living.<br><br>However, over the past decade Ireland has transformed itself from a struggling agricultural nation to experiencing possibly the greatest level of economic growth in the world. This accomplishment prompted the naming of Ireland as the "Celtic Tiger." Now, itÂ’s non-agricultural employment exceeds 40% while agricultural workers make up less than 8.6%. In less than a decade, itÂ’s per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) leapt past the economies of Germany, France, Japan, and the average of the 15 European Union (EU) countries.
