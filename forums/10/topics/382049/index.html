              <p>A MRI machine is very costly and hence the hospital will try to make full use of it.</p>
              <p>A private doctor who orders a brain scan will be treated as a private or full-fee paying patient and hence it will be charged at full cost plus a margin.</p>
              <p>A polyclinic doctor who orders a brain scan will be treated as a subsidized patient and hence it will be charged about 50% below cost.</p>
              <p>The disparity in charges is to ensure that the private doctors do not send the patient frivolously for a brain scan or the private doctor sends the patient for the scan upon the patient's insistent of the scan, though the medical condition may or may not warrant it. </p>
              <p>While the polyclinic doctor will only send the subsidised patients for the scan only when it is medically necessary to have the scan.</p>

              <p>But the main issue i would be concerned about is how often does it happen?</p>
              <p>Did it happen because they geninuely didn't capture it or it was performed for the malice intention of getting you to pay for it again?</p>
              <p>I'm pretty willing to accept that the MRI isn't a 100% thing but it's quite another if i have to keep doing it repeatedly for no apparent reasons.</p>
              <p>Considering the lengthy period to wait for an MRI scan, i don't think it is the latter that is the problem. If the intention is to milk as much money out of it, it makes more sense by buying more of it to cut down on the waiting time.</p>

              <p>no. if you have a referral letter from polyclinic, you wont be seeing a fully fletched specialist. you will be seeing a registrar, a advanced trainee specialist in training. I went to CGH with a referral letter from polyclinic, the doctor I saw was not a specialist. he is a registrar nia.</p>
              <p>for your info, there are 3 kinds of specialist. associate consultant, consultant and senior consultant.</p>
