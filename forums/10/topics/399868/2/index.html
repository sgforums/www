              16.667 / 25.8 = 64.599% | 09 / 84 = 10.714%" is that whilst the GRC 
              system was dismal 64.6% effective  (a decreasing trend since 1991 
              (83.0%)) at ensuring minority representation in parliament, it was 
              (100.00 - 10.7)% = 89.3% effective (increasing trend since inception 
              from 51.9%) at minimizing independents and opposition-candidates from 
              contesting in SMCs.<br> <br> The exceedingly high ability of GRCs  to reduce SMCs (by currently 
              89.3%) compounded by the increasingly poorer ability of GRCs to uphold 
              its original purpose- that of safeguarding minority representation 
              (currently= 64.6%), arouses suspicion about the PAP's true intentions in
               implementing the GRC system of elections.<br> <br> As the figures suggests, it seems the outcome of the GRC system (in its 
              current form), to more so  reduce SMCs; with ensuring minority 
              representation being the excuse rather then norm. Thus  making suspect 
              if the original purpose of the GRC system of elections was really what 
              it was proffered to be: "The GRC system was established in 1988 to

              <p> Aiyah, dun say like dat lah, including minority in SG parliament is good thing actually, but what is important is BALANCE- which according to the initial 3men system (circa. 1988), was a good start actually, except that I believe that the PAP govt then secretly tweaked it so much to serve their own selfish interest-  the interests of Lee F, Son and Holy Goh et al. (just jokin), that the current result now is an embarassment rather then an accomplishment. That PAP interest now outweighs that of 'ensuring minority interest' as my post at 4Aug: 10.38am: "As a multiple of 'minority representation efficiency', the

                                          MORE effective in reducing SMCs then it is at ensuring minority
                                          representation</span>." describes- obtusely remains the main hinderence to the progress of fair politics in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Balancing both 'ensuring minority interest' and 'ensuring SMCs', the par result would be 12 X 3member GRCs, the rest of the seats being SMCs: i.e. 84 - 12 (3) = 48 X SMCs.</p>
              <p>PAP's  [CNA 26 April 2010]: 'Parliament amends Constitution to
                                          change NCMP &amp; NMP schemes': [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1052726/1/.html">link</a>] announcement would then sync nicely with this change as '9' is the exact nice number in case minorities come up with only 12 seats coming election because then the total number of minority MPs (MP + NCMP) would be 21 (almost the ideal situation for minority representation).</p>
              <p>In a world of limited opportunity and resource, all perspectives should be considered and balanced; as such,  no one is indispensable, not even high earning PAP Ministers- let them compete in the 48SMCs or with a good team amongst 12 GRCs, let them earn their keep like every other Singapore Citizen.</p>
              <p>Let Singapore be a democracy, let the people embrace peace and prosperity.</p>
              <p>Good day to U.</p>

              <p><strong>[Straits Times - 28 May 2009]- GRCs to shrink, but they will stay.</strong></p>
              <hr style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ffffff;">
              <p>News: The Straits Times - 28 May 2009</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Transcripts/Prime+Minister/GRCs+to+shrink+but+they+will+stay.htm">GRCs to shrink, but they will stay</a><br> By Zakir Hussain<br> IN A concession to often-made calls for smaller GRCs, the average size 
              of these multiple-member constituencies will shrink to no more than five
               MPs.<br> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament yesterday there should 
              not be too many six-member GRCs, as this makes it harder for voters to 
              identify with the whole slate of MPs.<br> Currently, the average number of MPs in a group representation 
              constituency is 5.4, as there are five six-member GRCs and nine 
              five-member GRCs.<br> There will therefore be fewer six-member GRCs by the next election, he promised.<br> There will also be at least 12 single-member constituencies, or SMCs, up from the current nine.<br> Mr Lee said he would make these requirements part of the terms of 
              reference for the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee, which 
              determines the shape and size of electoral constituencies prior to every
               election.<br> He hastened to add that he has not appointed the committee yet.<br> Former Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia of the National Solidarity Party 
              told The Straits Times the move was 'a first step in the right 
              direction'.<br> 'From 1988 till now, it's been bad news for the opposition, but finally 
              there's some loosening up,' he said, referring to how GRCs had expanded 
              in size since they first came about 20 years ago.<br> 'We hope the GRCs will be much smaller, and there will be more SMCs.'<br> In his speech, PM Lee defended the present system of having most MPs 
              elected in GRCs. This was a sound system that ensured multiracial 
              representation, the reason GRCs were first formed in 1988, he said.<br> 'They encourage political parties to appeal to all races with moderate 
              policies and not to one race or another with chauvinist or extremist 
              policies,' said Mr Lee.<br> 'They also put a premium on parties which can field credible teams and 
              therefore demonstrate that they are fit not just to become MPs but also 
              to form the government,' he added.<br> Mr Lee, however, said single seats should also remain, so that small 
              parties and independent candidates can still contest in general 
              elections.<br> He noted that there were both advantages and drawbacks to having bigger GRCs.<br> On the one hand, they allow stronger multiracial teams to be formed 
              which include MPs with different backgrounds and skills 'to serve voters
               more comprehensively and effectively'. Resources can also be pooled to 
              run town councils better.<br> They also require a challenger to field a strong team that offers a 
              serious alternative, and so 'encourage responsible and credible 
              opposition parties to emerge'.<br> On the other hand, having too big a GRC makes it harder for voters to identify with the whole team of MPs.<br> 'In the light of our experience, we have concluded that on balance, 
              smaller GRCs, that means less than six members, have the edge over 
              larger GRCs,' he said.<br> However, he did not think six-member GRCs should be ruled out entirely, 
              as 'sometimes the configuration of constituencies on the ground makes 
              this the most practical option'.<br> 'The changes to smaller GRCs and more SMCs may or may not result in more
               seats being contested or more opposition MPs being elected,' he 
              stressed.<br> 'That is not their purpose. Ultimately, it's up to the opposition MPs to
               field candidates to contest the elections and up to the voters to 
              decide who they want to represent them in Parliament.'<br> When Mr Lee concluded his speech, Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang) promptly 
              rose to ask the PM if he would ask the boundaries review committee to 
              keep existing constituency boundaries as far as possible, and not 
              gerrymander.<br> He also asked Mr Lee to consider appointing the committee earlier before
               an election so that the opposition will have more time to look at the 
              changes.<br> Mr Lee said how boundaries were drawn was up to the committee members. 
              'I think it's best to leave them to decide in accordance with the 
              situation on the ground. They do not disturb boundaries unnecessarily, 
              but when the population has changed, boundaries have to recognise these 
              electorate changes,' he said.<br> As for appointing the committee earlier, he said he would appoint it in good time.<br> 'It is not our intention to do it at the last minute and spring 
              surprises on either our own members or on opposition members,' he said.<br> 'I will not tell you how many months' notice I give you, otherwise when I
               appoint the committee and its results are published, you will calculate
               forward and determine the election date.'<br> -end of ST article<br> <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Transcripts/Prime+Minister/GRCs+to+shrink+but+they+will+stay.htm">http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Transcrip...+will+stay.htm</a></p>
