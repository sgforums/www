                                  elections to reduce SMC seats in excess of its effectiveness in
                                  upholding its intended aim of ensuring minority representation
                                  calls for a return to the original objective for which the GRC
                                  system of elections was introduced and the downsizing of all GRCs
                                  to a max of 3 members each.<br> <br> In fact, judging by the ability of just 14 GRCs in the last
                                  election (2006) to return 22 minority members: AMK(2), Bi-TP(2),
                                  EC(2), Holland-B.Timah(2), Jur(2), M.Parade(2), P.Ris(2), Semb(2),
                                  perhaps with the current 14 GRCs achieving in excess of ideal
                                  minimum guaranteed, 2006 having turned in a bumper of 22 minority
                                  MPs (26.19%- in excess of the population they represent); some
                                  being ministers or popular MPs, perhaps a spread of 14 x 3memb GRCs
                                  (42persons) and 42 SMCs would make GE 2011 a fairer one to all;
                                  without the need for any NCMPs, (but for the unlikely case where
                                  the total number of minority MPs dips below 21 etc- even then its 7

                                  minority rep. (that peaked in 1991, then dwindled)- has been
                                  deviating since 1991 from its original objective of minority

                                  of the GRC system- that of diminishing the number of SMCs available

              opposition leaders like Mr Jeyaretnam in Anson, a predominantly Chinese

              Malays "not to become like Singaporean Malays", Berita Harian Singapore 
              editor Guntor Sadali's response was: "We do not believe in being

              progressive percentage fall of the majority Chinese population, since 
              1980, need be explained. The purpose of this mention is in support of 
              the arguement that  ''12' the correct number of (3-Memb) GRCs for

              elections have since been overwhelmed by obtuse manipulation for party 
              political interest such that "GRCs serve the PAP’s interest rather than 
              the original objective of "ensuring minority representation": When 
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong spoke of the PAP’s recruitment challenge 
              in 2006, he admitted: "Without some assurance of a good chance of 
              winning at least their first election, many able and successful young 
              Singaporeans may not risk their careers to join politics." [<a href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=555">'sgpolitics', 28Aug2008</a>] <br> <br> That said, not all is lost for the GRC system of elections and its 
              sister act- the NCMP scheme, though a complete reconsideration of the 
              intentions behind each need be publicly discussed and revealed. ''12'

               - I hope, might be helpful in this regard as it tries to balance 
              equitably, the need to 'ensure minority representation' whilst 
              minimizing the harm caused by GRCs depriving the electorate of "say when

              <p><br>GRC system is not only to undermine the opposition weakness but also to gain an economy of scale in ruling. When i young in school, i remembered a Mr Lim Boon Heng came and talk to us about GRC.  He said that Singapore being small, a few small towns gather together to form a group is better than each town going for election individually, that will be tedious and also waste time and effort for both the voters and the parties concern. Just like buying things in bulk will be cheaper than buying thing one by one. And it is not something that the govt is playing a game here, the govt just wanted to consolidate these towns as one adminstration, one town council, one office and so on so as to be  better than creating useless extra councils, offices and having excess people in adminstration, which is very costly and add no value to it. And such costs are taxpayers money. So in view of these aspects, the govt decide to create GRCs so that more brains is better than one, and please dun think that GRC is to make the opposition difficult, if you look at the other way, we are also putting ourselve at risk, if an opposition party won a GRC, they won 4 to 5 seats at one shot, if 2 GRCs, that will be 9 to 10 seats at one go, which is also a benefit to opposition. It is a level and fair field the govt is playing, we did not reduce or shift our goal post. At the end the day, GRC is mend to consolidate for the sake of economy of scale</p>

              <p>To answer to TS, actually in Chad, Djibouti and Cameroon they have such system as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most likely, is old man go Djibouti and learn from it one, as it has 37 seats in a group out of 65 parliment seats. (One of the GRC is <strong>37</strong> seats, one of them is 4 member one etc etc)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Update: Eh wait, the electoral law in Djibouti was on somewhere 1992, and by then GRC had already implemented, so the next might be Chad (With the electoral law by 1900, despite such game rule was likely not implemented in 1900 back then --- but no evidence to say so la.). Most likely for Djibouti forumers / netizens who ask a similar question in their country pretext will be their party / president etc had a visit with Singapore and learn from old man one.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>By doing a simple maths, Chad has 155 elected members (As opposed to 84 in present Singapore as of writing), 155 - 25 = 130</p>
              <p>Out of 130 members in the remaininhg 34 multi-member seats, 130 / 34 = 3.823529411764706, literally means it has some 3 member seats, 4 member and 5 member seats, which is similar to Singapore's system somehow. But thanks to the second link &lt;Chad's Parlimentary System&gt;, it means that Chad has 2 ~ 5 member "GRC"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And finally, Cameroon:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2053_B.htm">Cameroon's interesting Parlimentary System, with elements of Proportional Representation if neither party gets a minimum of 50% votes.</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Cameroon">Cameroon has 49 multi and single member constituencies with 180 seats</a></p>
              <p>By the way, Cameroon's electoral law was introduced on 1991, which is another post GRC era.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conclusion: Such idea of GRC is invented by Chad (Dunno who) and perfected by LKY and his minions for Singapore case which was a sucess example to model from (In Cameroon and Djibouti ruling party's point of view)</p>

              <p>I doubt the GRC will be split in this coming GE.  Cos it only sent out signal that the GOV had no confidence in that area.  Guess die die will still base on the last GE with little changes.  If they lost 1 GRC, what they do next is after 2 to 3 years, call for snap election.   So which means our PM will be busy for the next 2 to 3 years thinking how to fix those opposition before calling for snap pole.</p>
