            <div class='col-md body'>Let us observe how one assassinates a Great man in Africa! Patrice Lumumba was assassinated by the Americans, in the name of the cold war that the Africans have not ever invented. The Belgians, who endorsed this coward assassination, are only scapegoats. The Belgians, British and French, who were the right arms of the Americans, encouraged this coward assassination. All the Great Western powers need the richnesses of Congo. This State d`Afric is the richest country, in basement, in the world. Even Hitler wanted to monopolize  this country in order to manufacture its atomic bomb. After the Conference or the "Brutality" of Berlin, the Belgians, who developed because of under ground congolais, profited l`essor from the Belgian middle class. The Belgian system is founded on a trilogy much imbriguÃ©e than in the other colonizers forced:travail, exploitation of the richnesses and missions Christian. In the years 1958, Patrice Lumumba arrives who refuses paternalist l`action of missionnaires and l`exploitation without condition of the richnesses congolaises. Westerners love not this kind of character, volunteer, proud, humble, defender of social justice, to control a rich country like Congo, without putting it except d`Ã©tat to harm. Many conflicts which generate nowl Afric, c`est because of not called into question of our traced borders of African blood and, especially, of the neocolonialism. Patrice says this in 1960: "Congo is an area which is with l`interior d`une Nation. This know Nation Africa ". This great man, to trust and patriot, were a true African dignitary. In 1958, indicator that nobody s`occupy  of l`indÃ©pendance total of his people, it creates the MNC (National Movement Congolais). In 1960, Congo is supposedly independent. In May of the same year, it gains the legislative elections. Therefore, it is named Prime Minister, tandisque Kasa Vubu reaches the presidency in June 1960. L`become with the head of the government congolais directed by the nationalist Patrice Lumumba n`a not smiled to the Western powers. Anti-colonial, unifying, prosovietic, communist, socialist, progressist, Patrice Lumumba automatically precipitates l`alliance of KasaÃ¯ and l`union Katangaise. July 10, 1960, of the Belgian troops are dispatched in Elisabethville (Lumumbashi), the capital of Katanga, in order to subdue a rebellion of l`army of Congo. Patrice Lumumba counteracts and claims l`assistance of the United Nations. July 12, 1960, he threatens to request l`help of the l`ex-USSR if the Belgian troops do not to evacuate  Katanga, July 19, 1960. ProsoviÃ¨tique which, requiring of the help Communists, wants to direct a rich country like Congo, the Americans and Europeans "blessed yes yes" of the Americans will never forgive it, because of the cold war. The Security Council of l`ONU vote a resolution asking Belgium to withdraw its troops which will be replaced by blue helmets, July 14, 1960. These blue helmets will unload on July 16, 1960. September 15, 1960, s`il plait you, the Belgian minister Ganshof Van-DER is dispatched in Congo to put Patrice Lumumba except d`Ã©tat to harm for the only Western economic interests which do not stop to stuff us the craniums on the philosophy of the rights of the men. September 19, 1960, c`est-with-statement three days after the arrival du minister Ganshof Van-DER, colonel Mobutu, this 29 year old young fellow, adhering to the National Movement Congolais (MNC) of Patrice Lumumba, of which it becomes the men of confidence, "close friend" of Patrice Lumumba, founds a college of the general police chiefs automatically, thus replacing the bodies of the capacity. This friendship resembles d`autres friendships: Sankara-Blaise CompaorÃ© and Marien Ngouabi-Sassou Nguesso.<br>November 15, 1960, in the Eastern province, the partisans of Lumumba Ã©vincent the officers faithful to Mobutu and form a government lumumbist in Stanleyville which will be recognized by fifteen States progressists, of which Ghana de Nkrumah, l`Egypte of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Guinea de SÃ©kou TourÃ©, etc... on 9 December 1960, handled by the Americans, Belgians, Britanniques and French, the Belgian minister Ganshof Van-DER asks Mobutu to kill Patrice Lumumba, in spite of the presence of the United Nations in Congo. Automatically, colonel Mobutu stops Patrice Lumumba and send with Elisabethville in Katanga, where it is assassinated on January 17, 1961. Here how a true African is assassinated. What is unhappy is that this is an African who assassinated his own brother, in the name of l`Occident. Dists me, my sisters and brothers, The men Africa it not maudit forever? http://membres.lycos.fr/african97160/;;;;;;;;;<br><br>Mr. president of the French, Allow me to come towards you taking into account the difficult situation in which, you are spirit of plunged the Ivory Coast, like d`autre country to Africa. If you see, in me, an individual who you blames that of it could not seem to you strange. And it is, however, truth that your responsabiltÃ©s in the crisis of the Ivory Coast are immense. Mr Chirac, it-that l`Afric, unintermitting martyr, did know since so-called "independences"? Only social injustices; of l`exploitation of the men by the men; nÃ¨o-colonialism most contemptible which dominated during forty years; military and economic interventions which bleed, exploit and devastate our populations; encouragements with the conflicts for your only interests egoists. Because of you, Mr. Chirac, the people of the Ivory Coast lives, since more than three months, a crisis which it meurtrit painfully, affects the bases of its social cohesion and threatens it in perenniality of its national existence. Now, the awakening of the true nature of the dangers which attack the Ivory Coast is known of everyone. Because of you, Jacques Chirac, l`Ã©lan of development of the Ivory Coast, itself, are broken; the investment  productive is stopped and the dependence, with the regard of your country, is worsened. These measurements and their effects on the economic development and the company open the way with the proliferation parasitic d`activities, with the development of corruption, the practice on a large scale of the nepotism and the clientelism, with the unrestrained race with the enrichment easy and the conspicuous consumption. Like consequences of these drifts, the cohesion s`est found fissured, the work and l`effort destroyed like statutory values and the confidence of the citizen in his institutions inevitably shaken. Therefore, Mr. Chirac, remade not in Ivory Coast what you did in CONGO BRAZZAVILLE where you drove out a democratically elected President: PASCAL LISSOUBA. Yes, you armed, in the name of l`exploitation of men by the men, your dictator Sassou Nguesso in order to release loosely President Lissouba elected democratically by the vote for all. By your cruelty, Mr. Chirac, increasingly broad sides of the company congolaise and social categories, increasingly many, live in precariousness and l`exclusion. The young people, in particular, who constitute the crushing  population congolaise and his future, are struck in strong proportions by the failure  school, unemployment, the marginalisation and l`absence of prospects social d`insertion. Because of the neocolonialism, of l`exploitation of men by the men and the support which you bring to the African dicateurs, in particular in Denis-Sassou Nguesso, of new difficulties are profiled with l`horizon, related on the weight of the foreign debt and interior and to the population increase still very strong, with persistence d`une critical dependence in the fluctuations of the oil markets, with the new challenges advent that impose the universalization of l`economy like new technologies of l`information and comminication in real time.<br>Because of you, Mr. Chirac, the democracy is broken is CONGO, the institutions called into question, pluralism and the democracy, of which l`approfondissiment and defense were to constitute your essential priorities, as "a Defenseur of the democracy and the rights of the men". Alas, you destroyed them by loosely drawing aside a democratically elected president. Mr. Chirac, your country, French, this always autoproclamÃ© "country of the rights of l`homme". Force is to note that this obsessing rÃ©pÃ©tion ends up transforming in l`esprit of the French citizen, l`error in truth: French is respectful rights of men. You lie, Mr. Chirac, because French not a ever respected the most elementary rights of the men African. Therefore, your manners and your manners hardly concern the democratic virtue. It is time, Mr. Jacques Chirac, that French, your Fatherland, s`occuppe finally of its buttocks, because the Africans are really tired of your cruelty. GREETINGS ANTICOLONIALES!!! http://membres.lycos.fr/african97160/;;;;;;;;<br><br>Yes, unisons us Men from the Ivory Coast! African Unisons Us! Any action together for us African is a product of freedom. Therefore, l`unity calls us in all the fields! Let us banish this democracy which misleads eye in it, organize we and manufacture governments d`Union national to be able to go straight towards a real unit of our People d`Afric. We all are of the Men from the Ivory Coast, GhanaÃ©ns, of the Senegaleses, etc... the Coast d`Ivoire belongs to l`Afric and this Africa appartent at the Ivory Coast. I am torn by the brutality of the life, mechancetÃ© and the silly thing of the men, after the tragic events which proceeded in Rwanda. Blind violence, violence absurdity: the forces of l`ordre, in very l`Afric, took practice to kill and to terrorize in all impunity the civil ones, in particular that belongs to ethnos groups different from their or another religion which is theirs. L`Afric of the AIDS; l`Afric exploited, bled, devastated, impoverished and our dispersed people. I think that not answer will not be given to all these evils, excluded only one: this not by nourrisant membership religious or ethnique (which n`a no value, no future), of every man for himself, nationalism, regionalism, insulation and the ignorance, that we will find of the ways which are advantageous with us. This in fraternity, solidarity, l`amity and the comprehension which we will find our bohnor. Only fraternity will enable us to take again confidence, so to link  our People, all our People. Without the Africans, all the Africans, this African unit will not shape. Therefore, let us banish membership  ethnique and religieuse(elle is personal, the religion) to go straight towards l`unity which wants to say freedom. With us of to indicate  and to mobilize all the Africans, white and blacks, yellows or reds, bus this is together  of the Africans who will be able to build l`Afric of tomorrow. This XXIÃ¨ century will be the battle of l`intelligence, therefore of l`education, research and the culture. Our nationalities do not existe absolutely, because they are null and not avenues. The characteristic of l`ideology populist, one knows, is it to mystify reality. Did we already forget the function "TO DIVIDE FOR BETTER REGNER" and the dramatic consequences of the nihilism? One cannot build a strong and powerful Nation by having concerns primarily dependent on the religion, especially when this one is enamelled d`iniquity and d`abjection. I wish that African pragmatism give us perspicacity to sweep the pompeux speeches of which result  sprinkles the fields of hatred and sclerosis the spirits. I wish that l`Afric s`enriches of its past to build a future worthy of its genius. Our continent can be still rectified. Thus let us mobilize our resources to work without slackening in order to leave L`Afric the misery which, I am closely convinced, is not a fate. Fraternity in continuity and l`union is the only way of the free proclamation d`une Africa. If our leaders do not stop to divide us between Musulmans and Christians, between hutus and Tutsis, Dioulas and BaoulÃ©s, Peuls and Soussous, s`ils does not n`arrivent to carry out our people, the poor, impoverished, overexploited, towards their unit, the support which we can their bring, will be to regard them as traitres, neocoloniaslists who are corrompus by inherent pouvoir(phenomene of the world of the policy). Our opposition in their connection will be done by the means of the civil company; we will remain plain and vigilents to make respect our rights and our DIGNITE. Then, that quelqu`un wants or not, we will seize freedom to show us active, interdependent and plain! IN THE NAME OF THE REASON, MEN FROM THE IVORY COAST, UNISONS US, BECAUSE ANY ACTION TOGETHER FOR US MEN FROM THE IVORY COAST AND AFRICANS EAST A PRODUCT OF FREEDOM<br>In very l`Afric, our famous defenders of the rights of l`homme created various leagues: League SÃ©nÃ©galaise of the rights of l`homme, league congolaise of the same rights of l`homme, etc... Yes, there are leagues of the rights of l`homme everywhere in Africa, whereas our collective rights are completely ridiculed. On our premises, in Senegal, French has a VETO there. This last means that we are always colonized by French, because this it which represents us in the United Nations. Why n`a one not stopped the French, at the time of the Rwandan gÃ©nocide? Why actors of l`apartheid  not worried by l`Opinion international? Because l`Africain n`a no dignity. This wants to say that the International right inÃ©xistant in Africa, at is made indignant and always colonized. What thus does those which represent us with the various international organizations? In this case, do we need the Africans who are represented with l`ONU? Why make? - a League Man from the Ivory Coast of the Rights of the men, in colonization, whereas the Men from the Ivory Coast die free - a Secretary General of the United Nations, in event  Kofi Annan (Here the first living corpse). - Of the Spokesman of Office of the High Commission of the United Nations for the individual rights of Men. - representatives for INTERNATIONAL AMNESTY for the same individual rights of the rights of Men. - Presidents or vice-presidents of the International Federation of the individual rights of Men. - the In charge ones of the questions of International Justice to the same International Federation. - leagues sÃ©nÃ©galaise, congolaise, of the Ivory Coast, Rwandan... of the individual rights of men. Not, l`Afric n`a more need for this defamatory stain. All aren't these Africans informed? N`est this not a beautiful world, my sisters and brothers? Yes, they are there to defend the rights of men, the individual rights of men, whereas their people live under the absolute neocolonialism. Unthinkable C`est. Is this qu`en defending the individual rights of men, our various representatives with l`ONU or with INTERNATIONAL AMNESTY, they defends our collective rights, our dignity? Not, Not and Not C`est invraissemblable. Qu`est this which we have in our small heads? 50 years of misleading declaration, we still have not anything included/understood or we do not want to include/understand. 50 years of the neocolonialism, of dictatorship, d`exploitation without condition of our richnesses and military frenzy, we accept, respect and venerate this philosophy of the individual rights of men, whereas our people are always colonized. http://membres.lycos.fr/african97160/;;;;;;<br>If the individual rights of men profit caution  from our various representatives, the collective rights, them, are releguÃ©s to the second plan by political opportunism or personal ambitions. How, sincerely, can one defend the individual rights of men whereas the collective rights neither are respected, nor defended? How can these living corpses, which represent us universally, make respect our personal freedoms whereas our collective freedoms are completely ridiculed? And yet, there N ` ever was personal freedom without collective freedom. How can our dictators, who control us, respect our individual rights, whereas our collective rights are ridiculed by the Western powers, those same which created l`ONU and the declaration known as universal? International law? It gives to a country its legal consistency; it must seek to limit the conflicts and to facilitate the international relations. When did it l`ONU put an end to a conflict in Africa? These organizations of the so-called rights of men are numerous. Each organisation(there are at least 200 of them: United Nations, the World Health Organization, etc...) must answer different concern according to the Member States and the goal of its action. The divergences interests between the States, the need for surmounting them peacefully, is the role of the international law, like its name l`indic. Are the United Nations of the United Nations? to question  can. Was Dabord, how born this Organization? It was during the Second world war that Roosvelt (l`AmÃ©ricain), Churchill (l`Anglais), and Stalin (SoviÃ¨tique) met in TÃ©hÃ©ran(Iran) in November 1943 in full world war. These three personalities, dominating the world, estimated qu`une international organization would be necessary to regulate the world problems once, returned peace. A prÃ©parative Conference, bringing together delegates American, British, sovietic and Chinese, took place of August 21 at October 07 1944 in the United States. The broad outline was traced, supplemented with YALTA in February 1945. Pay attention what I will say: It say, from the very start, that the United States and the l`ex-USSR were going to be the dominating powers of l`aprÃ¨s war and that only a co-operation between these two Nations and their existence could allow the correct operation of l`ONU. And now, l`Union SoviÃ¨tique n`exist more. No Nation n`a taken its place. No Nation can say "Not" to the Americans, no countervailing power. A capacity, which n`est not supervised, is a dictatorship. C`est American DIKTAT. Therefore, l`ONU died with the l`ex-USSR. In this case, one can to question  of l`existence of the international law, his progress, of his operation, his range and, especially, his future, because l`Europe Unie is far be plain.<br>But why not l`Afric plain? Let us recall that  the shortly after the Second World war, in December 1945, after the discovery of the atrocities Nazis, qu`est born this universal Declaration of the rights of l`homme pourque the white do not disappear because of their beliefs (cruelty). Only one and single ambition: To defend and protect the individual rights of men, then that not African State n`Ã©tait supposedly independent, excluded l`Afric of the South of the racist white. Thus us, African, this colonial declaration of the rights of men hardly concerns us. Do you know, why? because we live in small areas, qu`on can call associations. It is not enough to d`avoir a territory manufactured by the colonist, a population joined together by the colonist and a governmental authority administered by the colonist to claim to have a Nation. Do our People continue to suffer, but with which to ask for memory? Yes, since the slavery while passing by colonization and the neocolonialism, our People suffer because of impotence of the Africans and their basement. Yes, l`Afric is the richest continent in the world, richer than all the others joined together. Why, devil, the inhabitants of l`Afric are poorest in the world? When will we learn how to defend l`Afric, its natural richnesses and the inhabitants who make it up? In spite of the creation of l`ONU and its thousands various d`organisms d`assistance, in spite of the Universal Declaration of the rights of l`homme and the citizen, in spite of multiples and interminable international conferences, in spite of many efforts more or less not involved and more or less skilful; governments Western, institutions international, multinational, international banks, expert, co-operating, mercenaries, secret agents, "humanitaires"(une mine of vipers) compete to exploit and impoverish the poor people d`Afric. Here are almost 50 years that we are supposedly "independent". L`Occident exploited these false independence to make a modern slavery of it. A slavery, obviously, nourished by the DIVISION OF L`AFRIQUE. Since these so-called "independences", our People were in mourning during almost 50 years. Fifty years of gÃ©nocide, of civil wars, d`exploitation without condition of their richnesses, the neocolonialism most contemptible, the HAND OF L`OCCIDENT MAKES the GESTURE OF L`INSTINCT AND NOT THAT OF the REASON. Such an amount of d`annÃ©es cruelty, of French soldiers, French mercenaries, French d`"humanitaires ", of French co-operation of Shit, arrests  and judgments arbitrary, external attacked , blows d`Etat, false lawsuit, of physical l`elimination of our African patriotic truths, lie, silence(boucher the ears and to close the eyes), the WORD STAMMERS<br>BUT A WHICH TO ASK MEMORY? With people aficain decapitated of its history, to which one lied in depth of its existence, with which one always trampled l`honnor and the dignity, with which one underdeveloped economically and culturally, with which one divided to reign eternally? To people qu`on made deaf, dumb and blind man of his own culture and its own civilization, dedicated to remember only daily miseries, of l`injustice sociale(allant with l`encontre fundamental principles of freedom), suffering to which, is condemned to perpetuity? But will the memory of the facts and the gestures be retained like an extenuating circumstance? Now, all protagonists of the crisis of the Ivory Coast rÃ©crute of the mercenaries in Bob Denard ". And yet, the mercÃ©nariat is prohibited by the international authorities. But, let us speak about l`enfant Bob Denard. Since long years, Bob Denard sowed terror in Africa, since long years it was supported by all the presidents of the French Republic, of which the soldier Of Gaulle, l`echangist George Pompidou, the macaque ValÃ©ry Giscard d`Estaing, the gÃ©nocidaire Mitterand and the Chirac thing. Yes, since long years, Bob Denard sows terror in this impotent, divided Africa, bled, exploited and meurtrie. Truth-statement, it is goat-emissary d`une political hybrid of French in Africa. No French n`a raised the small one must for saying STOP. Children Bob Denard rendered services enormous to French. Children Bob Denard is a special mercenary correspondent for the account of French l`Etat in Africa. This mercenary showed of all the colors to the African populations always under the absolute neocolonialism. In the Comoros, in 1978, Bob Denard and its mercenaries take the control of the country and physically eliminate the president who was in place. Bob Denard puts President Abdallah at the capacity, qu`il had relieved in 1976. And all that by the d`Americ complicity of l`ONU and the United States which fights aujourd`hui against terrorism, in the name of justice without border. In 1989 Bob Denard, special correspondent by the gÃ©nocidaire Mitterand, keep silent President Abdallah and monopolize of the capacity. My sisters and brothers, there n` is qu`en Africa qu`on sees similar things. Since be-saying independence of the Comoros, there was more than 17 governments because of l`oppression of this French Republic, twisted blow, the attempt scorched earth policy at dismissal, whereas the Africans n`ont nothing with saying. That which says to you that l`Africa is not a wet hen, it lied. impotence of the Africans to take their destiny in hand is an overpowering proof there. It is certain that Bob Denard is  goat-emissary. Not only it worked with all the Presidents of this French Republic, but also with all the French secret service. To start with the DGSE, the DST, etc... Let us take an example: MMC(Mission Militaite de CoopÃ©ration) is a terrorist co-operation. A theoretically autonomous organization, but practically attached to cabinent terrorist minisÃ¨tre of the co-operation. It is directed by a General of the French national Defense and which manages, appears it, 17% of the budget of the co-operation. The d`assistance heads from this MMC, brought by children wonder Bob Denard, collect, filter or incite the requests of the African persons in charge put at the capacity by French such as: the thing Sassou Nguesso, the new Bongo Moslem, the thing Idriss DÃ©by, the Eyadema bloodthirsty man, etc. Or many Africans who, protected by the this French Republic from DANTON and friendly ROBESPIERRE "from l`Afric", want to be presidents. http://membres.lycos.fr/african97160/;;;;;;;;;<br>The MMC? Its field d`action is the same one as that of its ministry of supervision. Like this field, since be-independences, n`a ceased to extend  with the old Belgian, Spanish and Portuguese colonies, the number of African countries concerned doubled since the gÃ©nocidaire Mitterand imposed the democracy to the Africans who are always in total l`indignity. It s`agit not only to to widen  this bordelle of francophonie, but to present itself at these countries like an alternative to the old supervisions. This because children Bob Denard that French has delighted Rwanda, ZaÃ¯re(actuelle RDC), Burundi with their Belgian godfather; Equatorial Guinea and l`Angola with their Spanish and Portuguese fasteners. With creation, in 1983, Fast Force Action (FAR), the French authorities dared, in the name of the reason, by the complicity of Bob Denard and Paul Barill, VRP(Voyageur Representing Canvasser) in mercÃ©nariat, of go in Africa. There exists on the black continent, always colonized, four specialized divisions of this force which is not that  defamatory stain. What does it make in Africa? This of international terrorism. Bob Denard advised in Bernard Kouchner to serve l`alibi while going to the South of Sudan to help the victims of the famine and the massacres. This same Bob Denard encouraged Jean Christophe Mitterand, the son of the gÃ©nocidaire Mitterand, to leave to North Sudan to sell weapons in Omar El BÃ©chir. In only one country, French is in the South for humane reasons ett in North to sell weapons. That which says to you that French is not a terrorist State in Africa, it lied. At tomorrow my sisters and brothers, because SÃ©kou TourÃ© is tired!<br><br>Yes, the presence of the French soldiers in Africa is an insult with our people. These images, showing l`army French unloading or stationing in Africa, are a defamatory stain! You have not understood that French confiscated l`indÃ©pendance the l`Afric black one because of LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor and d`HouphouÃ«t Boigny. How I have shame to be an African, shame of my existence! Intellectual pseudos, which are only wet hens, break the mouth for a democracy which n`a not of name; intellectual male prostitutes, whose people live in total l`indignity, see only their personal future; intellectuals, who are only gourous, spend their time still dividing the African people. These Africans, who act in this manner, not have  included/understood yet not understood that c`est the time of universalization, those of the accounts and the hard truths. And l`Afric, once again, out of modern time because l`Afric n`a is pushed ever be independent. Exploited, bled, devastated and marginalized in the international exchanges, l`Afric is recipient from only 7% of flows of capital. Thus once again, l`Afric is excluded from the world growth. More serious still political l`instability structural of the States vis-a-vis wave  of shock of this universalization appears. The answers differ depending on the States, but the jolt is the same one everywhere: it reaches the legitimacy of the structures and involves brutal degradation. It accompany e violence inouÃ¯e: famine, exodus of mass of our populations, civil wars, gÃ©nocides, etc... No African can close the eyes and stop the ears in front of this defamatory stain where the People, which n`ont ever fought for their rights, undergo any kind of consequences to the name "of the civilized values" imported. It ya much of problems unsolved in Africa. Instead of attack with the latter and to work  with their solutions, the African intellectuals hang  with front-axle unit of the imperialists Euro-Americans and impose by the force of the weapons leurs"proppres reforms "d`un economic system and policy become completely anachronistic. Any watch which these obsolete forces became an obstacle with the progress of the African continent. One of the most significant lessons of XXÃ¨ century is than the People d`Afric must to link  in order to combine together, or to disappear definitively. This century also showed that this  not the power of the Americans and EuropÃ©ens "benis yes yes" of the Americans which is decisive, but the force and the power of the People. Our success depends on our capacity to overcome ethniques and official fundamentalisms which dominate l`Afric. A more difficult objective d`autant qu`aucun work, in this direction, is not still carried out on the ground and qu`il n`exist, to date, no movement of mass to stop this phenomenon.<br><br>French cruelty in Africa!!! Did all the political community french (right-hand side  and left confused, elites and intellectuals), religious movements and trade unions mobilize on May 26, 1996, place of TrocadÃ©ro(place of rights of the men?) in Paris to express against cruelty. Why this demonstration did take place? Because he have  assassinated seven monks Trappists in Algeria. Why, devil, French as not-such step wildly bombarded its soldiers in Algeria? Why, devil, French it encourages, with  2002, cruelty in Africa? A French nation terribly humiliated in 1940, crapotant under German l`occupation, deprived in five years of all its dignity, with on the arms the dirty war d`Algery, the gÃ©nocide biafrais, the conflict tchadien, the Rwandan gÃ©nocide, the gÃ©nocide congolais, the conflict angolais... A pains all that digested, here that this French nation pains to recognize the consequences and the causes of the cruelty which, j`en am persuaded, is not an invisible power. Cruelty? It east human, bus the man is a true animal which kills without reason, but its causes are inhuman and degrading: weapons, colonization, occupation, humiliation, injustice, fanaticism, dictatorship, etc... That`Hitler occupied all l`Europe, by aiming at the Juive race, freedom and the dignity of the occupied people was trampled, like does it now French in Africa. It was the cruelty of the last century. When white(French them, Irish, English...) occupied l`Americ North and l`Americ South, they exterminated the populations otochtones (Indiens, AztÃ¨ques, Incas, Mayas...), it was cruelty with l`Ã©tat pure. While encouraging cruelty in Africa and exploiting without shame the richnesses of the black continent, why the Africans come won't to French? And yet, the respect of the rights of the political and economic People d`Afriqe(droits) and the fight against l`immigration are two facets d`une even requirement. Therefore, French dared to put the question of the rights of the African people to lay out -same, by economic opportunism, as if the "negros" were occupied by l`Allemagne Nazi, or developed enough for that sells to them missiles or the ultrast nec of its techniques, but not enough to accomodate a good technology which has proven reliable at it for two centuries: THE DEMOCRATIE, THE TRUE ONE. Therefore, French can make all the possible administrative decisions, to manufacture texts of law inhuman and degrading, it will solve the problem of l`immigration only if, and only if, it signs the respect of the d`Afric dignity of the people and it gives up its privileges on the black continent. http://membres.lycos.fr/african97160/;;;;;;;;.<br><br>Does French have a DUTY OF MEMORY? Yes, this continuous French, in year 2002, to devastate, Bleed and meurtrir l`Afric, does it have a DUTY OF MEMORY? TIME OF PEACE AND TIME OF WAR!!! TIME OF WAR! The French needed the Africans. 14-18, we took part in the release of French of DANTON, ROBESPIERRE and Saint-just. Warlike recognition of the Africans n`a ever proven by this French Republic, in times of peace. TIME OF WAR, the French always need the Africans! 39-45, when French was occuppÃ©e by Nazi Germany, it needed the Africans without their imposing a residence permit. Why, devil, in TIMES OF PEACE, request-tone a residence permit to the descendants of the Senegalese riflemen? Why this French behave does like a Banana republic? Why this French, released by the Senegalese riflemen, impose does a residence permit to the Black Africans? Why does it arbitrarily imprison these Africans who is not asked to come here to French, in TIMES OF WAR? Why this French have not imposed a residence permit on Hitler? Does  French encourage cruelty in Africa? Questions to answer for those which have not lost their memory! Our continent is a true scene of theatre because of only French: Rally Paris-Dakar or Grenade-Dakar which kills our citizens, our grounds, our trees, our animals, all our environment, one appaludit by singing the Marseillaise; illegal detentions of our fellow-citizens in French because of a maudite residence permit or massive expulsions in "the Charters" of our sisters and brothers perpetrated by Pasqua-Cress-dÃ©brÃ©, one speaks about friendship and co-operation; undesirable African students in French which one expels like gangsters or wild beasts, one speaks about the francophonie. All that is unworthy for us African. The divine reward is neither to serve e man, nor to have dollard, this is dignity. Therefore, one have more right to defend the francophonie, if we are normal and intelligent Men. To lose in a company, this not more to die of hunger, this not be assigned with residence supervised by this French Army. This French military presence, in times of peace in Europe, is an insult with our people, a defamatory stain. Therefore, no African have not right of to amuse with army French which insults our people. My brothers, our People are considered, by French, commes "animals". These People always lived politically, economically, militarily dependent on French, in times of peace, they always lived in the negation, l`indignity. To finish, I wonder whether French does have a duty of memory with respect to the Africans, IN TIMES OF PEACE? It is necessary that this French knows that CRUELTY EAST a VERY LONG INJUSTICE!<br>They are the Men who make History and not the Submen .<br>I am 100% Blacks, I have a Universitaire level of the Art-and-Trades, I am Moule 97160 Guadeloupe.
