              <p>Tons of us is unhappy with the PAP, with so many down with PAP threads in this forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, you don't like the PAP as a government, fine by me. However I want to ask everyone here a question ( and members of the opposition party if they visit the forums)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you/ they READY to lead singapore in the event that the opposition pulls an unexpected upset?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is everyone in the opposition, every members ready to face the possibility that they might be the minsters? Even those smaller members who isn't the party head and etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP seems to me that they are prepared for the role of a opposition, but is the opposition READY to BE the government every day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to make do with certain policies that might not be popular, but is needed for the country?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to be hated by the public for your role as a government?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to do a better job leading singapore than the PAP, are you ready to lead singapore BETTER than OTHER party as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to be the prime minster? The minster of defence, the minster of finance, minster of education?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you able to ensure that singapore can be well off even if a global recession ( or in the worse case scenario, a global depression) ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you able to ensure that you can manage singapore well enough even if you are faced with matters BEYOND your control?</p>

              <p><br>Err with politics, there is no bottom to speak of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at china during the 20s-70s. Just when you think you have hit rock bottom, you went down even further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NOTHING is secure in life...how can you say it is at the bottom where we have nothing else to compare to?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everything is simply speculation in regards to the performance of the government. Just because the democratic system to THINK that the next government can be better, it does not mean it is necessarily better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are simply predicting the future..there is a safe bet and a unsafe bet. But it is STILL a bet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We can never be sure of the future unless we experience it ourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What we can be sure of, is a person will to do so. That is the only thing that we can be sure and see it for ourselves.</p>

              <p>In true democracies, governments hated by the public do not usually get the votes of the people in election. Of course not so in authoritarian Singapore.</p>

              <p>Is/Was Singapore well off even in a global recession? In the Asian financial crisis 10 years ago, I'm not so sure that Singapore rode it well though the PAP claimed they did.</p>

              when goh keng see, lee kuan yew, rajaratnem and old guard took over singapore, they had little experience in running a country. but in the end they still succeeded fantastically. 
              
              so, some of our opposition are ready to lead us if they have the passion for it and they get our support. yes, i am ready for change, and expect the hiccups associated with political transition.

              <p>Sure, you don't like the PAP as a government, fine by me.
              However I want to ask everyone here a question ( and members of the
              opposition party if they visit the forums)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you/ they READY to lead singapore in the event that the
              opposition pulls an unexpected upset?</p>

              <p>Is everyone in the opposition, every members ready to face the
              possibility that they might be the minsters? Even those smaller
              members who isn't the party head and etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP seems to me that they are prepared for the role of a
              opposition, but is the opposition READY to BE the government every
              day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to make do with certain policies that might not be

              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to be hated by the public for your role as a
              government?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to do a better job leading singapore than the PAP,
              are you ready to lead singapore BETTER than OTHER party as
              well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you ready to be the prime minster? The minster of defence,
              the minster of finance, minster of education?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you able to ensure that singapore can be well off even if a

              <p><br>The Ironic of it is that COE is decreasing, so is reduction in road tax, i hv doubt in the govt reducing car population here, they decreased COE and Road tax to lure people in, then erect ERP and increase prices to earn from it. Surely they would had balanced that ERP generate more income than COE and Road tax which is more or less constant figure. And if the by product is lesser car, how on earth are they going to earn more...think probably hor. PAP not stupid ya, they got scholars aplenty there, the think tank committee are not for fun.</p>

              <p>If you can separate the government from the party then without the the PAP you're left with a fine civil service and set of public institutions.  It's not as if the new ruling party would have to rebuild them. </p>
              <p>However, this is a moot point, as the opposition is not going to get in overnight.  The opposition will either reach power through a gradual process, whereby there will be time to bring in talent, or a new goverment will be borne from a major split in the existing parties. In that case existing talent and ministers can play a role in a new government.</p>
              <p>All this is not to negate the value of the opposition should they never get into power; the value of an alternate voice for the people, and checks and balances on the ruling party.</p>
