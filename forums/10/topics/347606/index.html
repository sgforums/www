              <p> </p>
              <p>Warning! This will be the strangest post I have ever contributed here. If you do not like the meta physical, please stop now and ignore this post. If you have no wish to be mentally ‘disturbed’, please stop now and ignore this post. If you are already mentally disturbed and unstable, please stop now and ignore this post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you are mentally strong, I hope you will give me a chance, read my presentation, and give some time to consider its message.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This will be the year of war. In battles, one gets to see the enemy, or use technology to detect the enemy, and then use various ammunitions type to destroy the enemy. But in this war, you will not get to see, hear, smell or use tech to detect the enemy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> It is the worse and most fearsome of all enemies mankind can ever confront. The enemy is invisible and you can only feel it but never know what the direction it attacks you. No one else can help you fight it and only you alone can engage with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This enemy is called <strong>FEAR</strong>. And the battlefield in your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you see the stock indexes fall, you feel <strong>FEAR</strong>.<br>When you read about 650 people being retrenched, you feel <strong>FEAR</strong>.<br>When you hear some people unable to gain employment for years, you feel <strong>FEAR</strong>.<br>When you study, the image of unemployment looms in your mind, you feel <strong>FEAR</strong>.<br>When the time to pay your bills comes, and you have little money, you feel <strong>FEAR</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fear crawls into the battlefield of your mind, and take swipes at you. You try to avoid it, but it is always there in your mind. You lock yourself into a video game, but it stares back at you insolently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You go into a cinema, to escape into another world for an hour or two, but when your turn around and look, you can see it sitting beside you. You drink to stupor, and enjoy a merciful sleep, but when you awake, fear smiles triumphantly back at you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You meet your acquaintances, and they too equally are in fear. You are not alone. It is now a global phenomenon. As you talk and discuss, fear looms bigger and bigger to dinosauric size, with hot blazing eyes staring at you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From its foul mouth, it shoots forth poisonous darts called panic, worry and doubts. It will not kill you, at least not yet, and will slowly chew away your brain fiber every moment of the day, till it totally eats up your brain cells and makes you take that leap of the ledge of a window on a high floor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With its dirty razor sharp paws, it claws at you, leaving marks known as anger, envy, intolerance and frustration in the corners of your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You try to run away and shut your mind, but those marks run deep and painful. You attempt to ease that pain by lashing it out at others, rightly or unjustly, mostly unjustly, to soften that pain throbbing in your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>These are what Fear does to you. But you are not alone. Mankind had faced fear since time began and had triumph before. The weapons of successful conquest are knowledge, truth, patience and resilience. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even the bravest of men – the commandos, know fear. When they jump out of an aircraft at 15,000 ft into thin air, they too feel fear beside them prior to the jump. But they know that they had prepared their parachutes and checked carefully, and know it will open, as it had opened for others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With such knowledge, they dispel fear and thrash it to oblivion, and jump without fear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stock prices are volatile all the time, and do not reflect a true gauge of a company’s health or performance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a truth and ammunition for battle against Fear.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>650 may be retrenched today. 6,000 may be retrenched tomorrow. But can 1.9million people be retrenched? If you are one of the retrenched, is there no job available in public sector?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thousands of jobs are made available, and thousands more possible, if one is not choosy. Such jobs may not be ideal, or pay much, but one can survive on it for sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The crisis is only temporary. Earth’s fundamentals are still strong and mankind still have basic needs to be met. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a truth and ammunition for battle against Fear.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Schooling is a means to gain knowledge. Crisis or no crisis, one still needs to learn, in order to make a living. When the world is stable, able minds would be required.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus knowledge is vital. The govt had stepped in to ensure anyone who wants to learn will not be denied the opportunity to do so, so that they do not need to worry, just focus 100% on learning and getting skills. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a truth and ammunition for battle against Fear.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you have no money to pay your bills, it would mean you had over-extended the earning capacity of yourself.  The only solution is to make a correction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simplest action is to cut down consumption. Most extreme would be to declare for bankruptcy and pay off your creditors through a longer period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are flawed human beings and make mistakes. The only time we should be ashamed is when we refuse to confront and correct our mistakes but to continue on making worse out of it, driving ourselves deeper into the pit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your life is more precious than the credit card debt, car loan debt, home loan debt and even gambling debts. A human life once destroyed, is lost forever. You can never return.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As long as one still breathes,  have hands and legs, debts can always be repaid back thru honest work. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a reality and ammunition for battle against Fear. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anger and frustration itself cannot kill one. The pain is real. Energy develops from it. But instead of using such energy to vent on others, it can be channeled to more productive use, such as intensifying your labor output:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>–  from a student - studying harder for his test, road sweeper – taking shorter breaks and sweep more streets, sales engineer – work with a team to creatively seek solutions to close cases, to the PM – cracking his whip on civil servant scholars to seek out of the box solutions or look into dusty files called proposals to find for solutions out of our crisis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>News reports, statistics, biased opinions and criticisms  may be adverse and disheartening daily, but Fear can be conquered. It is a battle that only you and you alone can win, just like anyone and everyone else in our world have to do now, for that battle is in each and every individual’s own mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True friends, society and govt can only place ammunition at your disposal.  But the choice and willingness to accept ammo and battle it out it is yours alone to make.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one else can fight in out on your behalf within the deep recesses of your mind. Unless you enjoy being enraptured and conquered by fear, living a wasted life of unecessary misery, bitterness and frustration in this crisis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> No one, absolutely no one, no matter who you are - roadsweeper or  PM, wants you to live in misery. <strong>You are one of us, descendents of our forefathers whom give us our today</strong>. May you make the right choice.Cheers!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Whom i vote for matters little, for i am only a drop in the large ocean of Singapore society. but what you and others vote will matter alot. Espacially during this financial crisis.</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter who rules, but what matters is the one who rules must take the necessary actions that will get us out of the crisis, thru his leadership team using  experience,reason, logic, facts and figures and at times, calculated risks.</p>
              <p>Thus we need to have a leader we can trust during this crisis and rally behind him. This is not the time to argue, spark dissension, or squabble over petty issues anymore.</p>
              <p>The crisis is real and only the strong willed will survive. They may even go hungry and broke, but their strength and perseverance will be strong to overcome the odds. And it will be the strong whom will help pull the weak out of this abyss. So too must our leader be even stronger, not mad.</p>
              <p>Once we are out of the crisis, go ahead and play your political petty games. In times of peace and plenty, a little experiment aint gonna hurt anyone. But in these troubled times, do think twice, I beg.</p>
