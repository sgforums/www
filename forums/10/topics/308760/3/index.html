              <p>The lyrics is really quite simple.If you could sing a beatle song this one is really no problem.The job of an adult /teacher is to pass down knowledge correctly so that a young person would not grow up to be ignorant like passing a baton in a relay race.The Anthem is not a Tupac rapp music it has meaning and purpose so do keep up the tradition in understanding it.</p>

              <p>it came to me why the national anthem would probably never be changed/sung in any other language.....</p>
              <p>Since singapore is an asian country....our leaders want singapore to have its own identity......not malay, nor chinese or any other race but a singapore identity.....</p>
              <p>we didn't want to use english probably becoz we didn't want to be viewed as an english 1st world wannabe community.....</p>
              <p>we wanted our own community....we are proud to be an asian community.....the singapore community......</p>
              <p>i think that was wot our leaders thought......</p>
              <p>so changing the national anthem to english would be inappropriate....and changing it to any other language would mean that they are siding a race making it racism.....so the best would've been to leave it as it was...hmmm</p>

              <p>I'm proud of the Anthem because it reflects our reality. That we are a South-east Asian state in the Malay Archipelago.</p>
              <p>Why change it? Malay is our national language. Anyway, Malay is important and we should all learn it. Better to understand the mindset of our neighbours and their editorials too.</p>

              <p>our inability to master malay as a language is one of SG education biggest failure.</p>
              <p>u never know how important it is until one start travelling to places like malaysia and indonesia for business. rather than casting our sights on china's market, we should focus locally as well.</p>
              <p>MOE should allow schools to teach malay as a 3rd option language.</p>

              <p><br>More than ten years ago I travelled to Java, and I was surprised that the Indonesians there were surprised that I could speak Malay (Bahasa). It occured to me it is because that most Singaporean they met could not speak Malay. Yes it is a shame that the present generation could not speak Malay. My mother never went to school, yet she could speak Malay, at least the pasar version. We are in the middle of the Malay Archepelago, for God's sake. This is another short comming of a government who micromanage everything. Some things just slip up. During the tsunami aid period LKY said that Malay ought to be introduced into the education syllabus, as being able to speak Malay helped our aid workers to be effective. Kudos to the wise and learned man for making a brilliant suggestion. I suggested the same thing after my trip to Java in CNA forum, and got flamed.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Some European countries like Germany and France used to think that English could be a threat to their own language and culture,as you can see it is not so today everybody wants to learn it .In South East Asia it is not a disadvantage to learn Malay,dont have to be fluent as in English but just a basic knowledge is good enough.Also not forgetting that this was the language that bridged the various ethnic groups in the good old days.As for the Singapore national Anthem,I would say that it was written by a good composer and very original indeed cuz a lot of the World Anthems were taken from other songs.</p></div>
