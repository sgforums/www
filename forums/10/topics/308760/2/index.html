              <p>spore was number 29th in terms of security becoz of statistics......the reason being so was becoz of the size of our army even though its size was relatively big enough for our country and all.....</p>

              <p>I am not saying that malays r the only ones with black sheeps...
                  all other races have black sheeps too... it's either u see it or u

              <p>so wat u r trying to say that these black sheep were the bad

                  kind of black sheeps is to just be true to only one culture that u
                  r from? malays stays in malay kampong, chinese stay in chinese

              <p>Arent you being the racist here... Does it matter where we all
                  came from, we r here now... rite now in singapore... nothing can
                  change that...</p>
              <p>But if u say that these black sheeps were effects of
                  multi-culturalness, i would disagree... how about the malay black
                  sheeps in m'sia(Mat remp-it - if i am not wrong)? I doubt that they

              <p>i dunno if this would help but just a quote from wiki about translation;</p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Translations</span></h3>
              <p>Interviewed by the Oral History Department in 1989, Dr. Toh Chin
              Chye said it was appropriate for the national anthem to be in Malay,
              "the indigenous language of the region, as English is not native to
              this part of the world." He felt that the "Malay version of the
              national anthem would appeal to all races... it can be easily
              understood. And at the same time [it] can be easily remembered... [I]t
              must be brief, to the point; ... and can be sung"<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-26">[30]</a></sup> However, on <a title="July 22" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_22">22 July</a> <a title="1991" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991">1991</a>, the English daily newspaper <em><a title="The Straits Times" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times">The Straits Times</a></em> reported that during a meeting between the then Prime Minister <a title="Goh Chok Tong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong">Goh Chok Tong</a> and community leaders,<sup id="_ref-ST:_Few_understand_lyrics_0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Few_understand_lyrics">[31]</a></sup> a group of <a title="Grassroots" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots">grassroots</a> leaders and a lawyer had suggested that "adjustments" should be made to
              the national anthem. The given reason was that many Singaporeans could
              not sing it in Malay and therefore did not have "strong feelings" or
              "strong emotions when they sing the national anthem".<sup id="_ref-ST:_Raja_0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Raja">[32]</a></sup> In particular, some grassroots leaders argued that since the Chinese
              constitute a majority of the population, a Mandarin version of the
              anthem should be used.<sup id="_ref-ST:_Raja_1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Raja">[32]</a></sup> The Prime Minister's response was that he would keep the national
              anthem as it was while ensuring that translations in other mother
              tongues were more easily available.<sup id="_ref-ST:_Few_understand_lyrics_1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Few_understand_lyrics">[31]</a></sup> The proposal to change the lyrics was also criticized by former Deputy Prime Minister <a title="S. Rajaratnam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Rajaratnam">S. Rajaratnam</a>,
              who felt that the Malay lyrics of the anthem were so simple that
              "anyone over the age of five, unless mentally retarded, had no
              difficulty singing the anthem. All Singaporean children of kindergarten
              age have not only had no difficulty memorising the words but have for
              decades sung it every morning with 'strong feelings and emotion'." He
              also noted that the anthem had been translated into Singapore's three

              <h3><span>Translations</span></h3>
              <p>Interviewed by the Oral History Department in 1989, Dr. Toh Chin Chye said it was appropriate for the national anthem to be in Malay, "the indigenous language of the region, as English is not native to this part of the world." He felt that the "Malay version of the national anthem would appeal to all races... it can be easily understood. And at the same time [it] can be easily remembered... [I]t must be brief, to the point; ... and can be sung"<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-26">[30]</a></sup> However, on <a title="July 22" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_22">22 July</a> <a title="1991" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991">1991</a>, the English daily newspaper <em><a title="The Straits Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times">The Straits Times</a></em> reported that during a meeting between the then Prime Minister <a title="Goh Chok Tong" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong">Goh Chok Tong</a> and community leaders,<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Few_understand_lyrics">[31]</a></sup> a group of <a title="Grassroots" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots">grassroots</a> leaders and a lawyer had suggested that "adjustments" should be made to the national anthem. The given reason was that many Singaporeans could not sing it in Malay and therefore did not have "strong feelings" or "strong emotions when they sing the national anthem".<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Raja">[32]</a></sup> In particular, some grassroots leaders argued that since the Chinese constitute a majority of the population, a Mandarin version of the anthem should be used.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Raja">[32]</a></sup> The Prime Minister's response was that he would keep the national anthem as it was while ensuring that translations in other mother tongues were more easily available.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Few_understand_lyrics">[31]</a></sup> The proposal to change the lyrics was also criticized by former Deputy Prime Minister <a title="S. Rajaratnam" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Rajaratnam">S. Rajaratnam</a>, who felt that the Malay lyrics of the anthem were so simple that "anyone over the age of five, unless mentally retarded, had no difficulty singing the anthem. All Singaporean children of kindergarten age have not only had no difficulty memorising the words but have for decades sung it every morning with 'strong feelings and emotion'." He also noted that the anthem had been translated into Singapore's three other official languages (<a title="English language" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, <a title="Standard Mandarin" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Mandarin">Mandarin</a> and <a title="Tamil language" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language">Tamil</a>) for those who cannot understand Malay.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majulah_Singapura#_note-ST:_Raja">[32]</a></sup></p>
