Secondly, PAP did not go all out the capture these wards and if you care to check the records even some PAP supporters were stunned and disappointed at that time.<br></div></blockquote>As i recall, there was limited coverage of the media in both of these wards; this can be attributed to attempts to lower the opposition's profile and campaign efforts in these single-seat wards during elections.<br><br>However, who can forget the antics of Seetoh during his pro-PAP campaign? Effort and determination to take Potong Pasir was there.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Minister George Yeo hopes for minimal changes to Aljunied GRC team</strong><br>By May Wong, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>Foreign Minister George Yeo said he hoped there would be minimal changes to his existing Aljunied GRC team so he could work with them again at the upcoming General Election.<br><br>Mr Yeo spoke to reporters after opening a new 4-storey market at Block 105, Hougang Avenue 1 on Sunday.<br><br>He spoke to various stall-holders as he toured the S$9 million market.<br><br>On the Budget statement, Mr Yeo said it was a constant effort on the government's part to take care of Singaporeans.<br><br>He said: "I don't think we can say, oh well, elections are coming, so we sweeten the ground, and people are happy. I don't think Singaporeans are so simple-minded. They'll observe what the government has been doing over the years, measure us against what we have promised in the past."<br><br>"Have they kept their word? Have they been true to their principles? It's on this basis that they say look, can they take us into the future? So that's the approach that we take. In an election year, you make sure that the budget is a buoyant one."<br><br>And on whether Singaporeans could expect new faces to be fielded in Aljunied GRC, Mr Yeo said he was happy with his existing team.<br><br>He said: "I hope there'll be minimal changes, I'll be quite happy to go into battle with this same team because we have developed a strong bond of friendship and we've been able to work very well together."<br><br>He said he and his team had been working the Aljunied ground for the last 4 years or so and there had been visible improvements.<br><br>But Mr Yeo said ultimately it was for the people to decide and he and his team were ready to fight and win every vote.<br><br>The Workers' Party has said it plans to contest in Aljunied GRC.<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "They've been here and there sporadically, dropping their namecards and telling people that they're around but I notice in the last few months, they spend less time here. I think they've been looking at other constituencies as well. But I expect them to come. Because they came here the last time, but unfortunately they didn't fill in their forms properly so this time round, they'll come back."<br><br>The new Hougang Market started operations in December last year after a S$9 million facelift.<br><br>It includes new amenities like lifts, escalators and wider walkways, which Minister Yeo says are critical to accommodate Singapore's aging population.<br><br>When asked about the mood of residents after meeting some of them at the new Hougang market, Mr Yeo had this to say: "People are very warm and enthusiastic. I think partly because the economy is better, not to say that everyone is doing well. There are shops not doing so well, even in this hawker centre, a bit more way out, sometimes, there're problems here and there, we cannot expect everyone to be happy."<br><br>"But on the whole, the economy compared to last year or about 2 years ago is doing much better and I think this trend should continue at least this year. But it depends a lot on the American economy and whether things remain buoyant in those big markets." - CNA/ch<br><br></div>
