              <p>So so sad... now more than 900 deaths. latest news is that Israel does not want to deny that they used **i can't rmb what it is*.. Yet if u watch the news, it is the bomb which exploded mid air and cover a vast area, it will then have a white smoke/gas on its tail. Smtg like flare. And so, that white smoke contain phosphurous and is sensitive to the skin. it is ban to be used in such way as it may affect civilians..</p>
              <p>Maybe journalists were killed becos of ^^..</p>

              <p>It certainly is horrendous. The casualties are mounting and yet Hamas is continually defying calls for truce and yet continue to hide amongst civilians to raise the death toll further, with no regards to palestinians whom are but 'sacrifices' in their idealogy to further wipe out an ethnic group!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is 'disportionate' when each life is precious to their loved ones? Israel is willing to stop. But Hamas is dead set on killing every jew and infidel in this world, even sacrificing fellow palestinians!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How long more are the muslims in our world going to remain silent and not condemn Hamas, and call them to stop?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many more innocent palestinians dead and the tarnishing of their peaceful religion twisted to allow genocide in this age will then the muslims demand for the heads of Hamas? </p>

              <p><br>That is 13 nations. Assuming simple calculations, the number of nation states in the world would be approximately 15.  I believe there a more than 15 nation states in the entire world. More nations are experiecing some sort of political, racial, ideological, religious, territorial conflicts. This is not the arena for you to exhibit hatred, prejudice or racism. I advise you to stop your pathetic attempts to portray arabs or muslims in the negative light especially when you employ generalised, unsupported and false statments to profess your despicable sentiments. Even if you insist, do it in a smarter way. As I mentioned before, it makes you appear utterly dumb. Or are you?  </p>

              <p>I say current conflicts. The list is not complete. I can add on many more countries involved in conflicts in the last 100 years, either by Muslims against others or Muslims against Muslims. That does not include countries that have experienced terrorist bombings. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>As of 12 Jan 2009*</p>
              <p> Israeli dead: 13 + 8 (This is the dead from the
                          rocket/mortar attacks in 2008,  information taken from
                          wikiepdia)</p>
              <p>Palestinians: 905</p>
              <p>Common sense would tell me this is an extremely disproportional
                          result. When you ask someone to use the term common sense, you
                          are assuming that everyone is going to look at the stituation with
                          the same value system you have.</p>
              <p>Truthfully, i agree with you this has nothing to do with
                          History. But the people who believe Israel is justified in this
                          discussion are the ones pulling out all the history, siting it as
                          truth that the Israelis are only partipating in self defense,
                          not wholesale slaughter.</p>
              <p>Jarhum is merely correcting the history that they are
                          quoting.</p>
              <p>Common sense also tells me BOTH sides must have done something
                          wrong when two people are fighting.</p>
              <p>Common sense tells me that i wouldn't shoot rockets at the
                          houses of others if i feel there is no injustice
                          involved.</p>
              <p> Common sense tells me a death ratio of 1:45(rounded
                          up) is not all a reasonable response, no matter how
                          justifiable.</p>

              <p>Stevenson,</p>
              <p>Your common sense is also as appalling. No really.</p>
              <p>So common sense tells you it's ok to shoot rockets into your neighbour's backyard because they bar you from entering their house ???? hhahahahahh!!!</p>
              <p>Look at what HAMAS is doing ? </p>
              <p>HAMAS wants the Palestinians to DIE.</p>
              <p>If HAMAS really cares about the Palestinians.. they will not hide among the civilians.</p>
              <p>They will be fighting the war at the borders instead of running into the crowds of women and children and innocent men like a  bunch of COWARDS.</p>
              <p>HAMAS would have stopped their nonsense knowing so many of their OWN people are suffering. Do they stop ?? NO. They claim they are winning the war !!!</p>
              <p>What kind of crap is HAMAS doing ????</p>
              <p>Look at world war 2. The Japanese sustained a huge loss after Hiroshima. Do they keep on fighting ? NO. They surrender !!!</p>
              <p>Will HAMAS surrender ? Perhaps not.. because to HAMAS, 900+ Palestinian dead is to them only small price to pay for their 75 virgins.</p>
              <p>All HAMAS needs to do is step down.. agree to a ceasefire. Are they doing it ? NO.</p>
              <p>If the muslim community really cares about their own brothers and sisters in religion. Then they should be protesting for HAMAS to step down .</p>
              <p>Instead.. they protests against Israel. They protests against the west.</p>
              <p>I really don't understand what they are thinking.</p>

              <p>"but collectively I do not trust the "jemmiah islamiah". They
                              are evil.</p>

                              they behave peacefully, but when they grow, they become
                              belligerent, discriminatory, and oppressive and
                              imperialistic contrary to the tenets promised in their
                              theology."</p>
              <p>This statement is not associated to terrorists act by al-qaeda
                              or JI for they are of the minority few.  The acts of this
                              people who comprise of a minute proportion of the larger muslim
                              world are condoned by the larger muslim community. However, this
                              renegade asserts that the larger Muslim community is as such.</p>
              <p>I am not appalled at an individuals ignorance of Islam or its
                              history but rather appalled towards baseless assertion which
                              contradicts history or whichever subject matter which concerns
                              it. </p>
              <p>The moral of the story is, If you are not well informed with
                              regards to a certain topic, refrain from making wild, asserting
                              statements which may result in widespread consequences.</p>
              <p>Your incapacity to comprehend with simple assertions baffles me.
                              Your constant referrence to analogies reflect your inability for
                              full understanding.</p>
              <p>Let me put acroos this point in your own words, " If i'm a
                              doctor I would not reprimand or be appalled with a patient for his
                              ignorance about his health condition but rather his odesity to
                              argue with baseless and unfounded as well as even contradictory
                              statements with someone who has exercised due dilligence on the
                              topic."</p>
              <p>If you really think I lack COMMON SENSE, you are most welcome to
                              challenge me to a discussion or debate. This is the second time I

              <p>Ok Jarhum, so what exactly is your point ? Really. Hhahahahahh !!!</p>
              <p>My "constant referrence to analogies" is simply to make everything SIMPLE enough so people like you who likes to complicate things gets to understand it in very SIMPLE terms. Gettit ?</p>
              <p>You keep saying we don't understand muslim history... ok ok .. so we don't. Now what ?</p>
              <p>Will understanding Islam's history change our perceptions ?</p>
              <p>Will understanding Islam's history .. turn us against our common sense ?</p>
              <p>Will understanding Islam's history.. makes us hate the jews more and be more sympathetic towards the Islamic extremists more ?</p>
              <p>I don't know Jarhum. YOU tell me. I'm listening.</p>
              <p>By the way Jarhum.. this is a discussion forum. What's there to challenge? And what is it you want to challenge ???? You want to challenge me to a hand to hand combat duel ???  Or you want to use your mind force against mine aka star wars style ???hahahahahh... too funny !</p>
              <p>If you win.. you get to write a letter to tell HAMAS to dissapear from Gaza so the Gazans may have peace. If you lose.. I buy you a jug of beer. Ok ?</p>
              <p>You want to discuss.. then discuss here. Ok ? good.</p>

              <p>Hmmmm....<br> You guys do know that there was no state of Israel till 1948, where by the Jews
                  invaded or took the land of the Palestines.</p>
              <p>They basically invaded Palestine with the backing of England. From then till
                  now they have been encroaching of Palestine's land. They now created two areas
                  for the people of Palestine to live in Gaza(1969) and the west bank. These
                  areas are considered the biggest open air prisons in the world.</p>
              <p>The area is surrounded by 6 story high concrete walls. Nothing can enter or
                  exit without the permission of the Israel guards who are in control of the
                  border. The people of Palestine cannot do any sort of trading for everything coming
                  in or out is controlled by Israel. Even food and aid is controlled by them.</p>
              <p>If the Israelites do not let the trucks come in and supply food for the
                  people of Palestine they can do nothing but starve. There was a harbour which
                  was built with the help of France and Netherlands but Israel kept bombing it. (read
                  it up in wikipedia) (would you consider it terrorism???)</p>
              <p>The Palestinians have no army at all. Just a bunch of self declared soldiers.</p>
              <p>In recent years after declaring areas for Palestinians to live in, some of
                  the people of Israel started taking over Palestinian land in the west bank. And
                  guess what the Palestinians can do nothing about it. There is no justice.</p>
              <p>The only place where the Israelites don’t touch is Gaza. and there is an
                  estimated 1.4 million people living in that small piece of land called Gaza.
                  Check it out seriously compared to the whole of Israel they are packing so many
                  people in a small area. Thus Gaza is one of the most populated areas per km.</p>
              <p>Lets take this information and look at it in a different way. Lets say that
                  Singapore controlled Malaysia(Malaysian land is ours).</p>
              <p>One day the Japanese came and invaded the land. They took over the whole
                  place and pushed everyone who was not Japanese to Singapore(they take over the
                  whole of Malaysia). (if you cannot get the picture think abt it in the context
                  of Singapore and Sentosa)</p>
              <p>Now they bombed our harbours and airports. They built walls around Singapore
                  to prevent anyone from going out or coming in. You can’t do any sort of
                  trading. Your economy crashes and you need foreign aid.</p>
              <p>However the aid that comes in is regulated by the Japanese. They patrol the
                  streets in armoured convoys and have ultimate power.</p>
              <p>You become like trapped animals. Even when Singapore was taken over by the Japanese
                  we organised a resistance. And people were proud to fight the enemy and died
                  with dignity.</p>
              <p>For the people of Palestine this is no different. They fight the only way
                  they know how and the Palestine people understand this that is why Hamas in
                  still in power. If the actions of Hamas took place in any other country they’d
                  be overthrown no doubt abt it.</p>
              <p>They only way peace will be achieved is if the Palestinians are no longer
                  oppressed. And this oppression has been going on for over 40 years.</p>
              <p>I hope I’ve given you a different view to consider. God Bless..</p>

              <p>Not to sound like a pacifist, but the sook ching probably would not have occured if the Malayan Communist Party didn't start creating so much trouble for the Japanese.  The Japanese had to kill a lot of Chinese guys in Singapore because they were afraid of such insurgent elements here.  </p>

              wikiepdia)</p>
              <p>Palestinians: 905</p>
              <p>Common sense would tell me this is an extremely disproportional
              result. When you ask someone to use the term common sense, you
              are assuming that everyone is going to look at the stituation with
              the same value system you have.</p>
              <p>Truthfully, i agree with you this has nothing to do with
              History. But the people who believe Israel is justified in this
              discussion are the ones pulling out all the history, siting it as
              truth that the Israelis are only partipating in self defense,
              not wholesale slaughter.</p>
              <p>Jarhum is merely correcting the history that they are
              quoting.</p>
              <p>Common sense also tells me BOTH sides must have done something
              wrong when two people are fighting.</p>
              <p>Common sense tells me that i wouldn't shoot rockets at the
              houses of others if i feel there is no injustice
              involved.</p>
              <p> Common sense tells me a death ratio of 1:45(rounded
              up) is not all a reasonable response, no matter how
              justifiable.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Surely it is not the case that the more impressive the kill ratio, the more guilty a side should be?</p>
              <p>The sites targeted were those that were storing or operating some of those rockets that were being used to shoot into Israel.  Imagine the kind of quantity of high explosives stored those facilities.  Now imagine a bomb smashing through building detonating all those rockets and explosive materials.</p>
              <p>My point is, Hamas is equally responsible for the collateral damage on 2 fronts.</p>
              <p>1.  For storing and operating them in dense civilian populations.</p>
              <p>2.  That their explosives were responsible for collateral damage as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is Israel justified to retaliate for the rocket attacks?  In my opinion, YES. </p>
              <p>But is Israel guilty for overuse of force? In my opinion, also YES.  However, that being said, one is more assured of victory amassing more than sufficient firepower in battle than having amassed insufficient.   </p>
              <p>Debating who is right and who is wrong is only secondary to what should be done now; finding a way to stop this.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Hamas is at the centre of this conflict that needs to be taken out of the picture.  Hamas as a military wing must disband, and as a political organization, cease to exist.  If the Palestinians in Gaza do not terrorize Israel with suicide bombings and rocket attacks, Israel would have no right to militarily oppress Gaza. </p>
              <p>Even after that, it won't be peace.  But at least there will be reduced bloodshed.</p>

              <p>Did Hamas win any political mandate from the people of Gaza, or did Hamas win a pyrrhic victory that resulted in a larger loss to the Palestinian people as a whole ?</p>
              <p>Hamas supposed political victory at the 2006 elections was a result that had <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_legislative_election,_2006">Hamas winning only 44.45% and Fatah 41.43%  </a>- with the remaining percentage held by independents.</p>
              <p>It was sheer dumbness on the Palestinian population as a whole to wilfully snub the international communities' views towards Hamas by electing Hamas into power; only to see the required international funding stopped to prevent the funds going into the hands of Hamas - known for their terrorists activities, and for their refusal to renounce the destruction of another sovereign state.</p>
              <p>The World should simply step aside and let the Palestinians and Arabs resolve the mess that they have created for themselves. </p>

              <p>Secondly, would it not be logical for Hamas to be unable to run away from the purposefully selected firing sites for their weapon systems, considering their lack of military training, and nil military strategies ?</p>
              <p>Finally, if their objective is to gain victory in the propaganda war against Israel, and to create international outrage towards Israel - would they not locate their activities in the midst of dense concentration of Palestinian residential areas ? </p>

              <p>Abu Marzook, interviewed last week, said that Hamas had no intention

              which hit Israel on Monday – as just <strong>"sending a message"</strong> to the Jewish
              state.</p>

              stopping the aggression from the Israelis against the civilian
              population in the Gaza Strip. But we are sending a message [by firing
              rockets]: 'We will not surrender.' We have to fight the Israelis and we
              will win this battle," he says. "<strong>We know we are going to lose a lot of
              people from our side, but we are going to win, inshallah [God willing]."</strong></p>

              <p>Surely it is not the case that the more impressive the kill ratio, the more guilty a side should be?</p>
              <p>The sites targeted were those that were storing or operating some of those rockets that were being used to shoot into Israel.  Imagine the kind of quantity of high explosives stored those facilities.  Now imagine a bomb smashing through building detonating all those rockets and explosive materials.</p>

              <p>No, i said both sides must have done something to provoke the other side. But the problem thus far is everyone is saying Israel hands are clean and completely justified in attacking civilians. The civilians are not dying in a few scattered incidents, they are suffering the majority of the casualties.</p>
              <p>Let's take your logic and turn it around, if Israel do not continously cut the Palestinians in Gaza access from food, water, electricity and the infrastructure for proper sanitation where would Hamas get the volunteers for suicide bombings and rockets attacks? Both of us are working and paid sufficient salaries to survive, would we want to be suicide bombers or fire rockets into Malaysia?</p>
              <p>We both would not do it because we have comfortable lives and do not wish to do anything to disrupt that peace. What happens when Malaysia cuts off our water and food? Take out our power plants and cripple our sanitation systems? Would we not do the same?</p>
              <p>I don't believe Hamas is retaining support because of any religious/racial/cultural reasons but simply because the Palestinians in Gaza are sick and tired of being pushed around and living in horrible environments. The Middle East nations wouldn't take them, why would they want millions of refugees to stress their society?</p>
              <p>You're right on one point, there won't be peace. The blood from this conflict is far too great. Even if Hamas disbanded, a new Hamas will be borned from the families of those killed in this conflict. Rockets and mortar will still continue to land on Israel irregardless of the result of this conflict.</p>
              <p>But pinning the blame solely on the Palestinians is ignoring the core of the problem.</p>

              <p>If America attacked us are we sepouse to lay down and submit? Cause that's the message you sending.</p>
              <p>"When you struggle unnecessary with no hopes of winning against a
              superior enemy, all you are doing is creating unnecessary
              collateral trouble and suffering."<br>- You might have just said lay down and die. Which is not the the way anyone or nation would act aspecialy Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>"no one wants another
              basketcase in the Middle East.  They have shown no
              organization to infrastructure development or economic
              developments,"<br>-Of coz they have no infrastructure or economic developments, whatever infrastructure that they have is being bombed! By Israel. Israel does not want the Palestines to have any sort of power but only to be dependent on them. Thus the bombing any type of trading center like the shipyard and blocades around the whole settlement preventing anything from going in or going out. How is a country sepouse to develop?</p>
              <p>We have to look at the cause which created this problem which came into effect 41 years ago. The arab nations have tried to protect the people of Palestines twice, the first which failed terriblely and they failed the second time only when the American came in and protected an invading nation(Israel).</p>
              <p>"No one wants to sweep a stable country like Israel out, for a
              potential basketcase. "<br>Just because they are a stable country does not mean they are right. If Germany won the world war would the Holocaust be any less wrong?</p>

              <p>Have i ever said Hamas hands are clean in this manner? </p>
              <p>No, i said both sides must have done something to provoke the
              other side. But the problem thus far is everyone is saying Israel
              hands are clean and completely justified in attacking civilians.
              The civilians are not dying in a few scattered incidents, they are
              suffering the majority of the casualties.</p>
              <p>Let's take your logic and turn it around, if Israel do not
              continously cut the Palestinians in Gaza access from food, water,
              electricity and the infrastructure for proper sanitation where
              would Hamas get the volunteers for suicide bombings and rockets
              attacks? Both of us are working and paid sufficient salaries to
              survive, would we want to be suicide bombers or fire rockets into
              Malaysia?</p>
              <p>We both would not do it because we have comfortable lives and do
              not wish to do anything to disrupt that peace. What happens when
              Malaysia cuts off our water and food? Take out our power plants and
              cripple our sanitation systems? Would we not do the same?</p>
              <p>I don't believe Hamas is retaining support because of any
              religious/racial/cultural reasons but simply because the
              Palestinians in Gaza are sick and tired of being pushed around and
              living in horrible environments. The Middle East nations wouldn't
              take them, why would they want millions of refugees to stress their
              society?</p>
              <p>You're right on one point, there won't be peace. The blood from
              this conflict is far too great. Even if Hamas disbanded, a new
              Hamas will be borned from the families of those killed in this
              conflict. Rockets and mortar will still continue to land on Israel
              irregardless of the result of this conflict.</p>
              <p>But pinning the blame solely on the Palestinians is ignoring the
              core of the problem.</p>

              <p>To break it, my opinion is simply to take one side out of the equation and see what happens.  Since Israel is an established state for more than 61 years, it's not going anywhere.  Hence, Hamas has to go. </p>

              <p>Everyone has a right to live in peace, and surely the Israelis having had the experience of being persecuted throughout history - from Biblical Days till the present - would feel for the Palestinians caught in the same situation as in their history.</p>
              <p>There have been so many missed opportunities during the Presidency of Arafat, who had his own vain agenda to fulfill instead of reaching out for peace with Israel as Egyptian President Sadat had done and changed the status quo of the relationship between Egypt and Israel.</p>
              <p>The efforts to resolve the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict would have been settled with the Palestinians led by President Abbas, and when Israel was led by PM Sharon - who had begun dismantling the Jewish settlements even as he was the strongest proponent for the spread of these settlements.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the entire peace process was scuttled with Hamas being funded by Iran, and sharing the same vain objective of seeing to the destruction of Israel.</p>
              <p>Hamas is poison to the Palestinian cause, and is no better then the loafer with nothing to do and to be employed by someone with an ambitious agenda to takeover the entire neighborhood by destabilising everyone and everything.</p>
              <p>Israel understand the mentality of the Arabs better then anyone not from the Middle-east region, and while the Israeli methods used is violent and excessive by anyone's standard - it is unfortunately the reality in being the only language that will gain Israel the respect from those who will use violence to threaten them.</p>
              <p>This has been established as a fact, with the big players like Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt all accepting the status quo since the 1967 Six-Day War - when all the combined forces of these front-line countries were neutralised, and vast tracts of territories were lost and held for decades until peace treaty was established.</p>
              <p>Now that the big players understand the futility of violence, it is the small players - like Hezbollah and Hamas - being instigated and funded by Iran that is threatening peace in the region.</p>

              <p>Hmmmm....<br> You guys do know that there was no state of Israel till 1948, where
              by the Jews invaded or took the land of the Palestines.</p>
              <p>They basically invaded Palestine with the backing of England.
              From then till now they have been encroaching of Palestine's land.
              They now created two areas for the people of Palestine to live in
              Gaza(1969) and the west bank. These areas are considered the
              biggest open air prisons in the world.</p>
              <p>The area is surrounded by 6 story high concrete walls. Nothing
              can enter or exit without the permission of the Israel guards who
              are in control of the border. The people of Palestine cannot do any
              sort of trading for everything coming in or out is controlled by
              Israel. Even food and aid is controlled by them.</p>
              <p>If the Israelites do not let the trucks come in and supply food
              for the people of Palestine they can do nothing but starve. There
              was a harbour which was built with the help of France and
              Netherlands but Israel kept bombing it. (read it up in wikipedia)
              (would you consider it terrorism???)</p>
              <p>The Palestinians have no army at all. Just a bunch of self
              declared soldiers.</p>
              <p>In recent years after declaring areas for Palestinians to live
              in, some of the people of Israel started taking over Palestinian
              land in the west bank. And guess what the Palestinians can do
              nothing about it. There is no justice.</p>
              <p>The only place where the Israelites don’t touch is Gaza. and
              there is an estimated 1.4 million people living in that small piece
              of land called Gaza. Check it out seriously compared to the whole
              of Israel they are packing so many people in a small area. Thus
              Gaza is one of the most populated areas per km.</p>
              <p>Lets take this information and look at it in a different way.
              Lets say that Singapore controlled Malaysia(Malaysian land is
              ours).</p>
              <p>One day the Japanese came and invaded the land. They took over
              the whole place and pushed everyone who was not Japanese to
              Singapore(they take over the whole of Malaysia). (if you cannot get
              the picture think abt it in the context of Singapore and
              Sentosa)</p>
              <p>Now they bombed our harbours and airports. They built walls
              around Singapore to prevent anyone from going out or coming in. You
              can’t do any sort of trading. Your economy crashes and you need
              foreign aid.</p>
              <p>However the aid that comes in is regulated by the Japanese. They
              patrol the streets in armoured convoys and have ultimate power.</p>
              <p>You become like trapped animals. Even when Singapore was taken
              over by the Japanese we organised a resistance. And people were
              proud to fight the enemy and died with dignity.</p>
              <p>For the people of Palestine this is no different. They fight the
              only way they know how and the Palestine people understand this
              that is why Hamas in still in power. If the actions of Hamas took
              place in any other country they’d be overthrown no doubt abt
              it.</p>
              <p>They only way peace will be achieved is if the Palestinians are
              no longer oppressed. And this oppression has been going on for over
              40 years.</p>
              <p>I hope I’ve given you a different view to consider. God
              Bless..</p>

              <p>It was sheer dumbness on the Palestinian population as a whole

              by electing Hamas into power; only to see the required
              international funding stopped to prevent the funds going into the
              hands of Hamas - known for their terrorists activities, and for
              their refusal to renounce the destruction of another sovereign
              state.</p>
              <p>The World should simply step aside and let the Palestinians and

              <p>Do you think that Hamas can hide itself from the drones that are

              <p>Secondly, would it not be logical for Hamas to be unable to run
              away from the purposefully selected firing sites for their weapon
              systems, considering their lack of military training, and nil
              military strategies ?</p>
              <p>Finally, if their objective is to gain victory in the propaganda
              war against Israel, and to create international outrage towards
              Israel - would they not locate their activities in the midst of
              dense concentration of Palestinian residential areas ? </p>

              system moulded by their centuries old culture and traditions ? Are
              you walking at a tangent ?</p>
              <p>While we have evolved in our vlaues and life styles - the Arabs
              seems to be trapped by the fundamentalist and extreme conservatists
              that mould their minds and trap them in the age old religious
              teachings.</p>
              <p>They prefer to allow themselves to be led by fundamentalists and
              conservatists, rather then by those who are educated and who
              are modernists from amongst their younger generations.</p>
              <p>Closer to home, we see our neighbors imitating the
              Middle-eastern fundamentalists and conservatists - simply
              to gain influence and control the minds of the rural uneducated
              folks, who are easily impressed by seemingly authoritative
              views from voices that pretend to be firm, strong, and forceful -
              but bankrupt of ideas to bring their community forward in this 21st
              Century.</p>
              <p>In this day and age, despite more the forty years of
              independence, these uneducated would prefer to submit themselves
              and the larger community to be restricted
              by the archaic Hudud Laws based on some vague and archaic
              religious precepts. </p>
              <p>Clearly the litany of this list of supposed Israeli

              of all that the Arab world had uselessly and impotently propagated
              for the last sixty years, and you have taken the easy option to
              merely regurgitate shamelessly despite claims to being a neutral
