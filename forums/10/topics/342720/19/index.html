              <p>Corruption and inadequancies of governance is the main cause of problems in Arab nations. They utilize and exaggerate the fear factor from suicide bombings to legitimize their hard rule. The main raison d etre for the existance of terrorist groups and its attacks on the goverments and kingdoms of the Arab countries is due to the harsh treatment received for voicing or writing against the state, rather than establishing a pan-islamic state. Like the JI which thrives of the leverage between various separatist movements such as MILF in Philippines, Laskar Jihad of Indo and Thai separatist movements to advance their personal, disparate causes of autonomy and retaliation against harsh persecution by their respective governments.</p>
              <p>However, the stark similarity is derived from the existance of  certain groups which aims to achieve a Pan Islamic state in the Middle East inclusive Israel such as Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Zionism aims to achieve a Jewish state ranging from modern Israel, to all of the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, large chunks of Syria, Jordan and Egypt as well as proportions of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Turkey although the Israeli spokesman would deny this but admissible by rightist Israelis.</p>
              <p>Antagonism among the Muslim groups also arises from their perception that their governments are facilitating the Zionist movements although this may be disputed.  </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, both entities desire the similar territories. </p>

              <p>Like many other travellers.. you do what you can to ensure a safe and uninterrupted travel. If I go to a Muslim country..

              <p>I stauchly believe that a withdrawing to pre 1967 Israel would guarantee Israel lasting peace and security as what many analysts have deduced.

              <p>Do you think if HAMAS were to step down and not insist on holding on to power.. willl there be a blockade ?</p>

              <p>So after the six day war.. is it also true that thousands of Jews living in neighbouring states gets persecuted and their properties confiscated ?

              <p>This is because U.N resolution 242 is crafted out of British ambiguiety. It leaves both the argument open. However, numerous academics have argued that post 1967 borders are illegitimate. Even so, Israel continue building settlements outside of its current boundaries. By saying so, does it legitimize any preemptive attack on Israel by its Arab neighbours or Iran? And Irans new capital will be Tel Aviv? International Law does not condone this.</p>
              <p><br>Muslim separatists are not state actors.</p>
              <p>Hamas is the legitimate elected government of Palestine. You have to understand that. FYI, it is Israel who started this war, not Hamas. Israel's genocide in Gaza will only produce more individuals who harbour extreme hate for itself. Even if Hamas do step down, trust me, more groups will form who will fight Israel.</p>
              <p>If your entire family were brutally murdered, would you not make it your life goal to kill the murderers?</p>
              <p>You have to understand that this war is not about Hamas. It is all about Israel. The Israeli elections are less than a month away, the IDF has to recuperate from its dignity lost during the 2006 hizbullah war and it sending a clear message to Obama. Note the Jewish distrust for your incoming President.</p>
              <p>Jews were persecuted by vigilante groups and individuals rather by the state itself. However, the numbers were exagerrated as the extra space stole from the 6day war made room for settlements for these diapora Jews. Remember, diaspora is frowned upon by Zionism. Jews at the same time desired to migrate to their 'promised land'.</p>
              <p>Double standards are practiced everywhere including your beloved country. China infringes on Tibet, America denounces China. When Israel massacres Gazans, it is for self defence. This entails a never ending argument.</p>
              <p>Ahhh.. the shallow, obscure analogies again.</p>
              <p>My point is if it were Hamas who goes into Tel Aviv and begin massacring its innocent civilians, I will most certainly denounce Hamas. I already have directed critisms at Hamas for intentionally killing 4 innocent civilians from its rocket fire. However, Israel deserves the lion's share of the criticms for intentionally killing more than 600 civilians, over 300 being children.</p>

              <p><br> It is obvious you have a huge problem with perceiving. I mentioned

              1967, Israel was a state. Which means that Israel has the right to
              exist. Hamas and Israel animosity is not mainly due to
              territory but the blockade on Gaza which prohibited food and
              essential supplies into Gaza and Israelis constant problems with
              adhering to a truce. You may want to read this in further detail in
              my previous post.</p>
              <p>It depends on what you mean by 'backed'. In the generic sense of
              the word, you might as well say that Hamas is backed by Norway.
              Because Norway recognizes Hamas (although incurring the wrath of
              the U.S) as the legitimate authority of the Palestinian territories
              and has contacts with Hamas officials.</p>

As an Iran specialist, I can attest that both accusations are false... What Ahmadinejad has questioned is the mythologizing, the sacralization, of the Holocaust and the “Zionist regime’s” continued killing of Palestinians and Muslims. He has even raised doubts about the scale of the Holocaust. His rhetoric has been excessive and provocative. And he does not really care what we in the West think about Iran or Muslims; he does not kowtow to western or Israeli diktat</span>.</p>

              <p>The 2002 Arab Initiative has publically declared the normalization of diplomatic ties with Israel in return for Israel withdrawing to its pre 1967 boundaries. This was signed by all 57 Muslim countries as well as Hamas Hizbullah and even Iran.</p>

              <p> Jarhum, </p>
              <p>It is distortingly inaccurate to pin Israel as the belligerent in the 6 day war when Nasser claimed, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Our basic objective will be the destruction of Israel. The Arab people want to fight,</span>" after mobilizing troops to the border. What does that tell you?</p>
              <p>Resolution 242's controversy over a single word IMO is overhyped especially when it was the Security Council's decision to deliberately reject appeals to insert the word "all" before the "territories."  It was a tacit understanding that territorial changes had to be made since all the belligerents were defeated. </p>
              <p>On charges of murdering civilians, both Israel and Hamas must answer.  They have both caused innoncent people to lose their lives.  Then again, Hamas or Palestine didn't sign the Geneva conventions did they?  Hence, if Hamas or its Palestinian militants cannot be tried in such fashion, how can it be that only Israeli military personnel be tried?</p>
              <p>In any case, your charge of genocide would have failed instantly.  To constitute genocide, one has to prove that a party has been systematically engaged in a process of targeting a specific race for EXTERMINATION.  Lets refrain from muddling up words to make the Israelis look more guilty than they really are. </p>
              <p>The Israeli state has the responsibility to ensure the security of its people.  Any state has.  I don't think you are not aware of that.  Its not whether they are right or wrong in the first place, but that its an expected reaction from overt high-profile attacks carried out by Hamas. </p>

              <p>This is because U.N resolution 242 is crafted out of British
              ambiguiety. It leaves both the argument open. However, numerous
              academics have argued that post 1967 borders are illegitimate. Even
              so, Israel continue building settlements outside of its current
              boundaries. By saying so, does it legitimize any preemptive attack
              on Israel by its Arab neighbours or Iran? And Irans new capital
              will be Tel Aviv? International Law does not condone this.</p>
              <p><br> Muslim separatists are not state actors.</p>
              <p>Hamas is the legitimate elected government of Palestine. You
              have to understand that. FYI, it is Israel who started this war,
              not Hamas. Israel's genocide in Gaza will only produce more
              individuals who harbour extreme hate for itself. Even if Hamas do
              step down, trust me, more groups will form who will fight
              Israel.</p>
              <p>If your entire family were brutally murdered, would you not make
              it your life goal to kill the murderers?</p>
              <p>You have to understand that this war is not about Hamas. It
              is all about Israel. The Israeli elections are less than
              a month away, the IDF has to recuperate from its dignity lost
              during the 2006 hizbullah war and it sending a clear message to
              Obama. Note the Jewish distrust for your incoming President.</p>
              <p>Jews were persecuted by vigilante groups and individuals rather
              by the state itself. However, the numbers were exagerrated as the
              extra space stole from the 6day war made room for settlements for
              these diapora Jews. Remember, diaspora is frowned upon by Zionism.
              Jews at the same time desired to migrate to their 'promised
              land'.</p>
              <p>Double standards are practiced everywhere including your beloved
              country. China infringes on Tibet, America denounces China. When
              Israel massacres Gazans, it is for self defence. This entails a
              never ending argument.</p>
              <p>Ahhh.. the shallow, obscure analogies again.</p>
              <p>My point is if it were Hamas who goes into Tel Aviv and begin
              massacring its innocent civilians, I will most certainly denounce
              Hamas. I already have directed critisms at Hamas for
              intentionally killing 4 innocent civilians from its rocket
              fire. However, Israel deserves the lion's share of the criticms for
              intentionally killing more than 600 civilians, over 300 being
              children.</p>

              <p>I was re-looking through some of the targeting pod videos lately due to this discussion and I realized that on so many occasions, I would have personally directed the use of cluster munitions on the launcher sites.  A single bomb's munitions footprint would have destroyed 3+ launchers in a single pass.</p>
              <p>Instead, they were targeted singlely with precision guided munitions.  I'm not trying to justify Israel's disproportionate response, but rather, that restraint has been shown while prosecuting legitimate targets within urban areas.</p>

              left 18 Jews dead and 25 injured; the survivors were herded into
              detention centers. Of Egypt's 4,000 Jews, 800 were arrested, including
              the chief rabbis of both Cairo and Alexandria, and their property
              sequestered by the government. The ancient communities of Damascus and
              Baghdad were placed under house arrest, their leaders imprisoned and
              fined. A total of 7,000 Jews were expelled, many with merely a satchel.<sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War#cite_note-162"><span>[</span>163<span>]</span></a>"</sup></p>

              <p><br> Politics is about transforming illegality to legality. in one
              sense.However, Israel's continuous territorial expansion is not
              sanctioned by international law. If you argue that territorial
              expansion is justifiable through violence and illegal means, you
              shoud assert that retaliation is similarly condoned. But our
              purpose here is to promote peace and end this evil taking of
              innocent human lives.</p>
              <p>However, I find it hard to link your statement of territorial
              expansion to self defence. You appear to claim that Israel
              defending themselves through territorial expansion which is a
              paradox. Expansion is an act of offence rather than defence.</p>
              <p>Israel is a belligerent and its actions are acts of terrorism.
              Unfortunately facts may be construed as a prejudiced towards the
              disadvantaged party.</p>
              <p>I do not particularly see your point. However, I do grasp your
              intention. The Israelis have killed innocent people intently as
              justified by numerous reports and sources from international bodies
              working from the war zone itself. Biasness and prejudice do not at
              all apply to accusing murderers of murdering.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, self defence turns into offence when one
              purposefully attacks and murders innocent civilians. It is
              absolutely nonsensical for one to justify purposeful
              and disproportionate killings of innocent women and children
              as a need for self defence. </p>
              <p>The Israeli elite should be tried for war crimes and
              genocide for its killings.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>sometimes offence is defence,  territorial expansion would create a buffer zone instead of fighting in israel itself. sound ugly but given a choice i would prefer fighting in enemies   territory and their civilians dying compared to mine.</p>
              <p>which sounds harder? crossing the border and attacking israel or crossing the border and marching 200 miles before fighting starts? and especially in israel's possition they can't afford to take chances. they can't relax because a treaty's just being signed.</p>
              <p>even if like you said it's not the hamas who attacked to break the truce, its showed there are people who would ignore the truce and strike at israel. either unable or unwilling hamas aren't stopping these people while crying cheat at the same time.</p>
              <p>600 civilians hardly amounts to genocide. what happened if they can be considered war crimes would have to be claimed by hamas. these are losses which can be avoided by hamas. the reasons why they died had already been given to you a few pages back.</p>
              <p>the israeli's never claimed they were there for "truth, justice and the american way". they're not there to throw candy at kids who pass their vehicles.</p>

              support the Israeli stand that it is killing innocent Palestinians

              <p>even if you want to use scholarly assessments and deductions you must consider the source. Shiraz Dossa isn't well known for his unbiased views. if i haven't read wrongly he believes there's ethnocide against Palestinians. would you trust someone like that to translate what Ahmedinejad said?</p>
              <p>The 2002 Arab Initiative means nothing, its unlikely to be followed through. its just an empty promise they can't keep.  most likely they'll normalise ties while recuiting fighters for the next jihad at the same time. hatred is too deepset in the region. you can't snap your fingers sign some papers and hope it'll go away</p>

              <p><br> Perhaps the only way should be Israel be disarmed and

              is guilty of numerous war crimes including the rape and murder of

              <p>Thusfar, no Palestinian army has fought within Israel. Arab
              nations in its previous wars with Israel are
              much comparatively cleaner than Israel in the number of
              war crimes committed. Thus, you may be able to deduce a probable
              inference from here. Israeli leaders have a list of war crimes
              committed hanging above them. </p>
              <p>It is ludicrous Hamas should bear the brunt of the blame when
              the innocent Gazans are intently murdered by the Israelis
              themselves.  I will emphasize this fact. Your argument is
              contradictory to rational thinking simply because of your prejudice
              possibly due to emotional ties to Israel.</p>
              <p>Military strategist have stated that if Israel were to
              engage Hamas in a guerilla warfare, Israel will lose. The

              <p>Let's face it Jarhum, disarmament is indeed the best thing to do. But if Israel is to take this route.. then it is also fair that <strong>all countries</strong> that poses a threat to Israel be disarmed too. Are the other countries willing to do that as well ?</p>
              <p>Weapons are evil.. it's creation was for the sole purpose of killing and destructions.</p>
              <p>Yes I agree it wasn't a fair fight from the beginning.</p>
              <p>But isn't it kinda stupid for HAMAS to take on Israel with their home made mortars/rockets ?</p>
              <p>If holding on to power is causing sufferings to your own people.. wouldn't a honest leader be willing to put down his pride and step down ?</p>

              <p> Jarhum, </p>
              <p>It is distortingly inaccurate to pin Israel as the belligerent in the 6 day war when Nasser claimed, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Our basic objective will be the destruction of Israel. The Arab people want to fight,</span>" after mobilizing troops to the border. What does that tell you?</p>
              <p>Resolution 242's controversy over a single word IMO is overhyped especially when it was the Security Council's decision to deliberately reject appeals to insert the word "all" before the "territories."  It was a tacit understanding that territorial changes had to be made since all the belligerents were defeated. </p>
              <p>On charges of murdering civilians, both Israel and Hamas must answer.  They have both caused innoncent people to lose their lives.  Then again, Hamas or Palestine didn't sign the Geneva conventions did they?  Hence, if Hamas or its Palestinian militants cannot be tried in such fashion, how can it be that only Israeli military personnel be tried?</p>
              <p>In any case, your charge of genocide would have failed instantly.  To constitute genocide, o"If Israel embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt, the battle against Israel will be a general one and not confined to one spot on the Syrian or Egyptian borders. The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Isrelne has to prove that a party has been systematically engaged in a process of targeting a specific race for EXTERMINATION.  Lets refrain from muddling up words to make the Israelis look more guilty than they really are. </p>
              <p>The Israeli state has the responsibility to ensure the security of its people.  Any state has.  I don't think you are not aware of that.  Its not whether they are right or wrong in the first place, but that its an expected reaction from overt high-profile attacks carried out by Hamas. </p>

              <p>Shotgun,</p>
              <p>I beg to differ. Your justification that Israel is not a belligerent due to a single simplistic quoted rhetoric is grossly inadequate. And your attempt to cite inadequately speaks volumes on your intent.</p>
              <p>Nasser said" "If Israel embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt, the battle against Israel will be a general one and not confined to one spot on the Syrian or Egyptian borders. The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel"</p>
              <p>I view your intent to leave out the first sentence of his announcement to trade unionist as purposeful and tantamount to alter the discourse of the exact causation of the war.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, Israeli </span><a class="mw-redirect" title="Foreign Minister" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Foreign_Minister"><span style="color: #000000;">Foreign Minister</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><a title="Abba Eban" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Abba_Eban"><span style="color: #000000;">Abba Eban</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> wrote in his autobiography that he found "Nasser's assurance that he did not plan an armed attack" convincing, adding that "Nasser did not want war; he wanted victory without war". Writing from Egypt on 4 June 1967 <a class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/New_York_Times">New York Times</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> journalist </span><a title="James Reston" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/James_Reston"><span style="color: #000000;">James Reston</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> observed: "Cairo does not want war and it is certainly not ready for war. But it has already accepted the possibility, even the likelihood, of war, as if it had lost control of the situation. In addition, Egypt planned to send its vice president to Washington for last ditch diplomacy attempts to avert a war on the day of Israel's pre-emptive strike.</span></p>
              <p>However, Israel's insistence to proceed with a preemptive strike leading to a war was a transformative and political manovouer rather than purely a miliary defence one.</p>
              <p>On resolution 242,</p>
              <p>there are various interpretations of the ambigous, inconclusive declaration. However, you have adopted the pro-Israeli stance as a definitive direction of the resolution which reflects your prejudiced stand. There exist various perspectives and interpretations of this vaguely coined declaration. Academics would point to the essence of the resolution that neither requires Israel to withdraw nor permits Israel to retain the 1967 boundaries. </p>
              <p>Palestine is defined as occupied territories rather than a sovereign state actor.  Your reluctance to accept Israel's liabilities towards its war crimes is questionable. Numerous groups have accused Israel of blatant violation of the fourth geneva convention, notably Amnesty, UNWRA and several others. Israel themselves do not refute its violation of human rights, only to justify it with claims of self defence.</p>
              <p>Does extermination requires the perpertrator to publically announce its intention in forms of rhetoric to justify charges of genocide directed at it? What Israel is doing in Gaza tantamounts to acts of genocide, I reiterate. Try asking Hitler was he responsible for acts of genocide against the Jews? He would vehemently refute the accusations. Any criminal would attempt to justify their wrongdoings and Israel is no different. I see no disparity between the killings of innocent civilians of a sovereign state and a non state actor. Do you imply acts of extermination of citizens would only then constitute genocide?</p>
              <p>The president of the UN General Assembly has condemned Israel's killings of Palestinians in its Gaza offensive as genocide.</p>
              <p> I am fully aware any state or individual has the right to self-defence. However, unlike you, I am not selective in its application. Unfortunaely, Israeli attacks, in this current round of events are not retaliatory nor a reaction. They were the perpertrators of this war. Refer to my previous article for my elaboration and substatiation of this.</p>
              <p>I am tremendously appalled at your attempted downplay of the massacre and the gross violation of human lives and rights by the Israeli Zionists. In addition, I am pretty amused at your selective citation of information to further a flismy stand. I hope you would reconsider your stand for disregard for the precise cause of the massacre of innocents will do your values no justice.</p>
