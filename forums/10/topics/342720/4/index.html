              <p>You can pretty much get Nostradamus to predict anything if you work hard enough at it.</p>
              <p>I never understood the belief that people centuries ago could make accurate predictions on when the world would end.</p>
              <p>Considering human nature, we would wipe ourselves out in a series of wars and famines, considering the depleted population and destroyed infrastructure we are then unable to protect ourselves from diseases and natural disasters. </p>

              <h2>Israel has history of failure in ground attacks</h2>
              <p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - Israel has a long and largely unsuccessful
              history of sending ground forces into Palestinian and Lebanese cities.
              Its forces have either gotten bogged down or sustained heavy
              casualties, without quelling violent groups or halting attacks for good.</p>
              <p>The
              most recent example is the 2006 war against Lebanese Hezbollah
              guerrillas, who fought mighty Israel to a draw. But that conflict also
              spawned a concept that could be applied in Gaza - an international
              force.</p>
              <p>Israel launched a massive land
              invasion of the Gaza Strip on Saturday, but its reluctance to send
              infantry and armored units into Gaza this time was palpable.
              Ex-generals and analysts warned that an operation big enough to stop
              the daily rocket barrages from Gaza would require large masses of
              forces and result in high casualties on both sides...</p>

              <p>This sort of questions rarely get asked by the media so i'm gonna ask them here.</p>
              <p>Though they are given Gaza strip and West bank to self govern, are they given proper access to food, electricity, clean water, medical care and sanitary facilities? Are they hindered in any way to obtain the infrastructure for such things?</p>
              <p>If they aren't, why do they need to dig tunnels to Egypt to get supplies?</p>
              <p>They have Gaza strip and West Bank but if they're being isolated you might as well put them on an abandoned island.</p>
              <p>I ask this because i've read a lot of articles of Palestinians being prevented from leaving or foreign aid being forbidden from going in the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>It takes two hands to clap.</p>

              Organization</a></h1>
              <p>As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other world leaders
              try to broker a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, one
              former member of the militant Islamic organization said there will
              never be lasting peace between the two groups.</p>
              <p><span>"There is no chance. Is there any chance for fire to
              co-exist with the water?" said <span>Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son
              of one of the group's founding members.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>Yousef added: "It's not about Israel, it's not about
              Hamas: it's about both ideologies."</span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>Yousef</span>, son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef,
              one of the most influential leaders of the militant group, said the
              organization</span></span> <span>betrays the Palestinian cause and
              tortures its own members.</span></p>
              <p>Hamas, formed in the late 1980's as an outgrowth of the
              Palestinian branch of the radical Muslim Brotherhood, is considered
              a terror organization by the U.S. government. Hamas seized power in
              the Gaza strip in 2007 in a violent coup against the more moderate
              Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
              <p><span>Yousef</span> said he was indoctrinated at an early age to
              use violence to challenge Israeli control in the region. As a
              teenager he moved up within the organization and became the leader
              of the radical Islamic Youth Movement that fought Israeli tanks and
              troops in the streets, celebrated suicide bombings and recruited

              <p><span>Yousef</span>, 30, said he realized the true nature of
              Hamas and radical Islam during a stint in an Israeli prison. He
              renounced his Muslim faith, left his family behind in Ramallah and
              converted to Christianity.</p>
              <p>"Islam is not the word of God," said Yousef. "If you want to be
              offended it's your problem. But you know something? Go study. Think
              for a second that I might be right. So wake up, look at your path,
              see where you're going. Are you really going to heaven with 72
              virgins after you kill yourself and kill another 20 people?"</p>
              <p>Yousef has sought asylum in the United States and now attends an
              evangelical Christian church in San Diego, Calif.</p>
              <p>"The Hamas leadership, including my father, they're responsible;
              they're responsible for all the violence that happened from the
              organization. I know they describe it as reaction to Israeli
              aggression, but still, they are part of it and they had to make
              decisions in those operations against Israel (for) which there was
              the killing of many civilians."</p>
              <p>Yousef talks more about his extraordinary story of faith,
              courage, violence and betrayal in a FOX News documentary, "Escape
              From Hamas," hosted by Bill Hemmer.</p>
              <p><em>Escape from Hamas airs Sat at 10p, with repeats at 1am and
              4a, EST, and Sun at 9pm, with repeats at 12 midnight, 2am,

              <p>Then he isn't a self-hating Hamas. He just hates Hamas and because of that, he left. I thought you meant that he was still in Hamas but hates the organisation and the things it commits.</p>
              <p>While Hamas may do things that the Arabs living in the Occupied Territories do not agree with, Israel is also, under the pretext of battling Hamas, oppressing the Arabs there by blockading the place to absurd extents (placing a ridiculous amounts of checkpoints) and preventing necessities from reaching the Gaza Strip.</p>

              <p><strong>Israel's War Crimes and "Change we can believe in"</strong></p>
              <p>by  Andrew  Hughes</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11580">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11580</a></p>
              <p>Once again, Israel is in the midst of murder and wanton destruction in
              Palestine. Gaza, after being starved of food, shelter, medical supplies
              and electricity, is again the stage for mass murder, the likes of which
              would normally elicit cries of protest the world over. However, the
              warped zeitgeist that currently pollutes reactions to Israeli violence
              has led to the usual commentaries of moral equivalency. The fact that
              the Palestinians had abided by the ceasefire agreement since the Fatah
              Hamas conflict in June 2007, but Israel <a rel="nofollow" href="http://maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=33024"><span style="color: #003399;">broke </span></a>it
              on November 5th this year is never mentioned in mainstream media. The
              same selective reporting was dominant during Israel's invasion of
              Lebanon in 2006 as Israel unleashed carnage and destruction upon a
              defenseless civilian population. What makes Israel immune to
              prosecution for crimes that are broadcast live on TV? Millions are
              bearing witness, millions are protesting in all corners of the world
              but we are left with the official judgment that Israel is only reacting
              to threats to its national security. After turning the Gaza strip in to
              the world's largest open air prison for 1.4 million souls and bleeding
              the inmates dry, unleashing a multibillion dollar military onslaught is
              now officially, in the western media, legitimate self defense. And all
              because the Palestinian people actually had the temerity to vote for
              Hamas instead of the Israeli controlled Fatah party. Democracy in
              action in the "only democracy in the Middle East".<br><br>The time for
              any sympathy for Israel has long since passed. The approval from George
              Bush, the cowardice of Gordon Brown, Nicholas Sarkozy and "there is
              only one President" Obama constitute an abrogation of moral law and
              acquiescence to mass murder.  It's no big surprise from the first three
              in the list but Obama's "no comment" on this matter compared to his
              endless hours of speeches on his new vision for America, bodes ill for
              the universally expected "Change". The U.S. has paid Israel over $1
              Trillion since its inception and, by continuing to support this
              apartheid regime, is complicit in Israel's crimes. The latter charge,
              though morally obvious, is difficult to prove in a court of law but
              Israel's crimes are not.<br><br>Israel signed the Geneva <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention"><span style="color: #003399;">Convention </span></a>on

              enforcement. The sequence of resolutions below illustrates the complete

              anything..<br><br>Resolution 636: " ... 'deeply regrets' Israeli deportation of Palestinian civilians. <br>Resolution 641: "...

Once again Israel is given the green light to destroy everything in its path. <br><br>If
              we are to believe in the "change" so vociferously expounded upon then
              let it start with justice. Justice with regard to Israel has not been
              served. The new administration has a chance in 2009 to rectify this
              egregious breach of common decency and to inspire the world with hope.
              If it continues to morally and financially support this murderous,
              apartheid regime, how is anyone expected to believe that "change" is
              really on the horizon?</p>

              <p>2) why would Hamas take this time to provoke the attack less than 30 days before a New US Presidents is to take office. instead of waiting for a new US President to shape a more liberal policy in the middle east?  </p>

              <p>Why would Obama be jumping into foreign policy issue right now? The State department is the proper govt body that address foreign policy. And The current US President is not Obama. There are proper Protocol in a civil govt.  Just because a different party sit in the white house after Jan 20th does not means that there is a 2nd Branch of govt in place. Please get your head clean.</p>

              <p>Once again, Israel is in the midst of murder and wanton destruction in Palestine. Gaza, after being starved of food, shelter, medical supplies and electricity, is again the stage for mass murder, the likes of which would normally elicit cries of protest the world over. However, the warped zeitgeist that currently pollutes reactions to Israeli violence has led to the usual commentaries of moral equivalency. The fact that the Palestinians had abided by the ceasefire agreement since the Fatah Hamas conflict in June 2007, but Israel <a rel="nofollow" href="http://maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;amp;ID=33024"><span style="color: #003399;">broke</span></a> it on November 5th this year is never mentioned in mainstream media. The same selective reporting was dominant during Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 2006 as Israel unleashed carnage and destruction upon a defenseless civilian population. What makes Israel immune to prosecution for crimes that are broadcast live on TV? Millions are bearing witness, millions are protesting in all corners of the world but we are left with the official judgment that Israel is only reacting to threats to its national security. After turning the Gaza strip in to the world's largest open air prison for 1.4 million souls and bleeding the inmates dry, unleashing a multibillion dollar military onslaught is now officially, in the western media, legitimate self defense. And all because the Palestinian people actually had the temerity to vote for Hamas instead of the Israeli controlled Fatah party. Democracy in action in the "only democracy in the Middle East".<br><br>The time for any sympathy for Israel has long since passed. The approval from George Bush, the cowardice of Gordon Brown, Nicholas Sarkozy and "there is only one President" Obama constitute an abrogation of moral law and acquiescence to mass murder.  It's no big surprise from the first three in the list but Obama's "no comment" on this matter compared to his endless hours of speeches on his new vision for America, bodes ill for the universally expected "Change".

              <p><strong>Israel's War Crimes and "Change we can believe
              in"</strong></p>
              <p>by Andrew Hughes</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;amp;aid=11580">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11580</a></p>
              <p>Once again, Israel is in the midst of murder and wanton
              destruction in Palestine. Gaza, after being starved of food,
              shelter, medical supplies and electricity, is again the stage for
              mass murder, the likes of which would normally elicit cries of
              protest the world over. However, the warped zeitgeist that
              currently pollutes reactions to Israeli violence has led to the
              usual commentaries of moral equivalency. The fact that the
              Palestinians had abided by the ceasefire agreement since the Fatah
              Hamas conflict in June 2007, but Israel <a rel="nofollow" href="http://maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;amp;ID=33024"><span style="color: #003399;">broke</span></a> it on
              November 5th this year is never mentioned in mainstream media. The
              same selective reporting was dominant during Israel's invasion of
              Lebanon in 2006 as Israel unleashed carnage and destruction upon a
              defenseless civilian population. What makes Israel immune to
              prosecution for crimes that are broadcast live on TV? Millions are
              bearing witness, millions are protesting in all corners of the
              world but we are left with the official judgment that Israel is
              only reacting to threats to its national security. After turning
              the Gaza strip in to the world's largest open air prison for 1.4
              million souls and bleeding the inmates dry, unleashing a
              multibillion dollar military onslaught is now officially, in the
              western media, legitimate self defense. And all because the
              Palestinian people actually had the temerity to vote for Hamas
              instead of the Israeli controlled Fatah party. Democracy in action
              in the "only democracy in the Middle East".<br> <br> The time for any sympathy for Israel has long since passed. The
              approval from George Bush, the cowardice of Gordon Brown, Nicholas
              Sarkozy and "there is only one President" Obama constitute an
              abrogation of moral law and acquiescence to mass murder.  It's
              no big surprise from the first three in the list but Obama's "no
              comment" on this matter compared to his endless hours of speeches
              on his new vision for America, bodes ill for the universally
              expected "Change". The U.S. has paid Israel over $1 Trillion since
              its inception and, by continuing to support this apartheid regime,
              is complicit in Israel's crimes. The latter charge, though morally
              obvious, is difficult to prove in a court of law but Israel's
              crimes are not.<br> <br> Israel signed the Geneva <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention"><span style="color: #003399;">Convention</span></a> on
              7th June, 1951. For the Convention to have any value, Israel must
              be charged and made to stand trial in The Hague under the following
              sections.<br> <br> Article 3 states "that even where there is not a conflict of

              the U.S. right on cue. Once again Israel is given the green light
              to destroy everything in its path.<br> <br> If we are to believe in the "change" so vociferously expounded upon
              then let it start with justice. Justice with regard to Israel has
              not been served. The new administration has a chance in 2009 to
              rectify this egregious breach of common decency and to inspire the
              world with hope. If it continues to morally and financially support
              this murderous, apartheid regime, how is anyone expected to believe
              that "change" is really on the horizon?</p>

              <p>I think Hamas changed their policy of destruction of Israel in 2006.</p>
              <p><em>The Hamas movement is ready to recognize agreements signed with Israel, and in fact recognize Israel, but only within the '67 borders, senior Hamas member Khaled Suleiman said Wednesday.  </em></p>
              <p><em>According to Suleiman, the movement will be ready to accept a Palestinian state inside the '67 borders and will not operate to thwart diplomatic negotiations held by Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas...</em></p>

              <p>Of course not. Destroy the Middle-East's only superpower? Destory the world's fourth largest military? I don't think so.</p>
