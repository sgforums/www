              <h1>Johann Hari: The true story behind this war is not the one Israel is telling</h1>
              <p>The world isn't just watching the Israeli government commit a crime
                      in Gaza; we are watching it self-harm. This morning, and tomorrow
                      morning, and every morning until this punishment beating ends, the
                      young people of the Gaza Strip are going to be more filled with hate,
                      and more determined to fight back, with stones or suicide vests or
                      rockets.</p>
              <p>Israeli leaders have convinced themselves that the harder you
                      beat the Palestinians, the softer they will become. But when this is
                      over, the rage against Israelis will have hardened, and the same old
                      compromises will still be waiting by the roadside of history, untended
                      and unmade.</p>
              <p>To
                      understand how frightening it is to be a Gazan this morning, you need
                      to have stood in that small slab of concrete by the Mediterranean and
                      smelled the claustrophobia. The Gaza Strip is smaller than the Isle of
                      Wight but it is crammed with 1.5 million people who can never leave.</p>
              <p>They live out their lives on top of each other, jobless and hungry, in
                      vast, sagging tower blocks. From the top floor, you can often see the
                      borders of their world: the Mediterranean, and Israeli barbed wire.
                      When bombs begin to fall – as they are doing now with more deadly force
                      than at any time since 1967 – there is nowhere to hide.</p>
              <p>There
                      will now be a war over the story of this war. The Israeli government
                      says, "We withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and in return we got Hamas and
                      Qassam rockets being rained on our cities. Sixteen civilians have been
                      murdered.</p>
              <p>How many more are we supposed to sacrifice?" It is a
                      plausible narrative, and there are shards of truth in it, but it is
                      also filled with holes. If we want to understand the reality and really
                      stop the rockets, we need to rewind a few years and view the run-up to
                      this war dispassionately.</p>
              <p>The Israeli government did indeed
                      withdraw from the Gaza Strip in 2005 – in order to be able to intensify
                      control of the West Bank. Ariel Sharon's senior adviser, Dov Weisglass,
                      was unequivocal about this, explaining: "The disengagement [from Gaza]
                      is actually formaldehyde. It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that
                      is necessary so that there will not be a political process with the
                      Palestinians... this whole package that is called the Palestinian state
                      has been removed from our agenda indefinitely."</p>
              <p>Ordinary
                      Palestinians were horrified by this, and by the fetid corruption of
                      their own Fatah leaders, so they voted for Hamas. It certainly wouldn't
                      have been my choice – an Islamist party is antithetical to all my
                      convictions - but we have to be honest. It was a free and democratic
                      election, and it was not a rejection of a two-state solution.</p>
              <p>The most
                      detailed polling of Palestinians, by the University of Maryland, found
                      that 72 per cent want a two-state solution on the 1967 borders, while
                      fewer than 20 per cent want to reclaim the whole of historic Palestine.
                      So, partly in response to this pressure, Hamas offered Israel a long,
                      long ceasefire and a de facto acceptance of two states, if only Israel
                      would return to its legal borders.</p>
              <p>Rather than seize this
                      opportunity and test Hamas's sincerity, the Israeli government reacted
                      by punishing the entire civilian population. It announced that it was
                      blockading the Gaza Strip in order to "pressure" its people to reverse
                      the democratic process. The Israelis surrounded the Strip and refused
                      to let anyone or anything out.</p>
              <p>They let in a small trickle of food,
                      fuel and medicine – but not enough for survival. Weisglass quipped that
                      the Gazans were being "put on a diet". According to Oxfam, only 137
                      trucks of food were allowed into Gaza last month to feed 1.5 million
                      people. The United Nations says poverty has reached an "unprecedented
                      level." When I was last in besieged Gaza, I saw hospitals turning away
                      the sick because their machinery and medicine was running out. I met
                      hungry children stumbling around the streets, scavenging for food.</p>
              <p>It
                      was in this context – under a collective punishment designed to topple
                      a democracy – that some forces within Gaza did something immoral: they
                      fired Qassam rockets indiscriminately at Israeli cities. These rockets
                      have killed 16 Israeli citizens. This is abhorrent: targeting civilians
                      is always murder. But it is hypocritical for the Israeli government to
                      claim now to speak out for the safety of civilians when it has been
                      terrorising civilians as a matter of state policy.</p>
              <p>The American
                      and European governments are responding with a lop-sidedness that
                      ignores these realities. They say that Israel cannot be expected to
                      negotiate while under rocket fire, but they demand that the
                      Palestinians do so under siege in Gaza and violent military occupation
                      in the West Bank.</p>
              <p>Before it falls down the memory hole, we
                      should remember that last week, Hamas offered a ceasefire in return for
                      basic and achievable compromises. Don't take my word for it. According
                      to the Israeli press, Yuval Diskin, the current head of the Israeli
                      security service Shin Bet, "told the Israeli cabinet [on 23 December]
                      that Hamas is interested in continuing the truce, but wants to improve
                      its terms." Diskin explained that Hamas was requesting two things: an
                      end to the blockade, and an Israeli ceasefire on the West Bank. The
                      cabinet – high with election fever and eager to appear tough – rejected
                      these terms.</p>
              <p>The core of the situation has been starkly laid
                      out by Ephraim Halevy, the former head of Mossad. He says that while
                      Hamas militants – like much of the Israeli right-wing – dream of
                      driving their opponents away, "they have recognised this ideological
                      goal is not attainable and will not be in the foreseeable future."</p>
              <p>Instead, "they are ready and willing to see the establishment of a
                      Palestinian state in the temporary borders of 1967." They are aware
                      that this means they "will have to adopt a path that could lead them
                      far from their original goals" – and towards a long-term peace based on
                      compromise.</p>
              <p>The rejectionists on both sides – from Mahmoud
                      Ahmadinejad of Iran to Bibi Netanyahu of Israel – would then be
                      marginalised. It is the only path that could yet end in peace but it is
                      the Israeli government that refuses to choose it. Halevy explains:
                      "Israel, for reasons of its own, did not want to turn the ceasefire
                      into the start of a diplomatic process with Hamas."</p>
              <p>Why would
                      Israel act this way? The Israeli government wants peace, but only one
                      imposed on its own terms, based on the acceptance of defeat by the
                      Palestinians. It means the Israelis can keep the slabs of the West Bank
                      on "their" side of the wall. It means they keep the largest settlements
                      and control the water supply.</p>
              <p>And it means a divided Palestine, with
                      responsibility for Gaza hived off to Egypt, and the broken-up West Bank
                      standing alone. Negotiations threaten this vision: they would require
                      Israel to give up more than it wants to. But an imposed peace will be
                      no peace at all: it will not stop the rockets or the rage. For real
                      safety, Israel will have to talk to the people it is blockading and
                      bombing today, and compromise with them.</p>
              <p>The sound of Gaza
                      burning should be drowned out by the words of the Israeli writer Larry
                      Derfner. He says: "Israel's war with Gaza has to be the most one-sided
                      on earth... If the point is to end it, or at least begin to end it, the
                      ball is not in Hamas's court – it is in ours."</p>

              <p>One man's freedom fighter, another's terrorist.</p>
              <p>Hamas, in the eyes of liberals, Palestinians etc, is a freedom fighter organization which seeks to liberate Palestine and overthrow the 'illegal' Israeli entity. And yet, due to its violent means, it is considered to be a terrorist by its adversaries. This is entirely normal. There are two sides in any story.</p>
              <p>I bet the British Empire would have considered George Washington a terrorist and a traitor to the British Empire for instigating the armed rebellion against it. Wouldn't Imperial Japan consider Lim Bo Seng and his fellow resistance fighters from Force 136 a terrorist group for their attacks against them? How about Mandela, Ghandhi, CCP etc. History is ripe of such examples.</p>
              <p>Its all a matter of perspective. There are no true terrorists in history. Just ideological rivals armed with a gun, F-16s and perhaps a ticking time bomb strapped on the chest...</p>
              <p>A real tragedy. It seems despite lessons from human history, we never seem to learn that violence is often a short term solution for a long term problem. It will never create a lasting resolution. Only dialogue can.</p>

                  tomorrow morning, and every morning until this punishment beating
                  ends, the young people of the Gaza Strip are going to be more
                  filled with hate, and more determined to fight back, with stones or
                  suicide vests or rockets.</p>
              <p>Israeli leaders have convinced themselves that the harder you
                  beat the Palestinians, the softer they will become. But when this
                  is over, the rage against Israelis will have hardened, and the same
                  old compromises will still be waiting by the roadside of history,
                  untended and unmade.</p>
              <p>To understand how frightening it is to be a Gazan this morning,
                  you need to have stood in that small slab of concrete by the
                  Mediterranean and smelled the claustrophobia. The Gaza Strip is
                  smaller than the Isle of Wight but it is crammed with 1.5 million
                  people who can never leave.</p>
              <p>They live out their lives on top of each other, jobless and
                  hungry, in vast, sagging tower blocks. From the top floor, you can
                  often see the borders of their world: the Mediterranean, and
                  Israeli barbed wire. When bombs begin to fall – as they are doing
                  now with more deadly force than at any time since 1967 – there is
                  nowhere to hide.</p>
              <p>There will now be a war over the story of this war. The Israeli
                  government says, "We withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and in return we
                  got Hamas and Qassam rockets being rained on our cities. Sixteen
                  civilians have been murdered.</p>
              <p>How many more are we supposed to sacrifice?" It is a plausible
                  narrative, and there are shards of truth in it, but it is also
                  filled with holes. If we want to understand the reality and really
                  stop the rockets, we need to rewind a few years and view the run-up
                  to this war dispassionately.</p>
              <p>The Israeli government did indeed withdraw from the Gaza Strip
                  in 2005 – in order to be able to intensify control of the West
                  Bank. Ariel Sharon's senior adviser, Dov Weisglass, was unequivocal
                  about this, explaining: "The disengagement [from Gaza] is actually
                  formaldehyde. It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is
                  necessary so that there will not be a political process with the
                  Palestinians... this whole package that is called the Palestinian
                  state has been removed from our agenda indefinitely."</p>
              <p>Ordinary Palestinians were horrified by this, and by the fetid
                  corruption of their own Fatah leaders, so they voted for Hamas. It
                  certainly wouldn't have been my choice – an Islamist party is
                  antithetical to all my convictions - but we have to be honest. It
                  was a free and democratic election, and it was not a rejection of a
                  two-state solution.</p>
              <p>The most detailed polling of Palestinians, by the University of
                  Maryland, found that 72 per cent want a two-state solution on the
                  1967 borders, while fewer than 20 per cent want to reclaim the
                  whole of historic Palestine. So, partly in response to this
                  pressure, Hamas offered Israel a long, long ceasefire and a de
                  facto acceptance of two states, if only Israel would return to its
                  legal borders.</p>
              <p>Rather than seize this opportunity and test Hamas's sincerity,
                  the Israeli government reacted by punishing the entire civilian
                  population. It announced that it was blockading the Gaza Strip in
                  order to "pressure" its people to reverse the democratic process.
                  The Israelis surrounded the Strip and refused to let anyone or
                  anything out.</p>
              <p>They let in a small trickle of food, fuel and medicine – but not
                  enough for survival. Weisglass quipped that the Gazans were being
                  "put on a diet". According to Oxfam, only 137 trucks of food were
                  allowed into Gaza last month to feed 1.5 million people. The United
                  Nations says poverty has reached an "unprecedented level." When I
                  was last in besieged Gaza, I saw hospitals turning away the sick
                  because their machinery and medicine was running out. I met hungry
                  children stumbling around the streets, scavenging for food.</p>
              <p>It was in this context – under a collective punishment designed
                  to topple a democracy – that some forces within Gaza did something
                  immoral: they fired Qassam rockets indiscriminately at Israeli
                  cities. These rockets have killed 16 Israeli citizens. This is
                  abhorrent: targeting civilians is always murder. But it is
                  hypocritical for the Israeli government to claim now to speak out
                  for the safety of civilians when it has been terrorising civilians
                  as a matter of state policy.</p>
              <p>The American and European governments are responding with a
                  lop-sidedness that ignores these realities. They say that Israel
                  cannot be expected to negotiate while under rocket fire, but they
                  demand that the Palestinians do so under siege in Gaza and violent
                  military occupation in the West Bank.</p>
              <p>Before it falls down the memory hole, we should remember that
                  last week, Hamas offered a ceasefire in return for basic and
                  achievable compromises. Don't take my word for it. According to the
                  Israeli press, Yuval Diskin, the current head of the Israeli
                  security service Shin Bet, "told the Israeli cabinet [on 23
                  December] that Hamas is interested in continuing the truce, but
                  wants to improve its terms." Diskin explained that Hamas was
                  requesting two things: an end to the blockade, and an Israeli
                  ceasefire on the West Bank. The cabinet – high with election fever
                  and eager to appear tough – rejected these terms.</p>
              <p>The core of the situation has been starkly laid out by Ephraim
                  Halevy, the former head of Mossad. He says that while Hamas
                  militants – like much of the Israeli right-wing – dream of driving
                  their opponents away, "they have recognised this ideological goal
                  is not attainable and will not be in the foreseeable future."</p>
              <p>Instead, "they are ready and willing to see the establishment of
                  a Palestinian state in the temporary borders of 1967." They are
                  aware that this means they "will have to adopt a path that could
                  lead them far from their original goals" – and towards a long-term
                  peace based on compromise.</p>
              <p>The rejectionists on both sides – from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of
                  Iran to Bibi Netanyahu of Israel – would then be marginalised. It
                  is the only path that could yet end in peace but it is the Israeli
                  government that refuses to choose it. Halevy explains: "Israel, for
                  reasons of its own, did not want to turn the ceasefire into the
                  start of a diplomatic process with Hamas."</p>
              <p>Why would Israel act this way? The Israeli government wants
                  peace, but only one imposed on its own terms, based on the
                  acceptance of defeat by the Palestinians. It means the Israelis can
                  keep the slabs of the West Bank on "their" side of the wall. It
                  means they keep the largest settlements and control the water
                  supply.</p>
              <p>And it means a divided Palestine, with responsibility for Gaza
                  hived off to Egypt, and the broken-up West Bank standing alone.
                  Negotiations threaten this vision: they would require Israel to
                  give up more than it wants to. But an imposed peace will be no
                  peace at all: it will not stop the rockets or the rage. For real
                  safety, Israel will have to talk to the people it is blockading and
                  bombing today, and compromise with them.</p>
              <p>The sound of Gaza burning should be drowned out by the words of
                  the Israeli writer Larry Derfner. He says: "Israel's war with Gaza
                  has to be the most one-sided on earth... If the point is to end it,
                  or at least begin to end it, the ball is not in Hamas's court – it
                  is in ours."</p>

              <p>IMO, it is justified for all the defeated enemy (iran,iraq, jordan,syria,egypt, turkey?) in 1948 war to be occupied by israel. but israel is a small nation to occupy a vast territory as such.</p>

              <p>I'm especially interested in the Deir Yassin Massacre because it was committed by the jews. However, this was not the beginning of the massacres in 1948.</p>
              <p>In January of 1948,  armed Arabs ambushed a Jewish convoy on the way to a beseiged settlement, Etzion Bloc. All 35 Jews were murdered and their bodies mutilated. There were many more massacres commited by Arabs against Jews way back in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
              <p>It was the many massacres of Jews over the years that formed the motivation for the Deir Yassin Massacre.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>The latest agression by the IDF has been a continous and seemingly endless crusade by the zionist entity since its inauguration from 1948. We have to address this topic of discussion from an intellectual perspective. To the reader my previous two statements may reflect a paradoxical contradiction, however in no light have I ever and will ever sanction atrocities towards innocent civilians, the elderly, women and children on both sides of the fence.
              
              The media dosage which we Singaporeans are exposed to is a parrot of western media coverage and journalism which is heavily biased towards the Zionists. Time and time again American media portrays the Israelis as the victims of homemade bombs through various wordplays, subtlety, selective ommision of information and shallow regard of the history of this conflict. We cannot view this conflict as a mere Palestinian-Israeli conflict but more as globalised conflict between two opposing sides. This statement is made in due consideration to its effect and consequences on other parts of our world. Such effects include radicalisation of misled and impressionable Muslims whom are lured and taunted into the realm of wrongful aggression against misperceived oppresors as well as global oil prices which affect our pockets. 
              
              Israel have time and time again violated U.N resolutions and in selfish defence of its zionist cause, commited atrocities in utter defiance of the world community. The malevolent nature of its extremist jewish ring wing influences its public policies to a larger extent, but extraordinarily sublime to the massses. Its meticulous but zealous manipulation of the world has tremendous consequences for us all. These Zionist will forseeably be the fundamental causation of a seemingly impending world war which will cause us all misery and carnage. Even in our peaceful Singapore will not be spared from the overarching consequences of the Israelis zionist tirade.
              
              The world desperately needs a leader who is able to tame this Zionst entity in the most amicable manner possible lest its very uncontrollable dynamics manifests near doom for humankind on the whole. The Arab-Israeli or Muslim-Judaist discord has to be nipped in the bud. The Arab Initiative proposed by King Abdullah to surrender its unlawful occupation from its preemptive strike of 1967 of its neighbours in return for peace and harmony with the larger Muslim world surprisingly commanded the support of the typically disparate Arab entities. The initiative was a good first start. Now it is time to second it.     </p>

              The sad fact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is such that no end seems in sight. Greater Israeli is the penultimate objective of many a hawkish Israeli lawmaker. This entails the destruction of the Al-Aqsa mosque in the vicinity of Temple mount whereby radical Jews believe is the exact site of the sacred temple of King Solomon. This is a fact and a fearsome one too. It is perceived by the Zionists as their biblical right vis a vis Theodore Herzl's quote of the Israelites claim to pre 1948 Palestine. 
              
              The global repercussions of any attempt to destroy the third holiest shrine of the Muslim faith, the Al-Aqsa mosque, is shuddering. Jewish terrorist of far right organizations have time and time again endeavoured to commit this malicious task. The consequential scenario would speculatively, probably be as such (God Forbid): Muslim countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Southasia mobilizes their armies and defence forces. A conventional attack on Tel Aviv would be inevitable and the U.S would immediately come to Israel's Aid. Alliances and allegances would be formed, albeit a more even and proportional one than the allies vs axis of WWII. Israel, with due consideration of its zealous and disproportionate nature of striking at its enemy would employ its nuclear armourmant to strike at its opponents forcing a similar retaliation by nuclear armed Muslim nations such as Iran and Pakistan. Knowing the Zionists only too well, the Zionist may even deliberate strikes of the Muslim's holier shrines as a means of striking fear into its opponents. The U.S flexes its nuclear muscle, Nuclear begets Nuclear and the World goes back to the Middle Ages.With this, other nations may take the opportunity to settle old discords via proxies. This is all because of a particular entity's claim to Yahweh given rights to a small group of people, in full oblivion of the rest of its 'creation'.

              <p>3. England promised the jews statehood in the 1920s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. 1948, UN declared Israel statehood, majority voted by nations around the world, except arab states who against worldwide opinion, vowed vengence on the tiny state .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Israel took back jews whom were not wanted in Europe, or subjected to living in slums around the world, turn the desert and swamp state to a thriving green land again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. In 1967, the arab states combined and attacked Israel, a tiny nation. Israel stood alone again as it did during the holocaust, but this time routed the muslim army within a few days, and seize control of lands the arabs could not defend, so as to prevent further attacks on Israeli citizens.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>4. 1948, UN declared Israel statehood, majority voted by nations around the world, except arab states who against worldwide opinion, vowed vengence on the tiny state .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Israel took back jews whom were not wanted in Europe, or subjected to living in slums around the world, turn the desert and swamp state to a thriving green land again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. In 1967, the arab states combined and attacked Israel, a tiny nation. Israel stood alone again as it did during the holocaust, but this time routed the muslim army within a few days, and seize control of lands the arabs could not defend, so as to prevent further attacks on Israeli citizens.</p>

              <p>There are more, and i seek that you open your mind, understand objectively before forming your opinions. It doesnt matter if you side with anyone or don't, but be informed and not be used as a tool by others.</p>

              Dear Xtreyer,
              
              I would like to point out several inconsistencies and ambiguity in your facts. 
              
              1) Palestine leading up to Israel's inauguration in 1948 was occupied by majoritily Arabs with a mere 5% Jewish populace. In modern history, the Jews never really did governed the land of Palestine. It has been changing hands between the Muslims and Christians.  
              
              3) The Jews were promised sovereignty of Palestine long before 1920 and this was ratified with the Balfour Declaration of 1917. (A controversial condition attached to this was Chaim Weizmann's talents in producing accetone which is greatly required for Britain's war efforts).
              
              4) Ben Gurion, A Zionist declared Israeli independence himself. It was only in 1949 that U.N gave it official recognition. Only 13 nations initially gave Israel de jure recognation, not the entire world.
              
              5) It was not Israel which was not wanted in other parts of the world minus Germany but it is their utmost desire to claim their so-called biblical right to Palestine.
              
              6)In 1967, Israel was the entity which conducted preemptive strikes on its Arab neighbour which caught them in surprise. The Arab nations attacked only in retaliation. It was only the Yom Kippur War which the Arab nations combined to go to war with Israel.
              
              So do not attempt to boast writings of a pathetic shot at scholarly analysis when you can't even get your facts and dates right.
              
              As I mention unconditional support for this Zionist cause will cause mayhem for you and your family and all of us.

              <p>I personally feel Hamas is a legitimate (it won the elections) freedom fighter organization.</p>
              <p>Hamas = Mandela, Lim Bo Seng, George Washington, CCP etc</p>
              <p>Note all of the above used force and violence to liberate their country from foreign/illegal occupation.</p>
              <p>If Hmas succeeds in liberating Palestine from the Isrealis Occupation, it would be lauded as a determined resistnace fighter groups. If it fails, it will merely join the annals of history as a violent bunch of fanatics.</p>

              <p><br> Comparing the present Gaza strip to the Warsaw Ghetto of the
                  1940s will take a leap of speculative imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the 1940s, the Warsaw Ghetto was purposefully built by
                  the Nazis to isolate the Jewish community as part of a FINAL
                  SOLUTION to exterminate German CITIZENS of Jewish descent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gaza Strip was governed by an ELECTED HAMAS government that
                  decided to unilaterally evict themselves from the Palestinian
                  "Central" Government, and UNILATERALLY declared themselves a
                  separate entity from the West Bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The HAMAS government continued to allow itself to be used as a
                  proxy of Iran, and execute the
                  Iranian determined destruction of the State
                  of Israel by all means.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The present condition - that the residents of the Gaza
                  Strip have now found themselves in - was self-imposed when
                  they did not reject the HAMAS-Iranian agenda but embraced it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was Israel singularly responsible to wall the residents into the
                  Gaza Strip, or have the Egyptians also similarly been alarmed
                  by the HAMAS-Iranian agenda - when the Gaza Strip share a
                  common border with the Egyptian Sinai Peninsular, and the Egyptian
                  has similarly restricted border crossings ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The economic situation and living condition in the
                  Gaza Strip is brought about by the Palestinians residents
                  themselves in their continued stupidity in supporting the
                  HAMAS-Iranian agenda, instead of working as a
                  unified community to confront Israel based on their own
                  Palestinian Agenda.</p>

              <p>Really? Gaza has frequently been described as an open air prison with 1.5 million prisoners. Since 2007, Israel has <strong>restricted medical supplies, food and fuel from reaching the Gazans,</strong> destroying all semblence of a proper life. In addition, Israeli settlers regularly harass the Palestinians with the protection of the IDF.</p>
              <p>How is using F-16s against homemade rockets and bombs not like molotov cocktails against Panzer tanks? In fact, today's comparison is even more ridiculous.</p>
              <p>I agree that any nation has <em>the right to self-defence</em>, naturally Israel as well. And that includes Iran. But, if it continues oppressing the Palestinian people, expanding settlements that harrass Palestinians, restricting medical supplies, food and fuel, putting up an obscene amount of checkpoints that make life horribly inconvenient (and thats an understatement) for the Gazans, then why should the Gazans take it lying down? <strong>Tell me, does Israel deserve retaliation from its inhumane behaviour?</strong></p>
              <p>If Egypt blocks its border with Gaza, then it is complicit with the inhumane bloodshed. Thats why Egyptian flags were also burned during riots. Even though Palestinians are Arabs, the other Arab countries refuse to treat them like brothers. So such for the Islamic brotherhood.</p>
