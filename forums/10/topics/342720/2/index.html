              <p>Don't you think Isreal played into the hands of the Palestinians? The Isrealis did exactly what is expected of them. The Palestinians got what they wanted. Rallying world opinion against Isreal. Their innocent killed for that, for their culture its "So be it".</p>

              <p>The problem becomes clear when you realise that Israel holds de facto control over the <em>Occupied</em> Territories. Its the same thing for Iraqis. When a foreign power occupies your country and turns life into a living hell for you, you got to resist.</p>
              <p>I agree that the Palestinians are using Islam to galvanise violence against Israeli settlements. However, the fact is that Israel has been oppressing the Palestinians for a long time, even before widespread violence began. How is the invasion justified when it was being planned six months ago, while there was a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas? Although the Israeli leadership realised that it would give Hamas time to prepare, the IDF also needed time to prepare. When it started, the IDF purposely put out disinformation in order to achieve maximum casualties. All that rhetoric about minimising casualties is bullshit because that is the last thing they want. Probably they think: A dead Palestinian is a dead terrorists, in the spirit of Vietnam. Yet, it is only natural that a people would resist a foreign occupier.</p>

              <p><strong>Shock, Awe and Lies: The Truth Behind the Israeli Attack on Gaza</strong></p>
              <p>29 December 2008</p>
              <p><span class="small">Written by <a href="http://chris-floyd.com/component/comprofiler/userprofile/chris.html"><span class="small">Chris Floyd</span></a></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/3/1666-shock-%20awe-and-%20lies-the-truth-behind-the-israeli-attack-on-gaza.html">http://chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/3/1666-shock-%20awe-and-%20lies-the-truth-behind-the-israeli-attack-on-gaza.html</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Here is a simple, stone cold fact. You
              cannot read or hear the truth about what is happening in Gaza from any
              corporate media in the United States. The only thing you will find
              there are regurgitations of Israeli spin, which are themselves only
              regurgitations of the kind of spin that American militarists have put
              on their own depredations -- for centuries now. Up and down the
              American media and political establishments, you will find nothing but
              bleatings about Israel being "forced" to launch its vicious blunderbuss
              attacks against heavily populated Gaza because of the "recent spate of
              Hamas bombings" since the end of a six-month ceasefire.<br><br>This is of course a damnable and deliberate lie. Papers in Israel -- in <em>Israel</em>,
              but not the United States -- are reporting the truth: the murderous
              assault on Gaza was planned not only before the six-month ceasefire
              ended -- it was planned <em>before the cease-fire even took effect</em>. Indeed, the cease-fire was <em>part </em>of
              the military plan to decimate the civilian areas of Gaza; it was a
              hoax, a scam, a deliberate feint to buy time for military preparations
              -- precisely the same strategy followed by the Bush Regime (and its
              bipartisan Establishment supporters) in "going to the UN" to seek a
              "peaceful solution" to the "Iraqi crisis" -- when the invasion was
              already in the works.<br><br><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050426.html">Haaretz reports on the Israel's deceit</a> in the latest outrage, in the aptly titled piece, "Disinformation, secrecy and lies: How the Gaza offensive came about":<br><br></span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Long-term
              preparation, careful gathering of information, secret discussions,
              operational deception and the misleading of the public - all these
              stood behind the Israel Defense Forces "Cast Lead" operation against
              Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, which began Saturday morning. he
              disinformation effort, according to defense officials, took Hamas by
              surprise and served to significantly increase the number of its
              casualties in the strike.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Sources
              in the defense establishment said Defense Minister Ehud Barak
              instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the operation over
              six months ago, even as Israel was beginning to negotiate a ceasefire
              agreement with Hamas. According to the sources, Barak maintained that
              although the lull would allow Hamas to prepare for a showdown with
              Israel, the Israeli army needed time to prepare, as well..</span><br></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;"><br>The
              story also notes that the recent racheting of tension was sparked,
              deliberately, by a heavy-handed Israeli incursion into Gaza:<br><br></span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">The
              plan of action that was implemented in Operation Cast Lead remained
              only a blueprint until a month ago, when tensions soared after the IDF
              carried out an incursion into Gaza during the ceasefire to take out a
              tunnel which the army said was intended to facilitate an attack by
              Palestinian militants on IDF troops....</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">While
              Barak was working out the final details with the officers responsible
              for the operation, Livni went to Cairo to inform Egypt's president,
              Hosni Mubarak, that Israel had decided to strike at Hamas. In parallel,
              Israel continued to send out disinformation in announcing it would open
              the crossings to the Gaza Strip and that Olmert would decide whether to
              launch the strike following three more deliberations on Sunday - one
              day after the actual order to launch the operation was issued.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">"Hamas
              evacuated all its headquarter personnel after the cabinet meeting on
              Wednesday," one defense official said, "but the organization sent its
              people back in when they heard that everything was put on hold until
              Sunday." </span><br></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;"><br>Not
              only did this deception lead Hamas to send its officials back to work
              -- it also meant that there was no general warning to the masses of
              civilians packed like sardines into Gaza's hellish confines. It meant
              that civilian casualties would be maximized -- especially when the
              initial assault was launched in the middle of the day, with thousands
              of schoolchildren out at their lesson.<br><br><a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/12/28/peretz/index.html">As Glenn Greenwald notes</a>,
              Israel's massive bombing of civilian areas -- even if couched in terms
              of "retaliation" for scattershot strikes on Israeli territory by a
              political faction -- constitutes "a clear violation of the Geneva
              Conventions." Greenwald also adroitly turns Barack Obama's campaign
              kowtowing to Israeli militarism on its head:<br><br></span></p>
              <blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">[Obama
              on the campaign trail]: "The first job of any nation state is to
              protect its citizens. And so I can assure you that if -- I don't even
              care if I was a politician -- if somebody was sending rockets into my
              house where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything
              in my power to stop that. And I would expect Israelis to do the same
              thing."</span><br></blockquote><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Can't
              the exact same mentality be deployed to justify everything Hamas has
              done and is doing, to wit:  "if a foreign power were brutally occupying
              my country for four decades -- or blockading my country and denying my
              children medical needs and nutrition and the ability even to exit --
              I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that.  And I would
              expect Palestinians to do the same thing"?  But the last thing that our
              political class ever extends is reciprocal, two-sided analysis to this
              dispute.</span><br></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;"><br>What
              is the ultimate context of this carnage? The fact that the Arab
              inhabitants of Palestine had their land taken away from them by force
              -- not in some ancient, historic era, but within the lifetime of many
              thousands of Palestinians still living. I hold no brief for Hamas;<a href="http://angryarab.blogspot.com/"> like the Angry Arab</a>,
              whose coverage of the conflict has been relentless and penetrating, I
              don't care for any party based on religious extremism. But as Greenwald
              notes, every action taken by Hamas and other Palestinian resistance
              groups could be characterized as "retaliation" for the theft of their
              land, not to mention the war crime of collective punishment and
              genocidal blockades visited upon the Occupied Territories for years. <br><br>But
              there is not a single peep of this perspective from America's ruling
              class and its media courtiers. Of course, it is a bit much to expect a
              nation which itself was built on land theft, repression and slaughter
              to see anything wrong or "disproportionate" in Israel's treatment of
              the Palestinians. What else are you supposed to do when those dang
              heathen savages come around with their war parties and tomahawks,
              trying to get back the land that God Almighty has granted to good white
              folk?<br><br>Meanwhile, here's what Israel's "Manifest Destiny" looks like on the ground in Gaza. <a href="http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;Do=Print&amp;ID=34268">From the Maan News Agency</a> (<em>via the Angry Arab, as was the photo above</em>):<br><br></span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Death
              shrouds the hallways of Gaza City's Ash-Shifa medical compound
              Saturday, its smell creeping in from all corners. mputated bodies are
              strewn throughout hallways because morgues in the city can no longer
              accommodate the dead. In one corner a man stands with his seven year
              old son in a cardboard box because the hospital ran out of sheets to
              cover the dead with. This is how he will carry him home and bury him.
              Another man stands dazed, in shock after watching his son Mohammed
              killed during his graduation ceremony at the de facto police
              headquarters. The father of one of Mohammed's classmates stood next to
              his son as he was decapitated. The man is still screaming.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">In
              the packed hospital waiting room a mother sits silently staring into
              the distance; her son was pronounced dead shortly after she brought him
              in... Forty-year-old mother Nawal Al-Lad'a did not find the bodies of
              her two sons in the medical compound, so she left to look amid the
              rubble.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Husam Farajallah, a
              university student, was at the hospital collecting the body of his
              relative. He called what happened in Gaza a "black day" in the lives of
              all Palestinians, and wondered how the world could watch and do nothing.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">Medics
              in Gaza confirmed that the majority of those killed in the day's
              attacks were civilians, including men, women and children. Most were
              cut to pieces, making the job of doctors and medics difficult, and the
              task of giving bodies back to families painful and gruesome. The medics
              working in the field continue to dig up bodies from the densely
              populated urban areas of Gaza City.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">The
              scenes remind many Palestinians of the images that came out of the
              Sabra and Shatila massacres from Beirut in 1982, when thousands of
              Palestinians were killed by the Lebanese Phalangist militia.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: georgia,palatino;">As the death toll climbs and no word on a halt to the attacks has come from Israel, Gazans fear for their lives and loved ones.</span></blockquote>

              <p>I dont think Israel really have the intention of "Stopping rocket attacks".</p>
              <p>That "stopping rocket attacks" is just a slogan, soundbyte, theme.</p>
              <p>Usually for these kinds of political game or a warfare, the surface reason is always not the real reason.</p>
              <p>I think the real reason is to weaken the whole cause of the Palestinian nation building.</p>
              <p>Israel destroyed police stations, police training centers, killed UN workers (as usual), destroyed homes, apartments, roads, and everything that has to do with Hamas, all Hamas offices etc.</p>
              <p>This reminds me back when they launched a war into Lebanon, and gave the reason as to "save 2 Israeli soldiers being held by Hezbollah".</p>
              <p>Nobody would launch a big invasion just to save 2 lowly soldiers, and furthermore it was not a special-ops operation to find the 2 soldiers, but a real land war by mainstream troops.</p>
              <p>Now, I think the situation is the same. They are saying they want to "stop rocket attacks" but I think these are just the theme being given out as talking points to their ambassadors and spokesmen to say. That is not the real reason.</p>
              <p>It seems to me, from their continued settlement-building, playing Hamas vs Fatah, warring Lebanon and Palestine Gaza, they really have a goal of securing as long as possible their territory, and gaining upper hand and weaken the enemies and make any future negotiations or concession more beneficiary to them. They also wanted to weaken any Palestinian nation-building. That is why they choke off the economy, blockade the movement of goods and people (for years not just now), captured whole cabinets, and killed many leaders. They do not want to have a strong viable Palestinian nation-state, organized and solidified, contending the same land with them.</p>

              <p>Consider this, from a Jew but isn't a Zionist:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="postbody">I maybe a jew but i am not Zionist for these 3 reasons
              <br> 1. The land we took for Israel is Palestine, this was a muslim state,
              because we took the land from them, Zionism is actually causing more
              Antisemitsm, before the advent of Zionism, Jews and Muslims were living
              in peace and Muslims protected us in these occasions - During the time
              of the Crusades many muslims in power tried to protect us Jews in the
              Holy land (Now <br> Palestine) From the Crusaders atrocities against us.
              <br> In 1492 after the Spanish reconquest of the last Muslim Kingdom of Granada, The Spanish Inquisition 
              <br> ordered the expulsion of all jews from Spain, When This News
              reached The Muslim Ottoman sultan Beyazid II, Heordered a fleet to save
              Jews and Muslims from spain and immigrat them to the Ottoman Empire.
              The sultan is said to have exclaimed thus at the Spanish monarch's lack
              of wisdom: "Ye call Ferdinand a wise king he who makes his land poor
              and ours rich!" <br> <br> Also During the Time when Spain was muslim, Jews, Christian and Muslims
              lived in piece under the tolerant Muslim Leaders. Thios Ideology was
              called La Convivencia. before Zionism, it was natural for Muslim rulers
              to Jewish subjects to which this consideration did not apply, we have
              lost this trust because of Zionism, Many muslims who sound anti Semitic
              are not anti semitic, they are Anti Zionist, Anti Zionism is not
              anti-Semitism. In Iran, the Ideology of Convivencia lives today, Iran
              has one of the Largest communities in the Middle east, many Iranian
              Jews prefer to stay in Iran rather than living in the Illegimate state
              of Israel, Jews actually prosper in Iran, The Iranian Parliment even
              has a Jewish representative of the Jewish Community. the Iranian
              president Ahmednajad is not Anti Semitic, he is only anti Zionst. Jews
              also have Privelages what muslims do not have. Jews are allowed to
              produce there own alcohol and have mixed sex dances. taking land of
              what belongs to them is a really poor way to repay them for there
              protection of jews from persecution.
              <br> <br>2. years After the holocaust, the pope made a pilgramige to
              aushwitz, this was an effort to bring christians and jews together
              after the persecution of the jews by christans (not al christians were
              oppressive) lead to the holocaust. many of the Jewish Holocust victims
              were devout christians, Hiter and the Nazis were very anti christian
              and anti-semitic. Christian were not like how they were in the past
              (Particularly during medieval times), now they are more reformed and
              place support to jews. the Nazi Antisemitism is now impotent, so why
              are we taking land from someone else, this is actually us asking for
              more antisemitism. <br> <br> In conclusion, if we were to disband israel and return the land to
              Palestine, anti semitism would not really be a big issue any more, so
              Jews can live peacfully with muslims and christians like how it was in
              Muslim spain.</span></p>

              <p>Israel was created from the land that was already occupied by palestinian arabs in 1948. The muslims had rejected the 1947 UN partition plan for palestine as put forward by western nations but the UN went ahead anyway. What do you expect the arab muslims to do? They invaded Israel but lost the 1948 war. Israel expanded its territory beyond what was originally mapped out by the UN....victor's spoils...nothing new. Israel took the land of palestinians and drove 4 million of them out of their homes into neighboring arab nations as refugees. Despite UN resolutions requiring Israel to allow the rights of return for these refugees, Israel had refused.</p>
              <p>What do you expect the palestinians to do? Israel has F16 and precision bombs, the palestinians have only home made pipe rockets. Western nations accuse the palestinians of terrorism because their crude rockets do not distinguish between military and civilian targets, unlike the Israelis with their F16 and laser guided precision bombs. You know how silly that sounds? Sure, give the palestinians some F16 and precision bombs too so they can target just the soldiers. Israel has the military power, the palestinians do not. They can only use their bodies and resort to suicide bombings to make life as difficult as possible for the Israelis.</p>
              <p>But the palestinians will never be able to drive Israel to the sea, despite their rhetorics. And neither can Israel ever have peace so long as it will not allow the palestinians the right to return. This little war will not achieve anything. Israel must exterminate every single palestinian...every child and every woman along with the brick-hurling palestians...if they won't allow them to return home. Israel will not be able to bring about a palestinian holocaust even if they want to, and so the killing will go on and on.</p>

              <p>Israel could just stop oppressing the "Palestinians" and stop this endless cycle of violence. On the other hand, if Israel stops and sues for peace like in the immediate period after the 1993 Oslo Accords, the "Palestinians" might again be roused by their Imans calling for the destruction of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state. While Israel has offered a two state solution many times, the Palestinian representatives have always rejected it as a poor substitute for a Palestinian state built on the grave of Israel.</p>
              <p>One might ask: Why aren't the Arab states willing to take in their 'Muslim brothers' which are being oppressed and surrounded by the Israelis? The thing is that they too, dont want to take in the "Palestinian" Arabs because it would drain their national resources. Meaning that they dont see the "Palestinians" as "brothers" in the first place. Also, it serves as a way to keep the conflict and to maintain a chaotic Middle-East.</p>

              did not apply, we have lost this trust because of Zionism, Many
              muslims who sound anti Semitic are not anti semitic, they are Anti
              Zionist, Anti Zionism is not anti-Semitism. In Iran, the Ideology
              of Convivencia lives today, Iran has one of the Largest communities
              in the Middle east, many Iranian Jews prefer to stay in Iran rather
              than living in the Illegimate state of Israel, Jews actually
              prosper in Iran, The Iranian Parliment even has a Jewish
              representative of the Jewish Community. the Iranian president
              Ahmednajad is not Anti Semitic, he is only anti Zionst. Jews also
              have Privelages what muslims do not have. Jews are allowed to
              produce there own alcohol and have mixed sex dances. taking land of
              what belongs to them is a really poor way to repay them for there
              protection of jews from persecution.<br> <br> 2. years After the holocaust, the pope made a pilgramige to
              aushwitz, this was an effort to bring christians and jews together
              after the persecution of the jews by christans (not al christians
              were oppressive) lead to the holocaust. many of the Jewish Holocust
              victims were devout christians, Hiter and the Nazis were very anti
              christian and anti-semitic. Christian were not like how they were
              in the past (Particularly during medieval times), now they are more
              reformed and place support to jews. the Nazi Antisemitism is now
              impotent, so why are we taking land from someone else, this is
              actually us asking for more antisemitism.<br> <br> In conclusion, if we were to disband israel and return the land to
              Palestine, anti semitism would not really be a big issue any more,
              so Jews can live peacfully with muslims and christians like how it
              was in Muslim spain.</span></p>

              <p>The problem is that world affairs are ruled by the simple principle that might is right. Western nations decide that land should be taken away from Palestine to create the nation of Israel in 1948. The palestinians and many arab nations still regard the creation of Israel as unjustified and the result of a power balance that is overwhelmingly in favour of Israel and western nations. There is no doubt that if it is the palestinians who have nuclear weapons, the US will quickly pressure Israel to negotiate, give up land and allow the right of palestinian refugees to return.</p>
              <p>It is a zero sum game. Might is right.</p>

              <p>I dont think Israel really have the intention of "Stopping
              rocket attacks".</p>
              <p>That "stopping rocket attacks" is just a slogan, soundbyte,
              theme.</p>
              <p>Usually for these kinds of political game or a warfare, the
              surface reason is always not the real reason.</p>
              <p>I think the real reason is to weaken the whole cause of the
              Palestinian nation building.</p>
              <p>Israel destroyed police stations, police training centers,
              killed UN workers (as usual), destroyed homes, apartments, roads,
              and everything that has to do with Hamas, all Hamas offices
              etc.</p>
              <p>This reminds me back when they launched a war into Lebanon, and
              gave the reason as to "save 2 Israeli soldiers being held by
              Hezbollah".</p>
              <p>Nobody would launch a big invasion just to save 2 lowly
              soldiers, and furthermore it was not a special-ops operation to
              find the 2 soldiers, but a real land war by mainstream troops.</p>
              <p>Now, I think the situation is the same. They are saying they
              want to "stop rocket attacks" but I think these are just the theme
              being given out as talking points to their ambassadors and
              spokesmen to say. That is not the real reason.</p>
              <p>It seems to me, from their continued settlement-building,
              playing Hamas vs Fatah, warring Lebanon and Palestine Gaza, they
              really have a goal of securing as long as possible their territory,
              and gaining upper hand and weaken the enemies and make any future
              negotiations or concession more beneficiary to them. They also
              wanted to weaken any Palestinian nation-building. That is why they
              choke off the economy, blockade the movement of goods and people
              (for years not just now), captured whole cabinets, and killed many
              leaders. They do not want to have a strong viable Palestinian
              nation-state, organized and solidified, contending the same land
              with them.</p>
