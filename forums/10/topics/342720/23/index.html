              <p>frankly speaking i'm leaning somewhat in that direction. the whole world seems to think that the IDF are suppose to go in and avoid civilian casualties while taking out hamas at the same time. they're supposed to get hamas only despite hamas using people as human shields. despite gaza being so packed.</p>

              <p>That was the issue I was talking about in the first place. Hamas used civilians as human shields. <strong>I dont deny that and I feel that it is deplorable.</strong> But in the midst of condemning Hamas, we shouldnt forget that Israel also engages in the same practice. <strong>What's more, that also shouldnt prevent us from criticising the violations of human rights that the IDF has committed as well as those that Hamas has violated.</strong></p>
              <p>That is the double standards I was referring to. Even if the world practices double standards, it doesn't make it right (simple moral lessons that all children learn and you cant get it?).</p>

              <p><br>Fc, i know and understand where you are comming from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Believe me, my tears well up with each Israeli bullet or bomb that tears into a Gaza apartment, for i know there will be innocent men, women and children inside, while watching the war footage on CNN, similarly with every humanitarian on Earth who cares, as well as the Israeli citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Children, MY GOD! CHILDREN! I love children, not in the Micheal Jackson presumed ways. They are born innocent. Their unconditional trust and love in adults are out of this world, ephemeral and a pureness i know would never exist  in the real adult world. Why, God, why the most innocent of them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No Israeli wanted this to happen, but the world did not bother when Israeli citizens, mothers, fathers, children, were murdered by Hamas' missiles. The Israelis did what they had to do to protect their citizens, even after much restrain no soveriegn nation would ever do the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know you care, and am glad you care too. None of this would have happened if Hamas would stop their genocidal constitution and harming of Israeli citizens thru murders. We are civilised humans with brains prepared to compromise and negotiations. But Hamas and radical muslims do not have such faculties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They  wanted and willed Israeli bullets and bombs to their own fellow citizens as sacrifice, to draw condemnation to Israeli. This is atrocious! Innocent lives are NEVER, NEVER bargining chips! But Hamas didnt care. Nor do radical muslims around the world cares.</p>
              <p>Thus, I weep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By all means, KC, hold Israel acountable. Hamas would be glad, happy and be more than willing to provide more muslims innocents as 'sacrifice'. It will never end till every  innocent palestinian is dead except the terrorist leaders. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is what Hamas wants.  Your sympathy, loud whines and funds so that they and their kind can continue to kill more 'jews and infidels'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ban Ki Moon, the UN leader, should resign. He is a disgrace to the very noble constitution of UN charter. He is not effective as a leader or as a inspired negotiator, and did nothing to stop months ahead of this trajedy on Hamas' missiles. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He had failed in Myanmar, Somali, Iraq, and now Gaza. Tell him to save the crocodile tears. His foresight is lacking and hindsight atrocious.</p>
              <p><br>Holms, a humanitarian UN leader I look up to, is more realistic, but there is only so much he can do, and not be twisted by so called 'humanitarians' whom made use of his office to repress others further. He is not the top dog in UN or empowered to do anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to wallow in sadness, but for the sake of my fellow humans of the palestinian citizenship, I do know there is a solution avaliable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if only moderate Muslims around the world would be courageous enough to get out of their comfort zone and apathetic ways like i once was, condemn Hamas and demand their ideology of genocide and suicide be rendered blasphemous, and then the palestinians and the middle east will know a golden era of peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But will they? I don't know. Drowning in red wine over despair is my only solace now, inorder that i may know a good night's rest.. I am realistic enough to know that i am only a nobody afterall, have no say in national affairs let alone the world's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for hearing me out.</p>
