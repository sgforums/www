              <p>Dear Xtreyer,</p>
              <p>I would like to point out several inconsistencies and ambiguity
              in your facts.</p>
              <p>1) Palestine leading up to Israel’s inauguration in 1948 was
              occupied by majoritily Arabs with a mere 5% Jewish populace. In
              modern history, the Jews never really did governed the land of
              Palestine. It has been changing hands between the Muslims and
              Christians.</p>
              <p>3) The Jews were promised sovereignty of Palestine long before
              1920 and this was ratified with the Balfour Declaration of 1917. (A
              controversial condition attached to this was Chaim Weizmann’s
              talents in producing accetone which is greatly required for
              Britain’s war efforts).</p>
              <p>4) Ben Gurion, A Zionist declared Israeli independence himself.
              It was only in 1949 that U.N gave it official recognition. Only 13
              nations initially gave Israel de jure recognation, not the entire
              world.</p>
              <p>5) It was not Israel which was not wanted in other parts of the
              world minus Germany but it is their utmost desire to claim their
              so-called biblical right to Palestine.</p>
              <p>6)In 1967, Israel was the entity which conducted preemptive
              strikes on its Arab neighbour which caught them in surprise. The
              Arab nations attacked only in retaliation. It was only the Yom
              Kippur War which the Arab nations combined to go to war with
              Israel.</p>
              <p>So do not attempt to boast writings of a pathetic shot at
              scholarly analysis when you can’t even get your facts and dates
              right.</p>
              <p>As I mention unconditional support for this Zionist cause will
              cause mayhem for you and your family and all of us.</p>

              <p>Thank you Jarhum.</p>
              <p>But I got something to add. If you want to talk about British involvement, then we should all be British-bashing because the Brits promised Palestine then, to three different parties:</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Britain conquered Palestine from the Turks in 1917-18. First Her Majesty's Government <strong>promised Palestine to the Jews in </strong></span><strong><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">the Balfour Declaration in 1917</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">, and then again in the League of Nations </span><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Mandate for Palestine of 1922</span></a></strong><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">, in which it solemnly </span><a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/02-issue/grief-2.htm"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">accepted</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"> as "a sacred trust of civilization" to "be responsible for placing the
              country under such political, administrative and economic conditions as
              will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home." Then it
              <strong>repudiated that promise in a "White Paper" of 1939,</strong> which announced her
              intention to allow only 75,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine over
              the next five years (this as World War II and the Holocaust was just
              beginning) and after that to <strong>allow no further Jewish immigration
              without Arab consent</strong>. The White Paper also placed severe restrictions
              on the purchase of land by Jews. And it promised the Palestinian Arabs
              that Palestine would become an independent Arab state within ten years.
              All this was in flagrant violations of the League of Nations Mandate
              for Palestine; the League of Nations Mandates Commission noted this,
              and refused to ratify the White Paper. Britain implemented it anyway --
              to the extent of refusing to admit to Palestine 750 Jews who had
              managed to </span><a href="http://www.eretzyisroel.org/%7Ejkatz/struma.html"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">escape Nazi Europe</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"> in a leaky boat while the Holocaust was in full swing. The Jews </span><a href="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_mandate_oppose_immigration.php"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">were forced</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"> to turn back into the human-shark-infested waters of the Black Sea,
              where their leaky crate was torpedoed, and all but one of them killed.</span></p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Having already promised Palestine to both the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs, Britain after World War II </span><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/950373.html"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">promised it again</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">,
              this time to Syria! <strong>Secret British correspondence, recently discovered
              by an Israeli scholar, not in the archives of Britain but in those of
              France, which intercepted British and Syrian communications through
              espionage, reveals that the British promised to hand over Palestine to
              Syria in return for making Britain Syria's "protector" to replace
              France</strong>. The British even assisted the Syrians to carry out a massacre
              of French civilians and soldiers in order to force France out of Syria.<br></span></p>
              <div><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Britain
              encouraged the Arab states to form an "Arab League" as World War II
              came to an end. A British representative sat in on the League's
              meetings and raised no objections as the Arab states planned to invade
              Palestine -- even though Palestine was still under British control!"</span></div>

              <p>Another long winded opinionated piece, ignoring facts,
                       from a site of no accountability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you here to discuss solutions or lay blame on everyone else,
                      and become a tool of terrorists propaganda?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The facts are:-</p>
              <p>1. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It broke the truce by
                      Egypt and fired missiles into Israel urban centres with intention
                      to murder innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Israel, which any other nation would have retaliated before
                      even the 2nd missile landed, had restrain themselves when faced
                      such oppression with more than 200 missiles daily for months. No
                      one called for a halt in hama's agression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Israel realized they are alone, and retaliated last week, as
                      any nation would to prevent further dead in their homeland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever happened 1400 years ago, who was right or who was
                      right, what was conspired, is immaterial. The fact is that the
                      carnage is now happening, and death of innocents are happening on
                      BOTH sides which must end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas, a terrorist organisation dedicated to the death of
                      innocents to achieve their national agenda, recieves sympathies,
                      funds and recruits from faithful muslims thru a misinterpretation
                      on their holy book.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faithful muslims around the world assured the human race that
                      they condemn terrorism and terrorists acts - killing of innocent
                      men, women and children - done in their religion's name, which
                      is a mis-interpretation of their holy book, no matter the causes,
                      since 911.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore it is time now for the faithful muslims around the
                      world, without any excuses, must honour their words -  to
                      condemn the factual terrorists acts conducted by Hamas, whom slay
                      innocent people in Israel thru their daily missile barrage, as well
                      as now hiding amongst the civilian population ensuring more
                      innocents die in facing Israel's wrath.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The muslims must condemn the atrocities of Hamas, capture their
                      terrorists and turn them over to the authorities, and place more
                      effort to correct the misinterpretation of their holy book so that
                      no more muslims be misled or used by evil men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrritorial claims can be civiliy discussed, but not by piling
                      innocents dead in the meeting room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am under no illusion that my written word here will have any
                      effect or even read by anyone, but hope is like a droplet of water
                      into the ocean which will affect the tide, and when more considers
                      my post, it will be a Tsunami of change that will help our fellow

In addition, Israeli settlers regularly harass the Palestinians with the protection of the IDF.</p>

              <p>Description is purely opinions based on value systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was easy for the 1.5 million "prisoners" to change their living conditions if they had rejected the politics propounded by HAMAS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are the same Palestinians living on the West Bank not living in similar "prison like conditions" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you succumb to propaganda and propound it further with your own preferred twist of the situation, it does not help anyone to understand the present events any clearer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is fortunate for us to live in a different part of the World, and see it as "disinterested" parties with no special agenda, and view the events without any colored lens, or any emotional hang-ups - and pass our judgment based on the facts of the events, with our own values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "facts" depend on how and where you gather these from.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>How is using F-16s against homemade rockets and bombs not like molotov cocktails against Panzer tanks? In fact, today's comparison is even more ridiculous.</p>
              <p>I agree that any nation has <em>the right to self-defence</em>, naturally Israel as well. And that includes Iran.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The UN-GUIDED missiles or rockets fired by HAMAS are deliberately aimed or directed to land into the midst of Israeli civilian areas to cause maximum destruction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are not molotov cocktails.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least the Israeli are taking pains to retaliate by using laser guided bombs that target HAMAS militant strongholds and missile or rocket manufacturing facilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Compared to the cheap HAMAS rockets, these Israeli laser guided bombs and missiles would have cost at least 20 to 50 times more - and would have already shown the difference in the effort at minimising civilian casualties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that Palestinian casualties have occurred is due to the deliberate effort of HAMAS to locate these high-explosives manufacturing facilities in the middle of densely populated area - in TOTAL DIS-REGARD to their OWN POPULACE - shows the callous attitude of the HAMAS leadership towards even their own people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you agree that Israel or Iran - or any nation - has the right to self-defense - is there any need to agonise over the Israeli response to HAMAS irresponsible and callous acts towards Human Lives - whether be it Israelis or their own Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip ?</p>

              <p>But, if it continues oppressing the Palestinian people, expanding settlements that harrass Palestinians, restricting medical supplies, food and fuel, putting up an obscene amount of checkpoints that make life horribly inconvenient (and thats an understatement) for the Gazans, then why should the Gazans take it lying down? <strong>Tell me, does Israel deserve retaliation from its inhumane behaviour?</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Is Israel continuing to oppress the Palestinian people - or are you succumbing to propaganda ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The previous Israeli Prime Minister Sharon - who died of heart failure - was one of the stoutest propounder of Israeli settlements on occupied territories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet he was also one of the strongest advocate to forcibly remove large segments of the Israeli settlements from occupied territory, in exchange for Peace - and at a high price of his own political unpopularity amongst the Israeli settlers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sharon insisted on the mass removal of the Israeli settlers, as he realised that the Israeli settlements on occupied territory will only stretch Israeli military resources, and will only weaken their position in the face of mounting Palestinian civiliarn unrest in their well ochestrated INTIFADAH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israel had offered a negotiated and permanent settlement to allow a TWO-State solution to exist - this was rejected by the previous Palestinian Leader Arafat, who felt his position was better off having a prolonged stand-off than a resolution, as this guaranteed continued financial support from the other Arab countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that Arafat is dead and gone, the present Palestinian President Abbas efforts have been sabotaged by HAMAS refusal to negotiate with Israel, and insist on their Iranian supported foolish ambitious goal of having Israel totally anihilated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Palestinians in Gaza can taking it in any position they wish, as long as they continue with their foolishness in taking on Israel by threatening the Israeli civilians, they have only themselves to blame for the Israeli retaliation that will certainly come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the Middle-eastern principle of "an eye for an eye" - as is propounded by the fundamentalist Islamic believers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If Egypt blocks its border with Gaza, then it is complicit with the inhumane bloodshed. Thats why Egyptian flags were also burned during riots. Even though Palestinians are Arabs, the other Arab countries refuse to treat them like brothers. So such for the Islamic brotherhood.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Complicity requires more then just blocking the border with Gaza.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Palestinians in Gaza can burn all the flags of all the countries on earth, but they will not be getting any sympathy as that given to the USA on 9-11 - even from the worst protagonists of the US.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If HAMAS and their Palestinian supporters in the Gaza Strip play with fire, they have to learn to live with the fire they have created for themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No point attempting to look for sympathy from the World Community if they cannot control the fire that they have started.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>After 2 world wars, the world's humanity, led by the victor USA, evoloved into full emanciapation of mankind from the bondage of serfdom, tyranny and oppression by monarchists, tribal leaders and colonnialism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Colonnialism was dismantled and replaced with democracy and its following democratic processes to serve humanity, even fof the losers of the war - Germany, Japan and axis powers, which in another age, would have been sold as slaves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A new freedom for humanity rang in the air with the formation of UN, made up of representatives from population centres, using majority vote to arbitrate freedoms for the oppressed and those in national disagreements, so that the wars of conquests be avoided.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone to their borders, and those who seek for military expansion of their borders, will face the wrath of an united nation made up of a diversity of humans who share this world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There must be a point whereby ancient tribal fueds must cease over land and other issues so that a new generation may grow up in peace. By 1945, the world's humanity had suffered enough watching their loved ones die before their eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus humanity's solution was to remove historical baggages, end warfare and oppression where it exists and promote democracy where possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in the middle east, there exists men and women whom shares our world, are unwilling to embrace a new world and new realities for the new generation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They use ancient holy texts twisted to their ideology of land expansion by promoting hate, anger, oppression and murder of others anywhere to acheive their barbaric delusions of conquest granduer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oppressions can be ended on a negotiation table.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But murder of innocents using religion twisted is an ideology that will only end us all into the grave. More so a religion that had made peace with the world for hundreds of years after the excesses of the dark middle ages, and had seen scientific progress as well as the  evolution of mankind leaping into the stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only by  correcting the mis-interpretation in the holy book, thus nullifying barbaric agression ideology, will more come forward to the negotiation table to address claims of oppression or sovereignity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We ALL are humans, and each do have a right to live in peace on our planet, which can only be shared and not owned by any one individual or individuals, regardless of his/her race, politics or religion.</p>

              <p>Dear Jarhum,</p>
              <p><br>I take special exception to your chilly phrase:-</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff6600;">"unconditional support for this Zionist cause will cause mayhem for you and your family."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Is this an implied threat to me and my family?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rest assured, I would prefer to look the other way, being all annonymous to each but most probably known by the authorities, but there will be others who may not be so kind, to your post which smack right out of an arab propoganda page, for it ignore facts and fully subjective from the sole twisted viewpoint of the arabs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can continue your baseless accusation of me leaning towards the jews, but from each and every of my post, I stand only on the objective humanitarian side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I, along with may other humanitarian of different faiths, even the moderate muslim faith, call for a truce, ON BOTH SIDES, to end this suffering of innocents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas are not freedom fighters, for no freedom fighter will place their own people in the line of fire, nor fire upon innocent targets as they did with missiles into Israel urban centres.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are animals set upon by despicable others to achieve mis-interpretated claims of a peaceful religion shared by millions of faithful around the world, who would now place sackcloth on their heads on the sacriledge by these beasts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should the jews then just keep quiet and let their citizens die from continued missile and suicide bomb attacks? From a humanitarian point of view, most definately NOT!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus a need for ceasefire and sort out territorial or oppression claims in a calmer setting of the negotiation table, rather than to continue loss of human lives on BOTH sides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But most critical of all, is the need to correct the mis-interpretation in the holy book of such claims that non-muslims are infidels, deserving of death and anyone who kills infidels in peacetime or self-declared war is assured of a heavenly place in the afterlife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no interest in politics or the political dimensions of the conflict, nor care of it. My only concern is for the still living innocents on BOTH sides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> We, as a human race, had evolved from our animal instincts into civilised beings, capable of reason and logic, to negotiate, instead of killing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no solutions to long held holy book claims to land issues, but there is still a solution to end the killing of innocents. Hate me or ignore me, but correct that mis-interpretation, this i only plead, so that more lives may be saved. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It was easy for the 1.5 million "prisoners" to change their
                  living conditions if they had rejected the politics propounded by
                  HAMAS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are the same Palestinians living on the West Bank not living
                  in similar "prison like conditions" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you succumb to propaganda and propound it further with your
                  own preferred twist of the situation, it does not help anyone to
                  understand the present events any clearer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is fortunate for us to live in a different part of the World,
                  and see it as "disinterested" parties with no special agenda, and
                  view the events without any colored lens, or any emotional hang-ups
                  - and pass our judgment based on the facts of the events, with our
                  own values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "facts" depend on how and where you gather these from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The UN-GUIDED missiles or rockets fired by HAMAS are
                  deliberately aimed or directed to land into the
                  midst of Israeli civilian areas to cause maximum destruction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are not molotov cocktails.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least the Israeli are taking pains to retaliate by using
                  laser guided bombs that target HAMAS militant strongholds and
                  missile or rocket manufacturing facilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Compared to the cheap HAMAS rockets, these Israeli laser
                  guided bombs and missiles would have cost at least 20 to 50 times
                  more - and would have already shown the difference in the effort at
                  minimising civilian casualties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that Palestinian casualties have occurred is due to the
                  deliberate effort of HAMAS to locate these high-explosives
                  manufacturing facilities in the middle of densely populated area -
                  in TOTAL DIS-REGARD to their OWN POPULACE - shows the callous
                  attitude of the HAMAS leadership towards even their own people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you agree that Israel or Iran - or any nation - has the right
                  to self-defense - is there any need to agonise over the Israeli
                  response to HAMAS irresponsible and callous acts towards Human
                  Lives - whether be it Israelis or their own Palestinians living in
                  the Gaza Strip ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is Israel continuing to oppress the Palestinian people - or are
                  you succumbing to propaganda ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The previous Israeli Prime Minister Sharon - who died of heart
                  failure - was one of the stoutest propounder of Israeli settlements
                  on occupied territories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet he was also one of the strongest advocate to forcibly remove
                  large segments of the Israeli settlements from occupied territory,
                  in exchange for Peace - and at a high price of his own
                  political unpopularity amongst the Israeli settlers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sharon insisted on the mass removal of the Israeli
                  settlers, as he realised that the Israeli settlements on occupied
                  territory will only stretch Israeli military resources, and will
                  only weaken their position in the face of mounting Palestinian
                  civiliarn unrest in their well ochestrated INTIFADAH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israel had offered a negotiated and permanent settlement to
                  allow a TWO-State solution to exist - this was rejected by the
                  previous Palestinian Leader Arafat, who felt his position was
                  better off having a prolonged stand-off than a resolution, as this
                  guaranteed continued financial support from the other Arab
                  countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that Arafat is dead and gone, the present Palestinian
                  President Abbas efforts have been sabotaged by HAMAS refusal to
                  negotiate with Israel, and insist on their Iranian supported
                  foolish ambitious goal of having Israel totally anihilated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Palestinians in Gaza can taking it in any position they
                  wish, as long as they continue with their foolishness in taking on
                  Israel by threatening the Israeli civilians, they have only
                  themselves to blame for the Israeli retaliation that will
                  certainly come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the Middle-eastern principle of "an eye for an eye" - as
                  is propounded by the fundamentalist Islamic believers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Complicity requires more then just blocking the border with
                  Gaza.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Palestinians in Gaza can burn all the flags of all the
                  countries on earth, but they will not be getting any sympathy as
                  that given to the USA on 9-11 - even from the worst protagonists of
                  the US.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If HAMAS and their Palestinian supporters in the Gaza Strip
                  play with fire, they have to learn to live with the fire they have
                  created for themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No point attempting to look for sympathy from the World
                  Community if they cannot control the fire that they have
                  started.</p>

              <p>Haha, so those laser guided bombs, each weighing about several hundred pounds, cause less damage and casualties than unguided homemade or small-scale rockets? When the term "precision weapons" are used, it refers to its accuracy, not its impact. If Israel wants to target Hamas police stations (civilian infrastructure), which it did, a certain GBU could have destroyed it. But the ensuing shockwave generated would have probably injured and killed civilians within a radius of several hundred metres. In fact, Israel's bombs have already been reported to have caused <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article13863.htm">miscarriages and psychological trauma</a>, besides of course killing people.</p>
              <p>How can you believe that the Palestinians could at least have an acceptable standard of living when Israel makes sure that medical supplies, food and fuel is restricted, or at times, refuses to allow the re-supplying of Gaza? You could argue that religion or politics have caused this crisis. But when people are deprived of necessities, they have no choice but to rise up and rebel. Naturally we can't even understand that because our basic needs are fulfilled and taken for granted in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Israel has promised to halt settlement building many times. Yet the fact remains that expansion of settlements still continues. When the two state solution was proposed, it was impossible for Arafat to have agreed because firstly, the proposed Palestinian state would have been divided by the strategically situated (around Jerusalem) Israeli settlements. A nation that has no control over its borders is no nation at all. Secondly, the Palestinian state would have no control over its air space at all, meaning that the IAF would have a free reign to bomb it whenever it wants. Again, what kind of sovereignty is that?</p>
              <p>Despite the meaninglessness of this argument, because might is right in the real world, do you realise that Palestinian casualties are many times more than Israeli casualties? And of course it would be. Israel has undertaken this policy for many years, hitting hard in response to the smallest provocation. Decades ago for example, a border clash which killed less than 10 Israeli soldiers died was retaliated with an Israeli attack that would usually kill 50+ [insert Arab country] dead. That was then when Israel was potentially threatened on all sides. Today, it just seems like US-like bullying.</p>

              <p>From a humanitarian standpoint, Israel should use its military, the 4th largest in the world and funded largely by the US, to wage "shock and awe" on Gaza with absurdly technologically superior weapons, killing far more people than Hamas with its unguided rockets right? And also, to prevent Hamas attacks (rather ineffectively), <strong>prevent medical supplies, fuel and food</strong> from reaching Gaza right?</p>
              <p>If you want to profess such humanitarian feelings, then don't just condemn Hamas as "terrorists" because they are labelled as such in the MSM. Is Israel, though you'll insist regardless- is acting in self-defence, justified in inflicting far more casualties than Hamas and professing higher moral ground? Hamas has acted in brutal and inhumane ways, so has Israel. I'm not denying that. If you want to profess objectivity, then don't just condemn Hamas.</p>

              <h3>'They are bombing one and a half million people in a cage'</h3>
              <p><br> Mads
                          Gilbert, a Norwegian doctor working in Gaza, told Sky News on Monday
                          that that <strong>he believes Israel is deliberately attacking the Palestinian
                          population, not just targeting Hamas</strong> as Israeli authorities have said
                          numerous times.<br> <br> "Just a little bit more than an hour ago, the Israelis <strong>bombed the
                          central food market in Gaza City</strong> and we had a mass influx of about 50
                          injured and between 10 and 15 killed," said Gilbert, on the phone with
                          Sky News. <br> <br> "At the same time they <strong>bombed an apartment house with children playing
                          on the roof</strong> and we had a lot of children also. This is really like from
                          Dante's Inferno. It's like hell here now and it's been bombing all
                          night. Up till now, <strong>close to 500 people have been killed and the number
                          of casualties is getting to 2 to 2 and a half thousand which 50 percent
                          are children and women</strong>."<br> <br> "Are your hospital's reaching capacity?" asked the Sky News correspondent. "Can you deal with these people?"<br> <br> "We have been doing surgery around the clock," Gilbert replied. "I just
                          talked to to one of my colleagues in the ICU who has not been sleeping
                          for three days and they hospital is completely overcrowded and we are
                          running six, seven OR's and there are injuries that you just don't want
                          to see in this world. <strong>Children coming in with open abdomens and legs
                          cut off</strong>. <br> <br> "We just had a child who left. We had to amputate both legs and the
                          arms and the only crime they have done is been civilians --
                          Palestinians living in Gaza. The relief now is not more doctors and
                          more drugs the relief now is to stop the bombing immediately. This can
                          not go on. It is a disaster." <br> <br> "You've talked about the civilians, the women and children, the men who
                          aren't involved in this but are you also getting casualties that are
                          Hamas fighters?" asked the reporter.<br> <br> "To be honest, we came on New Year's Eve in the morning," answered
                          Gilbert. "I've seen one military person among the tens -- I mean,
                          hundreds -- we have seen and treated. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So, anybody who tries to claim
                          this as sort of a clean war against another army are lying. </strong></span><br> <br> "This is <strong>an all out war against the civilian Palestinian population in
                          Gaza and we can prove that with the numbers and you have to remember
                          that the average age of the Gaza inhabitant is 17-years. It's a very

              <h1>U.S. blocks U.N. [Ceasefire] statement on Gaza</h1>
              <p><span id="udtD">updated <span class="time">11:52 p.m. ET </span><span class="date">Jan. 3, 2009</span></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28484148/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28484148/</a></p>
              <p>UNITED NATIONS - The United States late
              Saturday blocked approval of a U.N. Security Council statement calling
              for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel and
              expressing concern at the escalation of violence between Israel and
              Hamas.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">U.S.
              deputy ambassador Alejandro Wolff said the United States saw no
              prospect of Hamas abiding by last week's council call for an immediate
              end to the violence. Therefore, he said, a new statement at this time
              "would not be adhered to and would have no underpinning for success,
              would not do credit to the council."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">France's
              U.N. Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert, the current council president,
              announced that there was no agreement among members on a statement. But
              he said there were "strong convergences" among the 15 members to
              express serious concern about the deteriorating situation in Gaza and
              the need for "an immediate, permanent and fully respected cease-fire."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Arab nations demanded that the council adopt a
              statement calling for an immediate cease-fire following Israel's launch
              of a ground offensive in Gaza earlier Saturday, a view echoed by
              Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Libya's
              U.N. Ambassador Giadalla Ettalhi, the only Arab member of the council,
              said the United States objected to "any outcome" during the closed
              council discussions on the proposed statement.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">He said efforts were made to compromise and agree on a weaker press statement but there was no consensus.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              15-member council had met behind closed doors to discuss a proposed
              presidential statement that would also call for all parties to address
              the humanitarian and economic needs in Gaza, including by opening
              border crossings.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              five permanent council members — the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and
              China — along with Libya, the only Arab nation on the council, then met
              privately to discuss possibly issuing another press statement.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"We
              need to have from the Security Council reaction tonight to bring this
              latest addition of aggression against our people in Gaza to an
              immediate halt," Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. observer told
              reporters.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              statement would have become part of the council's official record but
              would not have the weight of a Security Council resolution, which is
              legally binding.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Mansour
              said 3,000 Palestinians have been killed and injured since Israeli
              warplanes starting bombing Gaza a week ago. More than 480 Palestinians
              have been killed in Gaza and four killed in Israel.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">International
              criticism of the offensive has increased steadily, but Israel maintains
              the offensive is aimed at stopping the rocket attacks from
              Hamas-controlled Gaza that have traumatized southern Israel.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Before
              the council met Saturday night, Ban telephoned Israeli Prime Minister
              Ehud Olmert and said he was disappointed that Israel launched a ground
              offensive and "alarmed that this escalation will inevitably increase
              the already heavy suffering" of Palestinian civilians, the U.N.
              spokesman's office said in a statement.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"He
              called for an immediate end to the ground operation, and asked that
              Israel do all possible to ensure the protection of civilians and that
              humanitarian assistance is able to reach those in need," the statement
              said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Ban
              reiterated his call for an immediate cease-fire and urged regional and
              international partners "to exert all possible influence to bring about
              an immediate end to the bloodshed and suffering," the statement said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              secretary-general said the Israeli ground operation is complicating
              efforts by the Quartet of Mideast peacemakers — the U.N., the U.S., the
              European Union and Russia — to end the violence.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Several
              Arab foreign ministers are expected at U.N. headquarters on Monday to
              urge the Security Council to adopt a resolution ending the Israeli
              offensive. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delayed his arrival
              until Tuesday so he can meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the
              West Bank.</p>

              <p>My point is that you should stop being biased to Israel. What have I said do you think is a "conspiracy theory" despite not even responding to the information I posted? (I ask even though you wont answer, as always). And you think that Israel is the shining beacon of humanitarianism? Practice what you preach. If you dont like "blaming", then why are you condemning Hamas. Isn't that the same as blaming them for the bloodshed? And you've not answered my question whether Israel or Hamas has killed more people during this conflict. Just respond to the post and answer the questions. No one wants to hear your self-righteous rants (I really wonder how you got passed comprehension).</p>
              <p>And no, I dont have a solution. Even if I, or anyone here had, it wouldn't make a difference because the ordinary person is powerless. (See, this is called "responding to peoples' posts" aka "forum etiquette") Heard of it?</p>
