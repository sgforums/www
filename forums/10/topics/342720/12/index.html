              <p>Understanding and sympathizing are 2 different issues. Understanding extremism doesn't mean agreeing that their actions are justified. Sympathizing with them on the other hand, is to think that the pain they go through justifies their actions.</p>
              <p>As I said, condemning the current actions of Israel is one thing. If you are an Israeli leader, what would you decide to do in relation to Hamas?</p>

              <p>The most practical choice i would chose is to exterminate every last
                  one of them. Man, Women and Child. Eliminate every single potential
                  threat, the child and mother is going to grow up hating you anyway,
                  what's the point?</p>
              <p>It's the most straightforward option, the world would just
                  forget about it in a decade or two. The show of force would discourage
                  the Arab countries from ever provoking Israel  and it would take the
                  least amount of time to accomplish, with the lowest material cost. </p>
              <p>Best
                  of all, I can time it after the election since it's so close when I no
                  longer have to please the people. One half of the parliament would hail
                  me as the hero of the hour, willing to do what is needed, the other
                  will call me a monster but all you got to do is call that half cowards
                  and traitors then your political position would be secured.</p>
              <p>The
                  more painful option B, the weaker option i would chose is to introduce
                  scholarships for young bright Palestinian youths, both men and women.
                  Bring them to the best universities in Israel, make sure they are given
                  good accomodations and basically make sure they mingle with the other
                  Israel students.</p>
              <p>I would get student volunteers who could speak the language to ensure these Palestinian youths are as comfortable as possible and protect them from harassments.</p>
              <p>I see the problem as social, rather than racial, religious.or even historical.  There
                  is severe poverty and unemployment issues among the Palestinians. As
                  long as that exists Hamas will never run short of volunteers. Idle men are always aggressive.</p>
              <p>Taking
                  their brightest and educating them alongside with Israel's brightest
                  would at least open their eyes to the lives of the enemies, hatred is
                  easy when you do not mix on an everyday basis with the enemy. When
                  their education is done and they go back, you basically create a more
                  moderate leadership among the Palestinian people.</p>
              <p>Fund
                  construction projects and build infrastructure for them, paying
                  attention to employ Palestinian workers, if they have the engineers and
                  architect to handle the job pioritize the jobs to them. Ensure they
                  have access to proper water/food/electricity/sanitation and medical
                  support.</p>
              <p>Cut down on the checkpoints to the Gaza strip, allowing
                  the UN and volunteer groups to help. No more discrimination policies,
                  allow foreign groups with Palestinian members to come and go as they
                  please.</p>
              <p>During this time, Hamas and foreign funded groups would
                  do their best to sabotage the process. Ignore them, do what you can to
                  help the wounded but do not retaliate. Continously use the foreign
                  media to highlight the damage Hamas is doing, make sure to protray that
                  Israel is the victim. Make sure that such stories are distributed among
                  the Palestinians.</p>
              <p>Members of the Israeli government would not like such
                  arrangements, they would do their best to destroy the effort either
                  through deliberate actions or simply not doing anything at all. For
                  such individuals, use the Sedition Act and bring them up on false
                  charges and throw away the keys. Deny them access to everything,
                  including visitors and phonelines.</p>
              <p>Idealistically , i would
                  chose Option B. But it would never work in a Democracy simply because
                  of the short term memories of the electorate. Tough retaliation would
                  always be more popular than soft ones. The people want "strong"
                  leaders, they want alpha males as leaders! Not weak sympathetic women !(No offense, of course to Golda Meir)</p>
              <p>Imply that we sympathize and not understand the stituation is a
                  phrase i find very annoying. It is used far too often to defeat
                  arguments and options that we ourselves didn't even give much thought
                  to.I see the others in this thread posting reasonable arguments but all
                  put down easily by the use of "Arab propagandists, Arab sympathizers
                  and Israel haters"  </p>

(I still have one of the leaflets the Israelis dropped on besieged Beirut in 1982 and the language is exactly the same—“flee, flee for your lives!”). Mosques, schools, houses, apartment buildings, have all been brought down on the heads of those inside.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">All this death and destruction comes supposedly in retaliation for rocket attacks that had not inflicted a single fatality inside Israel in over a year. What happened to “an eye for an eye?”...</span></p>

              <p>Several misconceptions pertaining this conflict exists due to our staple consumption of American reporting primarily from the Israeli perspective. Let us give some consideration and thought to alternative sources for subscribing to a single source of perspective on an issue tends to espouse narrow mindedness in our views and consequently, discussions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. <em>Hamas initiated this conflict by firing rockets due to Israel's blockade of Gazas borders.</em></p>
              <p>Skirmishes occured even during the relativly calm period of truce between both parties. Hamas did consider an extention of the truce but turned its back when 3 of its personnel were killed by the IDF which accused them of planting explosives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. <em>Israel's killings of innocent civilians in Gaza is not intented but by accident as well as Hamas is deliberately exploiting its civilians as human shields.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Several reports coming within Gaza, instead of those reported by Israeli-aligned media operating from Israeli cities, affirm that Israel attacks Palestinian civilians on intent. The most publicised and blatant is the bombing of U.N school which has been accused by Zionist Israel of sheltering Hamas fighters. This accusation has been vehemently refuted by John Ging, the head of the U.N relief agency. Whist the Israeli have contradictorily reported receiving motar fire "from within" the school. However, recent statement released from the Israeli altered its statement of receiving motar fire "from" the school. U.N has challenged Israel to produce proof of its accusation. Not a single school but three U.N schools. Israeli defence of its innocence in this matter is objectively questionable.</p>
              <p>3. <em>Hamas associated with terrorism per se</em>.</p>
              <p>Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S and E.U and Japan. However, several nations maintain contact with Hamas, notably Norway and only its armed wing is listed as terrorist organization by Australia and E.U.</p>
              <p>We have to analyze the sequence of events leading to the current conflict as every middle-eastern conflict is a consequence of chain reactions.</p>
              <p>Israel's founding roots was etched in similar realms of terrorism. Irgun, a Jewish terrorist group killed 91 people, most British Officials when they planted a bomb in King David Hotel. The acts of terrorism of the Jews formed the founding roots of its state. The Deir Yassin massacre and the assasination of Lord Moyle, one of U.N peace envoy. The leaders of these Jewish terrorist groups went to become Israel's prime and foreign ministers. Hamas may be taking a leaf from the Zionist book.</p>
              <p>4. <em>Israel does not impede the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza</em>.</p>
              <p>Israel has turned down repeatedly appeals from the world community to allow basic neccesities into impoverished Gaza and impeded the flow of necessity aids into Gaza. The boat delivering humanitarian supplies, the Dignity was not allowed to reach Gaza and peace activists travelling with the Dignity affirmed that their boat was rammed several times by the Israeli Navy although it was still in international waters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israeli warmongers are responsible for numerous war crimes and this most recent adds on the their long list. Most notably, Ariel Sharon is wanted by the Hague Tribunal for his malice of the Sabra and Shatilla carnage of Lebanon. He avoids from travelling to Belgium for fear of being arrested.</p>
              <p>I hope that Israeli citizens be pragmatic and sensible to elect leftists and doves in their coming elections who are in favour of peace and stability. </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Several misconceptions pertaining this conflict exists due to
              our staple consumption of American reporting primarily from the
              Israeli perspective. Let us give some consideration and thought to
              alternative sources for subscribing to a single source of
              perspective on an issue tends to espouse narrow mindedness in our
              views and consequently, discussions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. <em>Hamas initiated this conflict by firing rockets due to
              Israel's blockade of Gazas borders.</em></p>
              <p>Skirmishes occured even during the relativly calm period of
              truce between both parties. Hamas did consider an extention of the
              truce but turned its back when 3 of its personnel were killed by
              the IDF which accused them of planting explosives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. <em>Israel's killings of innocent civilians in Gaza is not
              intented but by accident as well as Hamas is
              deliberately exploiting its civilians as human
              shields.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Several reports coming within Gaza, instead of those
              reported by Israeli-aligned media operating from Israeli cities,
              affirm that Israel attacks Palestinian civilians on intent.
              The most publicised and blatant is the bombing of U.N school which
              has been accused by Zionist Israel of sheltering Hamas fighters.
              This accusation has been vehemently refuted by John Ging, the head
              of the U.N relief agency. Whist the Israeli have contradictorily
              reported receiving motar fire "from within" the school.
              However, recent statement released from the Israeli altered its
              statement of receiving motar fire "from" the school. U.N has
              challenged Israel to produce proof of its accusation. Not a single
              school but three U.N schools. Israeli defence of its innocence in
              this matter is objectively questionable.</p>
              <p>3. <em>Hamas associated with terrorism per
              se</em>.</p>
              <p>Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S and E.U
              and Japan. However, several nations maintain contact with Hamas,
              notably Norway and only its armed wing is listed as terrorist
              organization by Australia and E.U.</p>
              <p>We have to analyze the sequence of events leading to the current
              conflict as every middle-eastern conflict is a consequence of chain
              reactions.</p>
              <p>Israel's founding roots was etched in similar realms of
              terrorism. Irgun, a Jewish terrorist group killed 91 people, most
              British Officials when they planted a bomb in King David Hotel. The
              acts of terrorism of the Jews formed the founding roots of its
              state. The Deir Yassin massacre and the assasination of Lord
              Moyle, one of U.N peace envoy. The leaders of these
              Jewish terrorist groups went to become Israel's prime and foreign
              ministers. Hamas may be taking a leaf from the Zionist book.</p>
              <p>4. <em>Israel does not impede the flow of humanitarian
              aid into Gaza</em>.</p>
              <p>Israel has turned down repeatedly appeals from the world
              community to allow basic neccesities into impoverished Gaza and
              impeded the flow of necessity aids into Gaza. The boat delivering
              humanitarian supplies, the Dignity was not allowed to reach Gaza
              and peace activists travelling with the Dignity affirmed that their
              boat was rammed several times by the Israeli Navy although it was
              still in international waters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israeli warmongers are responsible for numerous war crimes and
              this most recent adds on the their long list. Most notably, Ariel
              Sharon is wanted by the Hague Tribunal for his malice of the Sabra
              and Shatilla carnage of Lebanon. He avoids from travelling to
              Belgium for fear of being arrested.</p>
              <p>I hope that Israeli citizens be pragmatic and sensible to
              elect leftists and doves in their coming elections who are in
              favour of peace and stability. </p>

              <p>1. So are you saying it is justified for Hamas to kill innocent Israeli <strong>civilians</strong> with their rockets when 3 of their <strong>military</strong> personnel got killed ?And what were their personnel doing in Israel in the first place ????</p>
              <p>2. According to <strong>Palestinian</strong> witnesses... militants are firing rockets near the school.. and Palestinians admits that they had been harrassed by Hamas. Is this not true ?</p>
              <p>If Singapore dares to fire some rockets into JB, do you think Malaysia will not retaliate too ?</p>
              <p>3. Ok.. So when will the chain reaction stop ?When will the Palestinian move beyond history ?</p>
              <p>4. Gaza is not smack right in the middle of Israel. Their neighbour Egypt is predominantly Muslim. Why is the Egyptian border closed to Gaza ?   Why Hamas don't fire rockets at Egypt ??? How come only punish Israel ?</p>

              <p>Why did Hamas forcibly prevent the remaining Palestinian population from leaving the Gaza Strip and created a stand-off for more then seven days until an Egyptian brokered deal allowed those Palestinians to move through Israeli territory into the West Bank ?</p>

              <p>Then, considering that the nature of both parties' weapons are different, even if Hamas doesnt announce rocket launchings, like it will, Israeli casualties from their rocket attacks pale in comparison to the warned Israeli airstrikes. Does it really take a lot of thinking to get the idea that the impact from thousand-pound bombs is massively larger than homemade rockets? The death toll on both sides already demonstrates that fact.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> The death toll is largely due to Hamas own efforts to sacrifice the lives of the Palestinians to achieve their own political agenda.</p>
              <p>What they cannot hope to win militarily, they hope to win by political deceit through propaganda.</p>
              <p>Did Israel use thousand pounds or were the bombs approximately half of what you are not propagandizing for Hamas ?</p>
              <p>Even the concrete busting bombs do not have to weigh a thousand pounds - do you think the efficiency of the Israeli scientist is so poor that they will waste explosives in the manner that you are exagerating ?</p>
              <p>The death toll is uneven due to Hamas wilfull acts of putting their own Palestinian lives in danger, but attacking Israel from heavily populated areas in the Gaza Strip, by locating their most highly prized ammunition storage facilities in the midst of densely populated residential and commercial areas, by abusing the neutrality of the hospitals and mosques to be used as ammunition storage facilities.</p>

              <p>As I said, launching rockets into Israel is despicable. But, try to put yourself in their shoes. If a foreign power was oppressing you and your people, would you not resist? <strong>Saying that they purposely launched rockets from civilian-populated areas (where are there no civilians in Gaza?) is like saying that the Viet Cong in South Vietnam purposely used their own people as a shield without any scruples.

Of course, the Israelis do not want to allow that resource to benefit the Palestinian people. If you're oppressing a people, would it be in your interest for them to be lifted out of poverty? Would it be in your interest for them to achieve the means to sustain their own economy? </p>

              <p>If there is oil and gas in the Gaza - why are the Oil Companies not rushing in to sign up contractural papers with the Hamas leadership ?</p>
              <p>If there is so much oil and gas in the Gaza, why will Hamas risk it all by firing rockets into Israel and provoking Israeli airforce to bomb the oil and gas fields ?</p>
              <p>If the Gaza Strip is so densely populated and tight in living space for the Palestinians - where do you expect the Palestinians to move - so as to make way for the European and American Oil Companies?</p>

              <p><br>Yeah right. There were no rockets fired into Israel. Hamas are made up of kindergarten teachers and would not hurt a fly. Those statements they made as well as their constitution were created by the media. Even Al Jazreel is Western contaminated. And arab propagandists do not exists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sheesh! Is is so difficult for a muslim to admit shame? Is pride that important, more important than life and lives itself? I, a non-muslim, would gladly admit shame on your behalf if you don't dare admit it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone of us is flawed anyway. Only be admitting to our mistakes, correcting it, can we progress and evolve. To blame others is only to retard and devolve into lesser beings than humans, and would only cause harm to others around us. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have the deepest respect for men such as the good prophet Mohammed for his efforts to elevate an ethnic group and alleviate their sufferings, as well as other men and women in the course of our human history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what hamas had done makes a mockery of the efforts of the good prophet! Killing of innocents is an abomination. Who gives the right for Hamas or any muslim to declare religious war?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The caliphate is the only form of governance that has full approval in traditional Islamic theology,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Caliphate ended in 1924. There were no more successors, in the bloodline sense, to the prophet even long before Umar, the successor to Abu Bakr who took over from the prophet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So who is the Caliph today, the 'Commander of All Believers?" - Osama Bin Laden? Did religious leaders accept him? Is this killer and mass murderer of innocents, the commander of all believers you would follow?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This animal is no where in the class of the good prophet, who faced his enemies while doing battle. Osama and his gang of leaders are more like the  tribal arab cowards the good prophet conquered in the 6th Century.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These cowards are like little girls hiding behind their mom skirts, and enjoying luxury in the mountains while fools fight and die on their behalf, as well as believers whom are placed in the line of fire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the animal you wish to follow?</p>

              <p>Jojobeach,</p>
              <p>I would like to pose you a question: Is your reply an intended rebut or just a docile assumption that I advocate and espouse terrorism?</p>
              <p>I'll begin by asserting, which I have done numerous time provided you read my previous writings that I never condone attacks on civilians, whether they may be Palestinian, Israeli, Myamarese or anoone for that matter. But if you have contemplated the false assumption that I advocate Hamas attacks on innocent Israelis, let me reiterate that I do not.</p>
              <p>May I ask you whether my highlighting of Israeli terrorism past and presents a certain perception which tantamounts to approval of Hamas attacking innocent Israeli civilians?</p>
              <p>There were certain witnesses, a couple to be exact, who witnessed Hamas fighters firing from areas nearby the school. However, others' account contradict this report. The U.N has neither confirmed nor falsify this allegations. </p>
              <p>Many more Palestinians report harrassment by the Zionist entity.</p>
              <p>The fact is anyone will retaliate when being attacked so your point is an irrelevent one.</p>
              <p>The Arab peace Initiative that Israel return to its pre-1967 boundaries in return for normalization of relations with all 57 Muslim countries has been unanimously supported by all Muslim nations as well as Hamas and Hizbullah. This may just stop the chain reaction. However, the chain reaction will stop in the event that the Israeli elites discard their Zionist mentality espousing God given rights and claims and such.</p>
              <p>Firstly, Egypt patrol guards close the border without attacking Gazas on the Palestinian side. Moreover, the Rafah crossing blockade is enacted by a new agreement between the Israelis and Egyptians. Meaning that in the event of Egypt opening the borders would tantamount to a breach of the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Gazans know that the Eyptian elites will be punished by their own electorate and they have no means to fight a war on two fronts.</p>
              <p>I appreciate if you would like to discuss this conflict with me, do it in an amicable manner instead of juxtaposing your discussions with emotional arguments. We are all civilized people.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Several misconceptions pertaining this conflict exists due to
              our staple consumption of American reporting primarily from the
              Israeli perspective. Let us give some consideration and thought to
              alternative sources for subscribing to a single source of
              perspective on an issue tends to espouse narrow mindedness in our
              views and consequently, discussions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. <em>Hamas initiated this conflict by firing rockets due to
              Israel's blockade of Gazas borders.</em></p>
              <p>Skirmishes occured even during the relativly calm period of
              truce between both parties. Hamas did consider an extention of the
              truce but turned its back when 3 of its personnel were killed by
              the IDF which accused them of planting explosives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. <em>Israel's killings of innocent civilians in Gaza is not
              intented but by accident as well as Hamas is
              deliberately exploiting its civilians as human
              shields.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Several reports coming within Gaza, instead of those
              reported by Israeli-aligned media operating from Israeli cities,
              affirm that Israel attacks Palestinian civilians on intent.
              The most publicised and blatant is the bombing of U.N school which
              has been accused by Zionist Israel of sheltering Hamas fighters.
              This accusation has been vehemently refuted by John Ging, the head
              of the U.N relief agency. Whist the Israeli have contradictorily
              reported receiving motar fire "from within" the school.
              However, recent statement released from the Israeli altered its
              statement of receiving motar fire "from" the school. U.N has
              challenged Israel to produce proof of its accusation. Not a single
              school but three U.N schools. Israeli defence of its innocence in
              this matter is objectively questionable.</p>
              <p>3. <em>Hamas associated with terrorism per
              se</em>.</p>
              <p>Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S and E.U
              and Japan. However, several nations maintain contact with Hamas,
              notably Norway and only its armed wing is listed as terrorist
              organization by Australia and E.U.</p>
              <p>We have to analyze the sequence of events leading to the current
              conflict as every middle-eastern conflict is a consequence of chain
              reactions.</p>
              <p>Israel's founding roots was etched in similar realms of
              terrorism. Irgun, a Jewish terrorist group killed 91 people, most
              British Officials when they planted a bomb in King David Hotel. The
              acts of terrorism of the Jews formed the founding roots of its
              state. The Deir Yassin massacre and the assasination of Lord
              Moyle, one of U.N peace envoy. The leaders of these
              Jewish terrorist groups went to become Israel's prime and foreign
              ministers. Hamas may be taking a leaf from the Zionist book.</p>
              <p>4. <em>Israel does not impede the flow of humanitarian
              aid into Gaza</em>.</p>
              <p>Israel has turned down repeatedly appeals from the world
              community to allow basic neccesities into impoverished Gaza and
              impeded the flow of necessity aids into Gaza. The boat delivering
              humanitarian supplies, the Dignity was not allowed to reach Gaza
              and peace activists travelling with the Dignity affirmed that their
              boat was rammed several times by the Israeli Navy although it was
              still in international waters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israeli warmongers are responsible for numerous war crimes and
              this most recent adds on the their long list. Most notably, Ariel
              Sharon is wanted by the Hague Tribunal for his malice of the Sabra
              and Shatilla carnage of Lebanon. He avoids from travelling to
              Belgium for fear of being arrested.</p>
              <p>I hope that Israeli citizens be pragmatic and sensible to
              elect leftists and doves in their coming elections who are in
              favour of peace and stability. </p>

              <p>I think most of the points except the last one is really debateable depending on the kind of sources you're looking at.</p>
              <p>1.  The Israeli's claim that they were under fire form Hamas rockets which constitutes breaking of the truce.  While its true that there were skirmishes throughout the "calm" periods, but shooting rockets is a pretty high-profile and overt action that requires Israeli government to act on. Skirmishes between Hamas fighters and IDF troops may be quite a norm, but that's not as hard to suppress or account to the Israeli public when compared to Rocket and Mortar attacks. </p>
              <p>2.  I've been following the images of Israeli strikes on the so called civilian infrastructure.  I've seen their targeting pod images and Bomb Damage Assessments.  Judging from the images displayed, there were significant amount of secondary explosions indicating high-explosives to be present in those facilities.  And I'm not taking about gas tanks kind, but stuff you see in missiles, bombs and materials used to construct them.  Civilian infrastructure were indeed used to manufacture if not store such weapons, and the Israelis have to be credited for their precise intelligence in order to strike such facilities. </p>
              <p>However, as you can imagine, by storing and staging attacks from civilian facilities, can you truly blame the Israelis for accidentally striking those that were not used by Hamas?  If anything, Hamas has to be blamed for utilizing civilian infrastructure in the first place. </p>
              <p>3. <a href="http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/nationalsecurity.nsf/Page/What_Governments_are_doing_Listing_of_Terrorism_Organisations_Hamas'">http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/nationalsecurity.nsf/Page/What_Governments_are_doing_Listing_of_Terrorism_Organisations_Hamas'</a></p>
              <p>Its kinda like a half-empty vs half-full argument you have there.  Hamas' military wing comes under Hamas political leadership.  Unless the Hamas leadership severs its ties with its military wing, claiming no responsibility for all the actions its military wing conducts, perhaps the argument that Hamas is not terrorist organization may stand flimsily.  However, Hamas leadership continues to direct the operations of its military wing in providing targeting information for its rocket and mortar attacks on Israel.  Sorry to say, but the ordinary Hamas fighter popping of rockets and mortar would probably not have the intelligence level to figure out where to shoot on their own. </p>
              <p>4.  I fully agree with you that Israel needs to do more to allow humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza.  It is already sad that civilians, women and children are being caught in the crossfire and that more should be done to allow medical, food and water supplies to reach them.  </p>
              <p>However, the ball is not entirely in Israel's court.  Hamas can unilaterally surrender, turning over all personnel and arms over to the IDF, and request for international peacekeepers to enter Gaza.   That would instaneously end the situation in Gaza.  Yet, against an overwhelming opponent, they are not doing so. </p>
              <p>Israel indeed was a state that had its roots in terrorism with all its less than glorious history.  However, that is a judgement best reserved for historical debates rather than the discussion on the present situation.  Israel today is a sovereign and democratic nation.  It is fully within the sovereignty of any nation to defend itself against attacks on its cities and citizens. Any acting government has the obligation to provide defense to its citizens.  As a Political Scientist, I think you should have an even clearer understanding. </p>

              can unilaterally surrender, turning over all personnel and arms
              over to the IDF, and request for international peacekeepers to
              enter Gaza.   That would instaneously end the situation in
              Gaza.  Yet, against an overwhelming opponent, they are not
              doing so. </p>
              <p>Israel indeed was a state that had its roots in terrorism with
              all its less than glorious history.  However, that is a
              judgement best reserved for historical debates rather than the
              discussion on the present situation.  Israel today is a
              sovereign and democratic nation.  It is fully within the
              sovereignty of any nation to defend itself against attacks on its
              cities and citizens. Any acting government has the obligation to
              provide defense to its citizens.  As a Political Scientist, I
              think you should have an even clearer understanding. </p>

              <p>1. So are you saying it is justified for Hamas to kill innocent
              Israeli <strong>civilians</strong> with their rockets when 3 of
              their <strong>military</strong> personnel got killed ?And what were
              their personnel doing in Israel in the first place ????</p>
              <p>2. According to <strong>Palestinian</strong> witnesses...
              militants are firing rockets near the school.. and Palestinians
              admits that they had been harrassed by Hamas. Is this not true
              ?</p>
              <p>If Singapore dares to fire some rockets into JB, do you think
              Malaysia will not retaliate too ?</p>
              <p>3. Ok.. So when will the chain reaction stop ?When will the
              Palestinian move beyond history ?</p>
              <p>4. Gaza is not smack right in the middle of Israel. Their
              neighbour Egypt is predominantly Muslim. Why is the Egyptian border
              closed to Gaza ?   Why Hamas don't fire rockets at Egypt
              ??? How come only punish Israel ?</p>

              Personally for me, only 2 kinds of people will say Israel is harbouring some kind of evil intentions, or hidden propagandas, if you will. And they will say Hamas is the poor poor state being oppressed.
              
              1 - Muslims who are so biased in their reasonings and hatred towards anything un-Islamic.
              
              2 - People who are just being plain "sympathetic" (I admire sympathetic people, really). They see sufferings and without going through any thought-proccessing, condemns the so-called "oppressing" Israel.
              
              You guys will be surprised how many human beings who has almost no common sense there are out there. I'm quite surprised there are so many anti-Israel people in Singapore.

              <p>Shotgun,</p>
              <p>I appreciate your proportionately rational response.</p>
              <p>The initiation lead to this conflict has been heard from either the side of Hamas or the side of the Israeli. Of course, we all have heard conflicting accounts from various other sources. However, the well-oiled Israeli PR machine has greatly influenced the masses that Hamas primarily fired rockets into Israel due to an 85% blockade of its borders. This present conflict is mearly an magnified reflection of the skirmishes occuring during the ceasefire. Thus it is not wise to debate who started this round of conflict because blames are being put onto Hamas, Israel and even the U.N as this is as futile as arguing who should initiate an end to the conflict and initiate the proceed towards the negotiating table. But we all agree it should. Sources leaning towards the Palestinians would verify that Israel initiate the conflict whilst sources biased towards Israel would justify the conflict was started by Hamas. An independent body could analyse and verily these conflicting claims, although I do not see any tangible benefit coming from this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similarly, I have been keeping tabs on Israeli targeting pods and bomb assessments. But note, the IDF do not release every assessment. Of course, you would have to be a trained military analyst in order to accurately assess those slides provided by the IDF. I do not refute the claim that Hamas do hide stockpiles in civilian infrastructure. Gaza is a poorly planned conglomerate of shabby towns and villages and it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. However, not every civilian death in Gaza is due to the allegation that Hamas fighters are "hiding behind human shields." This is a journalistic figure of speech intended to deflect any nuances of the occurance of Israeli strikes killing innocent civilians. But it is hard to nonchalantly dismiss reports that civilian deaths in Gaza is due to intended Israeli targetting.</p>
              <p>I think we all have to accept the fact that Hamas is the elected, legitimate government of the Palestinians. This created a massive dillema for the West, torn between its espousal and acceptance of  democratically elected governments which it has labelled a terrorist organization as well. We have to take into consideration that the implication of the organization by the E.U and U.S is not shared by all. It is impossible to adopt the view taken by some or even the majority and superimpose it on the will and minds of the rest of the world. </p>
              <p>I am not too sure of the efficacy of military directions and decisions obtained by the upper echelons of the Hamas organizational structure. Even if they did receive 'intelligence' by their superiors, I do not think it would make any difference in the destination of their homemade rockets. Well, Hamas rockets, FYI, are terribly inaccurate.</p>
              <p>I totally agree that the ball is not unilaterally in Israel's court. However, the course of action taken by them reflects unilateralism. Let's not forget what are several causations to this war. The coming national elections, the intermission of the U.S administration and to repair its bruised pride from the debacle of its 2006 war with Hizbullah. Your assertion leads to the chicken and egg question. Who should put their weapons down first? Truthfully both would not. It is a matter of pride above all else.</p>
              <p>It is difficult to engage in a coherent discussion on this matter with an absolute detachment from past events which heavily influence the current. Israel is a sovereign and democratic state. However, Israel has repeated, as in the past, in arrogant defiance, broken international laws and its actions have constantly defined the Geneva Convention as affirmed by Amnesty International and alleged by UNRWA which demands an official inquiry. Iraq under Saddam as well as Taliban were all legitimate entities of the international system until they were raped of their sovereignty.  Let us not forget again that Hamas is a fellow combatant in this war which derives the same rationale as the Israelis.</p>
              <p>As a political scientist, I am exposed to a wider range of sources and information. Thus, I am writing, in my own personal sphere, of the blatant inconsistencies vis a vis the mainstream ( more specifically, U.S influenced) media and providing a humble attempt at portraying the more accurate and balanced sequence and reasons of events. However, several here accuse my of being an Arab propagandist, a Hamas supporter and similar phrases.</p>
              <p>I arrive to the deduction that championing the sanctity of human lives would label one as an Arab sympathiser since more Palestinian were killed.  </p>

              those in Gaza.</p>
              <p>Are you being neutral, or are you not simply following Hamas'
              rhetoric in condemning and sabotaging President Abbas efforts to

              mindless dishonesty.</p>
              <p>Jimmy Carter is a Bible hugging Pacifist that ignore the

              <p>Hamas may have candidates that won selected seats in the

              <p>It does not have enough seats to form a government.</p>
              <p>If it has the intelligence of selecting candidates - why has
              Hamas failed to have enough candidates that are acceptable
              to the Palestinian population that supported the PLA movement
              now led by President Abbas ?</p>
              <p>Why did nearly half of the Palestinian population move out of
              Gaza on the day that Hamas unlawfully seized political power from
              the legitimately elected government of President Abbas ?</p>
              <p>Why did Hamas forcibly prevent the remaining Palestinian
              population from leaving the Gaza Strip and created a stand-off for
              more then seven days until an Egyptian brokered deal allowed those
              Palestinians to move through Israeli territory into the West Bank
              ?</p>
              <p>Carter is a fool and remain so till this day, with little
              support or respect as an individual even from his own

              else.</p>
              <p> The death toll is largely due to Hamas own efforts to
              sacrifice the lives of the Palestinians to achieve their own
              political agenda.</p>
              <p>What they cannot hope to win militarily, they hope to win by

              <p>Did Israel use thousand pounds or were the bombs approximately

              <p>Even the concrete busting bombs do not have to weigh a thousand

              exagerating ?</p>
              <p>The death toll is uneven due to Hamas wilfull acts of putting
              their own Palestinian lives in danger, but attacking Israel from
              heavily populated areas in the Gaza Strip, by locating their most
              highly prized ammunition storage facilities in the midst of densely
              populated residential and commercial areas, by abusing the
              neutrality of the hospitals and mosques to be used as ammunition
              storage facilities.</p>
              <p> If launching rockets into Israel is despicable, is there
              any need to justify the acts of launching these rockets for

              <p>Make up your mind before you waste your energy to be seen as a
              hypocrite. </p>
              <p>Was mere "verbal rhetoric" the reason for Israel to
              bomb Hamas, or was it the continued firing of rockets and
              motar shells into Israeli towns and terrorising Israeli civilians
              the cause of the retaliatory bombings ?</p>
              <p>Surely you are not so low in the points left to argue your
              way out of a poorly disguised efforts to protect Hamas
              ?  </p>
              <p>Have I indicated any desire to "want to side with Hamas" ?</p>
              <p>If you have dirtied your hands while supporting Hamas, why

              to follow your foolishness ?</p>
              <p> More people have died from Israel's attacks ?</p>
              <p>Or should it have been more Palestinians have died - due to
              the stupidity of Hamas attacks on Israeli civilian targets ?</p>
              <p>Are the Palestinian deaths due to Israeli attacks or due to the
              stupid and suicidal acts of Hamas by attacking Israel with rockets
              and motar shells - when Hamas have no way of protecting
              Palestinian lives from any Israeli counter-attack ?</p>
              <p>Do you even know how the ceasefire was broken on 4 November 2008
              - before attempting to blindly protect Hamas and justify their
              supposedly retaliatory acts of terror against Israel ?</p>
              <p>If Hamas claim that they are the legitimate authority in
              the Gaza, why did they not control the unauthorised firing of
              rockets into Israeli civilian areas during the days before 4
              November 2008 ?</p>
              <p>Why did Hamas not put any efforts to control such unauthorised
              attacks against Israel but had even threatened Israel that Hamas
              will participate in launching rockets into Israel if the ceasefire
              is not renewed after 4 November ?</p>
              <p>If you believe in your own statement that Israel had a right to
              defend itself - why act like a blind hypocrite now ?</p>
              <p> Is CNN the "Global Watch Dog" - or are you so desparate to
              protect Hamas that you will depend on any slim and unsubstantiated
              loose talk for your supposed facts ?</p>
              <p>Why is Hamas claiming that the Palestinians are starving, when
              they have the ability to smuggle rockets into the Gaza strip that
              allowed them to fire a progressively increase quantity of rockets
              with longer ranges than that previously fired ?</p>
              <p>Why claim that the hospitals are lacking in medicine when there
              do not seem to be a drop in the quantity or quality of rockets
              fired into Israel ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a surprise for Israel to attack these tunnels that are
              dug under the Palestinian homes, with main entrances and storage
              facilities hidden inside innocent looking Palestinian homes ?</p>
              <p> Your efforts at staying neutral would be better served
              with some honesty in declaring your outright support for Hamas,
              which is already clearly seen by your definitive efforts in

              fundamental religious psychic as well - you might as well stop
              pretending to know anything about the politics in the
              Middle-east.</p>
              <p>Do you know what you want to say that you wish you will want
              to say ?</p>
              <p>Firstly, you must be truly naive if you believe that being
              equipped with modern weapons alone will make your armed forces
              modern.</p>
              <p>Secondly, how much do you know about the level of
              integration of the various systems and weapon platforms owned by
              the various arms of the respective military forces in each
              the country that you wish to compare ? </p>
              <p>Thirdly, do you have the ability to understand the level of
              sophistication in the types of technology owned and operated by the
              types of personnel that are available in the respective military
              forces of each country ?</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten your efforts with the Vietcong analogy ?</p>
              <p>Have you now decided to abandon the success of the Vietcong
              against the almighty war machine of the USA ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that Israel will allow the same to be repeated by a
              rag-tag army - no matter the size or the level of sophistication
              ?</p>
              <p>A threat remains a threat, and is assessed for its threat
              level in the rhetoric, evaluating such rhetoric to the
              resources available to move rhetoric into action, and also
              considering the determination of the messenger or messengers of
              such rhetoric to carryout their verbal abuses to the ultimate
              end.</p>
              <p>Are you expecting Israel to lie low, do nothing militarily or
              politically - and allow Hamas to fester into a formidable
              force ?</p>
              <p>Narrow mind ?</p>
              <p>How wide do you want to open your mind by foolishly
              absorbing all materials in some totally undiscerning ways that
              allow your mental faculties to be awed by propaganda, influenced by
              emotional coloring, and cleverly manipulated by others to
              achieve their own political agenda ?</p>
              <p>If there is oil and gas in the Gaza - why are the Oil Companies
              not rushing in to sign up contractural papers with the Hamas
              leadership ?</p>
              <p>If there is so much oil and gas in the Gaza, why will Hamas risk
              it all by firing rockets into Israel and provoking Israeli airforce
              to bomb the oil and gas fields ?</p>
              <p>If the Gaza Strip is so densely populated and tight in
              living space for the Palestinians - where do you expect the
              Palestinians to move - so as to make way for the European and
              American Oil Companies?</p>
              <p>Where are the Oil Companies ?</p>
              <p>Why are they not rushing into the Gaza ?</p>

              <p>I know that Hamas was founded to destroy Israel. No one is denying that. Neither am I denying that Hamas' rockets have killed people. I can agree with everything you say, but cant you realise that Israel is killing more people than Hamas? The death toll already speaks for itself.</p>
              <p>Do you see the mental twisting which you engage in when you state that the 500+ Palestinians that have died are killed not by Israel, but by Hamas? <strong>Hamas provoked Israel to retaliate, yet it is Israel that is doing the actual killing</strong>. Because you, and many others are just siding with one group of terrorists, and overlooking the actions of the other group of terrorists is something I take issue with. Its like taking sides when the US invades Iraq. The US has a rich history of sponsoring terrorism to destabilise nationalistic governments in favour of corrupt dictators. Saddam is a US-propped dictator who has oppressed the Kurds. In cases like this, its a waste of time to side with either one because both are anti-human scum.</p>
              <p>By the way, I dont understand what you mean by "succumbing to propaganda" when propaganda just refers to an organised effort to promote a particular belief. Everything that we hear is propaganda. If you want to accuse me of lying or putting out misinformation, then say so.</p>
              <p>I dont know why all the oil companies arent rushing to Gaza right now, when Israel is engaging in shock and awe. But would Israel ever let a Hamas-run government to control and benefit from the oil and natural gas? I dont think so. If you cant have it, no one can.</p>

              <p>To me, simply said. There is no such thing as a proportionate response to terrorism. The logic of an eye for an eye is flawed. If you are a father and an armed man comes and tries to kill your daughter. Do you call the police and say, "Please hurry! But send only ONE officer!" Obviously not. You'll ask them to send the whole force. Whether Hamas is a legitimate government, a terrorist organisation or a regime that has executed a coup on Fatah, depends on your own view. Mine is well clear. </p>
              <p>Having said that, it is really terrible to have loss of civilian lives on both sides. Hopefully the ceasefire will come soon. War should be the last resort and avoided at all costs no matter what.</p>
              <p>However, Hamas (as with the majority of these groups worldwide) are damn hypocritical. They can lob rockets at Israeli civilians, use their own and human shields and bombers while being the first to whine to the world when their own civilians are hit. War is ugly for civilians both sides and if they want to avoid, why spend the last two years firing rockets at random targets in the first place hoping it will land in populated areas? I wonder where they get their rockets from hmm.. ebay?</p>
              <p>Now the question is: Which side started it? Did the chicken come before the egg? They've been fighting since biblical times so God bless the new us president as he tries to make peace.</p>
