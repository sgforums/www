              <p><br>Please do not attempt to pull wool over people's eyes, least you get suspected of being a terrorist Hamas plant. Why the deliberate leaving out of actual statements and reports? Hamas is a terrorist organisation dedicated to death of innocents and a slur to faithful muslims around the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On 8 February 2006, Hamas head Khaled Mashal speaking in Cairo had clarified that "Anyone who thinks Hamas will change is wrong", stating that Hamas would "possibly" agree to a ceasefire with Israel if it withdrew from the lands conquered in 1967.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, in remarks released on the same day he stated that Hamas would not impede other Palestinian groups from carrying out armed "resistance" against Israel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Steven Erlanger of the New York Times, Hamas excludes the possibility of long-term reconciliation with Israel. "Since the Prophet Muhammad made a temporary hudna, or truce, with the Jews about 1,400 years ago, Hamas allows the idea. But no one in Hamas says he would make a peace treaty with Israel or permanently give up any part of Palestine.".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mkhaimer Abusada, a political scientist at Al Azhar University explains that “They (Hamas) talk of hudna, not of peace or reconciliation with Israel. They believe over time they will be strong enough to liberate all historic Palestine.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas' charter calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I call for an immediate ceasefire on BOTH sides. Innocents are dying as this moment on BOTH sides!</p>

              <p>This sort of questions rarely get asked by the media so i'm
              gonna ask them here.</p>
              <p>Though they are given Gaza strip and West bank to self govern,
              are they given proper access to food, electricity, clean water,
              medical care and sanitary facilities? Are they hindered in any way
              to obtain the infrastructure for such things?</p>
              <p>If they aren't, why do they need to dig tunnels to Egypt to get
              supplies?</p>
              <p>They have Gaza strip and West Bank but if they're being isolated
              you might as well put them on an abandoned island.</p>
              <p>I ask this because i've read a lot of articles of Palestinians

              <p><strong>Disinformation, secrecy and lies: How the Gaza offensive came about </strong></p>
              <p>By <a class="tUbl2" href="mailto:barakravid80@gmail.com">Barak Ravid</a>, Haaretz Correspondent</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050426.html">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050426.html</a></p>
              <p><span class="t13">Long-term preparation, careful gathering of
                  information, secret discussions, operational deception and the
                  misleading of the public - all these stood behind the Israel Defense
                  Forces "Cast Lead" operation against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip,
                  which began Saturday morning. <br> <br>The disinformation effort, according to defense officials, took
                  Hamas by surprise and <strong>served to significantly increase the number of
                  its casualties in the strike. </strong><br> <br>Sources in the defense establishment said <strong>Defense Minister Ehud
                  Barak instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the operation
                  over six months ago, even as Israel was beginning to negotiate a
                  ceasefire agreement with Hamas.</strong> According to the sources, Barak
                  maintained that although the lull would allow Hamas to prepare for a
                  showdown with Israel, the Israeli army needed time to prepare, as well. </span></p>
              <p><span class="t13">Barak gave orders to carry out a comprehensive
                  intelligence-gathering drive which sought to map out Hamas' security
                  infrastructure, along with that of other militant organizations
                  operating in the Strip.
                  <br> <br>This intelligence-gathering effort brought back information about
                  permanent bases, weapon silos, training camps, the homes of senior
                  officials and coordinates for other facilities.
                  <br> <br>The plan of action that was implemented in Operation Cast Lead
                  remained only a blueprint until a month ago, when tensions soared after
                  the IDF carried out an incursion into Gaza during the ceasefire to take
                  out a tunnel which the army said was intended to facilitate an attack
                  by Palestinian militants on IDF troops.
                  <br> <br>On November 19, following dozens of Qassam rockets and mortar
                  rounds which exploded on Israeli soil, the plan was brought for Barak's
                  final approval. Last Thursday, on December 18, Prime Minister Ehud
                  Olmert and the defense minister met at IDF headquarters in central Tel
                  Aviv to approve the operation.
                  <br> <br>However, they decided to put the mission on hold to see whether
                  Hamas would hold its fire after the expiration of the ceasefire. They
                  therefore put off bringing the plan for the cabinet's approval, but
                  they did inform Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of the developments.
                  <br> <br>That night, in speaking to the media, sources in the Prime
                  Minister's Bureau said that "if the shooting from Gaza continues, the
                  showdown with Hamas would be inevitable." On the weekend, several
                  ministers in Olmert's cabinet inveighed against him and against Barak
                  for not retaliating for Hamas' Qassam launches.
                  <br> <br>"This chatter would have made Entebe or the Six Day War
                  impossible," Barak said in responding to the accusations. The cabinet
                  was eventually convened on Wednesday, but the Prime Minister's Bureau
                  misinformed the media in stating the discussion would revolve around
                  global jihad. The ministers learned only that morning that the
                  discussion would actually pertain to the operation in Gaza.
                  <br> <br>In its summary announcement for the discussion, the Prime
                  Minister's Bureau devoted one line to the situation in Gaza, compared
                  to one whole page that concerned the outlawing of 35 Islamic
                  organizations.
                  <br> <br>What actually went on at the cabinet meeting was a five-hour
                  discussion about the operation in which ministers were briefed about
                  the various blueprints and plans of action. "It was a very detailed
                  review," one minister said. <br> <br>The minister added: "Everyone fully understood what sort of period
                  we were heading into and what sort of scenarios this could lead to. No
                  one could say that he or she did not know what they were voting on."
                  The minister also said that the discussion showed that the lessons of
                  the Winograd Committee about the performance of decision-makers during
                  the 2006 Second Lebanon War were "fully internalized."
                  <br> <br>At the end of the discussion, the ministers unanimously voted in
                  favor of the strike, leaving it for the prime minister, the defense
                  minister and the foreign minister to work out the exact time.
                  <br> <br>While Barak was working out the final details with the officers
                  responsible for the operation, Livni went to Cairo to inform Egypt's
                  president, Hosni Mubarak, that Israel had decided to strike at Hamas.
                  <br> <br>In parallel, Israel continued to send out disinformation in
                  announcing it would open the crossings to the Gaza Strip and that
                  Olmert would decide whether to launch the strike following three more
                  deliberations on Sunday - one day after the actual order to launch the
                  operation was issued.
                  <br> <br>"Hamas evacuated all its headquarter personnel after the cabinet
                  meeting on Wednesday," one defense official said, "but the organization
                  sent its people back in when they heard that everything was put on hold
                  until Sunday."
                  <br> <br>The final decision was made on Friday morning, when Barak met with
                  Chief of Staff General Gabi Ashkenazi, the head of the Shin Bet
                  Security Service Yuval Diskin and the head of the Military Intelligence
                  Directorate, Amos Yadlin. Barak sat down with Olmert and Livni several
                  hours later for a final meeting, in which the trio gave the air force
                  its orders.
                  <br> <br>On Friday night and on Saturday morning, opposition leaders and
                  prominent political figures were informed about the impending strike,
                  including Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu, Yisrael Beuiteinu's
                  Avigdor Liebermen, Haim Oron from Meretz and President Shimon Peres,
                  along with Knesset Speaker Dalia Itzik. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/01/israels-strike-on-gaza-a-primer/">Israel’s strike on Gaza: a primer  </a></p>
              <p>2 January 2009</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Israeli-Hamas ceasefire, signed on June 9, 2008, had long been a porous one. While Hamas, for the most part, until November 2008 did not fire its own rockets at Israel, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>it permitted other groups, such as the Iranian-supported Islamic Jihad, to do so</strong></span></span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">These limited rocket attacks</span>, while clear violations of the ceasefire agreement, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not precipitate major Israeli responses</span>, other than periodic limited closures of the border crossings into Gaza, through which Israel supplied food, fuel and other humanitarian aid to Gaza</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether Israel should have allowed any humanitarian aid into Gaza in the face of the rocket fire is a very open question: Israel was in fact in a state of war with Hamas, an organization pledged to destroy it, and the rockets fired at Israel simply underlined Hamas’ long term objective by demonstrating its “resistance” to the Jewish State. Under these circumstances, a full border closure might have brought home to the people of Gaza, the majority of whom voted for Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections, the costs of supporting Hamas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">In any case, fighting between Israel and Hamas intensified in November when Israel found and destroyed a tunnel between Gaza and Israel which the Israeli military thought would be used to kidnap another Israeli soldier, much as Gilad Shalit had been kidnapped in 2006.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ironically, the kidnap attempt was not aimed primarily at Israel, but at the Palestinian rival of Hamas, the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority on the West Bank headed by Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The kidnap attempt appeared timed to occur as Hamas and Fatah were jockeying for position before the start of what proved to be abortive Palestinian unity talks in Cairo. Had Hamas been successful in capturing another Israeli soldier, it would have shown that Hamas was demonstrating greater “resistance” against Israel than Fatah, which had been engaged in fruitless peace talks with Israel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following the Israeli attack on the tunnel, the number of rockets fired at Israel from Gaza escalated, reaching a new high after Hamas announced it would not extend the ceasefire unless Israel fully opened the border crossings and stopped arresting members of Hamas living on the West Bank—the latter demand not included in the original ceasefire agreement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Israel refused to agree to the new Hamas demands, Hamas further escalated its firing of rockets, hoping, apparently, to force Israel to accept the new ceasefire terms in return for restoring quiet to southern Israel. Hamas may have also believed that Israel’s ruling Kadima party desperately needed a ceasefire so as to remove the issue of the rocket firing from the ongoing Israeli election campaign. It had been Kadima that had undertaken the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, and presumably it did not want to remind the Israeli electorate that the withdrawal had resulted in the firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel.</p>

              <p><strong>Backed by the U.S.: Israel Unleashes a Massacre in Gaza</strong></p>
              <p>by  Larry  Everest</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11578">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11578</a></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Israeli and U.S. government officials, as well as the U.S. media, claim
                  that Israel’s attack was provoked by rocket attacks by the Palestinian
                  Islamist group Hamas (that controls Gaza) into Israel. The Bush regime
                  called Hamas “thugs,” blaming Hamas for provoking Israel and demanding
                  it end its rocket attacks—while pointedly refusing to call on Israel to
                  stop its assault.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>This step-by-step campaign of ethnic cleansing began with violently
                  driving some 750,000 Palestinians from their lands during the 1947-48
                  Arab-Israeli war; the destruction of hundreds of conquered Palestinian
                  villages; the military conquest of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967
                  war; the illegal colonialization of these “occupied territories"
                  afterward, coupled with a steady assault on Palestinian economy and
                  society. Israel claimed each assault was simply a response to
                  Palestinian “terror,” or refusal to make peace; while each Israeli
                  assault furthered its strategic objectives of destroying Palestine.<br><br>Most
                  of Gaza’s 1.5 million Palestinians were forced from their homes in
                  other parts of Palestine during the establishment of Israel. <strong>From 1967
                  until 2005, Israel militarily occupied Gaza. After ending the
                  occupation, Israel kept complete control of this desert strip’s land,
                  sea and air borders. Israel sent armored bulldozers to destroy Gaza’s
                  fruit orchards, blockaded the fishing port, cut off supplies to
                  factories and other businesses, and forbid most Gaza residents the
                  right to work elsewhere or even leave. Gaza today is a humanitarian
                  crisis, its population living in prison-like conditions.</strong><br><br>Hamas—which
                  governs Gaza—is not about liberating Palestine as a secular state free
                  of imperialist domination; it represents forces that would restructure
                  the oppressive relations that enslave the people of Palestine within an
                  Islamic theocratic framework.<br><br>Hamas has repeatedly proposed
                  long-term truces with Israel and offered to negotiate a permanent truce
                  in order to lift the siege of Gaza. <strong>A truce was finally agreed upon in
                  June 2008, under which Hamas agreed to stop missile attacks, and Israel
                  was supposed to end its blockade of Gaza.</strong> According to the pro-Israel
                  New York Times, Hamas was "largely successful" in stopping the launches
                  of the Qassam missiles, some of which are carried out by groups other
                  than Hamas. But Israel refused to ease its blockade. <strong>Then, on November
                  4, Israel launched an attack that killed six Palestinians. The next
                  day, it sealed all Gaza’s borders, intensifying what had already been a
                  horrific situation for the people.</strong><br><br>Israel’s siege has turned
                  Gaza into the world’s largest open-air concentration camp—its
                  impoverished inhabitants are being starved and subject to indescribable
                  suffering. <strong>80% live below the poverty line. About 97% of factories and
                  workshops cannot operate. Gaza’s industrial zone is completely closed.
                  Unemployment is about 50%. In 2006 Israel bombed Gaza's only power
                  plant, making Gaza dependent on power supplies from Israel and Egypt.
                  Fresh drinking water is often not available for days at a time.
                  Irregular power means that sewage treatment plants cannot function and
                  that raw sewage gets dumped into the Mediterranean. Medicines are in
                  short supply, and Israeli bans on travel mean that Palestinians seeking
                  advanced medical care that is not available in Gaza are left to die.</strong> (For more on the state of Gaza under siege, see the article from A
                  World to Win News Service, "Gaza: Tottering on the Brink," in
                  Revolution #150, available online at revcom.us)<br><br>In light of all
                  this, the claims by Israel and the U.S. that the current bloody
                  invasion is a “response” to small-scale and largely ineffective rocket
                  attacks on Israel from Gaza are obscene. They are like the method the
                  U.S. used to justify the genocide of Native Americans by settlers and
                  the military: according to the official narrative, that story “began”
                  with claims of the first Native American scalping of some settler
                  family or soldier—and then anything goes to “respond” to what is
                  declared an atrocity. What came before—what provoked the scalping, the
                  genocidal lies and brutality visited upon the indigenous peoples, and
                  America’s actual agenda of forcible conquest and colonialization—all
                  this is ignored and covered up.<br><br>Even by its own terms, Israel’s
                  longstanding policies of near-starvation, and the current massive reign
                  of death from the air are <strong>violations of international law</strong>—serving as
                  “collective punishment” against the entire population of Gaza. This
                  collective punishment of all Gaza residents is contrary to the Fourth
                  Geneva Convention and is illegal under international law. Article 55 of
                  the Fourth Geneva Convention, for example, states that "to the fullest
                  extent of the means available to it, <strong>the Occupying Power has the duty
                  of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population; it should,
                  in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and
                  other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are
                  inadequate."</strong><br><br>Israel has
                  served as U.S. imperialism’s unsinkable aircraft carrier and regional
                  enforcer in the Middle East for decades, and the U.S. has been Israel’s
                  staunchest backer, <strong>providing it with billions of dollars a year in aid</strong>.
                  And, with the “war on terror”—in reality a war for empire—Israel’s
                  strategic relationship with the U.S. has become even more pivotal.<br><br>According
                  to the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, in addition to
                  supplying the F16 fighter jets and the missiles used in Israel’s recent
                  attack, the U.S. transferred more than $200 million worth of spare
                  parts for Israel’s fleet of F16's between 2001-2006. “In July 2008, the
                  United States gave Israel 186 million gallons of JP-8 aviation jet
                  fuel. Last year, the United States signed a $1.3 billion contract with
                  Raytheon to transfer to Israel thousands of TOW, Hellfire, and ‘bunker
                  buster’ missiles.” And according to U.S. government officials, the U.S.
                  was fully informed ahead of time of Israeli plans and apparently gave
                  them a green light.<br><br>In short, Israel’s massacre and its ongoing
                  crimes against the people of Gaza could not have happened without U.S.
                  support—and people living in the U.S. have the responsibility to oppose
                  the crimes of “our” government. Protests have erupted across the Middle
                  East, and there have also been protests (with more planned) in the U.S.
                  and Europe.<br><br>There needs to be massive, visible political
                  opposition to the U.S.-sponsored assault on Gaza, here, and now.
                  Silence and acquiescence to these crimes in any form is complicity. The
                  world needs to see that within the U.S., there are people who are not
                  going along with the crimes being sponsored by their government.</p>

              <p><br>Comparing the present Gaza strip to the Warsaw Ghetto of the 1940s will take a leap of speculative imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the 1940s, the Warsaw Ghetto was purposefully built by the Nazis to isolate the Jewish community as part of a FINAL SOLUTION to exterminate German CITIZENS of Jewish descent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gaza Strip was governed by an ELECTED HAMAS government that decided to unilaterally evict themselves from the Palestinian "Central" Government, and UNILATERALLY declared themselves a separate entity from the West Bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The HAMAS government continued to allow itself to be used as a proxy of Iran, and execute the Iranian determined destruction of the State of Israel by all means.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The present condition - that the residents of the Gaza Strip have now found themselves in - was self-imposed when they did not reject the HAMAS-Iranian agenda but embraced it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was Israel singularly responsible to wall the residents into the Gaza Strip, or have the Egyptians also similarly been alarmed by the HAMAS-Iranian agenda - when the Gaza Strip share a common border with the Egyptian Sinai Peninsular, and the Egyptian has similarly restricted border crossings ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The economic situation and living condition in the Gaza Strip is brought about by the Palestinians residents themselves in their continued stupidity in supporting the HAMAS-Iranian agenda, instead of working as a unified community to confront Israel based on their own Palestinian Agenda.</p>

              <p>Another long winded opinionated piece, ignoring facts,  from a site of no accountability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you here to discuss solutions or lay blame on everyone else, and become a tool of terrorists propaganda?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The facts are:-</p>
              <p>1. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It broke the truce by Egypt and fired missiles into Israel urban centres with intention to murder innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Israel, which any other nation would have retaliated before even the 2nd missile landed, had restrain themselves when faced such oppression with more than 200 missiles daily for months. No one called for a halt in hama's agression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Israel realized they are alone, and retaliated last week, as any nation would to prevent further dead in their homeland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever happened 1400 years ago, who was right or who was right, what was conspired, is immaterial. The fact is that the carnage is now happening, and death of innocents are happening on BOTH sides which must end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas, a terrorist organisation dedicated to the death of innocents to achieve their national agenda, recieves sympathies, funds and recruits from faithful muslims thru a misinterpretation on their holy book.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faithful muslims around the world assured the human race that they condemn terrorism and terrorists acts - killing of innocent men, women and children - done in their religion's name, which is a mis-interpretation of their holy book, no matter the causes, since 911.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore it is time now for the faithful muslims around the world, without any excuses, must honour their words -  to condemn the factual terrorists acts conducted by Hamas, whom slay innocent people in Israel thru their daily missile barrage, as well as now hiding amongst the civilian population ensuring more innocents die in facing Israel's wrath.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The muslims must condemn the atrocities of Hamas, capture their terrorists and turn them over to the authorities, and place more effort to correct the misinterpretation of their holy book so that no more muslims be misled or used by evil men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrritorial claims can be civiliy discussed, but not by piling innocents dead in the meeting room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am under no illusion that my written word here will have any effect or even read by anyone, but hope is like a droplet of water into the ocean which will affect the tide, and when more considers my post, it will be a Tsunami of change that will help our fellow humans in the middle east.</p>

              <p>Another long winded opinionated piece, ignoring facts,  from a site of no accountability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you here to discuss solutions or lay blame on everyone else, and become a tool of terrorists propaganda?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The facts are:-</p>
              <p>1. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. It broke the truce by Egypt and fired missiles into Israel urban centres with intention to murder innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Israel, which any other nation would have retaliated before even the 2nd missile landed, had restrain themselves when faced such oppression with more than 200 missiles daily for months. No one called for a halt in hama's agression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Israel realized they are alone, and retaliated last week, as any nation would to prevent further dead in their homeland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever happened 1400 years ago, who was right or who was right, what was conspired, is immaterial. The fact is that the carnage is now happening, and death of innocents are happening on BOTH sides which must end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas, a terrorist organisation dedicated to the death of innocents to achieve their national agenda, recieves sympathies, funds and recruits from faithful muslims thru a misinterpretation on their holy book.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faithful muslims around the world assured the human race that they condemn terrorism and terrorists acts - killing of innocent men, women and children - done in their religion's name, which is a mis-interpretation of their holy book, no matter the causes, since 911.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore it is time now for the faithful muslims around the world, without any excuses, must honour their words -  to condemn the factual terrorists acts conducted by Hamas, whom slay innocent people in Israel thru their daily missile barrage, as well as now hiding amongst the civilian population ensuring more innocents die in facing Israel's wrath.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The muslims must condemn the atrocities of Hamas, capture their terrorists and turn them over to the authorities, and place more effort to correct the misinterpretation of their holy book so that no more muslims be misled or used by evil men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrritorial claims can be civiliy discussed, but not by piling innocents dead in the meeting room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am under no illusion that my written word here will have any effect or even read by anyone, but hope is like a droplet of water into the ocean which will affect the tide, and when more considers my post, it will be a Tsunami of change that will help our fellow humans in the middle east.</p>

              <p>1. Israel kills civilians without batting much of an eyelid too. And they kill many more.</p>
              <p>2. I don't think "occasional" ROCKET (not missile) strikes during the ceasefire or even during the ending of the ceasefire would somehow amount to 200 a day.</p>
              <p>3. Israel retaliated......if retaliation meant bring misery to the whole Gaza strip and destroying the homes of people, and the lives of many others.</p>
