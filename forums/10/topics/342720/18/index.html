              <p>JERUSALEM (AFP) â€” The Israeli army on Monday insisted all weapons being
                  used in its Gaza war were within the bounds of international law amid
                  accusations it was using white phosphorus and other deadly munitions.<br> <br> <strong>Medics in Gaza say they have treated more than 50 people suffering
                  burns caused by controversial white phosphorus shells, a claim backed
                  up by a report of the New York-based Human Rights Watch.</strong><br> <br> And two Norwegian doctors, recently returned from working in the Gaza
                  Strip, accused Israel of using the territory as a testing ground for a
                  new "extremely nasty" type of explosive.<br> <br> An army spokesman refused to confirm or deny claims it was using white
                  phosphorus, saying: "All weapons used by the IDF (Israel Defence
                  Forces) are in accordance with international law.<br> <br> <strong>"We are only using what is being used by other Western armies -- we are not using anything out of the ordinary," he said.</strong><br> <br> The controversy surrounding the nature of weapons being used by the
                  Israeli army stepped up a notch on Monday when the two medics said they
                  had seen clear signs that DIME explosives, a new experimental kind of
                  weapon, were being used in Gaza.<br> <br> According to Mads Gilbert, the two had seen evidence of a number of
                  "very brutal amputations... without shrapnel injuries" -- injuries
                  which were likely to have been caused by such a weapon.<br> <br> An army spokeswoman said she was "not aware of this type of weapon" and
                  reiterated claims that all weapons used by the military were legal.<br> <br> Mark Regev, spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said Israel was
                  only using legal weapons of the type used by other Western armies.<br> <br> "Israel military forces only use munitions that are acceptable under international law and international convention," he said.<br> <br> "The type of munitions used by Israel are similar, if not identical, to
                  munitions used by other Western democracies, including NATO members."<br> <br> His comments came as Yusef Abu Rish, a doctor at Gaza City's Nasser
                  hospital, said he had treated at least 55 people suffering burns caused
                  by white phosphorus shells.<br> <br> Under international law, white phosphorus is banned for use against
                  civilians, but is permitted if used for creating a smokescreen.<br> <br> Earlier, Human Rights Watch had slammed Israel's use of white
                  phosphorus which it said had been used in areas of Gaza City and the
                  northern district of Jabaliya.<br> <br> "Israel appears to be using white phosphorus as an 'obscurant' (a
                  chemical used to hide military operations), a permissible use in
                  principle under international humanitarian law," HRW said in a
                  statement.<br> <br> <strong>"However, white phosphorus has a significant, incidental, incendiary
                  effect that can severely burn people... The potential for harm to
                  civilians is magnified by Gaza's high population density, among the
                  highest in the world," it said.</strong><br> <br> The group said its researchers in Israel had observed multiple
                  air-bursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus which would spread the
                  chemical over an area between 125 and 250 metres (yards) in diameter.<br> <br> <strong>"Human Rights Watch believes that the use of white phosphorus in
                  densely populated areas of Gaza violates the requirement under
                  international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to
                  avoid civilian injury and loss of life," it said.</strong><br> <br> During Israel's 2006 war against Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, the army
                  was accused of using cluster bombs -- the use of which is banned in
                  civilian areas -- but Israel said they were only being used within the
                  confines of international law.<br> <br> White phosphorus is a toxic chemical agent which can cause severe burns.<br> <br> Dispersed in artillery shells, bombs, and rockets, it burns on contact
                  with oxygen and creates a smokescreen in order to hide the movement of
                  troops. <br> <br> CNN has more details <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/12/white.phosphorus/index.html?eref=ib_topstories">here</a>.</p>

              <p><br>This poetic quote seems terribly romantic but it is aimed to facilitate an uninterrupted territorialÂ expansion of greater israel. At its rate ofÂ illegal territorial expansion, for its neighbours to disarmÂ will be a great god send to the zionists. However, this quote professes double standardsÂ biased towards the Israelis.Â No country in their right mind would disable their miliatry capabilities in view of a belligerent neighbour at its doorstep</p>
              <p>Thus, I would disagree with your statement.Â </p>
              <p>However, you seem to be an ardent supported of Israeli terrorism in full view and knowledge that so many inocent lives have been lost.</p>
              <p>Any support for the Israeli onslaught should be construed as support for terrorism and disregard for innocent lives.</p>

              <p>If you win.. you get to write a letter to tell HAMAS to dissapear from Gaza so the Gazans may have peace. If you lose.. I buy you a jug of beer. Ok ?</p>

              <p>Â Â Â Â Â  I remembered I argued that th initiator of thisÂ cycle of violence isÂ ambigious, a chicken and egg issue.Â However, I would like to shed more light on this matter with relevence from new information obtained from myÂ most recent research on the cause of this recent mindless round of violenceÂ </p>
              <p>Most here assume that Hamas perpertrated this initial cycle of violence. However, Jimmy Carter, former U.S president a several centre-right Israeli think tanks have produced justifications contrary to this Israeli propaganda to justify its massacre of innocent women and children.</p>
              <p>Allow me to quote:</p>
              <p>"The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, whose December 31 report titled "<a href="http://www.rightsidenews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=3157"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Six Months of the Lull Arrangement Intelligence Report</span></span></a>," confirmed that the June 19 truce was only "sporadically violated, and then not by Hamas but instead by ... "rogue terrorist organisations".<br><br>Instead, "the escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement" occurred after Israel killedÂ six Hamas members on November 4 without provocation and then placed the entire Strip under an even more intensive siege the next day."</p>
              <p>Moreover,Â  a joint Tel Aviv- European University study affirms that Israeli terrorism is responsible for ending 79% of all ceasefires with its neighbour compared to 8% by Hamas or other Palestinians "terrorist" groups.</p>
              <p>The Israeli PR machinery realised that this argument is losing credibility thus they have shifted their argument to the 'need' to stop Hamas smuggling of weapons through tunnels from Egypt.</p>
              <p>Historian Avi Shalim of Oxford UniversityÂ asserts that Israel is responsible for breaking this ceasefire. He isÂ among a number of Jewish intellectuals who have repeatedlyÂ claim and denounce Israeli initiation and acts of violence towards the Palestinians. Others include Meisheimer and Stephen Walt. No one is able toÂ accuse these Jews of prejudice as they share the same roots as thoseÂ perpertrating the carnage at this moment. Especially when Professor AviÂ Shalim served "loyally in the IsraeliÂ Air Force" in the mid 1960s.</p>
              <p>The Israeli military and political elite are noÂ less of a terrorist organization than Hamas, I iterate. TheÂ difference is the results of their terrorist activities which hugely favour Israel winning HamasÂ hands down.</p>
              <p>I advise anyone who attempts to argue in favour of the Israeli carnage toÂ employ proper and impartial substantiations when stating their claims.</p>
              <p>ThisÂ current Gaza massacre has the mainstream media lambasting and denouncing the Israeli acts. Remnants of its supporters should be construed as supporters of terrorism.Â Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>

              <p>Nope, Singapore did experience racist tensions before but the ISD clamped down hard on all agitators. US. of A is not zealously Zionist at its upper echelons but rather stauchly Christians who view that if Israel is gotten rid off first, then US of A is the next big target.</p>

              <p>Any form of racism is a result of not understanding the cultures of others.</p>
              <p>While you may insist that the airport securities should not have infringed on the religious rights of your Sikh friends... I'd like to remind you also that airport securities first priority is to make sure everyone onboard the plane are safe. They do not go through religious classes to understand all the taboos of global religion. And as a Sikh.. he is the minorities of minorities. Get what I mean ?</p>
              <p>As a frequent traveller myself.. I also get random pat down and screened... and I doubt I look like a terrorist. Even a caucasian mother with a baby bottle of milk are told to either throw the liquids away or not take the plane.</p>
              <p>Like many other travellers.. you do what you can to ensure a safe and uninterrupted travel. If I go to a Muslim country.. I don't walk around in my hot shorts.. or wear revealing clothings. It is a form of respect and also to ensure I comply with the general practise expected of an outsider.</p>
              <p>So regarding the 1967 boundaries.. why do you think it is illegitimate ?</p>
              <p>Just an after thought though... you know your sikh friend ? If he don't take off his turban... then is he willing to put his head through the X-ray machine ? No offence ah.. just trying to figure what would I do .. if I am the airport security.</p>
