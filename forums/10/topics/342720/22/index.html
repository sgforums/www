              <p>The UNRWA is not trustworthy. The employees are Palestinians. Some of them are Hamas. If you don't believe, you go ask Peter Hanson. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Your articles are not relevent to this discussion at all but you are merely demonizing the Muslims and Islamic faith. I hope you realize in Singapore, your actions willfully attack people of a certain faith.</p>

              <p>If you scroll back to all the previous pages you will see that I refrain from joining the "discussion". This is delilberate,  because it will lead to nowhere. I do not use  "other peoples' ideas or reports" as ammunition. Remember my post about being ask a question by an archangel.</p>
              <p>So what I post here is my own. Pun, humour, scarcasm, opinion, suggestions, whatever, up to the reader to assess. In your abject biasness you fail to notice that I am not in alliance with any other forumers here. It is your "If you are not with us, you are against us" mentality that make you group me as an Zionist extremist. I laugh at that.  1. You hate labeling, 2. Not all Jews are Zionist. (You should know that very well). 3. I am certainly not a Jew.</p>
              <p>You also quoted me out of context.  Are you not demonising me? Here is what I wrote,</p>
              <p> "<em>Individually I have no quarrel with Muslims, but collectively I do not trust the "jemmiah islamiah". They are evil, like the communist of the Stalin, Mao era. The grassroots are the sheeps, it is the higher hierachy that are wolf in sheep clothings. Everywhere, when a Muslim community is small, they behave peacefully............"</em></p>
              <p>compare it with what you attributed to me.</p>

              <p>jojobch,</p>
              <p>Mancha's 'personal opinion' is not a mere commentary on the actions of terrorists who are Muslims by name but rather an attack on the Muslim community as a whole which is most certainly tantamount to an act of sedition. I am sorry you perceive the writer's opinion wrongly.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Allow me to quote:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"but collectively I do not trust the "jemmiah islamiah". They are evil.</span></p>
              <p>"Everywhere, when a Muslim community is small, they behave peacefully, but when they grow, they become belligerent, discriminatory, and oppressive and imperialistic contrary to the tenets promised in their theology."</p>
              <p>This statement is not associated to terrorists act by al-qaeda or JI for they are of the minority few.  The acts of this people who comprise of a minute proportion of the larger muslim world are condoned by the larger muslim community. However, this renegade asserts that the larger Muslim community is as such.</p>
              <p>I am not appalled at an individuals ignorance of Islam or its history but rather appalled towards baseless assertion which contradicts history or whichever subject matter which concerns it. </p>
              <p>The moral of the story is, If you are not well informed with regards to a certain topic, refrain from making wild, asserting statements which may result in widespread consequences.</p>
              <p>Your incapacity to comprehend with simple assertions baffles me. Your constant referrence to analogies reflect your inability for full understanding.</p>
              <p>Let me put acroos this point in your own words, " If i'm a doctor I would not reprimand or be appalled with a patient for his ignorance about his health condition but rather his odesity to argue with baseless and unfounded as well as even contradictory statements with someone who has exercised due dilligence on the topic."</p>

              <p>Meaning what Hamas is doing, is being supported by the

              <p>This is published by a Saudi Arabia Television network. There is
              no mention of whether the girl was a Palestinian or not. You just

              <p>This is published by the Palestinian Media Watch. Do not let the
              name deceive you because it is not headed by Palestinians, but by
              Itamar Marcus, a Israeli counter terrorism analyst.  There is
              already a conflict on interest on producing this video.</p>

              <p>The same, published by the Palestinian Media Watch.</p>
              <p>First and foremost, none of us knows Arabic (Or whatever dialect
              that the Palestinian people uses) So whether the language used in
              the video is accurate or not we do not know and i do not understand
              why there must be English subtitles for a children show for the
              Palestinian people, and considering that they only have 1 coal
              fired power plant, with constant breakdowns i find it difficult to
              believe they even have the electricity power for televisions.</p>
              <p>You don't even question the information you are feeding yourself
              with, what makes you think you really understand the situation
              ?</p>
              <p>You have shown great courtesy in being civil in this discussion
              and i am compelled to do the same. However, i must need to point

              <p>Fair enough that my Arabic is rudimentary at best.  (My bad for getting used to the anime style of fansubbing) I'll see if I can get some of my friends who used to work in ME tell me whether its accurate or not then.  However, I did make out some words out of all arabic verses flying over my head, then again it could have been out of context.  The subtitles were added for us people who watch it on youtube by the Palestinian Media Watch who are trying to create awareness of the Palestinian situation. </p>
              <p>But just a little question.  Don't you think the comment box of those videos would have been flooded by arabic speakers screaming for blood for mistranslating if that was the case?</p>
              <p>Yes, I am well aware of who runs Palestinian Media Watch.  But if we make 2 presumptions, that 1, the children featured were not Israelis, and 2, that the content of the subtitling was true, what does that say?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@freedomclub </p>
              <p>Then if Hamas doesn't go, one power doesn't give way to the other, the cycle continues. And we'd all be on this forums arguing to the point of raised blood pressures over it.  Doesn't move away from that direction does it?</p>
              <p>And if for some reason, after Hamas collapses, and the Israelis really do oppress the Palestinians... and the UN or Arab league doesn't intervene; what does it tell us about their attitude to the Palestinians?  Despite them screaming for blood everytime an Israeli missile strike targets Hamas HQs, they pretty much don't care for the Palestinians. </p>

              <p>Let's clear some myths and misconception:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A) Palestine Legislative Council</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The president of the <strong>Palestinian National Authority</strong> is a position directly voted by the palestinian people, and has the power to appoint a Prime Minister from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Palestinian Legislative Council</span> whom he shares power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mahmoud Abbas is the current President.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Hamas, an islamic militant group, won 76 seats while Fatah, won 43 seats in the Legislative Council, in the national election in 2006, even though exit polls showed Fatah having a majority of 42% of votes while Hamas only 35%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Monitors of the election declared the elections were 'well-administered', but they fail to observe the most important part of the voting process - the gathering and counting of votes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Rather than to form a coalitian government and responsibly serve its constituents, Hamas, with its 'death to jews and infidels' ideology, seize control of Gaza, murdered Fatah political members, UN workers, as well as civilians between June 7 to June 15,2007 in the Gaza Strip. They totally disregarded and ignored their head of state President Abbas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Terrorist group Hamas may had won with its strong arms tactics, but it is a myth to believe they have ALL the palestinians support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Exit polls showed only 35% of palestinians support them. 65% of palestinians are suffering now in their hands, with the other 35% having dubious thoughts about their vote now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler too, won in a democratic election. So did the mad president from Iran with an unbelievable vote count of 62%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B.) Sanctity of UN centres &amp; other humanitarian organistion sites</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The UN and other humanitarian organsitions must forthwith seek an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">independent audit</span> into the use of its centres and staff being compromised as arsenals and hiding grounds for combatants, as well as the integrity of its staff, be they doctors or drivers of being biased and supportive of combatants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not, no one will trust the sanctity of UN premises and would be death-traps for refugees, propaganda material for terrorists, as well as loss of valuable donated equipment and food for them.   </p>

              <h1>Noam Chomsky: Undermining Gaza</h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
              </span></p><p><strong>DOSSANI</strong>:
              The Israeli government and many Israeli and U.S. officials claim that
              the current assault on Gaza is to put an end to the flow of Qassam
              rockets from Gaza into Israel. But many observers claim that if that
              were really the case, Israel would have made much more of an effort to
              renew the ceasefire agreement that expired in December, which had all
              but stopped the rocket fire. In your opinion, what are the real
              motivations behind the current Israeli action?</p>
              <p><strong>CHOMSKY</strong>: There's a theme that goes way back to the
              origins of Zionism. And it's a very rational theme: "Let's delay
              negotiations and diplomacy as long as possible, and meanwhile we'll
              'build facts on the ground.'" So Israel will create the basis for what
              some eventual agreement will ratify, but the more they create, the more
              they construct, the better the agreement will be for their purposes.
              Those purposes are essentially to take over everything of value in the
              former Palestine and to undermine what's left of the indigenous
              population.</p>
              <p>I think one of the reasons for popular support for this in the
              United States is that it resonates very well with American history. How
              did the United States get established? The themes are similar.</p>
              <p>There are many examples of this theme being played out throughout
              Israel's history, and the current situation is another case. They have
              a very clear program. Rational hawks like Ariel Sharon realized that
              it's crazy to keep 8,000 settlers using one-third of the land and much
              of the scarce supplies in Gaza, protected by a large part of the
              Israeli army while the rest of the society around them is just rotting.
              So it's best to take them out and send them to the West Bank. That's
              the place that they really care about and want.</p>
              <p>What was called a "disengagement" in September 2005 was actually a
              transfer. They were perfectly frank and open about it. In fact, they
              extended settlement building programs in the West Bank at the very same
              time that they were withdrawing a few thousand people from Gaza. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So
              Gaza should be turned into a cage, a prison basically, with Israel
              attacking it at will, and meanwhile in the West Bank we'll take what we
              want. There was nothing secret about it.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Ehud Olmert was in the United States in May 2006 a couple  of months after the withdrawal. He simply <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1148482035571">announced</a> to a joint session of Congress and to rousing applause, that the
              historic right of Jews to the entire land of Israel is beyond question.
              He announced what he called his convergence program, which is just a
              version of the traditional program; it goes back to the <a href="http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MAPS/1967-allon-plan.html">Allon</a> plan of 1967. Israel would essentially annex valuable land and
              resources near the green line (the 1967 border). That land is now
              behind the wall that Israel built in the West Bank, which is an
              annexation wall. That means the arable land, the main water resources,
              the pleasant suburbs around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and the hills and
              so on. They'll take over the Jordan valley, which is about a third of
              the West Bank, where they've been settling since the late 60s. Then
              they'll drive a couple of super highways through the whole territory —
              there's one to the east of Jerusalem to the town of Ma'aleh Adumim
              which was built mostly in the 1990s, during the Oslo years. It was
              built essentially to bisect the West Bank and are two others up north
              that includes Ariel and Kedumim<strong> </strong>and other towns which
              pretty much bisect what's left. They'll set up check points and all
              sorts of means of harassment in the other areas and the population
              that's left will be essentially cantonized and unable to live a decent
              life and if they want to leave, great. Or else they will be picturesque
              figures for tourists — you know somebody leading a goat up a hill in
              the distance — and meanwhile Israelis, including settlers, will drive
              around on "Israeli only" super highways. Palestinians can make do with
              some little road somewhere where you're falling into a ditch if it's
              raining. That's the goal. And it's explicit. You can't accuse them of
              deception because it's explicit. And it's cheered here.</p>
              <p><strong>DOSSANI</strong>: In terms of U.S. support, last week the UN
              Security Council adopted a resolution calling for a cease fire. Is this
              a change, particularly in light of the fact that the U.S. did not veto
              the resolution, but rather abstained, allowing it to be passed?</p>
              <p><strong>CHOMSKY</strong>: Right after the 1967 war, the Security
              Council had strong resolutions condemning Israel's move to expand and
              take over Jerusalem. Israel just ignored<strong> </strong>them. Because
              the U.S. pats them on the head and says "go ahead and violate them."
              There's a whole series of resolutions from then up until today,
              condemning the settlements, which as Israel knew and as everyone agreed
              were in violation of the Geneva conventions. The United States either
              vetoes the resolutions or sometimes votes for them, but with a wink
              saying, "go ahead anyway, and we'll pay for it and give you the
              military support for it." It's a consistent pattern. During the Oslo
              years, for example, settlement construction increased steadily, in
              violation of what the Oslo agreement was theoretically supposed to lead
              to. In fact the peak year of settlement was Clinton's last year, 2000.
              And it continued again afterward. It's open and explicit.</p>
              <p>To get back to the question of motivation, they have sufficient
              military control over the West Bank to terrorize the population into
              passivity. Now that control is enhanced by the collaborationist forces
              that the U.S., Jordan, and Egypt have trained in order to subdue the
              population. In fact if you take a look at the press the last couple of
              weeks, if there's a demonstration in the West Bank in support of Gaza,
              the Fatah security forces crush it. That's what they're there for.
              Fatah by now is more or less functioning as Israel's police force in
              the West Bank. But the West Bank is only part of the occupied
              Palestinian territories. The other part is Gaza, and no one doubts that
              they form a unit. And there still is<strong> </strong>resistance in
              Gaza, those rockets. So yes, they want to stamp that out too, then
              there will be no resistance at all and they can continue to do what
              they want to do without interference, meanwhile delaying diplomacy as
              much as possible and "building the facts" the way they want to. Again
              this goes back to the origins of Zionism. It varies of course depending
              on circumstances, but the fundamental policy is the same and perfectly
              understandable. If you want to take over a country where the population
              doesn't want you, I mean, how else can you do it? How was this country
              conquered?</p>
              <p><strong>DOSSANI</strong>: What you  describe is a tragedy.</p>
              <p><strong>CHOMSKY</strong>: It's a tragedy which is made right here.
              The press won't talk about it and even scholarship, for the most part,
              won't talk about it but the fact of the matter is that there has been a
              political settlement on the table, on the agenda for 30 years. Namely a
              two-state settlement on the international borders with maybe some
              mutual modification of the border. That's been there officially since
              1976 when there was a Security Council resolution proposed by the major
              Arab states and supported by the (Palestinan Liberation Organization)
              PLO, pretty much in those terms. The United States vetoed it so it's
              therefore out of history and it's continued almost without change since
              then.</p>
              <p>There was in fact one significant modification. In the last month of
              Clinton's term, January 2001 there were negotiations, which the U.S.
              authorized, but didn't participate in, between Israel and the
              Palestinians and they came very close to agreement.</p>
              <p><strong>DOSSANI</strong>: The <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=130193&amp;contrassID=3&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0">Taba</a> negotiations?</p>
              <p>Yes, the Taba negotiations. The two sides came very close to
              agreement. They were called off by Israel. But that was the one week in
              over 30 years when the United States and Israel abandoned their
              rejectionist position. It's a real tribute to the media and other
              commentators that they can keep this quiet. The U.S. and Israel are
              alone in this. The international consensus includes virtually everyone.
              It includes the Arab League which has gone beyond that position and
              called for the normalization of relations, it includes Hamas. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Every
              time you see Hamas in the newspapers, it says "Iranian-backed Hamas
              which wants to destroy Israel." Try to find a phrase that says
              "democratically elected Hamas which is calling for a two-state
              settlement" and has been for years. Well, yeah, that's a good
              propaganda system.</strong></span> Even in the U.S. press they've occasionally allowed
              op-eds by Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniya and others saying, yes we want a
              two-state settlement on the international border like everyone else.</p>
              <p><strong>DOSSANI</strong>: When did  Hamas adopt that position?</p>
              <p><strong>CHOMSKY</strong> That's  their official position <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/AR2006022402317_pf.html">taken</a> by Haniya, the elected leader, and Khalid Mesh'al, their political
              leader who's in exile in Syria, he's written the same thing. And it's
              over and over again. There's no question about it but the West doesn't
              want to hear it. So therefore it's Hamas which is committed to the
              destruction of Israel.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In a sense they are, but if you went to a Native American
              reservation in the United States, I'm sure many would like to see the
              destruction of the United States. If you went to Mexico and took a
              poll, I'm sure they don't recognize the right of the United States to
              exist sitting on half of Mexico, land conquered in war.</strong></span> And that's true
              all over the world. But they're willing to accept a political
              settlement. Israel isn't willing to accept it and the United States
              isn't willing to accept it. And they're the lone hold-outs. Since it's
              the United States that pretty much runs the world, it's blocked.</p>
              <p>Here it's always presented as though the United States must become
              more engaged; it's an honest broker; Bush's problem was that he
              neglected the issue. That's not the problem. The problem is that the
              United States has been very much engaged, and engaged in blocking a
              political settlement and giving the material and ideological and
              diplomatic support for the expansion programs, which are just criminal
              programs. The world court unanimously, including the American justice,
              agreed that any transfer of population into the Occupied Territories is
              a violation of a fundamental international law, the Geneva Conventions.
              And Israel agrees. In fact even their courts agree, they just sort of
              sneak around it in various devious ways. So there's no question about
              this. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It's just sort of accepted in the United States that we're an
              outlaw state. Law doesn't apply to us. That's why it's never discussed.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Fair enough that my Arabic is rudimentary at best.  (My bad
                  for getting used to the anime style of fansubbing) I'll see if I
                  can get some of my friends who used to work in ME tell me whether
                  its accurate or not then.  However, I did make out some words
                  out of all arabic verses flying over my head, then again it could
                  have been out of context.  The subtitles were added for us
                  people who watch it on youtube by the Palestinian Media Watch who
                  are trying to create awareness of the Palestinian
                  situation. </p>
              <p>But just a little question.  Don't you think the comment
                  box of those videos would have been flooded by arabic speakers
                  screaming for blood for mistranslating if that was the case?</p>
              <p>Yes, I am well aware of who runs Palestinian Media Watch.
                   But if we make 2 presumptions, that 1, the children featured
                  were not Israelis, and 2, that the content of the subtitling was
                  true, what does that say?</p>

              <p>@freedomclub </p>
              <p>Then if Hamas doesn't go, one power doesn't give way to the
                  other, the cycle continues. And we'd all be on this forums arguing
                  to the point of raised blood pressures over it.  Doesn't move
                  away from that direction does it?</p>
              <p>And if for some reason, after Hamas collapses, and the Israelis
                  really do oppress the Palestinians... and the UN or Arab league
                  doesn't intervene; what does it tell us about their attitude to the
                  Palestinians?  Despite them screaming for blood everytime an
                  Israeli missile strike targets Hamas HQs, they pretty much don't

              <p>I accept that yes it is quite possible that if it was inaccurate there should be Arabic speakers pointing out the problem. </p>
              <p>But we must considering the amount of internet usage in the Middle East ( 2.9%, 41,939,200). How many among these users even frequent English websites or know enough of it to navigate youtube to see the mentioned videos ? How many could even go into youtube (Iran, UAE, Turkey, Syria, Kuwait, Pakistan bans it, claiming to want to stop anti Muslim websites)</p>
              <p>*corrected, UAE or Saudi Arabia does allow youtube. But apparently there are blocks in place for "objectable", <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">"blasphemous material"</span> content. What exactly does this entails i have no idea.</p>
              <p>Considering the amount of hate on those videos, what would happen to a user that is not fluent in English and attempted to say those videos are false ? Hell we don't even know a lot about what Malaysians are saying about us.</p>
              <p>I ask this because i have China friends and they spent much of their internet time on Chinese websites and rarely go into the English websites because even though they're schooled in English they're not fluent enough to fully understand what is being said. </p>
              <p>I never said the children was Israelis nor did i say the subtitling was false. I'm merely skeptic about information in all forms and question the intention of those who posted the videos, who has a vested interest in not reporting truthfully. It's not like the Palestinians are internet literate and know English enough to provide counter arguments. </p>
              <p>Our media tells us a lot of positive news about how good the PAP are and how good our leaders. Even i myself are skeptic about the information, i'm not arrogant enough to presume that the majority of Palestinians are stupid enough to believe everything their television tells them, you think their economic stituation allows them to sit like couch potatoes with nothing to do like the Americans?</p>
              <p>Hell, i'm not even sure how much of them really believe in the 75 virgins bull the Western media say they are so obsessed about.  People are so influenced by what the Western media tells them they can't even see people in the Middle East like a normal human being anymore.</p>

              <p>*corrected, UAE or Saudi Arabia does allow youtube. But
              apparently there are blocks in place for "objectable", <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">"blasphemous
              material"</span> content. What exactly does this entails i have no
              idea.</p>
              <p>Considering the amount of hate on those videos, what would
              happen to a user that is not fluent in English and attempted to say
              those videos are false ? Hell we don't even know a lot about what
              Malaysians are saying about us.</p>
              <p>I ask this because i have China friends and they spent much of
              their internet time on Chinese websites and rarely go into the
              English websites because even though they're schooled in English
              they're not fluent enough to fully understand what is being

              <p>I never said the children was Israelis nor did i say the
              subtitling was false. I'm merely skeptic about information in all
              forms and question the intention of those who posted the videos,
              who has a vested interest in not reporting truthfully. It's not
              like the Palestinians are internet literate and know English enough
              to provide counter arguments. </p>
              <p>Our media tells us a lot of positive news about how good the PAP
              are and how good our leaders. Even i myself are skeptic about the
              information, i'm not arrogant enough to presume that the majority

              television tells them, you think their economic stituation allows

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I made a point contrary to that? In fact, I acknowledged that Hamas' using of human shields has resulted in civilian deaths many times earlier on. Can you read? Can you answer a direct question? I'm just asking you to look at the war crimes the IDF has committed, the same war crimes that Hamas has committed. Yet you are willfully ignoring whatever question or content I post. <strong>Instead of condemning one side of committing war crimes, why can't you see that both parties do not, or cannot, respect human rights?</strong> Is it so antithetical to your conditioning that you cannot accept it and constantly evade the issue?</span></p>

              <p><em>Hamas's use of civilians as shields resulted in many
              civilian deaths. Anybody cannot undestand this?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I made a point contrary to
              that? In fact, I acknowledged that Hamas' using of human shields
              has resulted in civilian deaths many times earlier on. Can you
              read? Can you answer a direct question? I'm just asking you to look
              at the war crimes the IDF has committed, the same war crimes that
              Hamas has committed. Yet you are willfully ignoring whatever
              question or content I post. <strong>Instead of condemning one side
              of committing war crimes, why can't you see that both parties do
              not, or cannot, respect human rights?</strong> Is it so
              antithetical to your conditioning that you cannot accept it and
              constantly evade the issue?</span></p>
              <p><em>If almost half of Palestinians casualties were
              militants(since Palestinians claimed that half the casualties were
              civilians), the ratio is 1:1.</em></p>
              <p><em>It  indicates that IDF do make efforts to minimise
              civilian casualties.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I've already posted information
              showing the contrary.</span></p>

              the "propaganda" that you like to condemn. Which armed force
              wouldnt produce something like that to try winning the support of
