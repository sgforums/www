              <p>Let's face it Jarhum, disarmament is indeed the best thing to do. But if Israel is to take this route.. then it is also fair that <strong>all countries</strong> that poses a threat to Israel be disarmed too. Are the other countries willing to do that as well ?</p>
              <p>Weapons are evil.. it's creation was for the sole purpose of killing and destructions.</p>
              <p>Yes I agree it wasn't a fair fight from the beginning.</p>
              <p>But isn't it kinda stupid for HAMAS to take on Israel with their home made mortars/rockets ?</p>
              <p>If holding on to power is causing sufferings to your own people.. wouldn't a honest leader be willing to put down his pride and step down ?</p>

              <p><br>Of course, your suggestion would be the most ideal scenario for everyone. I would ardently support such a move.</p>
              <p>Contrary to the 2006 Hzbullah war, this war is not about Hamas or it is the least about Hamas. I mentioned that in my previous posts.</p>
              <p>Hamas began with a few people. However, most of their combtants were fathers and husbands of Palestinian women and children who were killed in the war. And most people will take up arms when their loved ones are killed and being killed.</p>

              <p>even if you want to use scholarly assessments and deductions you must consider the source. Shiraz Dossa isn't well known for his unbiased views. if i haven't read wrongly he believes there's ethnocide against Palestinians. would you trust someone like that to translate what Ahmedinejad said?</p>
              <p>The 2002 Arab Initiative means nothing, its unlikely to be followed through. its just an empty promise they can't keep.  most likely they'll normalise ties while recuiting fighters for the next jihad at the same time. hatred is too deepset in the region. you can't snap your fingers sign some papers and hope it'll go away</p>

              <p>The Initiative which you beieve is redundant is simply your assumption. Thus you do not believe in any attempts for peace. Israel has broke numerous promises, agreements and truces. When you mention hatred is deeply entrenched in the region, you disregard any hopes for peace and diplomacy. I advice you do some soul searching within yourself first.</p>
              <p>Moreover, it is Israel who declined the initiative. Achieving peace is about both sides winning some and losing some. However, Israel is not prepared to lose.</p>

              <p><br> Perhaps the only way should be Israel be disarmed and
              U.N peacekeepers supervise its pre 1967 borders. Israel
              is guilty of numerous war crimes including the rape and murder of
              women and children. Read Sabra and Shatilla massacres in
              Lebanon.</p>
              <p>Thusfar, no Palestinian army has fought within Israel. Arab
              nations in its previous wars with Israel are
              much comparatively cleaner than Israel in the number of
              war crimes committed. Thus, you may be able to deduce a probable
              inference from here. Israeli leaders have a list of war crimes
              committed hanging above them. </p>
              <p>It is ludicrous Hamas should bear the brunt of the blame when
              the innocent Gazans are intently murdered by the Israelis
              themselves.  I will emphasize this fact. Your argument is
              contradictory to rational thinking simply because of your prejudice
              possibly due to emotional ties to Israel.</p>
              <p>Military strategist have stated that if Israel were to
              engage Hamas in a guerilla warfare, Israel will lose. The
              Israel "soldier" hides behind its helicopters and tanks. Any
              man would affirm that this is not a fair fight in its purest
              sense. Who are the cowards then?  </p>

              <p>haha why would the victor of a war in which it was not the aggressor give back annexed lands to countries who would continue to be hostile to it? much less disarm in such a hostile region?  Sabra and Shatilla massacres were not commited by the IDF. their fault was they didn't protect the victims.</p>
              <p>Palestinian army has fought within Israel because they don't have the ability to do so, not because they don't want to. and of course the arabs were cleaner in their wars with israel, they've lost every single one.</p>
              <p>instead of throwing in words like genocide and murder how about opening your eyes to how the palestinians are dying?</p>
              <p>haha and which military strategist are you going to quote? did the military strategist also tell you Israel will lose  in guerilla warfare because if israeli soldiers were to charge at bullets fired from behind covers they would die? why else do you think helicopters and tanks were brought in? are you trying to tell us you think the israeli army is there in gaza to challenge the hamas to a duel?</p>
              <p>so is war supposed to be fair? is that honestly what you think? so iraq was conquered by an army of cowards? When British ships bombed the island of Zanzibar were they cowards as well? should they have landed and throw away their muskets and engage in a sword fight with the sultan's men? should the IDF have brought israeli women to hide behind instead of helicopters and tanks?</p>

              <p><strong>Where have I ever denied Hamas' wrong doings?</strong> I've put it across many times that as long as the conflict continues, it is both sides that have to be condemned. But the popular opinion of people in this forum is to take one side, overlook the crimes of the other side, and condemn the other side.</p>
              <p>When you say "Arabs", do you refer to Hamas, the Palestinians or the Arab countries like Egypt, Jordan, Syria or Saudi Arabia? We all know that the Arab countries that attacked or got attacked by Israel over the last few decades, namely Egypt, Jordan and Syria, have made peace with Israel (except for Syria perhaps). If you mean that Hamas puts down their weapons, peace will only ensue if Israel halts its oppression of the Palestinian people, and that includes the inhumane closing of the Gazan border.</p>
              <p>In the absence of more evidence from the Gaza Strip, due to Israel's cutting off the foreign media there, I will not say that Hamas cant help using human shields, because I cant prove it, though that is my opinion. So I agree with you on that point. But so is Israel guilty of that charge.</p>

              <p>My stand is both Israel and its neighbours should disarm ideally at the same time under strict supervision from relevent international organizations. However, this remains a romantic notion. You are barbaric to claim that a complete genocide of the Palestinians is legitimate to achieve lasting peace. You are worse off than an animal. In no sound mind would one advocate murdering innocent civilians for any purpose.  You cannot accuse me of siding with any terrorist organizations for I detest the killings of innocent to further any cause, no matter how noble it may be. However, the same can't be said of you.</p>
              <p>I am an ardent defendent of the Palestinian lives being maliciously taken away and violated by the very atrocities of the Israeli army. I believe my ethical values correspond to the values of humanity and thus require no soul searching</p>

              announcement to trade unionist as purposeful and tantamount to
              alter the discourse of the exact causation of the war.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, Israeli</span> <a title="Foreign Minister" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Foreign_Minister"><span style="color: #000000;">Foreign Minister</span></a> <a title="Abba Eban" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Abba_Eban"><span style="color: #000000;">Abba Eban</span></a> <span style="color: #000000;">wrote in his autobiography that he
              found "Nasser's assurance that he did not plan an armed attack"
              convincing, adding that "Nasser did not want war; he wanted victory
              without war". Writing from Egypt on 4 June 1967 <a title="New York Times" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/New_York_Times">New York Times</a></span> <span style="color: #000000;">journalist</span> <a title="James Reston" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/James_Reston"><span style="color: #000000;">James
              Reston</span></a> <span style="color: #000000;">observed: "Cairo
              does not want war and it is certainly not ready for war. But it has
              already accepted the possibility, even the likelihood, of war, as
              if it had lost control of the situation. In addition, Egypt planned
              to send its vice president to Washington for last ditch
              diplomacy attempts to avert a war on the day of Israel's
              pre-emptive strike.</span></p>
              <p>However, Israel's insistence to proceed with a preemptive strike
              leading to a war was a transformative and political
              manovouer rather than purely a miliary defence one.</p>
              <p>On resolution 242,</p>
              <p>there are various interpretations of the ambigous, inconclusive
              declaration. However, you have adopted the pro-Israeli stance as a
              definitive direction of the resolution which reflects your
              prejudiced stand. There exist various perspectives and
              interpretations of this vaguely coined declaration. Academics would
              point to the essence of the resolution that neither requires Israel
              to withdraw nor permits Israel to retain the 1967
              boundaries. </p>
              <p>Palestine is defined as occupied territories rather than a
              sovereign state actor.  Your reluctance to accept Israel's
              liabilities towards its war crimes is questionable. Numerous groups
              have accused Israel of blatant violation of the fourth geneva
              convention, notably Amnesty, UNWRA and several others. Israel
              themselves do not refute its violation of human rights, only to
              justify it with claims of self defence.</p>
              <p>Does extermination requires the perpertrator to publically
              announce its intention in forms of rhetoric to justify charges of
              genocide directed at it? What Israel is doing in Gaza tantamounts
              to acts of genocide, I reiterate. Try asking Hitler was he
              responsible for acts of genocide against the Jews? He would
              vehemently refute the accusations. Any criminal would attempt
              to justify their wrongdoings and Israel is no different. I see no
              disparity between the killings of innocent civilians of a sovereign
              state and a non state actor. Do you imply acts
              of extermination of citizens would only then constitute
              genocide?</p>
              <p>The president of the UN General Assembly has condemned Israel's
              killings of Palestinians in its Gaza offensive as genocide.</p>
              <p> I am fully aware any state or individual has the right to
              self-defence. However, unlike you, I am not selective in its
              application. Unfortunaely, Israeli attacks, in this current round
              of events are not retaliatory nor a reaction. They were the
              perpertrators of this war. Refer to my previous article for my
              elaboration and substatiation of this.</p>
              <p>I am tremendously appalled at your attempted downplay
              of the massacre and the gross violation of human lives and
              rights by the Israeli Zionists. In addition, I am pretty
              amused at your selective citation of information to further a
              flismy stand. I hope you would reconsider your stand for
              disregard for the precise cause of the massacre of innocents will
              do your values no justice.</p>

              <p>Jarhum, </p>
              <p>My bad for also forgetting to mention that Egypt also enacted a blockade on Israeli Shipping in the Red Sea.  Isn't that an act of belligerency?</p>
              <p>Add that with the thousand tanks, and hundred thousand troops sitting on the border, Israel had a real concern for its security.  Any country would.</p>
              <p>Eban did attempt to delay Israeli pre-emptive strike, however, American plans to aid Israel fell on its ass, and Israel then knew they stood alone and had to do whatever it took to guarantee its Survival.  Why would it be matter of Survival?  All thanks to Nasser who chose very powerful words for that situation. </p>
              <p>Again, you claim to be a Political Scientist, and should understand that words are very carefully chosen when dealing with other countries.  Nasser's choice of words were in not way defensive.  He did not claim that they would defeat Israel, but chose the words, "destruction of Israel."  He added, "The Arab people want to fight" and not "The Arab people will want to fight."  A very aggressive choice of words don't you think?</p>
              <p>On Resolution 242, it was a matter of fact that the Security Council rejected appeals to insert the word "all."   If they intended for Israel to return all territories and force her to accept pre may 1967 borders, they would have happily made amendments. </p>
              <p>Now on the issue of Genocide.  A massacre might pass as a charge, but genocide not.  Genocide entails the complete elimination of a race of people, hence the root word, "gene-."  What Hitler tried to do, was genocide.  He targeted Jews, and came up with systematice methods to kill them by the droves.  He openly stated his ideals of "purification" of "Aryan" peoples and lands. </p>
              <p>There is no sign that the Israelis are systematically killing Palestinians.  If aerial bombings are considered so, then Americans should have been accused of genocide of Iraqis too.  Oh, did I mention that that would be horribly inefficient without the use of Fuel Air Explosives?  </p>
              <p>You can call me whatever you like, Zionist Extremists, PAP Dog, blah blah... I'm used to it.  I've said it before, I'm a realist.   I don't really care as much as for the morals and how many people are dying from Israeli WP.  I just know that the coexistence of Hamas and Israel creates security dilemmas and the only way to relative "peace" is the capitulation of Hamas.  </p>

              <p><br>I never intended nor attempted to answer your idotic questions. I only aim to refute your barbaric disregard for human lives. I am not surprised you avoid my invitation for a fruitful debate, looking at the tremendously low level of knowledge and intelligence you are unfortunately born with.</p>
              <p>The IDF did not only not prevented any massacre from happening but facilitated the carnage. However, the Kahan commision states that there was no direct involvement by the IDF. However, this claim was challenged by Philangists who stated that there were direct Israeli participation. It is difficult to believe Israel's claims nowadays with conflicting reports from from Israel against the U.N with regards to the presence of Hamas combatants within the U.N compund which Israel attacke And interestingly a conflicting report from none other than Ehud Olmert himself against Israel's stanuch ally, the United states where olmert arrogantly boasted that he instructed the U.S to abstain from voting the security council resolution which was denied by Washington. Thus, Israel's claims and reports are fast losing credibility as a result of direct conflicts of reports from itself against others. Moreover, the viability and integrity of the Kahan Commision comes into doubt since although it concludes that Sharon should never hold public office again, he still went on the become the PM of Israel.</p>
              <p>Israels facilitation and assistance is analogous to getting the Mafia to kill someone you want dead, instead of doing it yourself.  Moreover, you should attempt to keep your prejudice towards Israeli violent policies in check. Sabra and Shatilla were under direct control of the IDF. If you would utilize your same brand of arguing that loss of lives in Gaza is due to Hamas since Gaza is under direct control of Hamas, you should afirm that the massacre of Sabra and Shatilla is due to IDF. Moreover, Israel facilitated the massacres by providing assistance to the Philangists. I<strong> abhor your statement that these victims,women and children included, should just protect themselves without any weapons. </strong></p>
              <p>It is pretty obvious your knowledge regarding this matter is shallow. Hamas has no ring wing branch. It does not declare itself a ring wing organization nor western nations refer to it as "ring wing". Only insane Zionist zealots like yourself speaking the language of zionist terrorist groups such as Kach and those adhering to Kahanist ideologiea. Although I am convinced this was done out of pure stupidity.</p>
              <p>Initially, your lack of much competent arguments gained my sympathy. However, there is a stark difference between sympathy and pathetic. Now I realised it is the latter.</p>
              <p>At the very least if you realise you do not possess the required know how to challenge me to a fruitful debate, refrain from posting further incoherent and violent claims. </p>

              <p>Corruption and inadequancies of governance is the main cause of problems in Arab nations. They utilize and exaggerate the fear factor from suicide bombings to legitimize their hard rule. The main raison d etre for the existance of terrorist groups and its attacks on the goverments and kingdoms of the Arab countries is due to the harsh treatment received for voicing or writing against the state, rather than establishing a pan-islamic state. Like the JI which thrives of the leverage between various separatist movements such as MILF in Philippines, Laskar Jihad of Indo and Thai separatist movements to advance their personal, disparate causes of autonomy and retaliation against harsh persecution by their respective governments.</p>
              <p>However, the stark similarity is derived from the existance of  certain groups which aims to achieve a Pan Islamic state in the Middle East inclusive Israel such as Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Zionism aims to achieve a Jewish state ranging from modern Israel, to all of the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, large chunks of Syria, Jordan and Egypt as well as proportions of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Turkey although the Israeli spokesman would deny this but admissible by rightist Israelis.</p>
              <p>Antagonism among the Muslim groups also arises from their perception that their governments are facilitating the Zionist movements although this may be disputed.  </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, both entities desire the similar territories. </p>

              <p>Another mistatement: Muslims in the Middle East envision an era of peace from a pan-Islamic brotherhood of nations but which version of it will it be? The Shiite or Sunni vision?</p>
              <p>Another mistatement from Jarhum:</p>
              <p>Is every Israeli who defends his nation a Zionist? Granted that there are Kahanists in the military, but the state of Israel is a legal nation under the perview of the UN and thus must stand against all agression, including Hamas unwillingness to help police the mutual border.</p>
