              <p>Jarhum, </p>
              <p>My bad for also forgetting to mention that Egypt also enacted a blockade on Israeli Shipping in the Red Sea.  Isn't that an act of belligerency?</p>
              <p>Add that with the thousand tanks, and hundred thousand troops sitting on the border, Israel had a real concern for its security.  Any country would.</p>
              <p>Eban did attempt to delay Israeli pre-emptive strike, however, American plans to aid Israel fell on its ass, and Israel then knew they stood alone and had to do whatever it took to guarantee its Survival.  Why would it be matter of Survival?  All thanks to Nasser who chose very powerful words for that situation. </p>
              <p>Again, you claim to be a Political Scientist, and should understand that words are very carefully chosen when dealing with other countries.  Nasser's choice of words were in not way defensive.  He did not claim that they would defeat Israel, but chose the words, "destruction of Israel."  He added, "The Arab people want to fight" and not "The Arab people will want to fight."  A very aggressive choice of words don't you think?</p>
              <p>On Resolution 242, it was a matter of fact that the Security Council rejected appeals to insert the word "all."   If they intended for Israel to return all territories and force her to accept pre may 1967 borders, they would have happily made amendments. </p>
              <p>Now on the issue of Genocide.  A massacre might pass as a charge, but genocide not.  Genocide entails the complete elimination of a race of people, hence the root word, "gene-."  What Hitler tried to do, was genocide.  He targeted Jews, and came up with systematice methods to kill them by the droves.  He openly stated his ideals of "purification" of "Aryan" peoples and lands. </p>
              <p>There is no sign that the Israelis are systematically killing Palestinians.  If aerial bombings are considered so, then Americans should have been accused of genocide of Iraqis too.  Oh, did I mention that that would be horribly inefficient without the use of Fuel Air Explosives?  </p>
              <p>You can call me whatever you like, Zionist Extremists, PAP Dog, blah blah... I'm used to it.  I've said it before, I'm a realist.   I don't really care as much as for the morals and how many people are dying from Israeli WP.  I just know that the coexistence of Hamas and Israel creates security dilemmas and the only way to relative "peace" is the capitulation of Hamas.  </p>

              <p>You Israeli advocates are extremely fond of exploiting the notion of double standards blatantly. Although double standards is an inherent fault of the human psyche, purposeful manipulation creates questions on its exact purpose.</p>
              <p>Thus the Israeli blockade of Gazas border is also similarly construed as an act of belligerency although I attest Israel threw the first punch in this war.</p>
              <p>Eban was assured Nasser did not plan want to go to war. And Nasser's words were gleefully taken out of context as you did with mine. He only mentioned war with Israel in the event Syria and Egypt were attacked first. Do not get me wrong. The mobilization of troops and blockade of Tiran were doing injustice and provocative towards Israel. However,as a political scientist, I am simply citing references to Israels reasons for the preemptive strikes from the Israeli voice that the Israeli political and military elite believed the war would be transformative for Israel not miliatrily preferable. Transformative in no sense would be interpreted as defensive. Israel's sick lust for war and violence is exemplified here as assurances of and explicit knowledge of its enemy's war capabilities as well as desires were acknowledged by Israel to be of no threat as it repeats its sick lust for blood in the perpertration of this current round of violence for political and ideological purposes.</p>
              <p>It appears you have confused a political scientist with a politician. There are stark disparities between these two professions within the same sphere of study.</p>
              <p>One who is educated a political scientist would not willfully omit segments of any statement and construct a perceived rhetoric revolving around segments of a staement taken out of context. Only politicians do. "The Arab peple will want to fight...." Only if Israel attacked it first.</p>
              <p>On 242, U.N never intended Israel to withdraw from its territories nor intended Israel to continue its occupation. I never stated 242 explicitly requires Israel to withdraw from its post 1967 boundaries. I believe this is the most neutral statement one could ever deduce from the inconclusiveness of 242 rather than adhering to either, opposing interpretation.</p>
              <p>Your Iraqi comparison is invalid as there is much lesser Palestinians than Iraqis. However, I reiterate my position as a humanist that the killings of innocent Iraqis from the Americans "war on terror" is no less malicious than the killings of victims of 911.</p>
              <p>I vehemently disagree with your assertion that there is "no sign that the Israelis are systematically killing the Palestinians". There have been charges raised towards the killings by Israel and these charges are raised by those who are far greater eloquent and knowledgable in their own right.  I assume you definition of a genecide additionally involves an explicit declaration by the perpertrator as well. My friend, genocide requires no declaration nor rhetoric and actions speaks volumes greater than words. Israel systematic extermination of the Palestinian people does not occur in stages nor phases but occur in periods. Within the next 100 years and Israel continue its twice or thrice in a decade acts of "self-defence" against the Palestinians, the Palestinian race will be condemn to the pages of history.</p>
              <p>Your statement that you do not care as much as for the morals and the massacre of innocents reflect your blatant lack of conscience, as much as you do for the politics. Likewise most realists assumed that PLO and Israel could never coexist but diplomacy proved otherwise. The security framework of the Palestinian territories is no longer intricate due to the Arabs constant threat to annhilate Israels existance. This threat has been relegated to the pages of history.</p>
              <p>The Arabs have left Israel alone other than fruitless insults. But the contemporary security paradigm of the land around Israel is complicated by Israel's paranoia and unrealistic demands for peace. Not to mention its fanatical guarding of its dignity and scoring political points back home.</p>

              <p>Jarhum, </p>
              <p>It's not my Israeli advocates that are fond of double standards.  The whole world is fond of double standards.  So whose standards "stand" at the end of the day?  It will always be the standards that serves the interests of the many or of the powerful.  </p>
              <p>Israel's blockade of the Gaza differs in that the Gaza strip, and the Palestinians living there are not a state and have no sovereignty.  To the Israelis, its merely securing their borders and with a rightful reason; preventing suicide bombers from enter Israel.  Is that not a valid concern?  </p>
              <p>I hope that you do not miss my point about this.  What I am saying by providing the Israeli side of the story is that, both sides aren't clean.  Both sides erred, and Israel was a little to overeager or overzealous in their "pre-emptive" strike and not returning occupied lands in order to "bribe" some goodwill out of her Arab neighbours.  Instead, she chose keep occupying them to serve as a constant reminder of how they failed to annihilate her.  At least the "reminder" part worked.</p>
              <p>Oh there was this piece of text about the Arab Peace Initiative that I'd like to share with you to see if you agree with it.</p>

              <p>No, I have not confused a Political Scientist for Politician.  I am very aware of the differences between that two, trust me.  However, I believe that Political Scientists would be people who are also well aware of the type of words politicians use.  I'm saying that you should know the meaning and strength behind the words they use, because they choose such words carefully.  I am not asking you to use it. =D</p>
              <p>PS: Nasser said "The Arab people want to fight."</p>
              <p>Your vehement disagreement has been noted, and you are entitled to that opinion despite its unsubstantiated nature.  I cannot subscribe to that opinion simply because that would make the Israelis the most horridly inefficient genociders ever considering Hitler had so many wonderful ideas on how to eliminate them.  I believe the African clans had better and cheaper ethnic cleansing methods than the Israelis, if they were indeed embarking on one. </p>
              <p>Well, now I am also conscienceless.  Let me tell you what I believe.  I believe that for people to stop dying, for women and children to stop getting caught in collaterals, is for Israel to cease combat operations.  But I know that is an impossibility because sooner or later, some crackpot in Hamas is gonna start mortaring Israel again; groundhog day, deja vous, and there we will be on this forums debating again.</p>
              <p>So how does the fighting stop?  The simplest way is for Hamas to stop fighting and surrender.  Stop spreading hateful messages of the Jews and Zionist agenda, and let the Palestinian people decide for themselves.  What good does it do to those women and children when they keep teaching their own to hate Jews and commit themselves to martyrdom against them?  It only serves to perpetuate the cycle of violence.  How do I harbor sympathy to the suffering of Palestinians as a people when they have teaching their children to hate and kill? </p>
              <p>Perpetuating messages of hate towards the Jews won't help stop the fighting.  Getting Hamas to stop their attacks and surrender, will.  I know that to be the only option because Israel definitely won't surrender.  </p>

              <p>It is because of people like you that perpetrate ignorance and suspicions because of 'sensitivities' and thus keep issues hidden and in the dark, while you continue to push ramrod your bias agenda thru with threats to others who differs from yours and only unconciously seeks to know more.</p>

              <p>A glimmer of hope befalls Gaza - a possible truce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The credit belongs to everyone in the world who is concerned for the innocents on both sides and had prayed and voice out to their leaders to call for a truce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But more credit espacially to the moderate muslims who had swayed hardened minds not to support, provide funds or recruits to the terrorist organisation Hamas, which made them realized it is time to stop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should a truce occur, it is at best only fragile. There is much to do to strengthen it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israel must continue to find the best ways to change mindsets and not resort to bullets as the way to solve issues. It will not be an overnight change, but will take time and patience. The rest of the world, non-muslims and muslims as well, must take effort to listen and help too.<br> <br>Many a grieving mother had watch their children die with an Israeli bullet or bomb, even though the blame falls equally on Hamas too. There must be a time and patience for sensitivities to heal, with an ultimate desire for a better tomorrow for all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No point in dredging up the past. Mistakes had been made by all. Who amongst us is perfect?. There is no way to change the past, but we all have the choice and free will to build a better peaceful tomorrow, if not for ourselves, at least for the next generation. They are born fully innocent. We, this generation, owe them that much.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The leaders of Hamas must be brought to trial for their terrorist acts, given a fair trial and if guilty, must be made to pay the price for their errors and mis-using religion to destroy thousands of lives. The dead and their living loved ones demands of it, if not the millions of faithful muslims around the world shamed by their blasphemous destruction of a peaceful religion..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The men of Hamas must be given a chance to be properly rehabilated to rejoin and contribute back to society, for they are only following orders and had been mindlessly corrupted by their leaders. The Koran is just, but is merciful to those with remorse as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The world must give strength to the Palestinians to be not afraid of Hamas and stand up to them, turn them in to the authorities for inflicting worse suffering and death to them. </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>They are NOT freedom fighters. No freedom fighter will hide amongst them drawing fire and hide weapons in sancified Mosques, schools, hospitals, UN centres, etc.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The UN will continue its aid to Palestine, and no one, no one, must abuse it or hijack it to promote their political cause and make use of the Palestinians again. They, like the Israelis, have a right to the 4 freedoms espoused by one of the few  great men that walk thru this planet and influenced lives - Franklin Roosevelt, during a time when the world was colonnised, raped and enslaved. .</p>
              <p> </p>

                  with the shell remnants causes severe burns, sometimes burning the skin

                  doctor at the al-Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.</strong></p>
              <p>Almi said the
                  entire body of one victim was burned within an hour. It was the first
                  time he had seen the effects of what he called a "chemical weapon".</p>
              <p>The
                  Israeli military has denied using white phosphorus during the assault
                  on Gaza, <strong>but aid agencies say they have no doubt it has been used.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"It
                  is an absolute certainty," said Marc Garlasco, a senior military
                  analyst at Human Rights Watch. He had seen Israeli artillery fire white
                  phosphorus shells at Gaza City, Garlasco said.</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Human Rights Watch compares the use of white phosphorus shells over
                  Gaza to the impact of cluster munitions, which scatter "bomblets" over
                  a wide area. Children may kick and play with a lump of phosphorus,
                  stirring up the embers and producing more fire and smoke.</p>
              <p><strong>The use
                  of white phosphorus as a weapon – as opposed to its use as an obscurant
                  and infrared blocking smoke screen – is banned by the UN's third
                  convention on conventional weapons</strong>, which covers the use of incendiary
                  devices. Though Israel is not a signatory to the convention, its
                  military manuals reflect the convention's restrictions on using white
                  phosphorus.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Now, what is the difference when even though it may be claimed that it is used as a "smokescreen", but ends up harming and killing hundreds of civilians. Isn't that a definition of a weapon?]</span></p>
              <p>Israel initially claimed that it was not using white
                  phosphorus. It later explained that shells being loaded for a howitzer,
                  identified from photographs as phosphorus rounds, were empty "quiet"
                  shells used for target marking. <strong>However, images of exploding shells and
                  showering burning fragments are now acknowledged by independent
                  observers as having been phosphorus.</strong></p>
              <p>At the centre of the
                  controversy <strong>is the way white phosphorus air burst shells have been used
                  in heavily built-up urban areas, with an overwhelmingly civilian
                  population.</strong></p>
              <p>..."</p>
              <p>- <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/16/phosphorus-bombs-video-israel-gaza">Video shows evidence of phosphorus bombs in Gaza</a></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">No concrete evidence. If
                                          IDF is accused of mass-killing civilians, what's the point of IDF
                                          holding families as human shields?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Massing-killing civilians by indiscriminate bombing is different from using families as human shields as one is conducted from the air while the other is a tactic used by ground troops. Of course you will deny it even though Amnesty International accuses Israel of the crime. In the first place, you are not willing to accept that the Israeli military, just like all militaries, are trained to kill, but in this case, the killing is mostly the murder of civilians under the guise of killing Hamas members.</span></p>
              <p><strong>"Donatella Rovera</strong>, an Amnesty investigator in Israel, is quoted in today's <em>Guardian</em> as saying: "It's standard practice for Israeli soldiers to go into a
                  house, lock up the family in a room on the ground floor and use the
                  rest of the house as a military base, as a sniper's position. That is
                  the absolute textbook case of human shields.</p>
              <p>"It has been practised by the Israeli army for many years and they are doing it again in Gaza now."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Here's your proof:</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXq57XK2L0A">Israeli [Army] using Palestinian Kids as Human Shields</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4333982.stm">IDF to appeal human shield ban </a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When Hamas does it, everyone condemns it. But when Israel engages in it, people like you disregard it and even when Israel is caught doing it, its alright given how the IDF shows it audacity by appealing to the Israeli Supreme Court to continue the practice. That sure makes a lot of sense.</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israel HAS been caught doing it, and when Amnesty International, working to relieve the humanitarian crisis on the ground in the Gaza reports on it, of course I would believe it rather than your biased reasoning based on ZERO experience that you need proof that you wouldnt even accept. And of course Israel doesnt want news of this kind getting out, <a href="http://www.imemc.org/article/58369">thats why they have prevented the foreign media from accessing the Gaza Strip, even when an Israeli High Court allows them access</a>. Again, dont ignore this blatent violation of Israel's own Laws and legal system.</span></p>

                                          militants.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Injured militants or ambulances that have been hijacked? The video you posted didnt make that clear. In the first place, it is a violations of the Geneva Convention to deny medical treatment to the wounded, which Israel is doing. Then, even if the ambulance has been hijacked, it doesnt provide future immunity to Israel to attack the property and personnel of international humanitarian organisations. If so, then how the hell are the Palestinian people supposed to get aid? </span></p>
              <p>"ISRAELI shells set ablaze a food warehouse at UN headquarters in Gaza
                  yesterday, destroying tons of emergency rations intended for needy Gaza
                  civilians, a senior UN official said.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said the military fired artillery
                  shells at the UN compound after Hamas militants opened fire from the
                  location, a version of events John Ging, director of Unwra in Gaza,
                  rejected as "nonsense"<br><br>Mr Ging said <strong>Israeli shells first hit a
                  courtyard filled with refugees, then struck garages and the UN's main
                  warehouse, sending thousands of tons of food aid up in flames. Later,
                  fuel supplies ignited, sending a thick plume of smoke into the air</strong>.</p>
              <p>...Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, called the attack <strong>"indefensible",
                  saying the UN's mission in Gaza "is purely humanitarian, bringing
                  relief to civilians suffering in appalling conditions as a result of
                  the ongoing military actions and restrictions on food and medical
                  supplies entering Gaza</strong>".</p>
              <p>..."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I doubt it. Show evidence
                                          for us(or me) to verify.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Obviously you are not prepared to acknowledge any wrong-doing on the IDF's side even when the death toll is staring right in front of you. I already said, I'm not condoning or siding with Hamas (it is clear that Hamas has committed and is committing acts of terrorism), my case is to present the overlooked side of the story that you and other immovable Israel supporters have willfully ignored. If you cannot even acknowledge wrong when it is committed, how can you claim to be objective (despite all your caustic comments)?</span></p>

              <p>A glimmer of hope befalls Gaza - a possible truce.</p>
              <p>The credit belongs to everyone in the world who is concerned for
                  the innocents on both sides and had prayed and voice out to their
                  leaders to call for a truce.</p>
              <p>But more credit espacially to the moderate muslims who had
                  swayed hardened minds not to support, provide funds or recruits to
                  the terrorist organisation Hamas, which made them realized it is
                  time to stop.</p>
              <p>Should a truce occur, it is at best only fragile. There is much
                  to do to strengthen it.</p>
              <p>Israel must continue to find the best ways to change mindsets
                  and not resort to bullets as the way to solve issues. It will not
                  be an overnight change, but will take time and patience. The rest
                  of the world, non-muslims and muslims as well, must take effort to
                  listen and help too.<br>  <br> Many a grieving mother had watch their children die with an Israeli
                  bullet or bomb, even though the blame falls equally on Hamas too.
                  There must be a time and patience for sensitivities to heal, with
                  an ultimate desire for a better tomorrow for all.</p>

                  peaceful tomorrow, if not for ourselves, at least for the next
                  generation. They are born fully innocent. We, this generation, owe
                  them that much.</strong></p>
              <p>The leaders of Hamas must be brought to trial for their

                  pay the price for their errors and mis-using religion to destroy
                  thousands of lives. The dead and their living loved ones demands of
                  it, if not the millions of faithful muslims around the world shamed
                  by their blasphemous destruction of a peaceful religion..</p>
              <p>The men of Hamas must be given a chance to be properly
                  rehabilated to rejoin and contribute back to society, for they are
                  only following orders and had been mindlessly corrupted by their
                  leaders. The Koran is just, but is merciful to those with remorse
                  as well.</p>
              <p><strong>The world must give strength to the Palestinians to be
                  not afraid of Hamas and stand up to them, turn them in to the

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about the Israeli military and political leadership for their blatant violation of human rights laws? They get off scot-free just for inserting the Hamas excuse? Germans were hanged at Nuremburg for saying they were just obeying orders. Again, I'm not denying Hamas' wrong-doing. Just be fair and acknowledge the war crimes of the IDF and the Israeli leadership.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Because the Palestinians voted Hamas in, they should be punished for it? Collective punishment is a war crime by UN standards.

              <p>But why are they indoctrinated to begin with? If Israel is oppressing and bombing your home, killing your friends and relatives, wouldnt a Palestinian child grow up to hate Israel, making him susceptible to indoctrination? Today, the childhood of most Palestinian children consists of seeing soldiers firing at them, at beholding the splattered remains of human flesh, seeing their friends, relatives and teachers get shot or blown up right in front of them. How can a child have a normal life in such a circumstance? How can anyone?</p>
              <p>You are right, something is wrong with Palestinian society. Psychologically, they are probably the most traumatised society in the world (though I'm not forgotting civil-war ravaged African countries).</p>

              <p>How would you end this cycle then? As I said, Israel is fueling this crisis by bombing and continuing to oppress the Palestinians. But at the same time, the hatred fueled by fundamentalism is also too ingrained into the Palestinian consciousness to be forgotten. But then, why can Palestinian and Arab activists come together with Israeli activists to protest the genocide in Gaza?</p>
              <p>I dont think this conflict will end that easily. Even if some Palestinians and Arabs can unite with Israelis for the sake of peace, the majority of their respective populations will continue to hate each other, incited by those who want to see the conflict continue. I agree when Stevenson said that as long as either people survive, this conflict will continue. Either all the Palestinians or the Israelis will have to be wiped out for this drawn-out conflict to end.</p>

              victims. <strong>About a third of those killed in Gaza have been
              children</strong> - 311, according to the Palestinian Health
              Ministry, 270 according to the B'Tselem human rights group - out of
              the 1,000 total killed as of Wednesday. Around 1,550 of the 4,500
              wounded have also been children according to figures from the UN,
              which says the number of children killed has tripled since the
              ground operation began.<br> <br> This is too large a proportion by any humanitarian or ethical
              standard.</span></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>It is enough to look at the pictures coming from
              Shifa Hospital to see how many burned, bleeding and dying children
              now lie there. History has seen innumerable brutal wars take
              countless lives.<br> <br> <strong>But the horrifying proportion of this war, a third of the
              dead being children, has not been seen in recent
              memory.</strong></span></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p><span><strong>One can say Hamas hides among the
              civilian population, as if the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv is not
              located in the heart of a civilian population, as if there are
              places in Gaza that are not in the heart of a civilian population.
              One can also claim that Hamas uses children as human shields, as if
              in the past our own organizations fighting to establish a country
              did not recruit children.</strong><br> <br> A significant majority of the children killed in Gaza did not die
              because they were used as human shields or because they worked for
              Hamas. <strong>They were killed because the IDF bombed, shelled or
              fired at them, their families or their apartment buildings. That is
              why the blood of Gaza's children is on our hands, not on Hamas'
              hands, and we will never be able to escape that
              responsibility</strong>."</span></p>

              <p>"Video showing injuries consistent with the use of white
              phosphorus shells has been filmed inside hospitals treating
              Palestinian wounded in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gaza">Gaza</a> City.</p>
              <p><strong>Contact with the shell remnants causes severe burns,
              sometimes burning the skin to the bone, consistent with
              descriptions by Ahmed Almi, an Egyptian doctor at the al-Nasser
              hospital in Khan Younis.</strong></p>
              <p>Almi said the entire body of one victim was burned within an
              hour. It was the first time he had seen the effects of what he
              called a "chemical weapon".</p>
              <p>The Israeli military has denied using white phosphorus during
              the assault on Gaza, <strong>but aid agencies say they have no
              doubt it has been used.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"It is an absolute certainty," said Marc Garlasco, a
              senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch. He had seen Israeli
              artillery fire white phosphorus shells at Gaza City, Garlasco
              said.</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Human Rights Watch compares the use of white phosphorus shells
              over Gaza to the impact of cluster munitions, which scatter
              "bomblets" over a wide area. Children may kick and play with a lump
              of phosphorus, stirring up the embers and producing more fire and
              smoke.</p>
              <p><strong>The use of white phosphorus as a weapon – as opposed to
              its use as an obscurant and infrared blocking smoke screen – is
              banned by the UN's third convention on conventional
              weapons</strong>, which covers the use of incendiary devices.
              Though Israel is not a signatory to the convention, its military
              manuals reflect the convention's restrictions on using white
              phosphorus.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Now, what is the difference when
              even though it may be claimed that it is used as a "smokescreen",
              but ends up harming and killing hundreds of civilians. Isn't that a
              definition of a weapon?]</span></p>
              <p>Israel initially claimed that it was not using white phosphorus.
              It later explained that shells being loaded for a howitzer,
              identified from photographs as phosphorus rounds, were empty
              "quiet" shells used for target marking. <strong>However, images of
              exploding shells and showering burning fragments are now
              acknowledged by independent observers as having been
              phosphorus.</strong></p>
              <p>At the centre of the controversy <strong>is the way white
              phosphorus air burst shells have been used in heavily built-up
              urban areas, with an overwhelmingly civilian
              population.</strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">No concrete evidence. If
              IDF is accused of mass-killing civilians, what's the point of IDF
              holding families as human shields?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Massing-killing civilians by
              indiscriminate bombing is different from using families as human
              shields as one is conducted from the air while the other is a
              tactic used by ground troops. Of course you will deny it even
              though Amnesty International accuses Israel of the crime. In the
              first place, you are not willing to accept that the Israeli
              military, just like all militaries, are trained to kill, but in
              this case, the killing is mostly the murder of civilians under the
              guise of killing Hamas members.</span></p>
              <p><strong>"Donatella Rovera</strong>, an Amnesty investigator in
              Israel, is quoted in today's <em>Guardian</em> as saying: "It's
              standard practice for Israeli soldiers to go into a house, lock up
              the family in a room on the ground floor and use the rest of the
              house as a military base, as a sniper's position. That is the
              absolute textbook case of human shields.</p>
              <p>"It has been practised by the Israeli army for many years and
              they are doing it again in Gaza now."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When Hamas does it,
              everyone condemns it. But when Israel engages in it, people like

              alright given how the IDF shows it audacity by appealing to the
              Israeli Supreme Court to continue the practice. That sure makes a
              lot of sense.</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israel
              HAS been caught doing it, and when Amnesty International, working
              to relieve the humanitarian crisis on the ground in the Gaza
              reports on it, of course I would believe it rather than your biased
              reasoning based on ZERO experience that you need proof that you
              wouldnt even accept. And of course Israel doesnt want news of this
              kind getting out, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.imemc.org/article/58369">thats why they have prevented the foreign media from
              accessing the Gaza Strip, even when an Israeli High Court allows
              them access</a>. Again, dont ignore this blatent violation of
              Israel's own Laws and legal system.</span></p>

              that have been hijacked? The video you posted didnt make that
              clear. In the first place, it is a violations of the Geneva
              Convention to deny medical treatment to the wounded, which Israel
              is doing. Then, even if the ambulance has been hijacked, it doesnt
              provide future immunity to Israel to attack the property and
              personnel of international humanitarian organisations. If so, then
              how the hell are the Palestinian people supposed to get

              artillery shells at the UN compound after Hamas militants opened
              fire from the location, a version of events John Ging, director of
              Unwra in Gaza, rejected as "nonsense"<br> <br> Mr Ging said <strong>Israeli shells first hit a courtyard filled
              with refugees, then struck garages and the UN's main warehouse,

              supplies ignited, sending a thick plume of smoke into the

              present the overlooked side of the story that you and other
              immovable Israel supporters have willfully ignored. If you cannot

              <p>Right, as if the UN has a rich history of successfully protecting and managing poor and weak countries with no ways of defending themselves from economically and politically powerful countries.</p>
              <p>Hamas will probably never disband because the western world is perceived as biased against it. If a country or people dont have the ability to defend itself, then we'll just be back at square 1. Israel will start exploiting them and begin the cycle of violence again. Might is right although we like to say it isn't.</p>
              <p>Granted the UN has altruistic intentions (a big assumption), but its capabilities are horribly handicapped by its member contributors. Rather, the UN, the WB/IMF and others are just tools of the western countries to subjugate poorer countries. The UN may be able to MONITOR a crisis, but as to whether it is effective in resolving the crisis impartially is a big question. While a food crisis is being touted, world food production is 1.5 times current consumption. The problem is that the world's poor cannot afford food because of the corporate monopolisation of the world's food supply. While the WB/ IMF calls for Third World countries to abolish their tariffs to allow cheaper imports into their market, domestic food industries are destroyed. In their place, cash crops are produced by giant corporations displacing food production. All while the EU and the US subsidises their agriculture to the tune of billions per year (<strong>EU subsidy/ cow = $2 = Daily wage of the world's 3 billion poor</strong>) and the UN, WB/IMF and the WTO says nothing, or do anything about it.</p>

              <p>This is published by a Saudi Arabia Television network. There is no mention of whether the girl was a Palestinian or not. You just believed the title and didn't watch the content. </p>

              <p>This is published by the Palestinian Media Watch. Do not let the name deceive you because it is not headed by Palestinians, but by Itamar Marcus, a Israeli counter terrorism analyst.  There is already a conflict on interest on producing this video.</p>

              <p>The same, published by the Palestinian Media Watch.</p>
              <p>First and foremost, none of us knows Arabic (Or whatever dialect that the Palestinian people uses) So whether the language used in the video is accurate or not we do not know and i do not understand why there must be English subtitles for a children show for the Palestinian people, and considering that they only have 1 coal fired power plant, with constant breakdowns i find it difficult to believe they even have the electricity power for televisions.</p>
              <p>You don't even question the information you are feeding yourself with, what makes you think you really understand the situation ?</p>
              <p>You have shown great courtesy in being civil in this discussion and i am compelled to do the same. However, i must need to point out the flaws in your reasoning for this debate to be meaningful</p>

              <p>You just post videos and photos under the heading of Palestinian militants.</p>
              <p>Yet i see nothing in the videos that state its origin, or whether if it's even Palestinians in it. Please provide more information to better clarify what we're seeing.  </p>
