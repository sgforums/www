              <p>skywood,</p>
              <p>you are bringing superficial elements into this discussion to substantiate unjustified facts contrary to actual happenings of the war. I quote this:</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">From The Telegraph:</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Two United Nations contractors were killed by an Israeli tank shell today during an official suspension of hostilities designed to allow relief operations in the besieged Gaza Strip.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>If I were to utilize your brand of argument, your perspective infers that it was the military elite who perpetuated the orders for the killings of U.N contractors.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Reports were did not alleged Hamas threw the first punch following the 3 hour truce, however reports that THE IDF resumed air strikes after the end of the ceasefire.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus your accusation that Hamas may have fired during the ceasefire is utterly false. This is a stark reflection of your prejudice. But do not stoop too low by fabricating facts which are proven otherwise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Will the militants stay away from mosque, schools and hospitals in their effort to attack the Isrealis? definitely not"</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">how do you know Hamas are based in schools, mosques and hospitals? Many of the Israeli accusations have not been substantiated. On the other hand, Israeli attacks on civilian infrastructure have been justified by independent sources that no Hamas fighters were present. Notably the U.N school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">" And the justified attack LOOK like atrocities to the reporters because the militants are the one who dies."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Your sentence is grossly incomprehensible. I do not see your intended point here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">I am appalled that a fellow Singapore justifies attacks on innocent civilians. In accordance to the Geneva Convention, no attacks on civilians are justified. You seem to be an ardent supporter of terrorism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Not only Hamas combatants die by Israeli aggression as many, if not more, innocent children, women and civilians are killed as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">
              </span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Military discipline. LEARN."</span></p>
              <p>You are the pot calling the kettle black. You seem to severely lack knowledge and much skill at stringing coherent points across.  However, your assertation that the Israeli soldiers obey orders via the chain of command NOT to attack is proven false. They did attack innocent civilians. Thus it can be deduced that either it was the military elites of the Israeli terrorist army who commanded the attack or there was a severe breakdown in the dissemination of orders, meaning that military discipline of the Israelis was severely lacking.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Mentioning that peace groups advocate for peace is stupid</span>."</p>
              <p>My response: "My emphasis was on the fact that those peace organizations are Jewish and Israeli but they condemn the aggressions of their army."</p>
              <p>You must be blind or rather, blinded by your overzealous support of the Israeli war crimes. Never did I mention peace groups advocate peace. That is stating the obvious. I wonder the level of common sense you possess. Currently, judging from your accounts, it appears to be pretty low.</p>

              <p>Actually, many of the Crusading leaders were out to curry political favour with the Pope (and their populace), and also to get rich going east. The East has always been a hot bed of trade even before the Roman Empire. For Arab rulers, control of Jerusalem gave them extraordinary legitimacy in the eyes of their people. Remember that making yourself look weak invites coups etc. Saladin rose through a coup, for example, with an army at his back.</p>

              <p><br>The Arab/Muslim society and nation is at its lowest point ever since the time of Prophet Muhmmad far distant from the times of the times of the Rashidun,Umayyad,Abbasid caliphates. </p>
              <p>However, there is little choice of response to Israel's continued oppression of the Palestinians. Israel refusal to engage Hamas as well their most trusted aide, the Americans parroting of their stand complicates the situation further. Even a ceaefire is always uneasy and temporary. The Zionist ideology of Greater Israel and the desired restoration of king solomon's temple on the exact coordinates of Al-Aqsa crosses swords with the Muslim sovereignty to Al-Aqsa, the third holiest shrine in Islam. Right-wing members of the knesset have even argued that Muslims already possess 2 holy shrines thus should give in the 3rd for the sake of the holiest shrine in Judaism. A probable amicable solution to this is to hand over the holy land to a 3rd party to ensure its sovereignty which has been proposed by the UN but entirely dismissed by Israel.</p>
              <p>This war has little to do with the Palestinian or Hamas themselves. The elections are coming as well as the Israeli elite needs some divertion from the corruptions of the elite. Moreover, it needs to send a precautionary message to Barack Obama since the President-elect's closests aides have leaked his intention to establish low-level contacts with Hamas. This war was planned more than a year ago and apprved by the knesset before the deadline of the six-month truce. The Israeli justification of self-defence from Qassam's growingly appears to be a gross exaggeration as the war goes on. Moreover, with numerous sources alleging Israel of intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure. The continued oppression by Israeli terrorism of the Palestinians offers them a choice: Stay barely alive or Die tryin'. </p>
              <p>The proposed Arab Initiative was agreed by all parties including Hamas, Hizbullah, centre-left Israelis only to be vehemently put down by the influential rightist of Israeli politics and proponents of the Zionist movement.</p>
              <p>The annexation and declaration of the Jerusalem Law is deemed a violation of international law by the U.N. However, the act alone is ample to humiliate the Arab and Muslim world.</p>
              <p>Barack Obama have promised the world a message of hope. Peace to the holy land shall be his test.</p>

              <p>jojobeach,</p>
              <p>Finally, you have input the some form of neutrality into this discussion. Never once did I asset Hamas is NOT to be blamed for this carnage. My point was pretty simple, Israel is killing with civilians intently although their reports contradicts most independent credible sources reporting from the warzone. Thus, they have to share a bigger portion of the blame due to the killings.</p>
              <p>Yes. Hamas did reject the UN administered truce.</p>
              <p>Reason: Not interested as it was not consulted and the truce fails to meet its requirements.</p>
              <p>However, your purposeful omission of the similar fact that Israel rejected the truth reeks of prejudice.</p>
              <p>Reason: FM Livni  stated that Israel will not allow an external body to dictate the actions of a sovereign nation.</p>
              <p>Which raison d etre is more sensible?</p>
              <p>Moreover, Israeli polls show that 90% of the Jewish majority is in favour of the war. Numerous deductions can be made from this sick reality. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sick reality ?</p>
              <p>The sick reality is that Hamas is determined to see to the destruction of Israel - knowing that it has the support of Iran.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html">population of Israel is 7,112,359 (2008) </a>- what can we make out of your speculative deduction that 90% are infected in your assumed sick reality ?</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes. Hamas did reject the UN administered truce.</span></em></p>

              <p>Do we need to speculate about your position ?</p>
              <p>Was Hamas rejection simply due to the fact that it was not consulted, or was it due to the fact that the resolution passed by the UN Security Council had also required a halt to Hamas' weapon smuggling - even as it also demanded the borders to be open to allow humanitarian aid to get through to the Palestinians in Gaza ?</p>
              <p>Israel's rejection was not only about an external body imposing their will on their sovereign right to protect themselves, but as Israel knows the Hamas mentality better than anyone outside of their neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Israel knows that Hamas will not honor any ceasefire, and will use the lull in warfare to restock their rockets, weapons, and ammunition.</p>
              <p>Can the Israeli and Palestinian not live together, or is the animosity, suspicion, fear, hatred, and anger due to the politics of the Middle-east that are designed not for any win-win outcome ?</p>

              <p>This peace prospect was possible as shown by the other larger numbers of Palestinians living on the West Bank and led by President Abbas - all are willing to make the two state option a reality until it was torpedoed by Hamas unilateral and illegal declaration of a breakaway state of its own in the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>Until this day, none of the Middle-eastern Arab State has accepted nor recognised Hamas authority nor legitimacy, and its continued existence - with the support from Iran - is the cause for the deaths and misery of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and is the single threat to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

              <p><em>If Hamas had abandoned its ambition of destroying Israel, would there be any killings of any number of people ?</em></p>
              <p>Hamas and Israel are alike in so many ways. Israeli extremists and hardliners harbour the same thoughts of each other vis a vis Hamas. Killings occured even before the establishment of Hamas. Israel has been found guilty of numerous terrorist activities ever since 1948. I find the claim that the rationale behind the malicious killings of Palestinians is attributed to Hamas and the ones who does the actual killing is innocent and perceived to be the "oppressed", utterly ridiculous. This is contrary to the typical logical mind of any sane person. Moreover, the Israeli politicians have been planning for this since mid 2007. And the IDF southern command has been pressurizing the central command for the green light to attack. The knesset ratified the incursion before the expiry of the ceasefire date.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Those in the Israeli Government are not extremists like Hamas - as the Israeli Government is legitimately elected through an election process.</p>
              <p>Hamas has no legitimacy as an authority in the Gaza Strip - with the only recognised legal authority being the Government led by President Abbas.</p>
              <p>The Israelis and the IDF has always been planning military reactions according to different scenarious - so does the SAF - is it illegal for a legitimate state to prepare for war in defense of its citizens ?</p>
              <p>The fact that the IDF only attacked with the approval of the Knesset showed that it had legal status, compared to Hamas which was not even authorised by the Palestinian Parliament to attack Israel. </p>
              <p>Hamas no legitimacy as an authority in the Gaza Strip, as seen in the fact that no Arab Government had recognised the existence of Hamas as an authority.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>If Hamas had been able to exercise strategic wisdom and smarter tactics in their confrontation with Israel, would there be any large number of deaths on the Palestinian side compared to the Israelis</em></p>
              <p>I agree with you on this. The casualty ratio will be more proportionate. This is attributed to the ill-equiped Hamas military infrastructure. Militar analysts have pointed out that if the scenario was such Israel were to engaged in a warfare with infrastructure similar to Hamas, their soldiers will be killed.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Have you forgotten the 6-Day War in 1967 - when Israel was outnumbered 10 to 1 ?</p>
              <p>The Israeli military infrastructure was nothing compared to the well-armed military forces of Egypt, Syria, Jordan - that immediately borders Israel - and the military contributions from Islamic countries further away such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.</p>
              <p>Yet, through its own superior intellect, resourcefulness, ingenuity, intelligence, strategy, and tactics of the Israeli civilian and military leaders, and the quality of the individual rank and file of the IDF - Israel was able to wipe out the most dire threat to Israel as a state, and all concluded in 6 days with minimal loss of lives to themselves.</p>
              <p>Israel did not use their own civilian as Human Shield to garner international sympathy, but had instead made the aggressors pay a heavy price despite their better military hardware delivered with the compliments of the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>Why should the cowardly and unintelligent leadership of Hamas resort to hiding amongst the Palestinian civilians in the Gaza ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Hamas will not borrow your line of argument as their agenda is to win the psychological propaganda war over the Israelis - by causing as many Palestinian casualties as possible after each intentional attack towards Israel.</em></p>
              <p>Is this your own opinion or cited from a credible, neutral source?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Do you need to depend on neutral source, or are you incapable of any independent thinking on your own, or do you doubt your own neutrality to be objective ?</p>
              <p>It clearly shows that you are too involved in the conflict for one reason or another.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Is Israel the only one guilty of the killing, or is Hamas not equally guilty for causing the casualties and deaths amongst the innocent Palestinians - by attacking Israel from densely populated areas of Palestinian residences, refugee camps and schools ?</em></p>
              <p>Israel is guilty of the massacre of almost 800 lives, at least half of which are civilians according to U.N sources. Hamas is guilty of the massacre of 13 Israeli, 10 of which are soldiers. The allegation that Hamas largely fires rockets <strong>from within</strong> civilian areas is still a matter of contention. Prior to the ground incursion by the IDF, I doubt Hamas fired their rockets deep from their own territory. This is due to the fact that Hamas rockets reached Ashdod a city 40km from the Gaza Border and Hamas's projectiles have similar reach only. Due to the ground incursion, the fighting occured within the civilian populations.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Does the balance in numbers make the one side less liable then the other ?</p>
              <p>If the Gaza Strip is as densely populated as everyone has claimed, and the Palestinians are packed like rats in the densely packed residences in the Gaza - can there be any space left for Hamas to launch their rockets or fire their motars ?</p>
              <p>Is it not obvious that Hamas is firing from the tightly packed residential neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip ?</p>
              <p>Only those with an agenda to promote Hamas cause will abandon objectivity and neutrality to deny this fact and classify these as "allegations" and "contentions".</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em> Have you not succumbed to propaganda - which is "Hamas organised effort to promote a particular belief" - that Israelis are massacreing the Palestinians ? </em></p>
              <p><em> Are you not regurgitating what is being repeated on behalf of Hamas - despite your declared efforts of being a neutral ?</em></p>
              <p>I find your statement that the fact that the Israelis are massacreing the Palestinians is Hamas perpetuated propaganda most disturbing. Neutrality and factual information is being tarnished by blatant, incomprehensible accusations of being Hamas propaganda tools. Hamas releases nothing more than mere rhetoric to the press, short of relevent statistics and figures. It is the humanitarian organizations and personnel working from Gaza providing us with the relevent statistics and facts. </p>
              <p>I shall not present my facts and substantiations with regards to oil exploitation as I have yet to exercise my due dilligence on this issue. I hope some others there follow this lead and realise that ample research and study neccessitates any legitimate analysis on this conflict.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hamas - like the Hezbollahs in Lebanon - are tools used by the Iranians for their well known agenda to see to the total destruction of Israel.</p>
              <p>For an organisation that has moved away from the main Palestinian body, and with almost all Palestinians in the Gaza being economically impoverished - have you not question where it is getting the funds to purchase all the rockets, explosives, ammo and weapons from ?</p>
              <p>This conflict has been analysed for decades - and missed opportunities for peace have abounded, with the most recent prospects of a two nation state being totalled destroyed by Hamas usurping of the authority in the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>Any peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that result in a two state resolution to their problems, can only result in Iran's interests being affected.</p>
              <p>It will do you well to understand the situation in the Middle-east based on our local community values, and not allow ourselves to be influenced by religious ties, or politics - as their politics has nothing to do with us, nor should we be involved in their form of ethnic links to their religious views, which has always taken precedence over the Theology of their Faith.</p>

              <p>Israel had given the Palestinians time and warning to move out of areas that they are planning to attack, and such early warning could also serve as early notice for Hamas to move out of the danger zones.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Hamas do not reciprocate in similar ways by giving early notice as to where and when the rockets will land onto Europe.</p>
              <p>If someone inform the residents that an attack will occur in District 10, surely the residents there will move out and stay in some other adjacent Districts.</p>
              <p>Hamas have been known to prevent Palestinians from leaving, and has even gone so far as to recurit - the innocent, the uneducated, the mentally imbalanced, the gullible, the young, the emotionally unstable - to act as suicide bombers. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While "propaganda" does not have any negative denotations, I know that people like to use it to connote lies and misinformation. "Propaganda" is a technical word. I dont think Hamas can wage an effective media war because they dont have the means to do so, unlike Israel, which has taken the media war to Youtube. Anyway, how is it not true that Israel is NOT masscreing Palestinians? Your very stand is based on Israeli propaganda. How are you different?</span></p>

              <p>It seems you are less resourceful then Hamas, and just because you are less imaginative then Hamas - others will not underestimate Hamas nor take them for granted in the manner that you prefer to treat Hamas.</p>
              <p>Hamas do not need too much resources to wage an effective media war, as the news chasing reporters are only too eager to enter the war zone to report from the frontlines and to give support to the supposed underdogs.</p>
              <p>During the Vietnam War, the less sophisticated Communist Vietnamese was able to mobilise public opinions, and take advantage of the anti-war sentiments in the USA to drive a wedge between the US Government and those would-be inductees into the US Military. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gaza is in a totally different context. As you know, Hamas does not have anything that resembles a national military. But how are you proving that oil and natural gas doesn't exist when you're just using your preconception that it does not exist to prove it doesn't exist? In the first place, you're not prepared to accept that. I also dont know very much about this, I've just read this information recently. And of course I would believe it until I read anything credible to the contrary.</span></p>

              <p>Immediately after the 6-Day war, the oil rich Arab World had formed an oil cartel, and practically held the world hostage to their agenda to move support away from Israel.</p>
              <p>It is a known fact that Israel depend on imported oil, and if there is oil in the Gaza - do you think that it will not be detected by the Israelis ?</p>

              <p>Did the Israelis resort to terrorism when they were vastly outnumbered by the masses of Arab forces that forced Israel to conduct a pre-emptive war that gave them complete superiority in a 6-Day War in 1967 ?</p>
              <p>It was through superior intellect, creativity, resourcefulness, and discipline in the rank and file of the Israeli population that gave them victory in 1967.</p>
              <p>This is certainly lacking in the Hamas leadership, who had displayed total callousness and irresponsiblity in attacking Israel without preparing themselves and the civilians - in the same manner as the Hezbollah did in Lebanon.</p>
              <p>Instead, Hamas preferred to place the Palestinians in jeogpardy of suffering heavy casualties - all with the hope of winning world public opinion, and to place political pressures onto Israel.</p>
              <p>Force can only result in more force being applied, and as seen - it has led to a constant spiral into the depths of evil ingenuity.</p>
              <p>Why should Hamas sabotage the efforts of the West Bank supporters of their President Abbas - when their community was on the verge of making progress in the peace negotiations with Israel - so as to achieve a peaceful two state existence ?</p>

              <p>Thank you angel, for your thoughtful post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I pride myself as being a humanitarian, and had called for both sides to ceasefire, so that the palestinians and jews may breathe easier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In my pride, i had failed to realized</span> that a ceasefire would only prolong the eventual death of more jews and palestinians, because both sides will only replenish their arsenals and refresh their troops and re-organise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once ready, the killings will only resume.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israel had shown itself capable of restrain, refraining from attacking while suffering for months of missile oppresion and deaths. It will restrain again, so long as Hamas, the terrorists organisation stops its deadly oppression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Israel doesnt, I will be on the forefront to condemn it.</p>
              <p>But more critically, Hamas must either disband or tear up its constitution to murder every living jew and infidel. It's an abomination to humanity in this day and age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The palestinians had suffered much, and will only continue to suffer more if Hamas does not gives up its ideology. The palestininans deserve a better life, they are humans just like the rest of us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There had been huge amount of funds donated to them, by US and the UN organistions since the late 60s till today</span>. But unfortunately, such funds were used to buy killing materials instead of uplifting the palestinians. It must stop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only you moderate muslims can help now</span>. I am sure there will be many others whom are non-muslims who will stand beside you to help the palestinians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We singaporeans are not superhumans. We too were kicked out to a lemon but we made lemonade out of this piece of rock called Singapore, thru intelligence and hardwork, fed our nation and made it wealthy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So too can our fellow humans of the palestinain citizenship.</p>
              <p> <br>We would welcome the peaceful moderate ones to share from us on how to increase intelligence and wealth and obtain a decent life for all instead of war, which Arafat denied them during the 70s when UN tried to provide education and better living conditions, but was rejected and kick out of the refugee camps or threatened, because Arafat needed killers to wipe out the jews.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arafat prefered to keep the population stupid, just as Hamas intends today, to feed their militant machine going.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Almighty intended us humans to have intelligence, which is why we were given brains to process information, know right from wrong. Advance Mathematics and science came from Arabs during the golden years of the good prophet Muhammed's earlier benevolent dynastic rule.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Palestinians can too, evolve back to those days of progress and further elevate the arab world in peace and intelligence, not only for muslims, but for humanity and know the Almighty better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world is big enough and have much resources to be shared. For example, even if Hamas kill everyone of us whom are not muslims but infidels, according to their misinterpretation, it would leave only 1.5million palestinians in the world.</p>
              <p><br> How much can 1.5million palestinians feed on the billions of apples that can be harvested in the world? How much would it have to be left rotten?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The good Prophet Mohammend had never intended to kill the rest of the world or he would have divine intervention to do so during his reign.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But who is Osama and Hamas, these animals, believed and supported by the faithful, to do something which the good prophet had never intended to do? How dare and who are they but fallible mortals to presume the Almighty's Will?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moderate muslims must stand up and challenge the legitimacy and moral authority of these murderous Hamas and other false prophets who are killing the palestinians as well as humanity</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>This is the only way to help palestinians now and uplift their lives thru peace, this i plead on bended knees. Fatalistic belief in predictions of doom can be averted if we act now.</strong><br> </p>

                  suspension of hostilities designed to allow relief operations in
                  the besieged Gaza Strip.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>If I were to utilize
                  your brand of argument, your perspective infers that it was

                  U.N contractors.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Reports were did not alleged
                  Hamas threw the first punch following the 3 hour truce, however
                  reports that THE IDF resumed air strikes after the end of the
                  ceasefire.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus your accusation that
                  Hamas may have fired during the ceasefire is utterly false. This is
                  a stark reflection of your prejudice. But do not stoop too low by
                  fabricating facts which are proven otherwise.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">how do you know Hamas are
                  based in schools, mosques and hospitals? Many of the Israeli
                  accusations have not been substantiated. On the other hand, Israeli
                  attacks on civilian infrastructure have been justified by
                  independent sources that no Hamas fighters were present. Notably
                  the U.N school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">" And the justified attack LOOK

                  incomprehensible. I do not see your intended point here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">I am appalled that a fellow
                  Singapore justifies attacks on innocent civilians. In accordance to
                  the Geneva Convention, no attacks on civilians are justified. You
                  seem to be an ardent supporter of terrorism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Not only Hamas combatants die
                  by Israeli aggression as many, if not more, innocent children,
                  women and civilians are killed as well.</span></p>

                  lack knowledge and much skill at stringing coherent points
                  across.  However, your assertation that the Israeli soldiers
                  obey orders via the chain of command NOT to attack is proven false.
                  They did attack innocent civilians. Thus it can be deduced that
                  either it was the military elites of the Israeli terrorist army who
                  commanded the attack or there was a severe breakdown in the
                  dissemination of orders, meaning that military discipline of
                  the Israelis was severely lacking.</p>

              <p>When someone else's report or article expresses opinion that is in line their sentiments, it will be touted as authoritative statements that support their views. Any report or article that is critical of their views will be touted as foreign trash.</p>
              <p>When the omniscience [archangel] ask you "What do you think of the Isreal/Palestine conflict?" The subject is not important, as the emphasis is on the "you".</p>
              <p>Are you going to produce UN reports, and other peoples' opinion?</p>
              <p>Read them, digest them, and please come up with your own opinion and assessment.</p>
              <p>You are not the product of one infusion of information, but the sum total of all the information gathered through the years. Therefore it is biasness on your part that make you select information agreeable to you, and label information otherwise as that of staple foreign lies.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>My Islamophobia is garnered through the years of observation of Muslim neighbours, friends, colleagues, countries, governments and news reports. And not through staple American reports. Individually I have no quarrel with Muslims, but collectively I do not trust the "jemmiah islamiah". They are evil, like the communist of the Stalin, Mao era. The grassroots are the sheeps, it is the higher hierachy that are wolf in sheep clothings. Everywhere, when a Muslim community is small, they behave peacefully, but when they grow, they become belligerent, discriminatory, and oppressive and imperialistic contrary to the tenets promised in their theology. Their defence is  justification, divine justification. Never once acknowledging that it is their yokel mentality that is taken advantage of by those who have political agenda through religion. Belief, as that is what relligion actually is, is a strong motivational force.</p>
              <p>Can there be peace between Isreal and Palestine? My opinion is no. Because the of the hijacked religion of the majority of the Palestinian people. Why is the religion of peace unable to procure peace in the Middle East? Simple, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I see</span> it is because there is great avenue for political hatred in the faith. This explosive force is acknowledged by the political leaders of our country, and of those around us.</p>
              <p>My personal opinion expressed here could invite enforcement actions, therefore the qualification "my personal opinion". And believe me, I am holding back.</p>

              <p>Should we be constantly amazed by the empty intellect of one that is supposed to have had the benefit of passing through the halls of Oxford ?</p>
              <p>Did the Israelis resort to terrorism when they were vastly outnumbered by the masses of Arab forces that forced Israel to conduct a pre-emptive war that gave them complete superiority in a 6-Day War in 1967 ?</p>
              <p>It was through superior intellect, creativity, resourcefulness, and discipline in the rank and file of the Israeli population that gave them victory in 1967.</p>
              <p>This is certainly lacking in the Hamas leadership, who had displayed total callousness and irresponsiblity in attacking Israel without preparing themselves and the civilians - in the same manner as the Hezbollah did in Lebanon.</p>
              <p>Instead, Hamas preferred to place the Palestinians in jeogpardy of suffering heavy casualties - all with the hope of winning world public opinion, and to place political pressures onto Israel.</p>
              <p>Force can only result in more force being applied, and as seen - it has led to a constant spiral into the depths of evil ingenuity.</p>
              <p>Why should Hamas sabotage the efforts of the West Bank supporters of their President Abbas - when their community was on the verge of making progress in the peace negotiations with Israel - so as to achieve a peaceful two state existence ?</p>

              <p>This is a zero sum game and might is right. It will only end when Israel exterminates the entire palestinian population or when the palestinians drive the Israelis to the sea, neither of which is likely to happen soon.</p>

              <p>Israel has lost the shield of moral righteousness. Its massacre of civilians, its blatant attacks on UN refugee shelters, schools, aid workers, reporters, children, women, elderly, mosques and churches all show that Israel is a rogue state. Once Israel loses all pretensions of humanity then humanity will lose all mercy for the Zionists. Nuclear technology is being proliferated within the Islamic world. The day the Zionists achieve what they think will be total victory, will be the day when the Sword of Damocles shall fall. The logic is very clear and the path to peace is open but the Zionists choose the fate of wild beasts.</p>

              <p>True....it's not yours unless you can defend it. And the palestinians will try to regain their land by rockets and suicide bombings. If Menachem Begin can become prime minister by bombing the King David hotel, Khaled Meshaal may well be president by sending rockets into Israeli schools.</p>
              <p>If they fail, they are terrorists. If they eventually succeed, they are freedom fighters. Might is right!</p>
