              <h1>What You Don’t Know About Gaza</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="byline">By RASHID KHALIDI</div>
              <div class="byline"><br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NEARLY everything you’ve
              been led to believe about Gaza is wrong. Below are a few essential
              points that seem to be missing from the conversation, much of which has
              taken place in the press, about Israel’s attack on the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="bold">THE GAZANS </span>Most of the people living in
              Gaza are not there by choice. </span>The majority of the 1.5 million people
              crammed into the roughly 140 square miles of the Gaza Strip belong to
              families that came from towns and villages outside Gaza like Ashkelon
              and Beersheba. They were driven to Gaza by the Israeli Army in 1948.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="bold">THE OCCUPATION </span>The Gazans have lived
              under
              Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967.</span> Israel is still
              widely considered to be an occupying power, even though it removed its
              troops and settlers from the strip in 2005. Israel still controls
              access to the area, imports and exports, and the movement of people in
              and out. Israel has control over Gaza’s air space and sea coast, and
              its forces enter the area at will. As the occupying power, Israel has
              the responsibility under the Fourth Geneva Convention to see to the
              welfare of the civilian population of the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="bold">THE BLOCKADE </span>Israel’s blockade of the
              strip, with the support of the United States and the European Union,
              has grown increasingly stringent since Hamas won the Palestinian
              Legislative Council elections in January 2006.</span> Fuel, electricity,
              imports, exports and the movement of people in and out of the Strip
              have been slowly choked off, leading to life-threatening problems of
              sanitation, health, water supply and transportation.</p>
              <p>The blockade has subjected many to unemployment, penury and
              malnutrition. This amounts to the collective punishment — with the
              tacit support of the United States — of a civilian population for
              exercising its democratic rights.</p>
              <p><span class="bold">THE CEASE-FIRE </span>Lifting the blockade,
              along
              with a cessation of rocket fire, was one of the key terms of the June
              cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. This accord led to a reduction in
              rockets fired from Gaza from hundreds in May and June to a total of
              less than 20 in the subsequent four months (according to Israeli
              government figures). The cease-fire broke down when Israeli forces
              launched major air and ground attacks in early November; six Hamas
              operatives were reported killed.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="bold">WAR CRIMES</span> The targeting of civilians,
              whether by Hamas or by Israel, is potentially a war crime.</span> Every human
              life is precious. But the numbers speak for themselves: Nearly 700
              Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed since the
              conflict broke out at the end of last year. In contrast, there have
              been around a dozen Israelis killed, many of them soldiers. Negotiation
              is a much more effective way to deal with rockets and other forms of
              violence. This might have been able to happen had Israel fulfilled the
              terms of the June cease-fire and lifted its blockade of the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This war on the people of Gaza isn’t really about rockets. Nor is it
              about “restoring Israel’s deterrence,” as the Israeli press might have
              you believe. Far more revealing are the words of Moshe Yaalon, then the
              Israeli Defense Forces chief of staff, in 2002: “The Palestinians must
              be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness
              that they are a defeated people.”</strong></span></p>

              <p>JoJobich,</p>
              <p>Hamas and the Gazans seek the lifting of the bloackade of its boundaries which Israel have agreed before during the previous truce but failed to hold on to their truce. You really think Israel wants to see an end to this violence before the febuary elections?</p>
              <p>Both parties refuse to stop their fires. Not simply Hamas. Get simple facts right.</p>
              <p>You keep on avoiding my questions in my previous posts to you.</p>
              <p>Stop providing inchorent, contentious analogies. What's with you and children? I could give you a thousand different analogies but I would not succumb to your shallow arguments</p>
              <p>I am educated as one which is why I do not think much of you as a fellow competent analyst.</p>
              <p>As I have mentioned, you reiterate my hunch that you are either very young or very immature.</p>

              <p>gackt13,</p>
              <p>I reiterate my argument, which I have substantiated with coherent and rational justifications, that the Zionists are mainly responsible for the deaths of numerous civilians in Gaza. I do not need to repeat. To get the notion, please refer to my previous posts.</p>
              <p>You accuse my arguments find basis in conspiracy theories. Prove it. Prove the facts and reasons I have put forward are false.</p>
              <p>When did I every mention or even infer that the U.S or such have some sort of conspiracy against the Muslims? Your accusation is flabbergasting. Everyone knowledgable enough knows the fact that U.S mainstream media aligns itself towards the Israeli perspective due to numerous elites within the industry and the lobby being jews.</p>
              <p>Your accusations are nothing more than the rantings of someone who tries to insult others' attempt at having a proper and fruitful debate.</p>
              <p>I am amused albeit saddened at the few people here who are cancerous to intellectual dscourse that some others are having here. It reflects much on yourself gackt13.</p>
              <p>Why not if you attempt to direct baseless accusations towards me, challenge me to a proper debate.</p>

              <p>The superiority or inferiority of military training bestowed upon both combatants is definately not cause to believe who initiated the fire after the ceasefire ended.</p>
              <p>Don't tell me superficiality of military prowess is the basis for your judgements? If so, it is terribly degrading for you.</p>
              <p>I would believe independent sources who reports from within the happenings itself, sources and individuals with no ties to both entities.</p>
              <p>My citations orginates from independent reports from the U.N as well as humanitarian agencies reporting from Gaza.</p>
              <p>That is,thusfar, the only sources of neutral, verifiable news from where we can obtain information. This is due to the fact that Israel has blocked access to journalist and media organizations to the war.</p>
              <p>My emphasis was on the fact that those peace organizations are Jewish and Israeli but they condemn the aggressions of their army. I seriously think it is a highly valid point in the debate on whom is to bear the large responsiblity of the deaths of innocent Palestinians. 'LAME' is talk you reserve for conversations with buddies at starbucks rather than a proper discourse. If you had intended to disagree, you should have stated the point invalid and substantiate with proper arguments and examples.</p>
              <p>You shoudl read my previous posts where I elaborated the atrocities commited by the Israeli attacks on the civlians and the sources are the U.N and humanitarian organizations reporting from Gaza. Inclusively, there are several journalists from Europe who managed to sneak through the Israeli bloakade. Further elaboration and references can be found from my previous posts.</p>
              <p>However, many mistake the 911 to be an unprovoked and un-facilitated attack. However, the discussions surrounding 911 runs deeper than what you read on the surfaces.</p>

              <p><strong>Israel's Onslaught on Gaza: Criminal, for Sure; But Also Stupid </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: xx-small;">By ALEXANDER COCKBURN </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #990000; font-size: small;">I</span><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">n
                  contrast to the grim forecasts of many fine contributors to this site
                  over the past days, your CounterPunch editors have been inclined to
                  take the view that Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, appalling though the
                  carnage has been, is not only a crime but a blunder, like the attack on
                  Lebanon in 2006, which demonstrated Israel’s military weakness, and the
                  corruption of its armed forces after long years of bravely tormenting
                  unarmed Palestinian peasants at check points, sawing down their olive
                  groves and crushing their homes with bulldozers and high explosive.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  left has a tendency to demonize its enemies in terms of proficiency in
                  administering their dastardly onslaughts. Through this optic, the
                  claims of the arms manufacturers are always taken at face value,
                  whether about the effectiveness of bunker busters, or devices to detect
                  Hamas’ Qassams. In our latest newsletter we print a long interview with
                  Hamas’ leader in Damascus, Khaled Meshal, conducted by CounterPuncher
                  Alya Rea, myself and others, including former US Senator James
                  Abourezk. Meshal made a case for Israel’s decline in military
                  effectiveness: </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Meshal:
                  Since 1948, if we want to draw a curve of Israel’s progress, do you
                  think that this curve is still heading up, or maybe is at a plateau, or
                  is heading down? I believe that the curve is now in descent. And today,
                  the military might of Israel is not capable of concluding matters to
                  Israel’s satisfaction. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Since 1948, you may notice that Israel has
                  defeated 7 armies. In ’56 they defeated Egypt. In ’67 they defeated 3
                  countries: Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. In ’73, the war was somewhat equal
                  in both sides between Egypt and Israel, if not for Nixon’s airlift  to
                  Israel’s forces at that time, the map of the world would be different.
                  In ’82 Israel defeated the PLO in Beirut. </strong></span></span></p>
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But
                  since ’82, 26 years ago, Israelis has not won any war. They did not
                  defeat the Palestinian resistance, and they did not defeat the Lebanese
                  resistance. Since that time, Israel has not expanded but has
                  contracted. They have withdrawn from southern Lebanon and from Gaza.
                  These are indicators that the future is not favorable to Israel.</strong></span> Then
                  today Israel, with all its military capabilities – conventional and
                  unconventional – are not enough to guarantee Israel’s security. Today,
                  with all these capabilities, they can’t stop a simple rocket from being
                  launched from Gaza.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hence
                  the big question is, can military might ensure security? Hence, we may
                  say that when Israel refuse the Arab and the Palestinian offer, a state
                  of Palestine on the border of 1967, Israel is losing a big opportunity.
                  Some years down the road, a new Palestinian generation, new Arab
                  generations, may not accept those conditions, because the balance of
                  power may not be in Israel’s favor. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hamas,
                  as I remarked last week,  has been greatly strengthened by the current
                  attack and the status of President Abbas reaffirmed as a spineless
                  collaborator with Israel; Mubarak likewise; Syria and Turkey alienated
                  from Western designs; Hezbollah and Iran vindicated by the world
                  condemnation of Israel’s barbarous conduct. For months Israel besieged
                  Gaza, starving its civilian inhabitants of essential supplies with no
                  effective international reproach. It’s hard to take dramatic
                  photographs of an empty medicine bottle, but  easy to film a bombed out
                  girl’s dorm or a Palestinian mother weeping over the bodies of her five
                  dead daughters, featured on the front page of the <em>Washington Post</em> two weeks ago. Efforts to keep  reporters out of Gaza have not been
                  entirely successful, and both UN and Red Cross workers on the ground
                  have sent outraged reports denouncing Israel’s barbarities. They have
                  also been fierce State Department memos from USAID workers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As
                  we go into the weekend,  an admittedly toothless resolution in the UN
                  calling for a ceasefire was not vetoed by the US. The UK Guardian ran a
                  story on Friday suggesting that my view expressed last week, that there
                  were two ways to read Obama’s initial silence about the onslaughts –
                  which he was finally forced to break after Israel killed nearly 50
                  women and children trying to shelter in the UN School. The Guardian
                  story began:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  incoming Obama administration  is prepared to abandon George Bush's
                  ­doctrine of isolating Hamas by establishing a channel to the Islamist
                  organisation, sources close to the transition team say.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  move to open contacts with Hamas, which could be initiated through the
                  US intelligence services, would represent a definitive break with the
                  Bush presidency's ostracising of the group. The state department has
                  designated Hamas a terrorist organisation, and in 2006 Congress passed
                  a law banning US financial aid to the group.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  Guardian has spoken to three people with knowledge of the discussions
                  in the Obama camp. There is no talk of Obama approving direct
                  diplomatic negotiations with Hamas early on, but he is being urged by
                  advisers to initiate low-level or clandestine approaches, and there is
                  growing recognition in Washington that the policy of ostracizing Hamas
                  is counter-productive. A tested course would be to start ­contacts
                  through Hamas and the US intelligence services, similar to the secret
                  process through which the US engaged with the PLO in the 1970s. Israel
                  did not become aware of the contacts until much later.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">One
                  has to caution that there could be more than one reason for such a leak
                  from the transition team – including an alert to the Israel lobby to
                  start piling on the pressure to head off any such contacts. With men
                  like Emanuel and “special assistant on the Middle East” Dan Kurtzer at
                  Obama’s elbow, I imagine the Israeli embassy won’t have much difficulty
                  in monitoring Obama’s plans, though his National Security Advisor, Jim
                  Jones, apparently once filed a report to Condoleezza Rice with
                  criticisms  of Israel’s conduct so harsh that the whole report was
                  hastily deep-sixed.</span></p>

              <p>The land that was taken from Arabs from Israel, first by the UN during the formation of Israel and later by Israel itself during subsequent wars. 4 million Palestinians have lost their homes in Israel, driven out by the Jews for the past 60 years. Do they not have a right to return to their homes? A right which Israel has constantly denied against the ruling of an earlier UN resolution.</p>
              <p>So Hamas should not use rockets and suicide bombers against Israel...but what other weapons do they have against Israel? Let the palestinians have the same F16 jets and laser-guided bombs and then require them to target only military installations in Israel.</p>

              <p>that is not military superiority. it is the likelihood for soldiers to obey orders. LEARN. well oiled war machine can and will obey orders to not attack. Rag tag militants who randomly lob rockets into neighbouring countries is definitely MORE likely to attack without orders, even during cease fires.</p>
              <p>and they are also more likely to attack from mosque, schools and even hospitals, and the Isreali will than be justified to attack these buildings. Will the militants stay away from mosque, schools and hospitals in their effort to attack the Isrealis? definitely not. And the justified attack LOOK like atrocities to the reporters because the militants are the one who dies.</p>
              <p>Military discipline. LEARN.</p>
              <p>Mentioning that peace groups advocate for peace is stupid.</p>

              <p>Throughout the two-week bombardment of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip most journalists have been kept out by the Israeli government on
              the pretext of security. And the Israelis are pleased with the results.</p>
              <p>Foreign
              journalists have been forced to report without getting to the detail of
              what is going on. That meant, at least in the early days of the
              bombardment, that reporters who would have been in Gaza were instead
              reporting from Israeli towns and cities under fire from Hamas, and
              Israeli officials found it easier to get themselves in front of a
              television camera.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Israeli official told me they were
              delighted at a BBC TV correspondent broadcasting from Ashkelon in a
              flak jacket, reinforcing the impression that the Israeli city is a war
              zone</span> when there is more chance of being hit by a car than a rocket. The
              notable exception is al-Jazeera TV, which has a bureau in Gaza City and
              has been broadcasting live from there.</p>
              <p>Danny Seaman, head of the
              Israeli government's press office, who has described foreign
              journalists as a "figleaf" for Hamas, says<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the exclusion of reporters
              from Gaza has worked in Israel's favour as it has forced a greater
              focus on Israel's side of the story...</span></p>

              <p>Go and ask any jew if their father Abraham was born in the land now called Israel. Any jewish rabbi will tell you no, their ancestor came from Ur of the Chaldees, in Babylonia or present-day Iraq. The jewish ancestry has more in common with Sadam Hussein than the Hittites, Jebusites and other tribes that inhabit the land on either side of the Jordon River. If present day palestinians should be sent to Saudi Arabia and Jordan, then perhaps the Israelis should be returned to where they originated in Iraq. </p>
