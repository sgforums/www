              <p>Jarhum,</p>
              <p><br> I am glad that you admitted yourself that 'there is no
              uniformed  essence of history and that history is
              perceptive', by your own words, in your reply to googomuck.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enough said. You admitted
              to twisting historical facts to suit your twisted arab propaganda.
              Thank you. At least others know where you stand.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do not under-estimate others who disagree with your
              propaganda as you continually do here, arab propagandist. You
              have freedom of speech here, regardless of whether you are a
              singaporean or a foriegner claiming to be singaporean, BuT do not
              abuse it. Then, its still your perogative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, 'Israeli sources' is not to be believed? And 'Palestinian
              sources' MUST be believed? Are you implying that? EVEN UN dare not
              confirm 100% that there were no militants in the said school, you
              dare, arab propagandist?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas has a 'right' to bomb innocent jews in Israel, as well as
              as to hide amongst civilian in civilian centres, putting innocent
              Gaza people in the line of fire as well? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is that what you are
              claiming?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you truly want to preserve life, you would have condemned
              Hamas actions, for it is an abomination to the Koran revered by
              Muslims around the world, including Arabs. But you prefer to use
              politically correct soft words such as 'overblown',etc, to propound
              further the arab propaganda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only by condemning them will sympathizers, funds and recruits be
              halted. They are destroying the religion anyway, and had used
              religion twisted to serve their interests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Hamas realizes they have no support, no more recruits
              and money to buy arms which should had been used to buy food
              for Gaza folks in the first place, they will quit armed struggle,
              and meet on the negotiation table without killing anyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no dearth of humanitarian aid in the meantime for Gaza
              when a truce rings out, or even when peace is achieved. They are
              humans still who would helped out, so long as their money is NOT
              use to kill others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If that is truly what they seek instead of violence and wiping
              out the human race, beginning with the jews and drawing everyone
              else into the conflict.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wars can only be financed. No money, no talk. Hot air from the
              mouth will kill no one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do remove your blinkers if you truly want to share a common
              ground, which is the preservation of lives right now in Gaza!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Using your sweet words here -  I too,  would
              unconditionally apologize in the event that my statements are
              wrongly interpreted by one of unintellectual capacity</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Hamas IS A TERRORIST organization. Enough said.</p>
              <p>They are the ones that cause harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, sacrificing their own people for their extreme thoughts.</p>
              <p>I don't see how their actions can be sympathized with, or supported. I don't see Hamas having any legitimate right in defending Gaza because their extreme idealogy is not shared by the normal arabs</p>
              <p>It's like saying a person sympathizes with Al Qaeda for taking down the Twin Towers and causing 6000+ loss of lives, because Americans kill more Arabs than that 6000+ people who lost their lives.</p>

If you want to call something or someone that, at least justify your accusation. The most punishing self-admission that appeared in your post describing his website is "politically incorrect".

              <p><br> Do you need to be seen to take the side of Hamas or
              white-wash their actions - after the many views you have
              offered that clamour for the understanding of Hamas
              acts of atrocities, while turning a total blind eye to the callous
              attitude of Hamas in placing Palestinian lives in danger ?</p>
              <p>As was mentioned before, it takes a great leap of imagination to
              understand the purpose of your efforts to compare  the
              treatment of Jews in WW2 to be of any parallel to the
              sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
              <p>Why do you not compare the living conditions of the Palestinians
              in the West Bank to the self-imposed pain and sufferings preferred
              by the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - by supporting the Iranian
              financed Hamas ?</p>
              <p>Why did the Israelis not walled up the Palestinians in the West
              Bank ?</p>
              <p>Did Hamas make any announcement to Israelis when and where their
              rockets and mortar shells will land ?</p>
              <p>At least the Israeli had announced their intention and had given
              the Hamas fighters time to move out of the intended target
              area.</p>
              <p>Did the Israelis prevent the Palestinians from leaving the
              targetted area ?</p>
              <p>Do you know that the Gaza Strip can be seen on the World Map,
              while this little red dot can hardly even be seen ?</p>
              <p>Yet this little red dot can accomodate 4.5 million Singaporeans
              with enough space to move out of specific areas to allow a
              gathering of 300,000 persons at any one time - who are you trying
              to kid that the Palestinians are prevented from leaving a targetted
              area, and have no place to run to avoid Israeli counter attacks
              ?</p>
              <p>Have I been dehumanised, or have you allowed yourself to be
              suckered by Hamas propaganda and allow yourself to think that
              everyone is numbed and dehumanised by the supposed atrocities -
              that are largely and purposefully self-inflicted ?</p>
              <p>If you recogonised the legitimate claim of Israel to retaliate
              against Hamas unprovoked and provocative acts of attacking Israel -
              why did you not also extend that understanding by questioning Hamas
              agenda of launching such attacks from densely populated Palestinian
              areas ?</p>
              <p>Why do you not question Hamas agenda in using their Palestinian
              civilians as Human Shield to cover their cowardly acts ?</p>
              <p>Did the Palestinian population in Gaza voted Hamas into
              power, or did the Hamas politician decide to take matters into
              their own hands and evicted from the Gaza Strip the legitimately
              elected PLA Government of President Abbas - and unilaterraly
              declare the Gaza Strip to be led by a Hamas Government ?</p>
              <p>Amazingly, no Middle-eastern country has recognised this Hamas
              Government except for Iran - who treat this Hamas Government as no
              more then a political pawn.</p>
              <p>If this is not another one of your acts of succumbing to
              propaganda ?</p>
              <p>You must be naive to expect Israel to give solace and
              comfort to Hamas and the Palestinians population that remained
              behind and give material and morale support to Hamas - when Hamas
              has declared their objective of destroying the State of Israel
              ?</p>
              <p>Is there any use for your seemingly moralistic statement in red
              - when you have already succumbed to Hamas propaganda ?</p>
              <p>It is plain stupidity to believe that Hamas or their
              Iranian backers will have any means to destroy Israel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the Malaysia-Singapore analogy flawed, when the intertwined
              history of these two countries over the last 40 odd years have led
              to the edge of a local conflict ?</p>
              <p>Prior to the recently concluded Pedra
              Branca issue, there were a few incidents which had resulted in
              Singapore Coast Guard and Navy vessels rubbing hulls with the
              Malaysian Navy and Police Patrol Boats.</p>
              <p>The war of words in the 1963 and 1969 had resulted in racial
              riots that spread across our state borders, and more recent events
              had even the previous PM Mahathir on different occassions to have
              been reported to be threatening to shut off the water pipes, bomb
              Singapore, and even to unilaterally cut off the Causeway to build a
              new link bridge on their side of the territories.</p>
              <p>All these acts would have constituted Acts of Wars - and the
              venom in the relationship had even permeated into the Malaysian
              Armed Forces, which even had a senior officer - in the rank of
              a Major - to contribute an article to one of their military journal
              that promoted the poisoning of our resevoirs as the opening gambit
              in any war.</p>
              <p>If you believe that the MAF and the SAF are equally matched,
              those who are more knowledgeable than you will probably excuse your
              ignorance, but will not forgive you - if you are a politician - for
              making any wrong gamble in any miscalculation due to your
              ignorance.</p>
              <p>It is just as well that you remain harmless in this Speaker's
              Corner and indulge in all your speculations based on propaganda and
              misinformation.</p>
              <p>Such misinformation will be similar to the sudden publicity
              given to the sudden discovery of oil and gas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that the Israelis do not have any
              earlier knowledge of this event and willingly give up the Sinai
              Peninsular and the Gaza Strip after a hard fought 6-Day War in the
              mid-1960s - when oil supply was cut off that resulted in the first
              ever oil crisis in the World ?</p>
              <p>If the Palestinians have no where to run in an Israeli attack,
              where do you expect the Palestinians in the tight Gaza space to
              move to when the oil and gas in the Gaza Strip will need to be
              exploited ?</p>

              <p>Enough. Let me simplify this to some Yes/No questions.</p>
              <p>Do I agree that Hamas should be condemned for launching rockets into Israel? Yes</p>
              <p>Do I agree that Hamas should stop the violence against Israel? Yes</p>
              <p>Do I agree that Israel has the right to self-defence <em>when it is attacked</em>? Yes</p>
              <p>I'm not siding with either side as you think I am. Because most of you are either condemning Israel or Hamas, it results in an unbalanced view. Let's see you answer some questions:</p>
              <p>Do you agree that Israel has been enforcing a blockade on Gaza, preventing food, fuel and medical supplies for most of the time after Hamas won the 2006 elections? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Do you agree that Israel has control over the Gazan borders? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Do you agree that a country which has no control over its borders has no real sovereignty at all? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Why does Israel treat the West Bank's Palestinians and Gaza's differently? Well, for one, the Fatah government is subservient to the Israelis. If Fatah ever dared to step out of line like Hamas, the West Bank will definitely get invaded.</p>
              <p>Why did Israel blockade Gaza after Hamas won in a democratic election? Not Yes/No, but surely you can handle structured questions.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"[Jimmy] Carter said that election was "orderly and fair"
              and Hamas triumphed, in part, because it was "shrewd in selecting
              candidates," whereas a divided, corrupt Fatah ran multiple candidates
              for single seats. </span></p>
              <p><span class="lead">
              </span></p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Far from encouraging Hamas's move into parliamentary politics,
              Carter said the US and Israel, with European Union acquiescence, has
              sought to subvert the outcome by shunning Hamas and helping Abbas to
              keep the reins of political and military power. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"That action was criminal," he said in a news conference after his speech."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">- Carter: Stop favoring Fatah over Hamas- <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181813074587&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181813074587&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull</a></span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Then, considering that the nature of both parties' weapons are different, even if Hamas doesnt announce rocket launchings, like it will, Israeli casualties from their rocket attacks pale in comparison to the warned Israeli airstrikes. Does it really take a lot of thinking to get the idea that the impact from thousand-pound bombs is massively larger than homemade rockets? The death toll on both sides already demonstrates that fact.</p>
              <p>As I said, launching rockets into Israel is despicable. But, try to put yourself in their shoes. If a foreign power was oppressing you and your people, would you not resist? <strong>Saying that they purposely launched rockets from civilian-populated areas (where are there no civilians in Gaza?) is like saying that the Viet Cong in South Vietnam purposely used their own people as a shield without any scruples. Its not like they are foreign fighters. What would you call ordinary Gazans rising up against a foreign power that is invading their country?</strong> Let's say, a Gazan teacher has had enough with tolerating Israel's inhumane treatment of Gazans and decides to aid Hamas, his democratically elected government. Israeli intelligence spots him and bombs his school. Was it his intention to get the school bombed in order to get sympathy for Hamas? I dont think so. Resisting against the Israeli occupiers was his priority. Can you understand this?</p>
              <p>Since you already admit that Hamas nor Iran could ever destroy Israel, then why all the using "Destroy Israel" rhetoric from the Iranians or Palestinians as justification for the bombing?</p>
              <p>If you want to side with Hamas, then do you claim that Israel's hands are clean? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Do you agree that more people have died from Israel's attacks than from Hamas' attacks? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Do you agree that Israel was the first one to break the ceasefire on Nov 4? Yes/No</p>
              <p>This has already been brought up many times and people'll say that Hamas broke it first by an ( implied passively aggressive) act of contructing a tunnel which would have been used to attack and kidnap Israeli troops and citizens. That's what was put out by the MSM. <strong>Think about it, for a country which has been blockaded and deprived of food, fuel and medical supplies, would they have tried to break the blockade by getting supplies in through a tunnel?</strong> Anyway, <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=KntmpoRXFX4">CNN has already confirmed that Israel was the one to break the ceasefire.</a></p>
              <p>I cant emphasis this enough, but it doesnt seem to be expressed well, probably because of much unconscious bias- it is wrong for both parties to act in this way. But, overlooking the fact that Israel has caused more casualties than Hamas would mean acknowledging that Palestinian lives are worth less than Israeli ones. Instead of just condemning Hamas as "terrorist", which by the way, is just a word to describe someone who uses a particular technique of 'persuasion', why not look at the way Israel treats the Palestinians.</p>
              <p>Finally, <em>I do not say that Singapore and Malaysia are equally matched</em>.</p>
              <p>Do you agree that Singapore and Malaysia <strong>both</strong>, have air forces, navies and land armies that are equipped to modern standards? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Do you agree that Israel is the Middle-East's superpower? Yes/No</p>
              <p>Do you agree that Hamas in Gaza has no air force or navy, and has only guerilla land forces? Yes/No</p>
              <p>I didnt know that there were oil and natural gas in Gaza till the  recent invasion put the spotlight on the Palestinians. I dont know whether the Israelis knew or didnt know about this either. Do you know? The article below states that it was discovered in 2000.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you know that Gaza does not have oil and natural gas? Yes/No</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Similarly, do you know that Gaza has oil and natural gas? Yes/No</strong></p>
              <p>Dont you think rejecting new information despite not having any evidence to the contrary demonstrates a narrow mind?</p>
              <p>It is precisely because the Gazans have a natural resource to fuel their development that the Israeli attack is timed as such. Of course, the Israelis do not want to allow that resource to benefit the Palestinian people. If you're oppressing a people, would it be in your interest for them to be lifted out of poverty? Would it be in your interest for them to achieve the means to sustain their own economy?</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The military invasion of the
              Gaza Strip by Israeli Forces bears a direct relation to the control and
              ownership of strategic offshore gas reserves. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is a war of conquest. Discovered in 2000, there are extensive gas reserves off the Gaza coastline. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="http://www.bg-group.com/OurBusiness/WhereWeOperate/Pages/pgIsraelandAreasofPalestinianAuthority.aspx">British Gas (BG Group)</a> and its partner, the Athens based </span><a href="http://www.ccc.gr/"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Consolidated Contractors International Company</span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> (CCC) owned by Lebanon's Sabbagh and Koury families, were granted oil
              and gas exploration rights in a 25 year agreement signed in November
              1999 with the Palestinian Authority. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The rights to the offshore gas
              field are respectively British Gas (60 percent); Consolidated
              Contractors (CCC) (30 percent); and the Investment Fund of the
              Palestinian Authority (10 percent). (Haaretz, October 21,  2007). <br><br>The
              PA-BG-CCC agreement includes field development and the construction of
              a gas pipeline.(Middle East Economic Digest, Jan 5, 2001). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The BG licence covers the
              entire Gazan offshore marine area, which is contiguous to several
              Israeli offshore gas facilities. (See Map below). It should be noted
              that 60 percent of the gas reserves along the Gaza-Israel coastline
              belong to Palestine.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The BG Group drilled two wells in 2000: <strong>Gaza Marine-1 and Gaza Marine-2. </strong>Reserves
              are estimated by British Gas to be of the order of 1.4 trillion cubic
              feet, valued at approximately 4 billion dollars. These are the figures
              made public by British Gas. The size of Palestine's gas reserves could
              be much larger. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Who Owns the Gas Fields</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The issue of sovereignty over Gaza's gas fields is crucial. From a legal standpoint, the gas reserves belong to Palestine. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The death of Yasser Arafat, the
              election of the Hamas government and the ruin of the Palestinian
              Authority have enabled Israel to establish <em>de facto</em> control over Gaza's offshore gas reserves. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>British Gas (BG Group) has been
              dealing with the Tel Aviv government. In turn, the Hamas government has
              been bypassed in regards to exploration and development rights over the
              gas fields.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The election of Prime Minister
              Ariel Sharon in 2001 was a major turning point. Palestine's sovereignty
              over the offshore gas fields was challenged in the Israeli Supreme
              Court. Sharon stated unequivocally that "Israel would never buy gas
              from Palestine" <strong>intimating that Gaza's offshore gas reserves belong to
              Israel.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In 2003, Ariel Sharon, vetoed
              an initial deal, which would allow British Gas to supply Israel with
              natural gas from Gaza's offshore wells. (The Independent, August 19,
              2003) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The election victory of Hamas
              in 2006 was conducive to the demise of the Palestinian Authority, which
              became confined to the West Bank, under the proxy regime of Mahmoud
              Abbas.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In 2006, British Gas "was close
              to signing a deal to pump the gas to Egypt." (Times, May, 23, 2007).
              According to reports, British Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened on
              behalf of Israel with a view to shunting the agreement with Egypt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The following year, in May
              2007, the Israeli Cabinet approved a proposal by Prime Minister Ehud
              Olmert  "to buy gas from the Palestinian Authority." The proposed
              contract was for $4 billion, with profits of the order of $2 billion of
              which one billion was to go the Palestinians. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Tel Aviv, however, had no
              intention on sharing the revenues with Palestine. An Israeli team of
              negotiators was set up by the Israeli Cabinet to thrash out a deal with
              the BG Group, bypassing both the Hamas government and the Palestinian
              Authority:</strong>   </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"<strong>Israeli defence authorities
              want the Palestinians to be paid in goods and services and insist that
              no money go to the Hamas-controlled Government</strong>." (Ibid, emphasis added)</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The objective was essentially
              to nullify the contract signed in 1999 between the BG Group and the
              Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Under the proposed 2007
              agreement with BG, Palestinian gas from Gaza's offshore wells was to be
              channeled by an undersea pipeline to the Israeli seaport of Ashkelon,
              thereby transferring control over the sale of the natural gas to
              Israel. </span></p>
              
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The deal fell through. The negotiations were suspended:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> "Mossad Chief Meir Dagan opposed the transaction on security grounds, that the proceeds would fund terror". </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Member

              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Israel's intent was to
              foreclose the possibility that royalties be paid to the Palestinians.
              In December 2007, The BG Group withdrew from the negotiations with
              Israel and in January 2008 they closed their office in Israel.(</span><a href="http://www.bg-group.com/OurBusiness/WhereWeOperate/Pages/pgIsraelandAreasofPalestinianAuthority.aspx"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">BG website</span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana;">). </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The invasion plan of the Gaza
              Strip under "Operation Cast Lead" was set in motion in June 2008,
              according to Israeli military sources: </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"Sources in the defense
              establishment said Defense Minister Ehud Barak instructed the Israel
              Defense Forces to prepare for the operation over six months ago [June

              agreement with Hamas."(Barak Ravid, </span><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11521"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Operation "Cast Lead": Israeli Air Force strike followed months of planning,</span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> Haaretz, December 27, 2008)</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">That very same month, the
              Israeli authorities contacted British Gas, with a view to resuming
              crucial negotiations pertaining to the purchase of Gaza's natural gas:  </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"Both Ministry of Finance
              director general Yarom Ariav and Ministry of National Infrastructures
              director general Hezi Kugler agreed to inform BG of Israel's wish to
              renew the talks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The sources added that BG has
              not yet officially responded to Israel's request, but that company
              executives would probably come to Israel in a few weeks to hold talks
              with government officials." (Globes online- Israel's Business Arena,
              June 23, 2008)</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The decision to speed up
              negotiations with British Gas (BG Group) coincided, chronologically,
              with the planning of the invasion of Gaza initiated in June. It would
              appear that Israel was anxious to reach an agreement with the BG Group
              prior to the invasion, which was already in an advanced planning
              stage.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, these negotiations
              with British Gas were conducted by the Ehud Olmert government with the
              knowledge that a military invasion was on the drawing board and that a
              new political-territorial arrangement for Gaza strip was being
              contemplated by Israel.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In fact, negotiations between
              British Gas and Israeli officials were ongoing in October 2008, 2-3
              months prior to the commencement of the bombings on December 27th.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In November 2008, the Israeli
              Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of National Infrastructures
              instructed Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) to enter into negotiations
              with British Gas, on the purchase of natural gas from the BG's offshore
              concession in Gaza. (Globes, November 13, 2008) </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"Ministry of Finance director
              general Yarom Ariav and Ministry of National Infrastructures director

              him of the government's decision to allow negotiations to go forward,
              in line with the framework proposal it approved earlier this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The IEC board, headed by
              chairman Moti Friedman, approved the principles of the framework
              proposal a few weeks ago. The talks with BG Group will begin once the
              board approves the exemption from a tender." (Globes Nov. 13, 2008) </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Gaza and Energy Geopolitics </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The military occupation of Gaza
              is intent upon transferring the sovereignty of the gas fields to Israel
              in violation of international law. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">What can we expect in the wake of the invasion? <br><br>What is the intent of Israel with regard to Palestine's Natural Gas reserves? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A new territorial arrangement, with the stationing of Israeli and/or "peacekeeping" troops?  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The militarization of the entire Gaza coastline, which is strategic for Israel? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The outright confiscation of
              Palestinian gas fields and the unilateral declaration of Israeli
              sovereignty over Gaza's maritime areas?  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If this were to occur, the Gaza
              gas fields would be integrated into Israel's offshore installations,
              which are contiguous to those of the Gaza Strip. (See Map 1 above). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">These various offshore
              installations are also linked up to Israel's energy transport corridor,
              extending from the port of Eilat, which is an oil pipeline terminal, on
              the Red Sea to the seaport - pipeline terminal at Ashkelon, and
              northwards to Haifa, and eventually linking up through a <em>proposed </em>Israeli-Turkish pipeline with the Turkish port of Ceyhan. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ceyhan is the terminal of the
              Baku, Tblisi Ceyhan Trans Caspian pipeline. "What is envisaged is to
              link the BTC pipeline to the Trans-Israel Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, also

                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enough said. You admitted
                      to twisting historical facts to suit your twisted arab propaganda.
                      Thank you. At least others know where you stand.</span></p>

              <p>Please do not under-estimate others who disagree with your
                      propaganda as you continually do here, arab propagandist. You
                      have freedom of speech here, regardless of whether you are a
                      singaporean or a foriegner claiming to be singaporean, BuT do not
                      abuse it. Then, its still your perogative.</p>

              <p>So, 'Israeli sources' is not to be believed? And 'Palestinian
                      sources' MUST be believed? Are you implying that? EVEN UN dare not
                      confirm 100% that there were no militants in the said school, you
                      dare, arab propagandist?</p>

              <p>Hamas has a 'right' to bomb innocent jews in Israel, as well as
                      as to hide amongst civilian in civilian centres, putting innocent
                      Gaza people in the line of fire as well? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is that what you are

              <p>If you truly want to preserve life, you would have condemned
                      Hamas actions, for it is an abomination to the Koran revered by
                      Muslims around the world, including Arabs. But you prefer to use
                      politically correct soft words such as 'overblown',etc, to propound
                      further the arab propaganda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only by condemning them will sympathizers, funds and recruits be
                      halted. They are destroying the religion anyway, and had used
                      religion twisted to serve their interests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Hamas realizes they have no support, no more recruits
                      and money to buy arms which should had been used to buy food
                      for Gaza folks in the first place, they will quit armed struggle,
                      and meet on the negotiation table without killing anyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no dearth of humanitarian aid in the meantime for Gaza
                      when a truce rings out, or even when peace is achieved. They are
                      humans still who would helped out, so long as their money is NOT
                      use to kill others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If that is truly what they seek instead of violence and wiping
                      out the human race, beginning with the jews and drawing everyone
                      else into the conflict.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wars can only be financed. No money, no talk. Hot air from the

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I'm not condoning or overlooking the rocket attacks committed by Hamas. They do kill. But Israeli bombs kill more. I also agree that more casualties doesnt mean more symphathy, people die. But less people also doesnt mean more symphathy as well. It also doesnt mean that the nationality, race or religion should matter. Then why are you only condemning Hamas and saying that they should be wiped out when Israel is also killing people, an act that most of the Israeli population opposes. If you would spare some curses for Israel, then I wouldn't have any issue with it. But as it is, you're just acting very biased against Israel. Dont ignore the other side of the story.</span></p>

                      claiming?</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then does Israel have a right to bomb the Gazans with F-16s and Apaches when all they can do is fire back with homemade rockets that sometimes dont even kill one person?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And they're not hiding in civilian centres. They are civilians. Civilians who have been disgruntled at the Israeli oppression and have started to make a difference by rising up and fighting back. Do you think just because they are resisting the Israeli military machine, they all go out donning helmets, signalling the formation of a Palestinian Army, as if they have the means? Even if its a WAR between two armies, civilians still die, what more a massacre by a modern army against a guerilla force? That's the only way they can tactically resist. I'm not saying its right or wrong, but pragmatically, its the only way to fight a superior force, just like Lim Bo Seng did against the Japanese.</span></p>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The military invasion of the Gaza Strip by Israeli Forces bears a direct relation to the control and ownership of strategic offshore gas reserves. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is a war of conquest. Discovered in 2000, there are extensive gas reserves off the Gaza coastline. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bg-group.com/OurBusiness/WhereWeOperate/Pages/pgIsraelandAreasofPalestinianAuthority.aspx">British Gas (BG Group)</a> and its partner, the Athens based</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ccc.gr/"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Consolidated Contractors International Company</span></a> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">(CCC) owned by Lebanon's Sabbagh and Koury families, were granted oil and gas exploration rights in a 25 year agreement signed in November 1999 with the Palestinian Authority. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The rights to the offshore gas field are respectively British Gas (60 percent); Consolidated Contractors (CCC) (30 percent); and the Investment Fund of the Palestinian Authority (10 percent). (Haaretz, October 21,  2007). <br><br>The PA-BG-CCC agreement includes field development and the construction of a gas pipeline.(Middle East Economic Digest, Jan 5, 2001). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The BG licence covers the entire Gazan offshore marine area, which is contiguous to several Israeli offshore gas facilities. (See Map below). It should be noted that 60 percent of the gas reserves along the Gaza-Israel coastline belong to Palestine.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The BG Group drilled two wells in 2000: <strong>Gaza Marine-1 and Gaza Marine-2.</strong> Reserves are estimated by British Gas to be of the order of 1.4 trillion cubic feet, valued at approximately 4 billion dollars. These are the figures made public by British Gas. The size of Palestine's gas reserves could be much larger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Who Owns the Gas Fields</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The issue of sovereignty over Gaza's gas fields is crucial. From a legal standpoint, the gas reserves belong to Palestine. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The death of Yasser Arafat, the election of the Hamas government and the ruin of the Palestinian Authority have enabled Israel to establish <em>de facto</em> control over Gaza's offshore gas reserves. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>British Gas (BG Group) has been dealing with the Tel Aviv government. In turn, the Hamas government has been bypassed in regards to exploration and development rights over the gas fields.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The election of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001 was a major turning point. Palestine's sovereignty over the offshore gas fields was challenged in the Israeli Supreme Court. Sharon stated unequivocally that "Israel would never buy gas from Palestine" <strong>intimating that Gaza's offshore gas reserves belong to Israel.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In 2003, Ariel Sharon, vetoed an initial deal, which would allow British Gas to supply Israel with natural gas from Gaza's offshore wells. (The Independent, August 19, 2003) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The election victory of Hamas in 2006 was conducive to the demise of the Palestinian Authority, which became confined to the West Bank, under the proxy regime of Mahmoud Abbas.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In 2006, British Gas "was close to signing a deal to pump the gas to Egypt." (Times, May, 23, 2007). According to reports, British Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened on behalf of Israel with a view to shunting the agreement with Egypt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The following year, in May 2007, the Israeli Cabinet approved a proposal by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert  "to buy gas from the Palestinian Authority." The proposed contract was for $4 billion, with profits of the order of $2 billion of which one billion was to go the Palestinians. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Tel Aviv, however, had no intention on sharing the revenues with Palestine. An Israeli team of negotiators was set up by the Israeli Cabinet to thrash out a deal with the BG Group, bypassing both the Hamas government and the Palestinian Authority:</strong>   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The objective was essentially to nullify the contract signed in 1999 between the BG Group and the Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Under the proposed 2007 agreement with BG, Palestinian gas from Gaza's offshore wells was to be channeled by an undersea pipeline to the Israeli seaport of Ashkelon, thereby transferring control over the sale of the natural gas to Israel. </span></p>
              &lt;!-- End of pagination --&gt;
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The deal fell through. The negotiations were suspended:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Israel's intent was to foreclose the possibility that royalties be paid to the Palestinians. In December 2007, The BG Group withdrew from the negotiations with Israel and in January 2008 they closed their office in Israel.(</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bg-group.com/OurBusiness/WhereWeOperate/Pages/pgIsraelandAreasofPalestinianAuthority.aspx"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">BG website</span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana;">). </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Invasion Plan on The Drawing Board</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The invasion plan of the Gaza Strip under "Operation Cast Lead" was set in motion in June 2008, according to Israeli military sources: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">That very same month, the Israeli authorities contacted British Gas, with a view to resuming crucial negotiations pertaining to the purchase of Gaza's natural gas:  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The decision to speed up negotiations with British Gas (BG Group) coincided, chronologically, with the planning of the invasion of Gaza initiated in June. It would appear that Israel was anxious to reach an agreement with the BG Group prior to the invasion, which was already in an advanced planning stage.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, these negotiations with British Gas were conducted by the Ehud Olmert government with the knowledge that a military invasion was on the drawing board and that a new political-territorial arrangement for Gaza strip was being contemplated by Israel.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In fact, negotiations between British Gas and Israeli officials were ongoing in October 2008, 2-3 months prior to the commencement of the bombings on December 27th.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In November 2008, the Israeli Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of National Infrastructures instructed Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) to enter into negotiations with British Gas, on the purchase of natural gas from the BG's offshore concession in Gaza. (Globes, November 13, 2008) </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Gaza and Energy Geopolitics </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The military occupation of Gaza is intent upon transferring the sovereignty of the gas fields to Israel in violation of international law.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">What can we expect in the wake of the invasion?<br><br>What is the intent of Israel with regard to Palestine's Natural Gas reserves? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A new territorial arrangement, with the stationing of Israeli and/or "peacekeeping" troops?  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The militarization of the entire Gaza coastline, which is strategic for Israel? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The outright confiscation of Palestinian gas fields and the unilateral declaration of Israeli sovereignty over Gaza's maritime areas?  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If this were to occur, the Gaza gas fields would be integrated into Israel's offshore installations, which are contiguous to those of the Gaza Strip. (See Map 1 above). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">These various offshore installations are also linked up to Israel's energy transport corridor, extending from the port of Eilat, which is an oil pipeline terminal, on the Red Sea to the seaport - pipeline terminal at Ashkelon, and northwards to Haifa, and eventually linking up through a <em>proposed</em> Israeli-Turkish pipeline with the Turkish port of Ceyhan. </span></p>

              Xtreyier,
              
              In no instance, I admitted to the malicious accusation of the act of twisting historical facts. My statement that history is not uniform in essence and history is perceptible is factual. Professional historian would agree that the subject of history is viewed from more than one perspective.Offering a certain perspective of history is in no instance tantamount to fact twisting.
              
              I offer due respect to anyone who disagree with my writings, provided that it revolves around intellectual discourse.
              In no instance I have been propagating rights to violence on either side. I wonder if writings reflecting a more balanced approach constitute propaganda for the arabs?
              
              This leads to your next accusation. Never did I mention that one source is to be dismissed and the other required obligatory acceptance in its totality. Your statement with regards to the U.N is grossly simplistic. The U.N neither denied nor confirm the presence of Hamas combatants within its compound. However, the underlying basis of the Israeli attack is due to alleged fire from the compound of the U.N which contradicts the assertion of the U.N that no fire was shot from its compound. Logically speaking, ascribing to the Israeli report reeks of prejudice towards the Israelis and acceptence of the U.N report would constitute neutrality. I shall not argue about the freedom of speech as I am clear my writings are purposeful for the sanctity of humankind.
              
              Next, your third inquiry whether I claim that Hamas possess the right to kill innocent civilians profess your shallow grasp of the language. I stated that Hamas has much right to defend the gazans as much as the Israelis do constitute a moral paradox. Any one can never claim the legitimacy to the killings of innocents. 
              
              I truly condemn Hamas for the malevolent killings of innocent lives as much as I condemn the malicious killings of innocent lives by the Israelis. Although I feel like a fool for condemning Hamas' killings of innocent lives due to the fact that the pathetic numbers of their killings constitued a lesser loss of lives vis a vis the number of traffic fatalities from the recent Jewish holiday weekend. As much as HAMAS intents to take the innocent lives of Israeli civilians, reports have affirmed to the purposeful killings of Palestinian civilians by the IDF albeit much more successful. Could anyone in the right mind term an entity which kills a highly disproportionate number of civilians vis a vis its enemy as the oppressed? 
              
              The Quran never sanction the killings of non-combatants in a lawful war, neither killing combatants from behind. Condeming HAMAS per se is an abomination of any ethical set of values because Israel is equally to be blamed. However, if we are arguing in terms of consequences, Israel deserves a higher degree of blame.
              
              My writing aims to offer a more balanced perspective from substantial sources. However, you have adopted a wholesome acceptence of heavily influenced U.S information with regards to this conflict. 
              
              Financing of this conflict is a laughable point you have brought up. The disproportionality of the financing of the Zionist Entity dwarfs the disparity between lives lost on either side. Barricades were requested to be opened for international sanctioned humanitarian aid. You seeming lean heavily in favour of the Zionist whose atrocities in this conflict dwarf Hamas in terms of consequence whether due to causations we shall not argue. This is at the expense of the loss of lives and you profess a claim to the sanctity of human lives. 
               
              From your conclusion, you have again showcased your low propensity for intellectual thinking. Plagarism is the highest form of un-intellectual discourse. 
              
              In the event you are keen to disagree with me with regards to the preservation of human lives via an end to violence from both sides of the conflict, you are most welcome to challenge me to a debate.

              has killed and wounded almost four thousand men, women and children so
              far in its assault on Gaza; it has entombed whole families together in
              the ruins of their homes. As I write these words, news is breaking that
              Israeli bombs have killed at least 40 civilians huddling in a UN school
              which they mistakenly thought would be safer than the homes from which
              Israel’s relentless barrage—and its deliberately terrorizing “warning”
              leaflets and prerecorded phone calls—had already driven them. (I still

              1982 and the language is exactly the same—“flee, flee for your

              the first that it is an entirely defensive move, a way to end the
              rocket fire of Hamas; and the second that it is designed to restore the
              army’s credibility after its failure to cow Hizbollah in 2006.<br> <br> No doubt the Israeli army has been itching to repair its battered
              image, and for sure the rocket attacks from Gaza create domestic
              pressures that are only too clear to an Israeli government about to
              face an election.<br> <br> But it is a gross misunderstanding of what is unfolding in Gaza to

              example of the blatant war crimes committed by Zionist Israel since its
              establishment in 1948.<br><br> Supported and encouraged by the United States and Britain, Israel has
              ignored international condemnation and insists that she has the
              unfettered right to murder innocent men, women and children on account
              of some rocket attacks by Palestinians who were retaliating against the
              blockade of Gaza. The blockade over the last 9 months has brought
              starvation and untold suffering to the Palestinians. The heroic
              Palestinian people have every right to take action in self-defence to
              break this inhuman siege.<br><br> The United Nations has condemned this attempt to starve and deny the
              medical needs of the Palestinians in order to force them into
              submission, but as usual, Israel backed by the United States has
              ignored international opinion and international law.<br><br> The peace loving peoples of the world must not just sympathise with the
              Palestinians but must take concrete action to bring the war criminals
              to justice.<br><br> For various reasons Governments will not do anything to put a stop to
              Israeli intransigence. It remains for the people to take positive
              action individually or through their Non-Governmental Organisations
              (NGO).<br><br> We propose that the peoples of the world boycott Israeli products and stop all trade with Israel.<br><br> Secondly we call upon the international community to abandon the use of
              the US Dollar in international trade, and to stop buying United States'
              bonds. Such purchases have enabled the United States to grant
              substantial aid to Israel and to supply it with the weapons now being
              used against the people in Gaza and elsewhere. The concerned peace
              loving peoples of the world must not, even if it is in a small way, be
              the participants and financiers in the massacre of the Palestinians,
              the Iraqis and the Afghans.<br><br> Finally we call upon the United Nations General Assembly to condemn
              Israel the same way that the Security Council condemns Darfur, Rwanda
              and Burundi and to set up a Tribunal to try Israeli war criminals.<br><br> <strong>Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad<br><br> Chairman <br><br> <a href="http://criminalisewar.com/foundation.html">Kuala Lumpur Foundation to Criminalise War</a> <br><br> and <a href="http://www.perdana4peace.org/">Perdana Global Peace Organisation</a></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Israel losing propaganda war</strong></p>
              <p>ISRAEL has taken a battering in the global propaganda battle
              over its war with Hamas, despite deploying all the latest weaponry
              from YouTube videos to Twitter blogs and an overworked
              spokeswoman.</p>
              <p>Governments worldwide have slammed the Israeli military
              onslaught on the Gaza Strip, with the UN Secretary-General, Ban
              Ki-moon, condemning attacks near UN schools that killed dozens and
              foreign media angry at being kept out of the Palestinian
              territory.</p>
              <p>With images of parents carrying lifeless children to overwhelmed
              hospitals dominating international media, protests have been staged
              in world capitals and Israeli websites reportedly came under cyber
              attack...</p>

              <p>googoomuck, Official combatants of the 1967 war were jordan, syria, egypt and Iraq. The rest were not listed as official combatants. In your interpretation, you might as well include Pakistan, Yemen as countries which contributed weapons and troops to the coalition</p>

              <p> The war lasted only six days. Which day did Iraq join in the 'fray' (war)? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
