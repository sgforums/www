Because you, and many others are just siding with one group of terrorists, and overlooking the actions of the other group of terrorists is something I take issue with. Its like taking sides when the US invades Iraq. The US has a rich history of sponsoring terrorism to destabilise nationalistic governments in favour of corrupt dictators. Saddam is a US-propped dictator who has oppressed the Kurds. In cases like this, its a waste of time to side with either one because both are anti-human scum.</p>

              <p>Atobe,</p>
              <p>I would see to it that several of your claims are rebutted although I will agree to one.</p>
              <p><em>If Hamas had abandoned its ambition of destroying Israel, would there be any killings of any number of people ?</em></p>
              <p>Hamas and Israel are alike in so many ways. Israeli extremists and hardliners harbour the same thoughts of each other vis a vis Hamas. Killings occured even before the establishment of Hamas. Israel has been found guilty of numerous terrorist activities ever since 1948. I find the claim that the rationale behind the malicious killings of Palestinians is attributed to Hamas and the ones who does the actual killing is innocent and perceived to be the "oppressed", utterly ridiculous. This is contrary to the typical logical mind of any sane person. Moreover, the Israeli politicians have been planning for this since mid 2007. And the IDF southern command has been pressurizing the central command for the green light to attack. The knesset ratified the incursion before the expiry of the ceasefire date.</p>
              <p><em>If Hamas had been able to exercise strategic wisdom and smarter tactics in their confrontation with Israel, would there be any large number of deaths on the Palestinian side compared to the Israelis </em></p>
              <p>I agree with you on this. The casualty ratio will be more proportionate. This is attributed to the ill-equiped Hamas military infrastructure. Militar analysts have pointed out that if the scenario was such Israel were to engaged in a warfare with infrastructure similar to Hamas, their soldiers will be killed.</p>
              <p><em>Hamas will not borrow your line of argument as their agenda is to win the psychological propaganda war over the Israelis - by causing as many Palestinian casualties as possible after each intentional attack towards Israel.</em></p>
              <p>Is this your own opinion or cited from a credible, neutral source?</p>
              <p><em>Is Israel the only one guilty of the killing, or is Hamas not equally guilty for causing the casualties and deaths amongst the innocent Palestinians - by attacking Israel from densely populated areas of Palestinian residences, refugee camps and schools ?</em></p>
              <p>Israel is guilty of the massacre of almost 800 lives, at least half of which are civilians according to U.N sources. Hamas is guilty of the massacre of 13 Israeli, 10 of which are soldiers. The allegation that Hamas largely fires rockets <strong>from within</strong> civilian areas is still a matter of contention. Prior to the ground incursion by the IDF, I doubt Hamas fired their rockets deep from their own territory. This is due to the fact that Hamas rockets reached Ashdod a city 40km from the Gaza Border and Hamas's projectiles have similar reach only. Due to the ground incursion, the fighting occured within the civilian populations.</p>
              <p><em> Have you not succumbed to propaganda - which is "Hamas organised effort to promote a particular belief" - that Israelis are massacreing the Palestinians ? </em></p>
              <p><em> Are you not regurgitating what is being repeated on behalf of Hamas - despite your declared efforts of being a neutral ?</em></p>
              <p>I find your statement that the fact that the Israelis are massacreing the Palestinians is Hamas perpetuated propaganda most disturbing. Neutrality and factual information is being tarnished by blatant, incomprehensible accusations of being Hamas propaganda tools. Hamas releases nothing more than mere rhetoric to the press, short of relevent statistics and figures. It is the humanitarian organizations and personnel working from Gaza providing us with the relevent statistics and facts. </p>
              <p>I shall not present my facts and substantiations with regards to oil exploitation as I have yet to exercise my due dilligence on this issue. I hope some others there follow this lead and realise that ample research and study neccessitates any legitimate analysis on this conflict.</p>

              <p>jojobeach,</p>
              <p>Finally, you have input the some form of neutrality into this discussion. Never once did I asset Hamas is NOT to be blamed for this carnage. My point was pretty simple, Israel is killing with civilians intently although their reports contradicts most independent credible sources reporting from the warzone. Thus, they have to share a bigger portion of the blame due to the killings.</p>
              <p>Yes. Hamas did reject the UN administered truce.</p>
              <p>Reason: Not interested as it was not consulted and the truce fails to meet its requirements.</p>
              <p>However, your purposeful omission of the similar fact that Israel rejected the truth reeks of prejudice.</p>
              <p>Reason: FM Livni  stated that Israel will not allow an external body to dictate the actions of a sovereign nation.</p>
              <p>Which raison d etre is more sensible?</p>
              <p>Moreover, Israeli polls show that 90% of the Jewish majority is in favour of the war. Numerous deductions can be made from this sick reality. </p>

              <p>jojobeach,</p>
              <p>Finally, you have input the some form of neutrality into this
                  discussion. Never once did I asset Hamas is NOT to be blamed for
                  this carnage. My point was pretty simple, Israel is killing with
                  civilians intently although their reports contradicts most
                  independent credible sources reporting from the warzone. Thus,
                  they have to share a bigger portion of the blame due to the
                  killings.</p>
              <p>Yes. Hamas did reject the UN administered truce.</p>
              <p>Reason: Not interested as it was not consulted and the truce
                  fails to meet its requirements.</p>
              <p>However, your purposeful omission of the similar fact that
                  Israel rejected the truth reeks of prejudice.</p>
              <p>Reason: FM Livni  stated that Israel will not allow an
                  external body to dictate the actions of a sovereign nation.</p>
              <p>Which raison d etre is more sensible?</p>
              <p>Moreover, Israeli polls show that 90% of the Jewish
                  majority is in favour of the war. Numerous deductions can be
                  made from this sick reality. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And what are the requirements HAMAS seeks that cannot be settled without rocket fires ?</p>
              <p>Are HAMAS a bunch of cavemen that can only get what they want through violence and death ?</p>
              <p>Do you also blame the Jewish majority for feeling this way about the war ? </p>
              <p>Jarhum.. if your family is under constant threat from your neighbor.. are you going to just think it's ok not to fight back ?</p>
              <p>If my child gets bullied in school.. I will tell him to stand up to the bully and protect himself. I don't know about you.. perhaps you will tell your child to be quiet and let the abuse continue.</p>
              <p><strong>So you find it sickening for Jewish majority to favor the war. Then may I ask.. are Gazans also against HAMAS firing rockets into Israel ? Or is HAMAS acting solely against the approval of their own people ?</strong></p>

              <p>well jojobeach,</p>
              <p>Anyone who is being bullied or intimidated will stand up to the aggressor. However, in the case of the Israeli-Palestine issue, my perspective is that it does not take a genious for one to determine the aggressor and the oppressed.</p>
              <p>However, I view such analogous examples as immature and inaccurate. Analogous examples are often used to sell a rotten product, in this case, your argument.</p>
              <p>The initiator of this conflict varies. However, it is an event concurring a spiral effect of events which started from the establishment of Hamas in 1987. The establishment of Hamas itself was initiated by the notorious Israeli secret service itself as a balancing factor to the increasing strength of the PLO. So, you may deduce the source of the Hamas-Israel conflict.</p>
              <p>Hamas rocket fires are insignificant vis a vis Israels missiles and tanks. Hamas and the Gazans want an end to the bloackade of neccessities by Israel.</p>
              <p>Your prejudice is blatant and childish. You state a point, you better substantiate your claim with feasible justifications.</p>
              <p>I definately would not blame the Jewish majority feeling this way. However, swap their status in the war with Palestinians, they be begging for the war to end.</p>
              <p>Your arguments has been based on emotional rantings and shallow examples. Every single life is precious. But a thousand lives is a thousand times more precious than a single life. Your brand of ideology continues to stun me.</p>
              <p>I sense you are not, or have not been educated in the tertiary level. The accuracy of citations and references is gauged by the closeness to the source of the information and the non-relation of the sources with regards to entities on both sides.</p>
              <p>Your final statement is a total contradiction. You keep on blaming and you say it needs to stop. Even if you make an attempt for prejudice do it intelligently. Prejudice is subjective. I dare admit to less prejudice than you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I do blame Hamas partially. You blame Hamas entirely.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you associate the concern I portray for innocent civilians killed in Gaza as support of Hamas while I blame civilians killed in Gaza on Israel and civilians killed in Israel on Hamas.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I view a thousand lives lost a thousand times worse than a live lost. Simple proportionate comparison. You equate a thousand lives lost to one.</p>
              <p>I'll show you where you get your references from:</p>

              <p>I agree at this stage.. it is time for the Israel offensive to stop. But what is HAMAS willing to give ?</p>
              <p>After all the fighting.. are you expecting Israel to give HAMAS an open arm hug and kiss ?</p>

              <p>Maybe Israel should abide by the Geneva conventions and halt its war crimes. You see, during yesterday's  3 hour ceasefire, Hamas fire stopped.

              Jarhum, why do you keep insisting that it is the Zionists who are responsible for the deaths of the Palestinians?
              
              Your arguments are based on the fact that the US, Israel, and maybe probably the whole world has an agenda towards anything un-Islam. And probably also a lot more CONSPIRACIES with regards towards the Muslim, than all the aliens conspiracies added up together.
              
              Which is really baseless and ridiculous. I almost laughed at your "US-controlled media" which pretty much sums up what kind of person you are. Where can you find a country which gives so much press/media-freedom in the world?
              
              I guess you feed on conspiracies to survive.

              <p>people like to bring up 911, and i always remember why people think 911 is bad.

              <p>Unfortunately, Hamas will not borrow your line of argument
              as their agenda is to win the psychological propaganda war
              over the Israelis - by causing as many Palestinian casualties
              as possible after each intentional attack towards Israel.</p>

              <p>Is Israel the only one guilty of the killing, or is Hamas not
              equally guilty for causing the casualties and deaths amongst the
              innocent Palestinians - by attacking Israel from densely
              populated areas of Palestinian residences, refugee camps and

              <p><em>If Hamas had been able to exercise strategic wisdom and
              smarter tactics in their confrontation with Israel, would there be
              any large number of deaths on the Palestinian side compared to the
              Israelis ?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How would you advise the vastly outnumbered and outgunned Hamas to wage <strong>war</strong> against Israel, the Middle-East's superpower? Let's hear some of your "strategic wisdom".<br></span></p>
              <p><em>Osama bin Ladin might as well borrow your intellect in
              protesting that after the 9-11 World Trade Center destruction
              - USA's right to hunt down Al Qaeda and Osama should stop
              when 500+ Afghans have been killed.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is totally unrelated, but I'll address it anyway. If the US wanted to catch Bin Laden, it had plenty of chances to do so. After the 1993 WTC bombings, <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=09245C90-4ABA-4468-9703-D82B70231153">Clinton let him escape after receiving an offer from Sudan to extradite him</a>. Then when the Taliban made the Bush Administration an offer after 9/11, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5">the US refused</a>. After all, the war plans for the invasion of Afghanistan were already prepared before 9/11 and troops were already massing across the Afghan border. That's because Bin Laden's just another CIA front that was hired back during the Afghan-Soviet war. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/28/eveningnews/main325887.shtml">In fact, a day before 9/11, Bin Laden was in a military hospital in Pakistan receiving medical treatment. </a>Dont forget that the CIA and ISI have a rich history of cooperation starting from the Afghan-Soviet war up till this day.</span></p>
              <p><em>Is Israel the only one guilty of the killing, or is Hamas not
              equally guilty for causing the casualties and deaths amongst the
              innocent Palestinians - by attacking Israel from densely
              populated areas of Palestinian residences, refugee camps and
              schools ?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No, as I have said many times, both parties are guilty of bloodshed. <strong>If everyone agreed on that, instead of trying to condemn one side <em>alone</em>, then there would not be any need to argue on this issue. </strong>Would you tell me where in Gaza is it not densely packed? I dont know, but if you can make such a statement, then you must know right? They dont have HDBs for the 1.5 million people there. </span></p>
              <p><em>Have you not succumbed to propaganda - which is "Hamas
              organised effort to promote a particular belief" - that
              Israelis are massacreing the Palestinians ? </em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While "propaganda" does not have any negative denotations, I know that people like to use it to connote lies and misinformation. "Propaganda" is a technical word. I dont think Hamas can wage an effective media war because they dont have the means to do so, unlike Israel, which has taken the media war to Youtube. Anyway, how is it not true that Israel is NOT masscreing Palestinians? Your very stand is based on Israeli propaganda. How are you different?</span></p>
              <p><em>When Iraq and Iran was fighting the seven year war, French
              companies were in Iran exploring oil and gas.</em></p>
              <p><em>When the USA was conducting its 'shock and awe' campaign
              during Dessert Storm I and II - oil companies were continuously
              pumping out crude in the region.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gaza is in a totally different context. As you know, Hamas does not have anything that resembles a national military. But how are you proving that oil and natural gas doesn't exist when you're just using your preconception that it does not exist to prove it doesn't exist? In the first place, you're not prepared to accept that. I also dont know very much about this, I've just read this information recently. And of course I would believe it until I read anything credible to the contrary.</span></p>
