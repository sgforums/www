              <p> Will it not be more strategically intelligent for Hamas to
              wage a political war then a military war ? </p>
              <p>Presumbaly you got your information from Osama ?</p>
              <p>Israel had given the Palestinians time and warning to move out
              of areas that they are planning to attack, and such
              early warning could also serve as early notice for Hamas
              to move out of the danger zones.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Hamas do not reciprocate in similar ways by
              giving early notice as to where and when the rockets will land onto
              Europe.</p>
              <p>If someone inform the residents that an attack will
              occur in District 10, surely the residents there will move out and
              stay in some other adjacent Districts.</p>
              <p>Hamas have been known to prevent Palestinians from leaving, and
              has even gone so far as to recurit - the innocent, the
              uneducated, the mentally imbalanced, the gullible, the young, the
              emotionally unstable - to act as suicide bombers. </p>
              <p>It seems you are less resourceful then Hamas, and just because
              you are less imaginative then Hamas - others will not underestimate
              Hamas nor take them for granted in the manner that you prefer to
              treat Hamas.</p>
              <p>Hamas do not need too much resources to wage an effective media
              war, as the news chasing reporters are only too eager to enter the
              war zone to report from the frontlines and to give support to the
              supposed underdogs.</p>
              <p>During the Vietnam War, the less sophisticated Communist
              Vietnamese was able to mobilise public opinions, and take advantage
              of the anti-war sentiments in the USA to drive a wedge between the
              US Government and those would-be inductees into the US
              Military. </p>
              <p> How did the oil and gas suddenly appear in the headlines -
              when decades have slipped by without a squeak of its existence
              ?</p>
              <p>Immediately after the 6-Day war, the oil rich Arab World had
              formed an oil cartel, and practically held the world hostage to
              their agenda to move support away from Israel.</p>
              <p>It is a known fact that Israel depend on imported oil, and if
              there is oil in the Gaza - do you think that it will not be
              detected by the Israelis ?</p>
              <p>Israel and Egypt had been at loggerhead since 1967 over the

              killing this week of up to 30 Palestinians in Zeitoun, south-east of
              Gaza City, <strong>when Israel shelled a house where its troops had told about
              110 civilians to take shelter.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pillay, a former international
              criminal court judge from South Africa, told the BBC the incident
              <strong>"appears to have all the elements of war crimes"</strong>. She called for
              "credible, independent and transparent" investigations into possible

              military operation. <strong>More than half of Gaza's population are children,
              and the Palestinian ministry of health said about 42% of the casualties

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately Israel has blocked off the foreign media from entering Gaza even though a major humanitarian crisis is precipitating in Gaza. I dont think it takes a lot of effort to figure who has the upper hand in the media war.</span></p>

              <p>Well, we should certainly not be surprised by the imbecilic posting of the ever reliably daft atobe.</p>
              <p>What need does Israel have to resort to suicide bombers and rockets made from tin cans when the americans have supplied them with F16 jets and laser guided bombs (despite which, they still manage to bomb a UN school when they have been given the GPS coordinates)? The palestinians have every right to wage war against Israel to recover their stolen land. The problem is: the combatants are not evenly matched. Israel has modern weapons, the palestinians have only martyrs.</p>
              <p>This is a zero sum game and might is right. It will only end when Israel exterminates the entire palestinian population or when the palestinians drive the Israelis to the sea, neither of which is likely to happen soon.</p>
              <p>The palestinians should simply bide their time and not invite conflict until they have the upper hand. In a few decades there will be more arabs than jews in that part of the world.

              <p>Why would anyone be surprised that you can be so affected by one whom you claim to be an imbecile and daft ?</p>
              <p>It certainly shows the shallowness that have constantly been observed from the many posts that you have been exposed for the shallow depths in political thinking and original thoughts.</p>
              <p>Stolen land ?</p>
              <p>If everyone claim their land to be stolen - as did Malaysia with Singapore over the Pedra Branca issue, and China with Japan over the Diao Yue Tai Island, and Japan with Russia over the Kuril Island chain - we all should be concerned that an Oxford trained mind will sanction the indiscriminate use of rockets to wage a war of terror to reclaim what is being disputed.</p>
              <p>Will Singaporeans have any legitimacy to be in Singapore, if the Johor Sultanate decide to turn back the clock of history and claim that the Singapore Island was not sold to the British but was on a term lease that became obscured by poor interpretation and translation of languages ?</p>
              <p>Yes, Israel may have been supplied sophisticated weapons by the USA, and possess its own high tech weapon systems - and these were used for precision attacks against legitimate Hamas rocket and mortar firing positions that were purposefully located near or in the midst of dense Palestinian residential areas.</p>
              <p>Compared to the mass bombing of Berlin, London, Stalingrad, Nanking, and Tokyo - the Gaza civilian casualties of 800+ remains low by comparison - and prove that the Israeli targetting efforts with the precision weapon systems were not indiscriminate.</p>
              <p>The fact that Israel was able to keep its own civilian casualties low, compared to the high number of Palestinian civilian casualties - will expose the wanton disregard of the Hamas leadership towards any kind of preparation to protect their own Palestinian civilians BEFORE launching an all out rocket and motar attack against Israeli civilian population centers.</p>
              <p>The shallowness of your tertiary educated mind is even more shocking by the mindless statement that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The palestinians should simply bide their time and not invite conflict until they have the upper hand. In a few decades there will be more arabs than jews in that part of the world. There is a limit to how many arabs an Israeli soldier can shoot down before being overwhlemed himself.</span></em> "</p>
              <p>There is the larger group of Palestinians living on the West Bank that is led by the elected President Abbas, who is supported by the West Bank Palestinians to make a peace settlement that will allow the Two State solution to become a reality.</p>
              <p>It remains Hamas objective to keep the conflict alive - in part to serve Iranian goals and to receive a continuous flow of funds to allow for the survival of the Hamas Party.</p>
              <p>If Hamas should become a spent force and be neutralised by the current Israeli efforts, the region may succeed in achieving a win-win situation of Two Separate State living in support of one another.</p>
              <p>Afterall, the Palestinians depend on employment within Israel, and the state of Israel depend on the Palestinians for low cost labor.</p>
              <p>Can this be a zero sum game ?</p>
              <p>Only in the shallow and mindless thinking of those who believe the halls of Oxford will qualify them to comment with authority on any aspect of Life's events.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the vast halls of Oxford can only echo the sound of those more willing to challenge the status quo with original thinking, and the daring to move out of the cycle to seek new ways to solve old solutions - instead of being caught in the old cycles of tried and tested methods that are out-of-date.</p>
              <p>Are we not familiar with your dogmatic thinking even on Singapore issues that find you attempting to bask in the white light fixed by others ?</p>

              <p>If it is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">True....it's not yours unless you can defend it.</span></em>" - why spite the Israelis for having been able to defend what they have claimed rightfully to be theirs ?</p>
              <p>The Israeli fight for existence during the British Colonial Rule of the Palestine Region was in a different period of time, when the fight for nationhood justify any means.</p>
              <p>Even the American Colonists were treated - by the English Government - as rebels and terrorists by their constant ambushes and skirmishes that injured and killed many soldiers sent from England to reclaim their colonies in America.</p>
              <p>Since the end of WW-2, when the Jews were resettled into the Palestine Region that was governed by the British Colonial Office, at least 60 years have transpired since the creation of the State of Israel - which is recognised by the United Nations.</p>
              <p>The State of Israel may not have been recognised by the other Middle-eastern countries then, it certainly has seen more UN members accepting the State of Israel.</p>
              <p>If you can condone the Palestinian methods to attack the civilians of a sovereign state - to reclaim what they believe to be rightfully theirs, are you not similarly condoning the opening of a pandora's box in the multitude of rebel organisation fighting for their own independent homeland across the globe ?</p>
              <p>This is shocking coming from one that sees others as daft and imbecilic.</p>
              <p>Should we not be concern that characters - who will unabashedly advertise their claims to be from prestigeous institutions of higher learning - can have such low intellect resting in a highly conceited head, and possibly holding some positions that affect the lives of countless others ?</p>
              <p>We all should pray that God will have the immense wisdom to forbid the passing of such genes to the next existence.</p>

              <p>Did they win a political war or even a military one over Israel ?</p>
              <p>Instead, all they did was to split the Palestinian Community into two - and weakening the Palestinian causes by their divisive acts that saw their illegally usurping the authority from the legitimately elected Palestinian Government of President Abbas.</p>
              <p>All that the Palestinian had achieved by remaining in the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip was to make themselves into a pariah state that is ignored even by the other Arab States of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Morroco, Iraq, and all other World Communities that support the Arab cause.</p>
              <p>What victory are you dreaming about that occurred in 2006 ?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> For one who claim others for refusing to look at information that is contrary to pre-conceptions - you seem to be indulging in double standards that begin with you depending on propaganda for your facts.</p>
              <p>Is it not obvious from your circular arguments based on flawed logic thinking - that you are fixated to the Hamas cause and with you being affected by the Palestinian casualties more then by the Principles of the Issues themselves ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Israel had given the Palestinians time and warning to move out of areas that they are planning to attack, and such early warning could also serve as early notice for Hamas to move out of the danger zones.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then why would they bother giving warnings if it could aid Hamas? </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Surely, we can understand your position in not see the obvious, as we can see that you are more indulgent in Hamas agenda despite your claims to neutrality.</p>
              <p>Even if Hamas should take heed of the advance warning made by Israel, it will already serve Israeli objectives in neutralising Hamas positions - by emptying Hamas personnels and destroying the infrastructure. </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even if they give warnings, the rampant bombing of the Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians are prevented from living is bound to result in heavy casualties because of superior Israeli firepower (ie via the shockwaves and structural damage to buildings). The casualties speak for themselves:</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Israeli deaths: 6 soldiers (4 by friendly fire) and 4 civilians</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Besides, there have already been instances where Israel had deliberately bombed civilian homes:</span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>The scoreboard surely shows the unpreparedness of the Hamas leadership to take advance construction of civilian bomb shelters, stocking of food, water and energy, and training for their civilians to respond to warning systems.</p>
              <p>The scoreboard shows the irresponsibility of the Hamas leadership to declare that rocket attacks will resume at the end of the last negotiated truce period, even when throughout the truce period there were no efforts to prepare the Palestinians for this expected outcome.</p>
              <p>Did Israel fire the first salvo immediately after the end of the Truce on the last day of November 2008 ?</p>
              <p>Even then Israel had only responded to the rocket and motar attacks by returning fire to the points of origins of the rocket and motar firing spots, and these were located intentionally by the Hamas leadership in the middle of dense Palestinian living areas.</p>
              <p>It is easy to shout "War Crimes" - but wild rhetoric with fiery sights then to blind the abilities to see facts on the ground.</p>
              <p>If War Crimes are to be instituted, the Hamas leadership will be the first to be dragged to stand trial - firstly for the illegitimate overthrow of an elected Palestinian Government in the Gaza Strip; secondly for the killing and imprisonment of duly elected officials of the Palestinian Government for the Gaza Strip under President Abbas; and third for the deliberate firing of rockets and motar attacks into Israeli civilian residential areas, schools, and public areas; and fourth for the contravening of the Geneva Codes of War by using clearly designated neutral faclities for the storage of weapons, ammunition and training of personnels that included civilian homes, hospitals, religious sites, schools and others.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, singled out the killing this week of up to 30 Palestinians in Zeitoun, south-east of Gaza City, <strong>when Israel shelled a house where its troops had told about 110 civilians to take shelter.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pillay, a former international criminal court judge from South Africa, told the BBC the incident <strong>"appears to have all the elements of war crimes"</strong>. She called for "credible, independent and transparent" investigations into possible violations of humanitarian law.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">More than 750 Palestinians have died since the start of the Israeli military operation. <strong>More than half of Gaza's population are children, and the Palestinian ministry of health said about 42% of the casualties have been children.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Unicef said at least 100 children and minors were killed in the first 10 days of fighting.</strong> The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, which posts staff at hospitals to track casualties, put this number at more than 160."</span></p>

              <p> My heart bleeds for the innocent lives loss, but it stops bleeding for the hypocritical cries of those who support Hamas deliberate and unprovoked acts of war on the innocent lives of others.</p>
              <p>Israel do not necessary need to prove that "might is right" - and is clearly resorting to the Middle-eastern tradition upheld by Islam's conservativism and fundamentalist religious practises in the "Principle of an Eye for an Eye".</p>
              <p>Clearly those outside of the Middle-eastern region do not understand nor appreciate nor accept such value systems - does that make anyone in the UN qualified to pass judgment as to what constitute a War Crime ?</p>
              <p>It will make you better off as a Singapore to be less involved due to your lop sided understanding of Human Rights that is colored by a lop sided Singapore humanities and value system.</p>
              <p>Tell me that you are not one from the same religion of these Palestinians - and perhaps I can begin to understand in your position revealed from your clearly show of skewed neutrality ? </p>

              <p><em>Hamas do not need too much resources to wage an effective media war, as the news chasing reporters are only too eager to enter the war zone to report from the frontlines and to give support to the supposed underdogs.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately Israel has blocked off the foreign media from entering Gaza even though a major humanitarian crisis is precipitating in Gaza. I dont think it takes a lot of effort to figure who has the upper hand in the media war.</span></p>

              <p>If as an outsider from that region of war, you can "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">figure who has the upper hand in the media war</span></em> " - it already shows that you are out-of-touch with the events on the ground with your biased comments.</p>
              <p>Western commentators are more resourceful then your own narrow assumptions, as others who are more knowledgeable of the events are already making shocking statements of their own that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.poligazette.com/2009/01/04/israel-losing-the-media-war/">‘Israel losing the media war’  </a></p>

              <p> If the gas and oil exist, why will Hamas allow themselves to be used as Iranian pawns to push Iranian agenda first, and put their own Palestinian future on the back burner ?</p>
              <p>After illegally usurping the authority over the Gaza Strip from the legitimately elected government of President Abbas, why did the Hamas leadership indulge themselves in the wasteful acts of aggressions towards Israel - instead of developing their strengths and stabilising their own future by exploiting the oil and gas fields lying in the Gaza ?</p>
              <p>With the oil and gas fields lying in abundance in the Gaza Strip - as you have claimed - Hamas would have won the long term strategic political battle over President Abbas PLA.</p>
              <p>Clearly the publicity made about Israel's intention to grab the Gaza Strip is nothing more then another speculative propaganda developed by a bankrupt mind that depend on wild imagined events.</p>
              <p>When Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip after completing its various missions to discover and destroy all of Hama's abilities to launch rockets and motars from the Gaza Strip - the speculators will disingeneously develop another propaganda.</p>

              <p> What did they win in 2006 ?</p>
              <p>Did they win a political war or even a military one over Israel
                  ?</p>
              <p>Instead, all they did was to split the Palestinian Community
                  into two - and weakening the Palestinian causes by their divisive
                  acts that saw their illegally usurping the authority from the
                  legitimately elected Palestinian Government of President Abbas.</p>
              <p>All that the Palestinian had achieved by remaining in
                  the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip was to make themselves into a
                  pariah state that is ignored even by the other Arab States of
                  Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Morroco, Iraq,
                  and all other World Communities that support the Arab cause.</p>
              <p>What victory are you dreaming about that occurred in 2006 ?</p>
              <p> For one who claim others for refusing to look at
                  information that is contrary to pre-conceptions - you seem to be
                  indulging in double standards that begin with you depending on
                  propaganda for your facts.</p>
              <p>Is it not obvious from your circular arguments based on
                  flawed logic thinking - that you are fixated to the Hamas
                  cause and with you being affected by the Palestinian casualties
                  more then by the Principles of the Issues themselves ?</p>
              <p>Surely, we can understand your position in not see
                  the obvious, as we can see that you are
                  more indulgent in Hamas agenda despite your claims to
                  neutrality.</p>
              <p>Even if Hamas should take heed of the advance
                  warning made by Israel, it will already serve Israeli
                  objectives in neutralising Hamas positions - by emptying Hamas
                  personnels and destroying the infrastructure. </p>
              <p>The scoreboard surely shows the unpreparedness of the Hamas
                  leadership to take advance construction of civilian
                  bomb shelters, stocking of food, water and energy, and
                  training for their civilians to respond to warning systems.</p>
              <p>The scoreboard shows the irresponsibility of the Hamas
                  leadership to declare that rocket attacks will resume at the end of
                  the last negotiated truce period, even when throughout the truce
                  period there were no efforts to prepare the Palestinians for this
                  expected outcome.</p>
              <p>Did Israel fire the first salvo immediately after the end of the
                  Truce on the last day of November 2008 ?</p>
              <p>Even then Israel had only responded to the rocket and motar
                  attacks by returning fire to the points of origins of
                  the rocket and motar firing spots, and these were located
                  intentionally by the Hamas leadership in the middle of
                  dense Palestinian living areas.</p>
              <p>It is easy to shout "War Crimes" - but wild rhetoric with fiery
                  sights then to blind the abilities to see facts on the ground.</p>
              <p>If War Crimes are to be instituted, the Hamas leadership will be
                  the first to be dragged to stand trial - firstly for the
                  illegitimate overthrow of an elected Palestinian Government in the
                  Gaza Strip; secondly for the killing and imprisonment of duly
                  elected officials of the Palestinian Government for the Gaza Strip
                  under President Abbas; and third for the deliberate firing of
                  rockets and motar attacks into Israeli civilian residential areas,
                  schools, and public areas; and fourth for the contravening of the
                  Geneva Codes of War by using clearly designated neutral faclities
                  for the storage of weapons, ammunition and training of personnels
                  that included civilian homes, hospitals, religious sites, schools
                  and others.</p>
              <p> My heart bleeds for the innocent lives loss, but it stops
                  bleeding for the hypocritical cries of those who support Hamas
                  deliberate and unprovoked acts of war on the innocent lives of
                  others.</p>
              <p>Israel do not necessary need to prove that "might is right" -
                  and is clearly resorting to the Middle-eastern tradition upheld by
                  Islam's conservativism and fundamentalist religious practises in
                  the "Principle of an Eye for an Eye".</p>
              <p>Clearly those outside of the Middle-eastern region do not
                  understand nor appreciate nor accept such value systems - does that
                  make anyone in the UN qualified to pass judgment as to what
                  constitute a War Crime ?</p>
              <p>It will make you better off as a Singapore to be less involved
                  due to your lop sided understanding of Human Rights that is colored
                  by a lop sided Singapore humanities and value system.</p>
              <p>Tell me that you are not one from the same religion of
                  these Palestinians - and perhaps I can begin to understand in
                  your position revealed from your clearly show of skewed
                  neutrality ? </p>
              <p>If as an outsider from that region of war, you can
                  "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">figure who has the upper
                  hand in the media war</span></em> " - it already shows that you are
                  out-of-touch with the events on the ground with your biased
                  comments.</p>
              <p>Western commentators are more resourceful then your own
                  narrow assumptions, as others who are more knowledgeable of
                  the events are already making shocking statements of their own that

              <p>So much for your expert views of the reality on the
                  ground. </p>
              <p> If the gas and oil exist, why will Hamas allow themselves
                  to be used as Iranian pawns to push Iranian agenda first, and put
                  their own Palestinian future on the back burner ?</p>
              <p>After illegally usurping the authority over the Gaza Strip
                  from the legitimately elected government of President Abbas, why
                  did the Hamas leadership indulge themselves in the wasteful acts of
                  aggressions towards Israel - instead of developing their strengths
                  and stabilising their own future by exploiting the oil and gas
                  fields lying in the Gaza ?</p>
              <p>With the oil and gas fields lying in abundance in the Gaza
                  Strip - as you have claimed - Hamas would have won the long
                  term strategic political battle over President Abbas PLA.</p>
              <p>Clearly the publicity made about Israel's intention to grab the
                  Gaza Strip is nothing more then another speculative propaganda
                  developed by a bankrupt mind that depend on wild imagined
                  events.</p>
              <p>When Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip after completing
                  its various missions to discover and destroy all of Hama's
                  abilities to launch rockets and motars from the Gaza Strip - the
                  speculators will disingeneously develop another propaganda.</p>

                  aggressions towards Israel - instead of developing their strengths
                  and stabilising their own future by exploiting the oil and gas

              <p>The Israeli effort to control access to news from Gaza is escalating
              along with its military actions. While the Israeli Supreme Court
              ordered the government to allow eight reporters to cross into Gaza,
              that order has not been enforced. Now media workers who were already in
              Gaza have become targets of military attacks.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/CJAL-7N5RUH?OpenDocument">International Federation of Journalists</a> (IFJ) which represents over 600,000 journalists in 123 countries
              worldwide is calling on the world’s media to protest the Israeli
              blockade on the media.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="wbq">
              <p>The IFJ call comes as another
              Palestinian journalist was reported killed - the fourth victim of
              recent Israeli military action in Gaza. Eyhab Al Wahidi, who worked as
              a cameraman for the Palestinian Broadcast Corporation in Gaza, was
              killed with his wife and mother-in-law yesterday when Israeli troops
              shelled their home in Gaza city. The family's children were injured.</p>

              <p>Describing the situation where the Israelis are holding outside
              reporters on the border – where they are fed Israeli official PR and
              photo ops (including all those shots of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/01/10/israel-stop-unlawful-use-white-phosphorus-gaza">White Phosphorous raining down on the people of Gaza</a> which form the backdrop of so many reports yet go unnoticed), Aidan White, IFJ General Secretary says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="wbq">
              <p>"There is a cynical attempt to ensure
              that media tell the story from the Israeli side only," said White. "The
              truth cannot be told unless journalists are free to move, to talk with
              everyone involved and to see with their own eyes what is happening on
              the ground…"</p>

              <blockquote>
              <div class="wbq">
              <p>at least one journalist was injured in
              an Israeli air strike while filing a report from the roof of the
              al-Johara Tower, an eight-story building in Gaza City which houses more
              than 20 international news organizations, according to multiple news
              outlets...</p>
              <p>"The Israeli military knows the location of TV facilities houses
              and news bureaus in Gaza. It is simply unacceptable that working
              journalists and their offices should come under fire in this way," said
              CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney. "Journalists enjoy protections
              under international law in military campaigns such as the one in Gaza.
              Israel must cease its attacks on the media immediately."</p>

              <p>I'd be a real crazy journalist to try to enter the Gaza while bombs and missiles are still raining down from the air.  There is little a pilot flying a UAV or fighter can do to identify a journalist through the lenses of a targeting pod.  They might really end up in harm's way.</p>
              <p>I feel it is wrong to complicate the Palestinian issue with religion.  The Israelis are not waging a war against Islam.  They are fighting Terrorists that are shooting rockets into their country.  I am lean towards the Israeli understanding of the situation on logic; I would be pissed when someone lobs rockets at my civilians and I will shoot back.</p>

              <p>The Arab league and other international communities spend the last 2 decade to negociate and help to facilitate 2 states Palestine and Israel. I am not sure they want to start a process to negociate a 3rd state. Gaza for the Hamas.</p>
              <p>I do not believe you can have West Bank, Israel and Gaza as 3 seperate political entity.</p>
              <p>I also think that Hamas has distracted the entire issue of israel fully compliance from the Peace Road Map including the withdrawer of ilegal settlement along the west bank. </p>

              <p>Sick reality ?</p>
              <p>The sick reality is that Hamas is determined to see to the
              destruction of Israel - knowing that it has the support of
              Iran.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html">population of Israel is 7,112,359
              (2008) </a>- what can we make out of your speculative
              deduction that 90% are infected in your assumed sick
              reality ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes. Hamas did reject the UN
              administered truce.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Reason: Not interested as it
              was not consulted and the truce fails to meet its
              requirements.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Which raison d etre is more
              sensible?</span></em></p>
              <p>Do we need to speculate about your position ?</p>
              <p>Was Hamas rejection simply due to the fact that it was not
              consulted, or was it due to the fact that the resolution passed by
              the UN Security Council had also required a halt to
              Hamas' weapon smuggling - even as it also demanded the borders to
              be open to allow humanitarian aid to get through to the
              Palestinians in Gaza ?</p>
              <p>Israel's rejection was not only about an external body imposing
              their will on their sovereign right to protect themselves, but as
              Israel knows the Hamas mentality better than anyone outside of
              their neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Israel knows that Hamas will not honor any ceasefire, and will
              use the lull in warfare to restock their rockets, weapons, and
              ammunition.</p>
              <p>Can the Israeli and Palestinian not live together, or is the
              animosity, suspicion, fear, hatred, and anger due to the politics
              of the Middle-east that are designed not for any win-win outcome
              ?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/11/22/formula-for-peace-israeli-and-palestinian-drivers-get-on-track/"><strong>Israeli and Palestinian Formula for
              Peace </strong> </a>show that the two communities can
              live together if the dark political agenda of Hamas can be
              dropped.</p>
              <p>This peace prospect was possible as shown by
              the other larger numbers of Palestinians living on the
              West Bank and led by President Abbas - all are willing to make
              the two state option a reality until it was torpedoed by
              Hamas unilateral and illegal declaration of a breakaway state
              of its own in the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>Until this day, none of the Middle-eastern Arab State has
              accepted nor recognised Hamas authority nor legitimacy, and
              its continued existence - with the support from Iran - is
              the cause for the deaths and misery of the Palestinians in the Gaza
              Strip, and is the single threat to peace between Israel and the
              Palestinians.</p>
              <p>I reiterate my position that the SICK REALITY encompass the Israeli killings of innocent lives as well as any individuals supporting or sympathising with these malevolent killings.  Its bewildering any rhetoric is able to surpass the mere extent of the carnage happening now.</p>
              <p>The Jewish majority in Israel wholly supports the war since they are not bearing the brunt of the consequences. Remember, a leading causation for this war is that waging war on Hamas would bring about popular opinion among the masses. Secondly, it is to restore the shattered pride of the Zionists from the debacle of the 2006 Hizbullah war.</p>
              <p>The Israelis have a much lower probability of victimization by Hamas rockets vis a vis the Gazans. In the event an organized poll surveying the halting to this war by both sides, I reckon Gazans would give its mandate overwhelmingly, judging from random interviews from those affected.</p>
              <p>My question is, if the Israeli majority are in the shoes of the Gazans do you think 90% will support the war?</p>
              <div class="quote_body">"Israel knows that Hamas will not honor any ceasefire, and will
              use the lull in warfare to restock their rockets, weapons, and
              ammunition." The most recent 3 hour ceasefire provides an insight to any Israeli honour of any agreement. The Israeli military killed a couple of U.N contractors during the ceasefire. At the very least, if they had killed Hamas combatants, they would still retain a point of contention. The dishonouring of the initial 6 month truce, of course, was blamed on both sides. However, there exists no independent body to verify both allegations.</div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">The seeds of hatred and animosity have been sown too deep, judging from past history, however blatant Israeli massacre of civilian Palestinians only diminishes any faint hope for long lasting peace.</div>
              <div class="quote_body">Hamas is regarded as a legitimate political force in Palestine by Middle Eastern nations. As far as Europe, Norway gives Hamas due recognition. UK and Australia recognizes Hamas's political wing albeit lists its military wing as a terrorist organization. However, Palestine is still not a state as yet. Thus both Hamas and Fatah are not legitimately state actors.</div>
              <div class="quote_body">I beg to differ that Hamas is the single threat to peace btwn the Israelis and Palestinians. It is the penultimate threat to peace between them.<br></div>

              <p>People will be selective. Some blatantly selective.</p>
              <p>When someone else's report or article expresses opinion that is
              in line their sentiments, it will be touted as authoritative
              statements that support their views. Any report or article that is
              critical of their views will be touted as foreign trash.</p>
              <p>When the omniscience [archangel] ask you "What do you think of
              the Isreal/Palestine conflict?" The subject is not important, as
              the emphasis is on the "you".</p>
              <p>Are you going to produce UN reports, and other peoples'
              opinion?</p>
              <p>Read them, digest them, and please come up with your own opinion
              and assessment.</p>
              <p>You are not the product of one infusion of information, but the
              sum total of all the information gathered through the years.
              Therefore it is biasness on your part that make you select
              information agreeable to you, and label information otherwise as
              that of staple foreign lies.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>My Islamophobia is garnered through the years of observation of
              Muslim neighbours, friends, colleagues, countries,
              governments and news reports. And not through staple
              American reports. Individually I have no quarrel with Muslims, but
              collectively I do not trust the "jemmiah islamiah". They are evil,
              like the communist of the Stalin, Mao era. The grassroots
              are the sheeps, it is the higher hierachy that are wolf in sheep
              clothings. Everywhere, when a Muslim community is small,
              they behave peacefully, but when they grow, they become
              belligerent, discriminatory, and oppressive and
              imperialistic contrary to the tenets promised in their
              theology. Their defence is  justification, divine
              justification. Never once acknowledging that it is their yokel
              mentality that is taken advantage of by those who have
              political agenda through religion. Belief, as that is what
              relligion actually is, is a strong motivational force.</p>
              <p>Can there be peace between Isreal and Palestine? My opinion is
              no. Because the of the hijacked religion of the majority of
              the Palestinian people. Why is the religion of peace unable to
              procure peace in the Middle East? Simple, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I see</span> it is because there is
              great avenue for political hatred in the faith. This explosive
              force is acknowledged by the political leaders of our country,
              and of those around us.</p>
              <p>My personal opinion expressed here could invite enforcement
              actions, therefore the qualification "my personal opinion". And
              believe me, I am holding back.</p>
              <p>Your observation is inciteful. However, allow me to analyze it from an intellectual perspective. What underlies the basis of your judgement? No mention of viable observational tools follow your baseless allegations. In addtion, your comprehension of history is grossly inadequate. Islam as a larger entity has proven during the era prior to the European Renaissance that minority groups are treated with a much higher degree of dignity vis a vis the Romans or Crusaders. </p>
              <p>Reading on your initial paragraph, I understand what substantiates your blatant ignorance. You base your claims upon personal opinions and assessments which severely lack any justifications of intellectual discourse.</p>
              <p>Every religion has its share of extremists as history and proper reasearch would enlighten you. Any civilization has harboured and implemented imperialstic tendencies on mankind, whether it is for the good or better, history has and will judge.</p>
              <p>Why can never be peace: Because of the unfortunate presence of individuals like yourself who attempt to promote anarchy and animosity through a mint coat of political correct-ness and feeble scholarlistic attempts.</p>

              <p>Truthfully, i agree with you this has nothing to do with History. But the people who believe Israel is justified in this discussion are the ones pulling out all the history, siting it as truth that the Israelis are only partipating in self defense, not wholesale slaughter.</p>
              <p>Jarhum is merely correcting the history that they are quoting.</p>
              <p>Common sense also tells me BOTH sides must have done something wrong when two people are fighting.</p>
              <p>Common sense tells me that i wouldn't shoot rockets at the houses of others if i feel there is no injustice involved.</p>
              <p> Common sense tells me a death ratio of 1:45(rounded up) is not all a reasonable response, no matter how justifiable.</p>

              <p>jojobch,</p>
              <p>Mancha's 'personal opinion' is not a mere commentary on the actions of terrorists who are Muslims by name but rather an attack on the Muslim community as a whole which is most certainly tantamount to an act of sedition. I am sorry you perceive the writer's opinion wrongly.  Allow me to quote:</p>
              <p>"but
                                      collectively I do not trust the "jemmiah islamiah". They are evil.</p>
              <p>"Everywhere, when a Muslim community is small,
                                      they behave peacefully, but when they grow, they become
                                      belligerent, discriminatory, and oppressive and
                                      imperialistic contrary to the tenets promised in their
                                      theology."</p>
              <p>This statement is not associated to terrorists act by al-qaeda or JI for they are of the minority few.  The acts of this people who comprise of a minute proportion of the larger muslim world are condoned by the larger muslim community. However, this renegade asserts that the larger Muslim community is as such.</p>
              <p>I am not appalled at an individuals ignorance of Islam or its history but rather appalled towards baseless assertion which contradicts history or whichever subject matter which concerns it. </p>
              <p>The moral of the story is, If you are not well informed with regards to a certain topic, refrain from making wild, asserting statements which may result in widespread consequences.</p>
              <p>Your incapacity to comprehend with simple assertions baffles me. Your constant referrence to analogies reflect your inability for full understanding.</p>
              <p>Let me put acroos this point in your own words, " If i'm a doctor I would not reprimand or be appalled with a patient for his ignorance about his health condition but rather his odesity to argue with baseless and unfounded as well as even contradictory statements with someone who has exercised due dilligence on the topic."</p>
              <p>If you really think I lack COMMON SENSE, you are most welcome to challenge me to a discussion or debate. This is the second time I have made this invitation which you have avoided.</p>
              <p>If I were you, I rather distant myself from Mancha's "Personal Opinion"</p>
