              <p><br>Not condemn Hamas?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must be addled in your brains! They are the antagonist in the entire middle east plans for peace with their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">call for genocide upon a nation!.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hold more respect for a dog, a cat, a pig, a horse or a cow than to Hamas. They are worst than animals, they are beasts. They and their kind murder innocent people, both palestinians and jews as well as others in their mis-guided agenda to achieve political and religious domination, but only tools and fools used by bigger fishes seeking for world domination by the persian Iran and Al Queda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make no mistake, even as i am a humanitarian, believe me, i would NOT hesistate to pull the trigger to blow their brains out the way i would blow a mauling tiger in order to save precious human lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the hell is 'disportionate' ? A stone that kills is equivalent to a nuclear bomb that wipes out, because human lives are lost. Does it matter to a human or their loved ones if it was a stone or a nuke that kill the victim?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> How many precious lives lost then can it be called 'proportionate'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The human life is precious. I would had been apathetic and closed my eyes and ears to everything else. But our late Ms Lo Hwee Yen made me realise how precious life is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> It was not because she was pretty. It was not because she was a grad. It was not because she was successful. It was because she was human. With a life ahead to live. And yet mercilessly cut down. By an evil ideology manipulated from a peaceful religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as innocent Jews and Palestinian lives were cut down. Men, women and espacially children. By an ideology that gains sympathies, funds and recruits to grow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No. I have no sympathy for Hamas and their kind or for those who sympathize with them. My sympathies are for the innocent jews and palestinians who had to bear with them, and died because of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May they finally find peace. And their loved ones bear the sorrow the way loved ones of our Ms Lo bore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moderate Muslims must stand up to end this tragedy of our times, of a religion hijacked by beasts, denounce them, and issue hunting licence for every single one of them. They are not fighting on behalf of religion, they are only destroying it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Muslim holy book cannot shoulder this responsibility of being spat upon by billions of this world whom are not muslims as more innocents die. There are too many beautiful verses in the Koran that comforts the soul, just like the Bible, the Buddhist Sutras and the Hindu Vedas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I , a non-muslim, would wear a sackcloth, for the sacriledge the terrorists had done to the holy book, written by a good man who lived during the 6th century, who united and uplifted a diverse nomadic society into greatness and knowing the Almighty, giving peace to a people whom faced brutal tribal leadership in a harsh land.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Peace be unto all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS:- My sense of right and wrong is always clear where human lives are concerned. I hold doctors with the highest regard. I could never swear to the Hippocratic oath, knowing that i must save a life even whom he/she will only continue to murder many other lives once he lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as Muslims and non-muslims are oblivious to the despicable Hamas and others like them on the harm they do to innocent lives and yet continue to support them. At least doctors attempt to save lives, these supporters only help encourage murdering of more lives.</p>

              <p>Well, I'm not saying that I support what is going on in Gaza thats for sure.  But given the kind of history we're talking about, the explosive mix of Palestinian Nationalism and regligious extremism, I think there is little we can do but watch the dominoes fall.  At least for now...</p>
              <p>I optimistically believe that not all the Arabs have axes to grind with Israel.  And the Arab peace initiative you mentioned is a good point supporting that.  However, the Arabs themselves are split between the moderates and the extremes.  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait etc, all have an interest in regional stability for the sake of profits.  Its the other bunch such as Iran and Syria thats destabilizing the region with their invisible hands, encouraging groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas in taunting Israel, drawing their military out for a fight.  Bush Jr  may have been an unpopular President, but he was right on the money naming Iran and Syria to be part of that axis of evil. These are the bunch that need to be dealt with in order to cut off Hezbollah and Hamas, the parties that are number 1 at antagonizing Israel. </p>
              <p>When the world first discovered strategic air power, people who believed in it, also believed that the way to win a war, was to bomb the enemy's infrastructure, women and children such that the enemy loses political will to fight.   We moved on from that thankfully.  However, Hamas and Hezbollah didn't.  On the other hand, from the footages I saw, Israel's retaliatory strike in Cast Lead had specifically targeted rocket launch sites and ammunition storage.  </p>
              <p>Look, these guys responsible for all those civilian casualties are hiding high explosives in Mosques and buildings with civilian infrastructure in the vincinity.  While the IAF had relied on targeting pods and laser guided bombs to hit back, Hamas has been shooting rockets into civilian populated areas.  It seems that nobody except Hamas and Hezbollah are targeting civilian populations. </p>
              <p>You take a trip to Israel and you will realize how ridiculous it is for a modern nation, prosperous as it is, to be at perpetual state of war and anxiety, not knowing when the next rocket attack will come.  Rocket attacks not sent from another hostile state, but by this blood thirsty organization hiding in the Gaza.  I can totally understand why the Israelis choose to hit back.  </p>
              <p>As Sith teaching goes, "Peace is a lie, there is only passion."  The Peace Loving majority would have no means to enforce peace other than through the force of arms.  How do you subdue belligerents other than through violence?  You may lable me Realist now. =D</p>
              <p> There are "peace loving" majorities on both side of the fence here.  The Palestinian people who are tired of seeing their loved ones being blown up by the crossfire between the IDF and Hamas,  and the "peace loving" majorities in Israel who are tired of suicide bombers and incessant rocket attacks places of congregation.  So which "peace loving" majority is gonna have their way?  From what it looks like, neither are.  Since Peace on both sides is impossible without the elimination of Hamas and Hezbollah, then there is only strife until one side prevails.  Then, there will be peace... until the next asshole comes along.  </p>
              <p>From the way I look at it.  You have a few kinda people in the Gaza right now, or within Hamas.  One, the ones who believe Israeli is an abomination that needs to be wiped off the face of the earth.  Two, those who believe that Palestine should be a sovereign state. Both fight Israel.  The latter bunch would adhere to a ceasefire or truce... but the first will always provoke.  If you can clear out type One, who knows what kind of settle might be possible, and perhaps... peace? Until then, the situation will be as in the preceding paragraph. </p>

              <p>Problem is with the attempts to destroy Type One, it is inevitable that you are going to have to destroy property and lives. Technology isn't that advanced, and the way the Palestinians are packed together you cannot avoid collateral damage.  </p>
              <p>With each attempt, it is going to be more and more difficult for the Palestinian Peaceniks to convince their people that a ceasefire and truce is in their best interest.</p>
              <p>Arguing whether the Israelis are justified in their retaliation is a moot point, it's just going to be a fact that Hamas will only grow stronger the way they're doing it, because through these actions you allow their more radical elements to take power.</p>
              <p>They take power and resume their rocket/terrorists attacks, prompting the more radical elements of the Israel government to respond with more retaliatory strikes.  </p>
              <p>We comment on Israel/Hamas/Hezbollah like it's a single group mind but as long as there is a group of humans they are going to be differing views on how best to accomplish something.</p>
              <p> Israel's counterattack will only escalate the conflict, not resolve it.</p>

              <p>Israel's counter attack won't escalate the conflict because it already has been escalated.  What is the worst the Hamas can do with the IDF locking down Gaza and pounding them from the air, land and sea?  Launch  more rockets?  Israel has already been constantly bombarded by those, so no change there, no escalation there.</p>
              <p>The reverse can be said to be true.  As the IAF targets more and more missile sites in the Hamas in the Gaza, Hamas is gonna start running out of launchers soon.  Palestinian " "Peaceniks" ( i like that term ;-) ) should have been violently prosecuting Hamas members and not letting them use the Gaza strip as launchpad (literally).  </p>
              <p>And here's a little point of consideration for you.  If the Palestinians were truly a peace loving bunch that abhor violence, it wouldn't really take that much effort to convince them that a ceasefire and truce (and maintenance of it) is in their best interest don't you think?  There is a fundamental problem with Palestinian society that takes to extremism and violence too easily.  Its equally sad and disturbing to see 5 year old Palestinian kids reciting poetry of "Martyrdom." </p>
              <p>The conflict, or rather incessant terrorist attacks and rocket/mortar attacks has already reached an escalated level.  They are not capable of mounting an outright invasion or launching any larger scale attacks than the ones they have already done.  At least not without the IDF sitting on their doorsteps and pounding away.  The reverse is true, the IDF can still choose to increase the level of violence and pressure on Hamas. </p>
              <p>Israel's retaliation however, may push Israeli-Palestinian "relations" (i'm not sure why im using this term, they aren't even a state...)  to a point of no-return.  However, "relations" is a pretty small "r" to worry about when you have "Rockets" coming your way. </p>

              <p>Hamas does not recognize Israel's sovereignty, and they are sworn to destroy Israel. In this case, concessions are out. Giving way to their demands are out. So what else is there for Israel to do that you think is effective?</p>
              <p>I see a lot of condemnations, but no solution provided forward. As Israel, i think it has the right to stop rockets firing into its land.</p>
              <p>Someone said that Israel had planned the land invasion long before the truce ended and claimed that this shows Israel's evil intentions. My take is that its leaders have the foresight to preempt the possible resumption of Hama's attacks and putting in place a plan before the truce ended.</p>

              <p>googoomuck,</p>
              <p>History is perceptible from different angles.</p>
              <p>Although I have scrolled through my posts time and time again,
              never did I state that Israel invaded and occupied territories. Its
              just a figment of your imagination that I did.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned it, Israel did invade and <span>OCCUPY</span> territories. Even the Israelies would affirm to
              that fact. Read U.N resolution 242.</p>
              <p>On what basis does your pathetic intellectual capacity attest to
              the claim that the Arabs were the aggresors? You desire to adhere
              to a claim which is one of a perceptible and contentious nature. I
              simply asserted that the Arabs retailiated in broad view of the
              historical fact that Israel <span>DID</span> conduct the
              first pre emptive strike before an official declaration of war.
              Since Egypt, Jordan and Syria are legitimately state actors of the
              international realm, the corresponding attack on Israel following
              its preemptive<br> strike would be called a retaliation.</p>
              <p>I begin to detect nuances of racism in your third paragraph
              which is most certainly unconstructive for any intellectual debate
              or discussion. But then again I shall not insult myself.</p>
              <p>Both of your claims are ambigious and inaccurate. And for your
              info, this is not a myth but could possibly tantamount to a myth if
              not kept in check.</p>
              <p>firstly only 3 nations initially amassed their troops of 3
              front. (congrats, you got the number of fronts right). then Iraq
              joined in the fray soon after. Even so, this fact falls short of
              3-4 nations as you claim)</p>

                  would NOT hesistate to pull the trigger to blow their brains out
                  the way i would blow a mauling tiger in order to save precious

              <p>What the hell is 'disportionate' ? A stone that kills is
                  equivalent to a nuclear bomb that wipes out, because human lives
                  are lost. Does it matter to a human or their loved ones if it was a

                  was a grad. It was not because she was successful. It was because
                  she was human. With a life ahead to live. And yet mercilessly cut
                  down. By an evil ideology manipulated from a peaceful religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as innocent Jews and Palestinian lives were cut down. Men,

              <p> </p>
              <p>No. I have no sympathy for Hamas and their kind or for those who
                  sympathize with them. My sympathies are for the innocent jews and
                  palestinians who had to bear with them, and died because of
                  them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May they finally find peace. And their loved ones bear the

              <p>Moderate Muslims must stand up to end this tragedy of our times,
                  of a religion hijacked by beasts, denounce them, and issue hunting
                  licence for every single one of them. They are not fighting on
                  behalf of religion, they are only destroying it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Muslim holy book cannot shoulder this responsibility of
                  being spat upon by billions of this world whom are not muslims as
                  more innocents die. There are too many beautiful verses in the
                  Koran that comforts the soul, just like the Bible, the Buddhist
                  Sutras and the Hindu Vedas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I , a non-muslim, would wear a sackcloth, for the sacriledge the
                  terrorists had done to the holy book, written by a good man who
                  lived during the 6th century, who united and uplifted a diverse
                  nomadic society into greatness and knowing the Almighty, giving
                  peace to a people whom faced brutal tribal leadership in a harsh

              <p> </p>
              <p>PS:- My sense of right and wrong is always clear where human
                  lives are concerned. I hold doctors with the highest regard. I
                  could never swear to the Hippocratic oath, knowing that i must save
                  a life even whom he/she will only continue to murder many other
                  lives once he lives.</p>

              <p>Just as Muslims and non-muslims are oblivious to the despicable

                  and yet continue to support them. At least doctors attempt to save

              <p>Israel's counter attack won't escalate the conflict because it
              already has been escalated.  What is the worst the Hamas can
              do with the IDF locking down Gaza and pounding them from the air,
              land and sea?  Launch  more rockets?  Israel has
              already been constantly bombarded by those, so no change there, no
              escalation there.</p>
              <p>The reverse can be said to be true.  As the IAF targets
              more and more missile sites in the Hamas in the Gaza, Hamas is
              gonna start running out of launchers soon.  Palestinian "
              "Peaceniks" ( i like that term ;-) ) should have been violently
              prosecuting Hamas members and not letting them use the Gaza strip
              as launchpad (literally).  </p>
              <p>And here's a little point of consideration for you.  If the
              Palestinians were truly a peace loving bunch that abhor violence,
              it wouldn't really take that much effort to convince them that a
              ceasefire and truce (and maintenance of it) is in their best
              interest don't you think?  There is a fundamental problem with
              Palestinian society that takes to extremism and violence too
              easily.  Its equally sad and disturbing to see 5 year old
              Palestinian kids reciting poetry of "Martyrdom." </p>
              <p>The conflict, or rather incessant terrorist attacks and
              rocket/mortar attacks has already reached an escalated level.
               They are not capable of mounting an outright invasion or
              launching any larger scale attacks than the ones they have already
              done.  At least not without the IDF sitting on their doorsteps
              and pounding away.  The reverse is true, the IDF can still
              choose to increase the level of violence and pressure on
              Hamas. </p>
              <p>Israel's retaliation however, may push Israeli-Palestinian
              "relations" (i'm not sure why im using this term, they aren't even
              a state...)  to a point of no-return.  However,
              "relations" is a pretty small "r" to worry about when you have
              "Rockets" coming your way. </p>
              <p>Thats just the way things are, IMO.</p>

              <p>Even peace-loving people will have to retaliate when their compatriots are dying everyday from air strikes, which they have no way of retaliating at all. Too much hatred has gone into the land for any peace to arise.</p>

              refuge and even non- Gazans were maliciously killed by the
              <span>IDF</span> the perpertrators of terrorism.</p>
              <p>There exists no tangible association with Gazans giving Hamas
              the popular vote as the main raison d etre is the terrible and
              overwhelming corruption of Fatah and the lack of social services

              <p>So let's use the example of how the US bombed a wedding procession in Afghanistan. Perhaps the night before, some Taliban had passed the same place. Even though the US has the world's most well-funded intelligence agency, the next morning, while some Afghans were making merry, US war planes (who couldnt distinguish a wedding procession from a Taliban mob) dropped some thousand pound bomb on the group. That sure is a good way to win the hearts and minds of the Afghanistan people.</p>

                  this world, you need to follow some or all of four things: <strong>Money, blood,
                  power or natural resources (usually oil or natural gas but it can be cobalt
                  like in the Congo).</strong></span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Oil is behind the conflicts in Darfur, Somalia and other
                  similar places.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The war in Afghanistan was never about finding bin Laden.
                   It was about uniting Afghanistan into a single government so a pipeline
                  could be constructed to bring a million barrels a day from areas north
                  of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia to markets
                  (<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/sardi7.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/sardi7.html</a>). </span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">We need to stop listening to what the "official"
                  media tells us when it comes to conflicts and wars because the official
                  media is corporate and government owned and/or controlled by government.
                   Less than one percent of the "news" in the world today is reported
                  and what is reported is usually heavily edited and slanted for propaganda
                  purposes.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-small;">Governments don't want the world to know that huge genocides
                  are going on just because of oil, gas or other natural resources.  The
                  world might get angry as a body and might organize to reject the genocides.
                   Big Oil and Energy doesn't want that to happen because it will interfere
                  with their profits. </span></strong> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Historically, it has been "efficient" for Big
                  Energy's short-term profit line to steal resources or get them "lower
                  than wholesale" than to pay the owners decently for them.  This is
                  how they've always done business (force by boot and gun).</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The World has been watching Israel's genocide of the
                  Palestinians for a long time but incredibly, the media never mentions the
                  Palestinians' natural resources or the fact that Israel has thwarted Palestine's
                  efforts to develop them.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The Palestinians are usually portrayed on television
                  as victims of impossible, cyclical poverty.  Ironic the Palestinians wouldn't
                  have to live in poverty if Israel would let them develop their natural
                  resources. </span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But developing Palestine's energy resources wouldn't
                  be in Israel's self-interest.  The oil and gas revenues would empower the
                  Palestinians.  They wouldn't have to starve to death or struggle in poverty.
                   Empowered Palestinians would be able to invest in infrastructure of their
                  legal government, Hamas. </span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Israel wants the Palestinians crushed and disappeared
                  so Israel can expand its territories for its citizens, have better access
                  to the sea for its navy and serve as watchdog for US and Israeli hegemony. </strong></span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Israel wants the Palestinians' oil and gas for its own
                  because Israel needs it for its country's needs.  Middle eastern countries
                  are loathe to sell their supplies to Israel.  The rulers and people of
                  area countries know that Israel has been slaughtering their Muslim kin
                  for over six decades and it is against their morals to help Israel with
                  energy supplies, especially fuel for Israeli tanks, airplanes and military
                  vehicles.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">To thwart Palestine from developing its energy supplies,
                  Israel keeps the region in turmoil plus in 2005, "Israel delivered
                  a major blow to the Palestinians' fledgling oil industry by choosing to
                  import natural gas from Egypt.  By doing this, Israel completely bypassed
                  its neighbor in favor of making a political statement.  The Israeli government
                  feared that any money given to Palestine would be later used to fund acts
                  of terrorism against Israel."<a href="http://www.oilandgasinvestingglossary.com/palestines_natural_gas_troubles.asp">http://www.oilandgasinvestingglossary.com/palestines_natural_gas_troubles.asp</a>)</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Finding information about Palestine's oil and gas resources
                  is difficult.  Even wikipedia doesn't mention it nor do most encyclopedias
                  and other academic resources.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The major corporate media has completely ignored and/or
                  has remained blissfully ignorant about Palestinian oil and gas <strong>because
                  it goes against the script of how powerful hidden western corporate and
                  government interests want to portray Palestine. </strong></span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-small;">Western media, Israel and the US would rather have the
                  world see Palestinians groveling in extreme poverty and/or portrayed as
                  "terrorists" who want to kill everyone. </span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Palestinians, empowered from oil and gas revenues, could
                  live decently.</strong> Shed of their impoverished image, the world would see them
                  as the Bright, Shining Human Beings they are.  But Bright, Shining Human
                  Beings are harder to disappear than those depicted by governments and the
                  media as untermenschen (nazi German term for "inferior people").</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">If you want to know more about this important subject,
                  the best places to look are oil and energy websites and publications.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Palestinian oil and gas is no secret in the energy field.
                  It's just a secret to everyone else.</span> </dt></dl>

              </span></p><p>As Operation Cast Lead concluded its harshest 24
                  hours on Tuesday after the IDF lost five soldiers, senior defense
                  officials revealed that the army was prepared to deploy in the entire
                  Gaza Strip, if necessary.</p>
                
              <p>Defense
                  Minister Ehud Barak will decide in the coming days whether Israel
                  should expand the ground operation against the Hamas terrorist
                  infrastructure, they said.</p>
              <p>Since the ground operation was launched on Saturday, IDF troops
                  from several infantry and armored brigades have, according to
                  Palestinian reports, taken up positions throughout northern Gaza - near
                  Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanun, Jabalya, Saja'iya and al-Atatra.</p>
              <p>Despite increasing international pressure on Israel to withdraw
                  its troops, a senior official confirmed that plans had been drawn up to
                  move troops into the south as well.</p>

                  Brigade. Another tank accidentally fired on a home in al-Atatra,
                  killing an officer in the 202nd Battalion of the Paratroop Brigade.</p>
              <p>The
                  soldiers were Cpl. Yousef Moadi, 19, who lived recently in Haifa, but
                  was originally from the Druse village of Yirka; Maj. Dagan Wertman, 32,
                  from Ma'aleh Michmash in the Binyamin region; St.-Sgt. Nitai Stern, 21,
                  from Jerusalem; and Capt. Yonatan Netanel, 27, from Kedumim.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday morning, St.-Sgt. Alexander Mashevizky, 21, was
                  killed and four other soldiers from a joint Golani-Engineering Corps
                  force were lightly wounded in a gun battle with Hamas operatives in
                  northern Gaza City.</p>
              <p>Mashevizky, a member of an elite Engineering Corps unit, led
                  the joint force, which was ambushed by Hamas gunmen while conducting
                  ground sweeps. The Hamas operatives were reportedly hit by IDF fire.</p>
              <p>Barak said Tuesday that Israel had paid a painful price for a bitter, unavoidable battle.</p>
              <p>"It is a bitter battle, but an unavoidable one," he continued.
                  "No peace-loving country can allow a terrorist organization to ruin
                  daily life and embitter the lives of civilians."</p>
              <p>A senior IDF officer said on Tuesday that Hamas had stepped up
                  its attacks against troops based in the periphery of towns and villages
                  in northern Gaza. Over 150 Palestinians have been arrested in Gaza.</p>
              <p>There have also been a number of kidnapping attempts by Hamas operatives who pop out of tunnels and try to grab soldiers.</p>
              <p>If the IDF decides to expand its operations, it may send some of
                  the reservists who have been training in the South into the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>"Hamas is trying to draw us inside the built-up areas," said a
                  senior IDF officer, speaking by a secure phone line from the field.
                  "Hamas is trying to avoid a classic battle with us. Last night, we had
                  a suicide bomber who tried to break into a compound and blow up, and
                  the force responded quickly. There is also sniper fire from hundreds of
                  meters away, and when we get into buildings there is a lot of mortar
                  fire."</p>
              <p>In spite of the fierce fighting, diplomatic activity has begun
                  to gain steam, and defense officials predicted that Operation Cast Lead
                  could be over in the coming week if a diplomatic resolution is
                  achieved.</p>
              <p>The IDF is conditioning its acceptance of a new cease-fire with
                  Hamas on the establishment of a supervision mechanism in the Gaza Strip
                  and the creation of a force based along the Egyptian side of the
                  Philadelphi Corridor to prevent the smuggling of weaponry and
                  explosives from Egypt into Gaza.</p>
              <p>Amid international criticism over civilian deaths and
                  increasing calls for a cease-fire, IDF soldiers edged closer to two
                  major Gaza towns on Tuesday.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>A total of 58 Palestinians were killed Tuesday, including 30
                  who were reportedly killed in an IDF mortar attack on a Jabalya school
                  from which Hamas was launching mortars into IDF positions.</strong></span> The IDF said
                  that several Hamas gunmen were among those killed in the school.</p>
              <p>Senior officers said the IDF would likely deepen its operations in Gaza in the coming days.</p>
              <p>Since it took up positions in northern Gaza, the IDF said Hamas
                  was having difficulty in launching long-range Katyusha rockets against
                  Ashdod and Beersheba.</p>
              <p>"Unless Hamas comes to its senses, we will find ourselves in
                  other parts of the Gaza Strip," a senior officer said. "Hamas is
                  determined, and this operation is not a walk in the park."</p>
              <p>The IAF also struck the home of one of the founders of Hamas's
                  rocket division on Tuesday. The IDF said that the terror chief, Iman
                  Siam, was in his house at the time of the air strike in Jabalya.</p>
              <p>The army said that in addition to being a founder of Hamas's
                  rocket-launching program, Siam was the head of the group's artillery
                  program throughout the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>At least 10 Hamas and Islamic Jihad gunmen were killed in other
                  Gaza battles early Tuesday, the IDF said, claiming that soldiers had
                  killed close to 150 Hamas gunmen since the ground operation was
                  launched on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Paratroopers operating near the town of al-Atatra discovered a
                  booby-trapped doll at the entrance to a smuggling tunnel. The doll-bomb
                  was safely dismantled.</p>
              <p>A Givati force entered a school on Monday night, and in the
                  morning discovered that it was rigged with explosives that were
                  connected to a piano in a nearby home.</p>
              <p>In an overnight clash, paratroopers operating near al-Atatra
                  spotted a suicide bomber and opened fire on him. The shooting triggered
                  his explosive belt, which killed him when it detonated. One soldier was
                  lightly wounded in the incident.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere, a booby-trapped house was bombed. The IDF believed that under the house were a number of smuggling tunnels.</p>
              <p>The IDF announced that it had conducted over 30 sorties during overnight operations late Monday and early Tuesday.</p>
              <p>During the raids, IAF planes bombed the Jabalya home of Basal
                  Abu Wadi, a prominent Hamas military officer who was at the level of a
                  company commander in Izzadin Kassam.</p>
              <p>The Jabalya home of another Hamas officer, Ashraf Guda, was
                  destroyed in a different air strike. His house was said to function as
                  a Hamas command and control center.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gaza truce proposed after Israeli shell kills 30</span></strong></p>
              <p>By IBRAHIM BARZAK and JASON KEYSER</p>
              <p>Associated Press Writers: GAZA CITY, Gaza (AP) âÂ€Â” France and Egypt announced an initiative to stop the fighting in Gaza late Tuesday, hours after Israeli mortar shells exploded near a U.N. school sheltering hundreds of people displaced by the onslaught on Hamas militants. At least 30 Palestinians died, staining streets with blood.</p>
              <p>The Egyptian and French presidents didn't release details of their proposal, saying only that it involved an immediate cease-fire to permit humanitarian aid into Gaza and talks to settle the differences between Israel and the Islamic militants of Hamas who rule the small coastal territory.</p>
              <p>They said they were awaiting a response from Israel. Israeli officials in Jerusalem declined immediate comment on the announcement, which came amid diplomatic efforts by the U.S. and other nations to resolve a conflict that has seen 600 people killed in 11 days.</p>
              <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice weclomed the initiative, but cautioned that no agreement would succeed unless it halted Hamas rocket attacks on Israel and arms smuggling into Gaza.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the day, President-elect Barack Obama broke his silence on the crisis, saying that "the loss of civilian life in Gaza and in Israel is a source of deep concern for me." He declined to go further, reiterating his stance that the U.S. has only one president at a time.</p>
              <p>Israel's military said its shelling at the school âÂ€Â” the deadliest single episode since Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza on Saturday after a week of air bombardment âÂ€Â” was a response to mortar fire from within the school and said Hamas militants were using civilians as cover.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two residents of the area who spoke with The Associated Press by telephone said they saw a small group of militants firing mortar rounds from a street near the school, where 350 people had gathered to get away from the shelling. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Majed Hamdan, an AP photographer, rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks. At the hospital, he said, many children were among the dead.</p>
              <p>"I saw women and men âÂ€Â” parents âÂ€Â” slapping their faces in grief, screaming, some of them collapsed to the floor. They knew their children were dead," he said. "In the morgue, most of the killed appeared to be children. In the hospital, there wasn't enough space for the wounded."</p>
              <p>He said there appeared to be marks on the pavement of five separate explosions in area of the school.</p>
              <p>An Israeli defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to make the information public, said it appeared the military used 120-mm shells, among the largest mortar rounds.</p>
              <p>U.N. officials demanded an investigation of the shelling. The carnage, which included 55 wounded, added to a surging civilian toll and drew mounting international pressure for Israel to end the offensive against Hamas.</p>
              <p>At a news conference in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the truce proposal offered by him and French President Sarkozy envisioned an immediate end to combat, so humanitarian supplies can safely enter Gaza.</p>
              <p>Mubarak said the plan also calls for an urgent meeting between Israel and the Palestinians to discuss ways to resolve the conflict and provide necessary guarantees to ensure fighting doesn't erupt again.</p>
              <p>There was no indication of the plan's chances. Sarkozy said at the news conference that he saw it as a "small hope" for ending the Gaza violence.</p>
              <p>Sarkozy said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to inform him of the initiaitve and was awaiting a response.</p>
              <p>He said Mubarak invited Israel "to come discuss the question of border security ... (and) that could be in the hours ahead."</p>
              <p>In Jerusalem, Olmert's spokesman, Mark Regev, told AP: "We are holding off comments on that for the time being."</p>
              <p>At U.N. headquarters, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the proposal. "I express my support for the plan set in motion today by President Mubarak and President Sarkozy," said Abbas, who was in New York for a Security Council meeting on the Gaza crisis.</p>
              <p>Israeli officials have said any cease-fire agreement must prevent further rocket attacks by Gaza militants and put in place measures to prevent the smuggling of missile and other weapons into the small Palestinian territory.</p>
              <p>Rice told the Security Council meeting that the U.S. understood the growing desire for a cease-fire. "In this regard, we are pleased by, and wish to commend, the statement of the president of Egypt and to follow up on that initiative," she said.</p>
              <p>But Rice added that any solution must address Israel's security.</p>
              <p>"There must be a solution this time that does not allow Hamas to use Gaza as a launching pad against Israeli cities. It has to be a solution that does not allow the rearmament of Hamas, and it must be a solution that finds a way to open (border) crossings so that Palestinians in Gaza can have a normal life," she said.</p>
              <p>In the wake of the criticism over civilian casualties, Israel agreed to set up a "humanitarian corridor" to ship vital supplies into the Gaza Strip. Under the plan, put forward by the Israeli Defense Ministry, Israel would suspend attacks in certain areas to allow people to get supplies.</p>
              <p>At U.N. headquarters, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the Israeli bombardment of U.N. facilities in Gaza "totally unacceptable." Israel's shells have fallen around three schools, including the girls school hit Tuesday, and a health center for Palestinian refugees.</p>
              <p>Ban added that it was "equally unacceptable" for militants to take actions that endanger Palestinian civilians, referring to the practice of militants making attacks from residential areas.</p>
              <p>Some 15,000 Palestinians have packed the U.N.'s 23 Gaza schools because their homes were destroyed or to flee the violence. The U.N. provided the Israeli military with GPS coordinates for all of them.</p>
              <p>The three mortar shells that crashed down on the perimeter of the U.N. school struck at midafternoon, when many people in the densely populated camp were outside getting some fresh air, thinking an area around a school was safe.</p>
              <p>Images recorded by a cameraman from AP Television News showed crowds fleeing the scene, pavements smeared with blood and battered bodies being carried off by medics and bystanders. A youth who limped away was helped along by several others. Sandals lay scattered on the pavement by a pock-marked wall.</p>
              <p>"There's nowhere safe in Gaza. Everyone here is terrorized and traumatized," said John Ging, head of Gaza operations for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</p>
              <p>An Israeli military statement said it received intelligence that the dead at the girls school included Hamas operatives, among them members of a rocket-launching squad. It identified two of them as Imad Abu Askar and Hassan Abu Askar.</p>
              <p>Two residents who spoke to an AP reporter by phone said the two brothers were known to be low-level Hamas militants. They said a group of militants âÂ€Â” one of them said four âÂ€Â” were firing mortar shells from near the school.</p>
              <p>An Israeli shell targeted the men, but missed and they fled, the witnesses said. Then another three shells landed nearby, exploding among civilians, they said, refusing to allow their names to be published because they feared for their safety.</p>
              <p>A total of 71 Palestinians were killed Tuesday âÂ€Â” with just two confirmed as militants, Gaza health officials said.</p>
              <p>An Israeli infant was wounded by one of about two dozen rockets fired into southern Israel by Gaza militants.</p>
              <p>Eleven Israelis have been killed since the offensive began: three civilians and a soldier by rocket fire and seven soldiers in the ground offensive, according to Isaeli officials.</p>

              <h1>Israel Hits Second U.N. School, Blasts Way Into Southern Gaza</h1>
              <p>Tuesday, January 06, 2009</p>
              <p><strong>Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli airstrike has hit a U.N. school in the northern Gaza Strip, the second deadly Israeli airstrike to hit a U.N. school on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Israel's military said its shelling was a response to mortar fire from within the school, pressing its assertion that Hamas militants are using civilians as cover. Two residents of the area who spoke to the Associated Press by telephone said they saw a handful of militants firing mortar shells from a street near the school.</p>
              <p>Israel has accused Hamas of using schools, mosques and residential areas for cover and staging grounds for terrorist attacks.</p>
              <p>Earlier Tuesday there was an attack that killed three at a school in the Gaza city itself.</p>
              <p>U.N. and Palestinian medics said 40 Palestinians were killed in the attack, including children, women and elderly people.</p>
              <p>Palestinian health official Said Joudeh told the Associated Press the school was turned into a shelter for people displaced by Israel's offensive against Hamas militants.</p>

              <p>Well Hamas played with fire with the full intention to be burnt. Isn't that obvious by now?</p>
