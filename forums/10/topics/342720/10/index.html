              <p>Israel will ignore the blatant attempts by HAMAS to use their

              the midst of the Palestinian schools, residential areas, and public
              places such as mosques and markets.</p>
              <p>HAMAS will have to learn that it will have to pay a high price
              for the foolish strategy that it purposefully perpetuate for a
              useless objective that reveal itself as being a pawn used at

              <p>Even the independent news agency has confirmed that the recent
              Israeli artillery retaliation that hit a UN school - was a result
              of some HAMAS militants purposefully firing from the vicinity of
              the UN school.</p>

              <p>Israel will continue to ignore HAMAS use of the Palestinian
              people as Human Shields when firing the undirected rockets and
              motars into Israeli villages.</p>
              <p>It is no use for HAMAS to cry foul or seek world

              extreme stupidity to carry out his threat of bombing Singapore,
              while using his civilians as Human Shield - do you expect the SAF
              to allow Singaporeans to be exposed to Mahathir's explosive antics,
              while we retaliate with one arm tied behind our backs ?</p>

              <p>After all, the Palestinians have already been dehumanised into the Other. Like how Hitler called Jews "sub-human parasites". So its not like any of you would see them as fellow human beings.</p>

              behind conflicts and wars in this world, you need to follow some or
              all of four things: <strong>Money, blood, power or natural
              resources (usually oil or natural gas but it can be cobalt like in
              the Congo).</strong></span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Oil is behind the conflicts
              in Darfur, Somalia and other similar places.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The war in Afghanistan was
              never about finding bin Laden. It was about uniting Afghanistan
              into a single government so a pipeline could be constructed to
              bring a million barrels a day from areas north of Afghanistan,
              Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia to markets
              (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/sardi7.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/sardi7.html</a>).</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">We need to stop listening to
              what the "official" media tells us when it comes to conflicts and
              wars because the official media is corporate and government owned
              and/or controlled by government. Less than one percent of the
              "news" in the world today is reported and what is reported is
              usually heavily edited and slanted for propaganda
              purposes.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-small;">Governments don't want the
              world to know that huge genocides are going on just because of oil,
              gas or other natural resources. The world might get angry as a body
              and might organize to reject the genocides. Big Oil and Energy
              doesn't want that to happen because it will interfere with their
              profits.</span></strong></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Historically, it has been
              "efficient" for Big Energy's short-term profit line to steal
              resources or get them "lower than wholesale" than to pay the owners
              decently for them. This is how they've always done business (force
              by boot and gun).</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The World has been watching
              Israel's genocide of the Palestinians for a long time but
              incredibly, the media never mentions the Palestinians' natural
              resources or the fact that Israel has thwarted Palestine's efforts
              to develop them.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The Palestinians are usually
              portrayed on television as victims of impossible, cyclical poverty.
              Ironic the Palestinians wouldn't have to live in poverty if Israel
              would let them develop their natural resources.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But developing Palestine's
              energy resources wouldn't be in Israel's self-interest. The oil and
              gas revenues would empower the Palestinians. They wouldn't have to
              starve to death or struggle in poverty. Empowered Palestinians
              would be able to invest in infrastructure of their legal
              government, Hamas.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Israel wants the
              Palestinians crushed and disappeared so Israel can expand its
              territories for its citizens, have better access to the sea for its
              navy and serve as watchdog for US and Israeli
              hegemony.</strong></span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Israel wants the
              Palestinians' oil and gas for its own because Israel needs it for
              its country's needs. Middle eastern countries are loathe to sell
              their supplies to Israel. The rulers and people of area countries
              know that Israel has been slaughtering their Muslim kin for over
              six decades and it is against their morals to help Israel with
              energy supplies, especially fuel for Israeli tanks, airplanes and
              military vehicles.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">To thwart Palestine from
              developing its energy supplies, Israel keeps the region in turmoil
              plus in 2005, "Israel delivered a major blow to the Palestinians'
              fledgling oil industry by choosing to import natural gas from
              Egypt. By doing this, Israel completely bypassed its neighbor in
              favor of making a political statement. The Israeli government
              feared that any money given to Palestine would be later used to
              fund acts of terrorism against Israel."<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oilandgasinvestingglossary.com/palestines_natural_gas_troubles.asp">http://www.oilandgasinvestingglossary.com/palestines_natural_gas_troubles.asp</a>)</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Finding information about
              Palestine's oil and gas resources is difficult. Even wikipedia
              doesn't mention it nor do most encyclopedias and other academic
              resources.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The major corporate media
              has completely ignored and/or has remained blissfully ignorant
              about Palestinian oil and gas <strong>because it goes against the
              script of how powerful hidden western corporate and government
              interests want to portray Palestine.</strong></span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-small;">Western
              media, Israel and the US would rather have the world see
              Palestinians groveling in extreme poverty and/or portrayed as
              "terrorists" who want to kill everyone.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Palestinians,
              empowered from oil and gas revenues, could live decently.</strong> Shed of their impoverished image, the world would see them as the
              Bright, Shining Human Beings they are. But Bright, Shining Human
              Beings are harder to disappear than those depicted by governments
              and the media as untermenschen (nazi German term for "inferior
              people").</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">If you want to know more
              about this important subject, the best places to look are oil and
              energy websites and publications.</span></dt> <dt> </dt> <dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Palestinian oil and gas is
              no secret in the energy field. It's just a secret to everyone
              else.</span></dt> </dl>

              <p>I have not sided with Hamas, nor have tried to whitewash its actions. My WWII analogy was simply to demonstrate that Palestinian lives are worth much less than Israeli lives. Also, the analogy of the Warsaw Ghetto serves to show that Israel, which controls most of Gaza's borders have isolated the Gazan population and deprived it of basic necessities. Before striking Gaza, the IAF drops leaflets warning Gazans to leave the area. How can they do that when Israel prevents them from leaving? If you cannot fathom the actuality and magnitude of this, then it is you who has been dehumanised.</p>
              <p>At the same time, I recognise that Hamas deserves retaliation for firing rockets into Israel. But with Israel's retaliation, the casualties are simply too unacceptable. It is here that you show yourself to be dehumanised again when you rationalise the loss of 550+ (and rising) Palestinian dead and 2800 wounded with a fraction of Israeli casualties. The article from the JP states 58 Palestinians (I'm sure there were more buried under rubble) while 40 rockets from Hamas didnt even kill even one Israeli. Sure, the Palestinians voted Hamas in. But what could you expect them to do when Israel is constantly making life hell for them? Do you expect them to continue to roll over and let Israel continue oppressing them?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>At the end of the day, this'll probably go on until either the Palestinians or Israeli are exterminated. The conflict has gone on too long to be tractable.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Using Singapore and Malaysia as an example is a flawed analogy. Malaysia is not occupying Singapore, nor restricting border access, nor controlling the flow of food, fuel or medical coming into Singapore. If we two fight, it'll be a WAR between two modern armies. Not a modern army against ragtag group of guerilla fighters. I'm sure I said something to this effect earlier on.</p>
              <p>And also, what about the dimension of Gaza's oil and natural gas reserves? With that new information, things change. It no longer belongs to the petty area of territorial concerns and religious pride, but geostrategy.</p>

              <p>GAZA CITY, Jan. 28 -- The radical Palestinian group Hamas, which has conducted numerous suicide bombings against Israelis and which the United States considers a terrorist organization, won an overwhelming victory in Thursday's local elections in the Gaza Strip, capturing almost two-thirds of all the seats being contested and seizing power in seven of the 10 towns where elections were held, according to independent analyses of results released on Friday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas, known officially as the Islamic Resistance Movement, won 76 of the 118 total seats, dealing a staggering blow to the Fatah movement, which was founded by Yasser Arafat and has been the most powerful Palestinian party for more than 30 years. Fatah, which is also the party of the Palestinian Authority's new president, Mahmoud Abbas, won 38 seats and took control of three councils. Three independent candidates and one from the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine also won seats.</p>

              <p><br>Do you need to be seen to take the side of Hamas or white-wash their actions - after the many views you have offered that clamour for the understanding of Hamas acts of atrocities, while turning a total blind eye to the callous attitude of Hamas in placing Palestinian lives in danger ?</p>
              <p>As was mentioned before, it takes a great leap of imagination to understand the purpose of your efforts to compare  the treatment of Jews in WW2 to be of any parallel to the sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
              <p>Why do you not compare the living conditions of the Palestinians in the West Bank to the self-imposed pain and sufferings preferred by the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - by supporting the Iranian financed Hamas ?</p>
              <p>Why did the Israelis not walled up the Palestinians in the West Bank ?</p>
              <p>Did Hamas make any announcement to Israelis when and where their rockets and mortar shells will land ?</p>
              <p>At least the Israeli had announced their intention and had given the Hamas fighters time to move out of the intended target area.</p>
              <p>Did the Israelis prevent the Palestinians from leaving the targetted area ?</p>
              <p>Do you know that the Gaza Strip can be seen on the World Map, while this little red dot can hardly even be seen ?</p>
              <p>Yet this little red dot can accomodate 4.5 million Singaporeans with enough space to move out of specific areas to allow a gathering of 300,000 persons at any one time - who are you trying to kid that the Palestinians are prevented from leaving a targetted area, and have no place to run to avoid Israeli counter attacks ?</p>
              <p>Have I been dehumanised, or have you allowed yourself to be suckered by Hamas propaganda and allow yourself to think that everyone is numbed and dehumanised by the supposed atrocities - that are largely and purposefully self-inflicted ?</p>
              <p>If you recogonised the legitimate claim of Israel to retaliate against Hamas unprovoked and provocative acts of attacking Israel - why did you not also extend that understanding by questioning Hamas agenda of launching such attacks from densely populated Palestinian areas ?</p>
              <p>Why do you not question Hamas agenda in using their Palestinian civilians as Human Shield to cover their cowardly acts ?</p>
              <p>Did the Palestinian population in Gaza voted Hamas into power, or did the Hamas politician decide to take matters into their own hands and evicted from the Gaza Strip the legitimately elected PLA Government of President Abbas - and unilaterraly declare the Gaza Strip to be led by a Hamas Government ?</p>
              <p>Amazingly, no Middle-eastern country has recognised this Hamas Government except for Iran - who treat this Hamas Government as no more then a political pawn.</p>
              <p>If this is not another one of your acts of succumbing to propaganda ?</p>
              <p>You must be naive to expect Israel to give solace and comfort to Hamas and the Palestinians population that remained behind and give material and morale support to Hamas - when Hamas has declared their objective of destroying the State of Israel ?</p>
              <p>Is there any use for your seemingly moralistic statement in red - when you have already succumbed to Hamas propaganda ?</p>
              <p>It is plain stupidity to believe that Hamas or their Iranian backers will have any means to destroy Israel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the Malaysia-Singapore analogy flawed, when the intertwined history of these two countries over the last 40 odd years have led to the edge of a local conflict ?</p>
              <p>Prior to the recently concluded Pedra Branca issue, there were a few incidents which had resulted in Singapore Coast Guard and Navy vessels rubbing hulls with the Malaysian Navy and Police Patrol Boats.</p>
              <p>The war of words in the 1963 and 1969 had resulted in racial riots that spread across our state borders, and more recent events had even the previous PM Mahathir on different occassions to have been reported to be threatening to shut off the water pipes, bomb Singapore, and even to unilaterally cut off the Causeway to build a new link bridge on their side of the territories.</p>
              <p>All these acts would have constituted Acts of Wars - and the venom in the relationship had even permeated into the Malaysian Armed Forces, which even had a senior officer - in the rank of a Major - to contribute an article to one of their military journal that promoted the poisoning of our resevoirs as the opening gambit in any war.</p>
              <p>If you believe that the MAF and the SAF are equally matched, those who are more knowledgeable than you will probably excuse your ignorance, but will not forgive you - if you are a politician - for making any wrong gamble in any miscalculation due to your ignorance.</p>
              <p>It is just as well that you remain harmless in this Speaker's Corner and indulge in all your speculations based on propaganda and misinformation.</p>
              <p>Such misinformation will be similar to the sudden publicity given to the sudden discovery of oil and gas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that the Israelis do not have any earlier knowledge of this event and willingly give up the Sinai Peninsular and the Gaza Strip after a hard fought 6-Day War in the mid-1960s - when oil supply was cut off that resulted in the first ever oil crisis in the World ?</p>
              <p>If the Palestinians have no where to run in an Israeli attack, where do you expect the Palestinians in the tight Gaza space to move to when the oil and gas in the Gaza Strip will need to be exploited ?</p>

              550+ (and rising) Palestinian dead and 2800 wounded with a fraction
              of Israeli casualties. The article from the JP states 58
              Palestinians (I'm sure there were more buried under rubble) while
              40 rockets from Hamas didnt even kill even one Israeli. Sure, the
              Palestinians voted Hamas in. But what could you expect them to do
              when Israel is constantly making life hell for them? Do you expect
              them to continue to roll over and let Israel continue oppressing
              them?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>At the end of the day,
              this'll probably go on until either the Palestinians or Israeli are
              exterminated. The conflict has gone on too long to be
              tractable.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Using Singapore and Malaysia as an example is a flawed analogy.
              Malaysia is not occupying Singapore, nor restricting border access,
              nor controlling the flow of food, fuel or medical coming into
              Singapore. If we two fight, it'll be a WAR between two modern
              armies. Not a modern army against ragtag group of guerilla
              fighters. I'm sure I said something to this effect earlier on.</p>
              <p>And also, what about the dimension of Gaza's oil and natural gas
              reserves? With that new information, things change. It no longer
              belongs to the petty area of territorial concerns and religious
              pride, but geostrategy.</p>

              Googoomuck, 
              I take utmost offence at your pathetic accusation that I am twisting historical facts. The contribution of military aid and paramilitary support does not tantamount to a belligerent of a war. This is fact. You continue to publicise your blatant lack of knowledge and stupidity by continuing to reply to posts here.
              
              In what instances I changed any due course of history? There is no uniformed essence of history as I mentioned history is perceptive.
              
              Anyway, "Palestinian sources" mentioned the casualities were MOSTLY civilians? How do you define "Palestinian sources"? Do the U.N and humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza constitute Palestinian entities?  Numerous independent sources pointed out Israel's blatant acts of targeting civilian infrastructure of the unsubstantiated claims of Hamas operating from civilian buildings. The Zionist terrorists bombed U.N school as well which the U.N demands an investigation.
              
              The argument that this conflict could only end with the extermination of the Palestinians is horrific and reeks of Jewish extremism. One could also argue the extermination of the Jews as well. However, the discussions put across here should only revolve around the preservation of the sancity of human lives.
              
              Hamas has as much legitimate right to defend Gaza as much as Israel to defend its state. 
              
              So, in order to put this discussion in perspective, I advice you to refer your sources well. And extermination should specifically be reserved for extremists on both sides which includes elites from the Zionist movements. 
              
              Read your history well. If you need any pointers and interpretatation, googoomuck, you can always ask someone who has the right knowledge of the field you failed miserably in.

              <p>Jarhum,</p>
              <p><br>I am glad that you admitted yourself that 'there is no uniformed  essence of history and that history is perceptive', by your own words, in your reply to googomuck. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enough said. You admitted to twisting historical facts to suit your twisted arab propaganda. Thank you. At least others know where you stand.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do not under-estimate others who disagree with your propaganda as you continually do here, arab propagandist. You have freedom of speech here, regardless of whether you are a singaporean or a foriegner claiming to be singaporean, BuT do not abuse it. Then, its still your perogative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, 'Israeli sources' is not to be believed? And 'Palestinian sources' MUST be believed? Are you implying that? EVEN UN dare not confirm 100% that there were no militants in the said school, you dare, arab propagandist?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas has a 'right' to bomb innocent jews in Israel, as well as as to hide amongst civilian in civilian centres, putting innocent Gaza people in the line of fire as well? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is that what you are claiming?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you truly want to preserve life, you would have condemned Hamas actions, for it is an abomination to the Koran revered by Muslims around the world, including Arabs. But you prefer to use politically correct soft words such as 'overblown',etc, to propound further the arab propaganda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only by condemning them will sympathizers, funds and recruits be halted. They are destroying the religion anyway, and had used religion twisted to serve their interests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Hamas realizes they have no support, no more recruits and money to buy arms which should had been used to buy food for Gaza folks in the first place, they will quit armed struggle, and meet on the negotiation table without killing anyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no dearth of humanitarian aid in the meantime for Gaza when a truce rings out, or even when peace is achieved. They are humans still who would helped out, so long as their money is NOT use to kill others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If that is truly what they seek instead of violence and wiping out the human race, beginning with the jews and drawing everyone else into the conflict.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wars can only be financed. No money, no talk. Hot air from the mouth will kill no one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do remove your blinkers if you truly want to share a common ground, which is the preservation of lives right now in Gaza!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Using your sweet words here -  I too,  would unconditionally apologize in the event that my statements are wrongly interpreted by one of unintellectual capacity</p>
