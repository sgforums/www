            <div class='col-md body'>Aren't they just shooting themselves in the foot? Any student worth his salt would instantly see that this reflects badly on malaysian educational insitutes as a whole and would instead point out to him that Singapore has indeed earned it's reputation for people to jump on her name. So hence it would point any good student towards us.<br><br>As for students who fall for this cheap trick, well, they probably aren't worth having around our schools in the first place, and guess who gets them...
