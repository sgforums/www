              <p><em>SINGAPORE: Even after the millions spent on Baby Bonuses and other
              parenthood incentives, policy-makers are confounded by a problem that
              goes to the very heart of survival: Singaporeans are still not
              reproducing themselves.<br><br>And on Friday, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan
              Yew reflected on this challenge at the National University of Singapore
              Society's (NUSS) dialogue on "Singapore and Singaporeans: A Quarter
              Century From Now".<br><br>In Singapore, he said, it is becoming a
              "lifestyle choice" for women past the age of 30 to stay single as they
              are well-travelled and have no one to worry about.<br><br>"My daughter
              is one of them. What can I do? When she was in her early 30s, my wife
              used to tell her, what you want is a 'MRS'. She did not think it was
              funny.<br><br>"Now she is 50-plus, her mother is bedridden, I'm on a
              pacemaker, I got this rambling house. Everything is looked after now.
              What happens if we are both not there?...<br><br>"She says, 'I'll look
              after myself'. But we know she has not been looking after herself all
              these years. When she went to Boston for training, her cooking was to
              just to put her salmon into the microwave."<br><br>Mr Lee added: "But
              that's life. It's a choice that she has made, and a choice that 30 per
              cent of our women are making. Who am I to complain? Society lives with
              the consequences it is making."<br><br>The problem that this trend
              creates: "Without new citizens and permanent residents, we are going to
              be the last of the Mohicans. We are going to disappear".<br><br>But immigrants bring their own challenges to a society.<br><br>Some
              Singaporean parents have complained about migrants entering schools and
              competing with local children. He urged parents: "Would you want them
              to compete against you or with you as part of the team? If you don't
              have them with you as part of your team, they will be on the Chinese
              and Indian team."<br><br>Some of these migrant students, he
              acknowledged, use Singapore as a stepping stone to other countries. So
              "why are we so stupid" in allowing this?<br><br>"Because more than half (of these students) do not make the grade to go to America, and the second tier is not bad for us."<br><br>Singapore
              needs to draw from a big talent pool beyond its own shores, "so that we
              can continue to punch above our weight. No other way".<br><br>"Would
              you want the pie to grow? You want a small pie with your children
              taking the last portion, or a big pie where you get a bigger portion,
              even though the talented person may get a bigger slice? That's life. If
              you are afraid of talent, you will not succeed."<br><br>One catch he
              foresees: Even as the second generation of today's immigrants become
              more Singaporean, one dubious habit they might also adopt, is to have
              only one child.<br><br>"So we got to make this breakthrough, otherwise we are going to have a constant problem.<br><br>"We got to get people to realise that if we don't have 2.1 (babies) to replace ourselves, we are always dependent."<br><br>Earlier
              in the evening, Mr Lee officially opened the new NUS Alumni Complex,
              which comprises the redeveloped NUSS Kent Ridge Guild House and Shaw
              Foundation Alumni House. </em></p>

              <p>I think you have a point, there are more factors at work besides the stop at 2, like high costs of living, women working no time look after children, changes in mentality due to propaganda during stop at 2 etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Singapore's government saw rapid population
              growth as a threat to living standards and political stability, as
              large numbers of children and young people threatened to overwhelm the
              schools, the medical services, and the ability of the economy to
              generate employment for them all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the atmosphere of crisis after the
              1965 separation from Malaysia, the government in 1966 established the
              Family Planning and Population Board, which was responsible for
              providing clinical services and public education on family planning. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Birth rates fell from 1957 to 1970,
              but then began to rise as women of the postwar baby boom reached
              child-bearing years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The government responded with policies intended to
              further reduce the birth rate. Abortion and voluntary sterilization
              were legalized in 1970. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Between 1969 and 1972, a set of policies known
              as "population disincentives" were instituted to raise the costs of
              bearing third, fourth, and subsequent children. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Civil servants received
              no paid maternity leave for third and subsequent children;</strong></span> maternity
              hospitals charged progressively higher fees for each additional birth;
              and income tax deductions for all but the first two children were
              eliminated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Large families received no extra consideration in public
              housing assignments</strong></span>, and top priority in the competition for enrollment
              in the most desirable primary schools was given to only children and to
              children whose parents had been sterilized before the age of forty.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Voluntary sterilization was rewarded by seven days of paid sick leave
              and by priority in the allocation of such public goods as housing and
              education. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">The policies were <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>accompanied by publicity campaigns urging
              parents to "Stop at Two" and arguing that large families threatened
              parents' present livelihood and future security. </strong></span>The penalties weighed
              more heavily on the poor, and were justified by the authorities as a
              means of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>encouraging the poor to concentrate their limited resources on
              adequately nurturing a few children who would be equipped to rise from
              poverty and become productive citizens. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Fertility declined throughout the
              1970s, reaching the replacement level of 1.006 in 1975, and thereafter
              declining below that level. With fertility below the replacement level,
              the population would after some fifty years begin to decline unless
              supplemented by immigration. In a manner familiar to demographers,
              Singapore's demographic transition to low levels of population growth
              accompanied increases in income, education, women's participation in
              paid employment, and control of infectious diseases. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> impossible
              to separate the effects of government policies</strong></span> from the broader
              socioeconomic forces promoting later marriage and smaller families, but
              it was clear that in Singapore all the factors affecting population
              growth worked in the same direction. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The government's policies and
              publicity campaigns thus probably hastened or reinforced fertility
              trends that stemmed from changes in economic and educational
              structures. </strong></span>By the 1980s, Singapore's vital statistics resembled those
              of other countries with comparable income levels but without
              Singapore's publicity campaigns and elaborate array of administrative
              incentives. </span></p>

              <p>One thing Lee Kuan Yew is good at is to mess up society with his rubbish policies, for example biliangual policy program, stop at 2 program and don't know what other nonsense he can come up with.</p>
              <p>When it comes to these things, Lee Kuan Yew is good at it.</p>
              <p>I mean seriously speaking would you trust someone with below views to make social policies?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each in
              the same condition and needing a blood transfusion. The first, a
              Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later.
              The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few
              days later.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and
              survived. That is the X factor in development."</strong></span> - 27 December 1967</p>
              <p>"If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and
              leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society...<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So
              what happens? There will be less bright people to support dumb people
              in the next generation. That's a problem."</strong></span></span> -Lee Kuan Yew in 1983
              National Day Rally</p>
              <p>"The Bell curve is a fact of life. The blacks on average score 85 per
              cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The whites
              score on average 100. <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asians score more ... the Bell curve authors put
              it at least 10 points higher. These are realities that, if you do not
              accept, will lead to frustration because you will be spending money on
              wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow."</strong></span></span> - Lee Kuan Yew, The
              Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</p>
              <p>"I started off believing all men were equal. I now know that's the most
              unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have passed
              over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this earth,
              been isolated from each other, developed independently, had different
              intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I didn't start
              off with that knowledge. <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But by observation, reading, watching,
              arguing, asking, that is the conclusion I've come to.</strong></span></span>" - Lee Kuan Yew,

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ah Chia:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I think you have a point, there are more factors at work besides
              the stop at 2, like high costs of living, women working no time
              look after children, changes in mentality due to propaganda during
              stop at 2 etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Singapore's government saw
              rapid population growth as a threat to living standards and
              political stability, as large numbers of children and young people
              threatened to overwhelm the schools, the medical services, and the
              ability of the economy to generate employment for them
              all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the atmosphere of crisis
              after the 1965 separation from Malaysia, the government in 1966
              established the Family Planning and Population Board, which was
              responsible for providing clinical services and public education on
              family planning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Birth rates fell from 1957 to
              1970, but then began to rise as women of the postwar baby boom
              reached child-bearing years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The government responded with
              policies intended to further reduce the birth rate. Abortion and
              voluntary sterilization were legalized in
              1970.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Between 1969 and 1972, a set
              of policies known as "population disincentives" were instituted to
              raise the costs of bearing third, fourth, and subsequent children.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Civil servants
              received no paid maternity leave for third and subsequent
              children;</strong></span> maternity hospitals charged progressively
              higher fees for each additional birth; and income tax deductions
              for all but the first two children were eliminated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Large families received no
              extra consideration in public housing assignments</strong></span>,
              and top priority in the competition for enrollment in the most
              desirable primary schools was given to only children and to
              children whose parents had been sterilized before the age of forty.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Voluntary
              sterilization was rewarded by seven days of paid sick leave and by
              priority in the allocation of such public goods as housing and
              education.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The policies were <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>accompanied by publicity
              campaigns urging parents to "Stop at Two" and arguing that large
              families threatened parents' present livelihood and future
              security.</strong></span> The penalties weighed more heavily on the
              poor, and were justified by the authorities as a means of
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>encouraging the
              poor to concentrate their limited resources on adequately nurturing
              a few children who would be equipped to rise from poverty and
              become productive citizens.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fertility declined throughout
              the 1970s, reaching the replacement level of 1.006 in 1975, and
              thereafter declining below that level. With fertility below the
              replacement level, the population would after some fifty years
              begin to decline unless supplemented by immigration. In a manner
              familiar to demographers, Singapore's demographic transition to low
              levels of population growth accompanied increases in income,
              education, women's participation in paid employment, and control of
              infectious diseases.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>impossible to separate the
              effects of government policies</strong></span> from the broader
              socioeconomic forces promoting later marriage and smaller families,
              but it was clear that in Singapore all the factors affecting
              population growth worked in the same direction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The government's policies and
              publicity campaigns thus probably hastened or reinforced fertility
              trends that stemmed from changes in economic and educational
              structures.</strong></span> By the 1980s, Singapore's vital
              statistics resembled those of other countries with comparable
              income levels but without Singapore's publicity campaigns and
              elaborate array of administrative incentives.</span></p>

              <p>The merger was a failure, but the stop at two was actually needed then, when there were crap living standards. If every family had 5 or more children what would happen? Everyone trying to get free money. Family planning, needed when poor, abolished when Singapore became richer. China also somewhat in the same boat</p>

              <p>That's why people don't respect us and we are always laugh at. If you go oversea and people know that you are the one boasting NO.1 char kway tiao... people laugh in their heart not on their mouth.. might invite unwanted danger at times..iam not proud iam scared...</p>
              <p>Since we have the best char kway tiao... but we still need to buy oil and ingredient from laska stall and shop n save if they don't sell us the ingredient to fry kway tiao... because we talk so loud that we are NO. 1 fried kway tiao therefore we shouldn't buy ingredients from the stall or market. If you are the best, you should not rely on anyone. People do not like this let alone those who are lower and backdated in culture and social living.. If i ever go to Africa for diamonds.. i will flourish and throw a lot of sweets in an attempt to ask for diamonds.. with sincerity of course..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">iam</span></strong> an inexpensive goldfish... say $1 for 10 pieces..type. But my master kept me in luxurious efforts.. placing me in a 10'' round fish bowl feeding me the best food and all expensive neccesity wherby even the top quality breed goldfish don't enjoy.. THUS I MUST BE VERY PROUD INFRONT OF OTHER GOLDFISH AND EVEN LOOK-DOWN ON THOSE TOP QUALITY BREED... However, my maintainace is the most prized in the world.. my tank though small, is alway evolving with new water plants and decoration.. few years later my master shift and change some design added some more plants in it to make me look ''new'' my tank kept on changing environment.. but 1 thing doesn't change is the tank size.. also when new water is refill in the tank.. HAHA I FEEL IAM SWIMMING IN THE SEA... ONCE AGAIN PROUD..ut when water evaporates and i could hardly swim or breath around.. i feel like drying soon.. but upon drying iam beinf fed again.. i have live in a round fish tank for over 30 years.. i wonder how the sea look like also IS THE SEA SLIGHTLY BIGGER THAN MY TANK OR IS IT THE SAME?... Would i or shall i feel proud if i siwm with other top quality marine fish in the sea.. Though sea is salt water based habitat, i have lived in a little pool of freshwater for 30 years. even if it's takes me to change the habitat i think i should see the world. As my world for 30 years is just a 10'' fish tank with expensive expenditure.</p></div>

I ONLY GIVE BIRTH TO KINGS AND QUEENS NOT SLAVES. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993366;">WHY IS THERE A TREMENDOUS DROP IN BIRTH RATE, ALSO ON THE OTHER HAND A YEARN FOR BIRTH RATE INCREASE??? BUT NOTHING HAPPEN???</span></span></strong></p>

ALSO, THOUGH THEY LEARN BETTER MATHS AND SCIENCE , THEIR MORAL AND PERSONAL CULTIVATION OF BEING A RIGHTEOUS PERSON NEVER INCREASE OR DEVELOPE... I WONDER WHAT DID THEY LEARN IN SCHOOL... OR BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEGENERATED IN TERMS OF PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY THUS THEIR OFF-SPRING ARE PROVEN FURTILE MUNDANE SIMPLETON IN MY EYE.. I SCARE MY SON/DAUGHTER WOULD BECOME LIKE THIS... WHY NOWADAYS PEOPLE TALK A FEW WORDS AND JUMP BUILDING SO EASILY?? BECAUSE THEIR BRAIN PROGRAMMING IS WRONG AND WEAK. </span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will my off-spring be any of these say weaker breed in society when they are born?? being bullied and make use of....causing family tragedy?... or being a slave to serve others.. earning ton of money for the maste while the slave suffer in slienence and end up sorrowful memories..
