              <p>Woohoo!!!</p>
              <p>Let's blame someone else for our problems, the way mahatier always do. Put the blame on him, hang him and voila! the problem is immediately solved! Easy, isnt it?</p>
              <p>Sigh.. the sad fact is that each and everyone of us matured adults are responsible as a society. Together, each of us make up our society. Whether our society or nation fails or rises, that responsibility lies with us, something we cannot shirk from, if we care enough for the next generation to come.</p>
              <p>The matured you and I have a job to do, and that is to ensure our society dont fail, and to do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what is best</span> so that the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> majority</span> may survive, even if we ourselves dun. We have only one life, so make it worthwhile, if not for our society, at least for our families, relatives and friends.</p>

              <p>Alamak LKY still making the same old mistake.......Actually the solution is there but Govt does not have the political "Will"</p>
              <p>1) slow down the pace of Singaporean balance between pursue wealth vs pursue lifestyle choices.</p>
              <p>2) Change mind set for Singapore. we do not need to have BEST Port, BEST System.</p>
              <p>3) Singaporean need to develop ingenious way of doing thing Singapore way. we have no need to copied China or West.  </p>
              <p>4) slow down inflow of foreign immigration so for Singaporean to felt that they have their own "HOME" they can connect rather than loosing references.  </p>
              <p>5) Help Singaporean to reduce the burden of cost particularly housing. If you can't pay your own home you don't want to have baby.</p>
              <p>6) Reduce the stress level of our school system and stop changing System every few years. All the Young Children in Singapore simply goes thru "System of School" Are they learning anything other than system of TESTS?  </p>
              <p>7) Stop social engineering. Singaporean need to be felt that their life matters not being segragated like cattles.</p>
              <p>once life styles are balance you see Singaporean settledown and maintain population. We don;t need social engineering.</p>

              <p>I know some families left Singapore because they don't like the education system in Singapore, e.g. the second language policy. some families left because they can't tahan the stress, and some really don't like the government...but I have heard of any one who left so they can have more babies.</p>

              <p>He is targetting intellecture genes, in another words, to him, even birthrate is low, it is not a problem, but if the low birthrate can produce intelligent genes rather than those ah lian, ah beng or ahmad genes, it is still ok for singapore.</p>
