              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has reiterated the need for Singapore to attract more educated immigrants. <br><br>Speaking at the Indian New Year celebrations in Little India on Saturday, Mr Lee said Singaporeans must recognise that with a declining population, the country needs such people, including those who have studied or worked in the US and Europe. <br><br>With the economy in a buoyant mood after the government upgraded its growth forecast for the year, Mr Lee said Singapore needs to grow as an attractive hub for international trade, investment and talent to sustain long-term growth. <br><br>"We benefited from being open to immigrants from around the world, especially China, India and the region. Throughout history, Singapore has welcomed migrants. When I first took office, we had 62,000 babies every year from a population of 2 million. Today, Singapore citizens produce only 32,000 babies in a year when we should have 60,000 just to replace our population," said MM Lee. <br><br>Little India is a glowing example of how early immigrants have flourished and taken root in the country. <br><br>Mr Lee said the government understands the concerns of Singaporeans over new immigrants and foreign workers. So it has taken steps to moderate the inflow and widen the differentiation between citizens and non-citizens. <br><br>Having educated immigrants here, said Mr Lee, makes Singapore more competitive and dynamic. <br><br>"The majority of the new PRs and citizens are skilled workers and professionals in finance, IT and R&amp;D. They bring new skills, global connections and a strong drive to create better lives for their families," said Mr Lee. <br><br>Mr Lee gave an example of how one immigrant is making a difference. <br><br>"Shyam Srinivasan came from Chennai at age 14, and went to Geylang Methodist Secondary School and Victoria Junior College. He took up citizenship and obtained a teaching scholarship from the Public Service Commission," said the Minister Mentor. <br><br>"Last year, he graduated top of his class in Physics at Oxford University. He is now doing his Masters in Applied Physics at Columbia University. He will come back and complete his NS. He will educate and inspire the next generation of Singaporeans," he said. <br><br>Their presence has also helped to shape the Singapore landscape. <br><br>Mr Lee cited how many Indian temples today have been refurbished to look "elegant" and "colourful". <br><br>"Our immigration policies have brought in better educated and wealthy Indians who have made that qualitative difference to our lives. Their support of these temples has resulted in this transformation, reflecting the transformation that is taking place throughout Singapore," said Mr Lee. <br><br>Mr Lee said the challenge is to integrate newcomers into Singapore society and an event like this Indian New Year Celebration is a good example of how integration can be done. <br><br>The event brings together different communities, not just among the different Indian ethnic groups, but also Singaporeans of all races. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-large; font-family: Arial Black;">Drinking Cow Urine and Eating Cow Dung?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000; font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Cow Urine Sales Skyrocket in India!</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">By David J. Stewart</span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><img src="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/india_cow_in_the_road.jpg" border="0" alt="India cow in the road." width="337" height="256" align="right"></span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">       The Hindu <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vedas</span></a> say that the cow is holy and should be worshipped.  These Brahmins also claim that cow dung ash has medicinal value.  However, samples sent to a leading test laboratory in West Germany have purportedly proved this to be untrue.  Even today Hindus smear their homes with cow dung, expecting a special blessing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Hindus foolishly worship cows as gods... DRINKING COW URINE and EATING COW DUNG!  As an outgrowth of this, products made by cows also have an enormous history of usage in that country.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Cow products made from dung and urine (known as goratna) have seen an enormous boost in popularity lately.  You can get lotions, potions and pills, some of which are cure-alls that battle everything from constipation, to irregular periods, to hysteria, to cancer, and much more.  In addition to medicines, the goratna products range from cow dung toothpaste, to detergents, a skin-whitening cream, baldness and obesity cures, soap and a cow urine “antiseptic aftershave.”  How about "cow-dung toothpaste"?  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Of course, you’re not allowed to slaughter cows, but you are allowed to use the five following items, collectively known as "panchgavya": <strong>milk, curd, cheese, urine and dung. </strong> Panchgavya is used to make a popular drink in India, which is alleged to have healing properties.  No thanks, I'll pass.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Hindus in India smile with happiness as a large cow craps on the floor of their home.  They think this is a sure sign that their home has been blessed.  Hindu's in India smear cow dung across the entrance of their homes, and require anyone entering their home to step through the dung.  Needless to say, Hinduism is a bizarre, Satanic, and sicko religion.  Hindus are in desperate need of the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ.  If you are Hindu and this article offends you... SO BE IT!  I care about you and don't want you to burn in Hellfire.  I am telling you the truth.  Salvation is found ONLY through the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 4:10-12).  Acts 10:43 states, "<em>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins</em>."  There is NO other way to Heaven (John 14:6).  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">According to the <em>History Channel</em>, in a segment called <em>The History Of Dung</em>, they state that there are 250,000,000 cows in India, and each cow produces 16-tons (32,000 LBS.) of dung per year.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Tragically, in India people are dying of hunger.  Why are low caste poor Hindus prohibited from eating beef?  People stop their cars, and sit for hours waiting for a cow to clear the roadway, thinking it to be sacred.  In India cow meat is cheaper than other available meats.  Instead of these Brahmins taking care of the low caste peoples of India, they are doing their best to save their "holy" cows instead.  This is evil.  According to Valmith's Ramayana, God Rama "ATE" meat.  So then "why" have these Brahmins given up beef-eating?  It's hypocrisy within their own religion.  <br> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Drinking Cow Urine for Health?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Hinduism also teaches URINE DRINKING.  One Prime Minister, Morarji Desai (Brahmin), boasted that he was drinking eight ounces of his own urine daily (pure and fresh!) in the morning in accordance with the Vedas claim that urine has medicinal value.  With the same claim today the Brahmins are drinking cow's urine as if it is a DAILY TONIC.  No scientists have ever claimed that urine has any medicinal value.  On the contrary it is well known fact that urine is an unwanted organic substance that the human body needs to discharge.  This is practice is another unscientific nonsense of Hinduism.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="story2"><span style="color: #00ff00;">HINDU nationalists in India have launched a marketing exercise to promote cow’s urine as a health cure for ailments ranging from liver disease to obesity and even cancer.

              <p>NEW DELHI: Alongside life-size posters of Hindu nationalist leaders, Indian political activists can now buy lotions, potions and pills to cure anything from cancer to hysteria to piles – all made from cow urine or dung.  </p>
              <p>A new goratna (cow products) stall at the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) souvenir shop is rapidly outselling dry political tracts, badges, flags and saffron-and-green plastic wall clocks with the face of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.   </p>
              <p>“You won't believe how quickly some of the products sold out,” says Manoj Kumar, who runs the souvenir shop along with his brother, Sanjeev, at the BJP headquarters in a plush central New Delhi neighbourhood. “The constipation medicine is a hot seller.”  </p>
              <p>But the biggest seller is a “multi-utility pill” that claims to cure anything from diabetes to piles to “ladies' diseases”. A month's supply costs a little over US$1 (RM3.80).  </p>
              <p>Another cure-all is Sanjivani Ark, a liquid medicine that battles cancer, hysteria, and irregular periods, among other things.  </p>
              <p>In addition to medicines, the goratna products range from cow dung toothpaste, to detergents, a skin-whitening cream, baldness and obesity cures, soap and a cow urine “antiseptic aftershave”.  </p>
              <p>Siddarth Singh, a spokesman for BJP, which has long campaigned on the sanctity of the cow, said the stall aimed to promote village industry, one of the biggest employers in India.  </p>
              <p>"If you go back in the history of India, this belongs to our culture. There's no commercial value to us. Village industry in this country needs to be promoted". </p>
              <p>The use of cow products in India is centuries old. The five key products – butter, milk, curd, urine and dung –are collectively known as <em>panchgavya </em>and are an important part of Ayurvedic medicine. </p>
              <p>The cow is worshipped by Hindus, who make up some 82 per cent of India's over 1 billion people. Cow slaughter is banned in most parts of the country. </p>
              <p>The <em>goratna</em> products, made by a cooperative in the northern 'cow belt' state of Uttar Pradesh, are rapidly gaining in popularity. </p>
              <p>"Once they use it, they are coming back and they are bringing their friends and their family and their neighbours back with them", says Kumar. </p>
              <p>Singh already uses the detergent and is thinking of experimenting further. </p>
              <p>"I'm tempted to try something for the hair --- let's hope", he grins, running his fingers through his thinning crop. – Reuters </p>

              <p>An analogy about new immigrants to Singapore:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having a controlled stream of immigrants coming to live and work in Singapore is beneficial for the country - Just like drinking a small glass of red wine a day is good for blood circulation for the body.</p>

                  Corinthians 4:4 teaches that Satan is the god of this sinful
                  world.  Thus, it is not surprising when we see
                  demonically-inspired people doing bizarre, self-destructive, and
                  crazy things.  I saw a teenage boy this week on TV, who tried
                  to do a backward-summersault with his bicycle and wound up knocking
                  his front teeth out.  Blood was everywhere.  He was
                  laughing and went to do it again.  Idiot!</span></p>

              <p><span>NEW DELHI: Alongside life-size posters of Hindu
                  nationalist leaders, Indian political activists can now buy
                  lotions, potions and pills to cure anything from cancer to hysteria
                  to piles – all made from cow urine or dung. </span></p>
              <p>A new goratna (cow products) stall at the Bharatiya Janata
                  Party's (BJP) souvenir shop is rapidly outselling dry political
                  tracts, badges, flags and saffron-and-green plastic wall clocks
                  with the face of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
                   </p>
              <p>“You won't believe how quickly some of the products sold out,”
                  says Manoj Kumar, who runs the souvenir shop along with his
                  brother, Sanjeev, at the BJP headquarters in a plush central New
                  Delhi neighbourhood. “The constipation medicine is a hot
                  seller.” </p>
              <p>But the biggest seller is a “multi-utility pill” that claims to
                  cure anything from diabetes to piles to “ladies' diseases”. A
                  month's supply costs a little over US$1 (RM3.80). </p>
              <p>Another cure-all is Sanjivani Ark, a liquid medicine that
                  battles cancer, hysteria, and irregular periods, among other
                  things. </p>
              <p>In addition to medicines, the goratna products range from cow
                  dung toothpaste, to detergents, a skin-whitening cream, baldness
                  and obesity cures, soap and a cow urine “antiseptic
                  aftershave”. </p>
              <p>Siddarth Singh, a spokesman for BJP, which has long campaigned
                  on the sanctity of the cow, said the stall aimed to promote village
                  industry, one of the biggest employers in India. </p>
              <p>"If you go back in the history of India, this belongs to our
                  culture. There's no commercial value to us. Village industry in
                  this country needs to be promoted".</p>
              <p>The use of cow products in India is centuries old. The five key
                  products – butter, milk, curd, urine and dung –are collectively
                  known as <em>panchgavya</em> and are an important part of Ayurvedic
                  medicine.</p>
              <p>The cow is worshipped by Hindus, who make up some 82 per cent of
                  India's over 1 billion people. Cow slaughter is banned in most
                  parts of the country.</p>
              <p>The <em>goratna</em> products, made by a cooperative in the
                  northern 'cow belt' state of Uttar Pradesh, are rapidly gaining in
                  popularity.</p>
              <p>"Once they use it, they are coming back and they are bringing
                  their friends and their family and their neighbours back with
                  them", says Kumar.</p>
              <p>Singh already uses the detergent and is thinking of
                  experimenting further.</p>
              <p>"I'm tempted to try something for the hair --- let's hope", he
                  grins, running his fingers through his thinning crop. –

              <p>if Indians were to eat cows then expect all grain prices to skyrocket !!! the majority of grain in US goes into feeding cattle......................</p>
              <p>a cow can provide milk + yoghurt/cheese, help with farming, provide fertilizer, transportation of goods, etc etc.................a cow is worth much much more alive than dead...............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then why weren't Jesus in India then ? they have a much bigger population than Europe, eh ? surely God would be smart enough to know saving more people make more sense ?</p>

                  Indian IT workers. Once a contract is given to an Indian based
                  company, you can be sure the line and staff workers will all be
                  Indians. The thing is that they only employ, work and live with
