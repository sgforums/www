              <p><br>questions sir,</p>
              <p>First, is there an end of the day in Singapore??? many already operate at 24hrs services</p>
              <p>Second, be it 3 or 4 generations, if we dun do it now, when are we going to do it? Will the 3 or 4th generations know how we suffer now and make us a hero icon for them to follow? Just like we appreciated our forefather who came here and make our life better today. That is why, many Singapore Chinese pray to them.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, Do you view a talent who left his/her country as a loser who cannot face the reality of suffering in life for the glory of his/her motherland?</p>

              <p>Anyway, as the chinese said, good horse never go back eat the same grass, so those Singaporeans returned are poor or weak horse that cannot make it big in foreign land. Foreigners becoming PR or citizenship here is not their fault, it is the Sg Govt who attracted them, because most foreigners got nothing to loose, they cannot survive in their own countries and  the conditions, be it politics, health, environment, laws and human rights are a 100 times worst than Singapore. They dun mind even to die here, for the sake of a proper funeral than their own countries dirty and flirty place. To most of them, even as you said, being conned by singapore govt, they dun mind, because in their own country, they were conned till bones and sticks. At least here, the govt con on morale issue only, food aplenty, jobs aplenty and education aplenty.</p>
              <p>If you said I come from Swiss, Brit, German, Finland, Canada, States or France, I may feel conned and leave this country immediately, but if i come from Mynamar, poor town of China, rural areas of Indonesia, Philippine, thais and vietnam, Singapore is heaven to me, Just imagine i dun have to pay a single cents since young to offer to this country and yet i can enjoy the stability, harmony, good transportation, housing, education, nice parks, road, environment, health etc etc...even if you said Sg Govt is conning us, we are still very much happier to be here and enjoying it at the expense of the last generation Singaporean works.</p>

              <p>Talk abit, talk about Karma liao, u truly karma or not? anguish and scolding people is a bad karma ya.</p>
              <p>we have never submit to political status quo, just that we have no better option to choose from.</p>
              <p>As i said many time, dun blame the foreigners, Singaporeans like you or others choose the govt to implement policy such as open immigration for us, you endorsed them, you mandated them, you supported them. We are innocent, they come to our country, do a Singapore road shows, we sign up and here we are in singapore...enjoy the heaven, you got to pity us, we have been living in martial or unstable political laws with no proper jobs, poor condition, no proper medication and a very disturbing society, we expect Singaporeans to show graciousness in welcoming us, not scolding us when actually they should be asking themselves and knocking on the own head on why they choose such govt??? Your govt Road show in Shanghai, free party, free food, free balloon and a free show on singapore and its good lifestyle, and those who sign up with high school grade will guarantee PR status and accomodation, first 2 years tax free, once baby are born to be Singaporean, both parents will become singaporean citizens, pregnant women and hushands who think of moving to Singapore will get first hand on HDB houses with a small amount of downpayment, workfare agency of singapore will arrange jobs for all. etc etc</p>
