                   of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased

                   highest income bracket, to ensure that they do not pay a lower 
                  percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_5-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffett_Rule#cite_note-BBC-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> In October 2011, Senate leader <a title="Harry Reid" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reid">Harry Reid</a> (<a title="Democratic Party (United States)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29">D</a>–<a title="Nevada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada">Nev.</a>) proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on millionaires to pay for new stimulus provisions, but the change did not go through.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffett_Rule#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6</a></p>

              <p><br> I am as a foreigner always considered Singapore as country of
                                  common sense less affected by distructive leftist ideas of the
                                  modern Western World. And the extraodinary economic success would
                                  be the best protection from populist politians using  the idea
                                  of "taking away and divide" to manipulate and use the majority of
                                  weak, envious and unsuccessful.<br> <br> But even here the voice of anti-establishment (means
                                  anti-successful and pro-unsuccessful)  left-liberals becomes
                                  louder. For example, a user ChangeCanHappen writes:<br> <br> "<em>I'd partially agree with you. But while the normal
                                  distribution is pervasive when it comes to salary earning of a
                                  population, the standard deviation of the curve can be affected
                                  both positively or negatively depending on the government's style
                                  of governance.<br> <br> As it stands, I'm afraid the standard deviation is already too
                                  great for a country that is supposedly "first class", and may get
                                  even larger if something is not done to correct the
                                  situation.<br> <br> High standards of living should mean high standards for everyone,
                                  or at the very least, the majority of the population. Not just for
                                  a select few. Sometimes I ask myself: What new significant and
                                  beneficial developments have we seen, since 10 years ago in
                                  1998?</em>"<br> <br> This sententions come from the main idea of modern
                                  left-fundamentalist propaganda: <strong>successful clever and
                                  strong people owe unsuccessful dumb and weak</strong>, and the role
                                  of governmet is to take away from successful and devide between
                                  unsuccessful.<br> <br> In this world <strong>nobody owes nobody</strong> and any attempt
                                  of forcible redistribution of wealth will lead to socilaism and
                                  economic collapse. You, S-poreans, live your life in perfectly
                                  organised society and just don't realize how lucky you are to had
                                  as a ruler such a talented man. You bash your govenment for high
                                  electricity costs and forget that millions of people die from
                                  starvation, wars, lack of medical service all over the world. Look
                                  at Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Angola, Mozambique, Cuba,
                                  North Korea, Venezuela. This could have happen to your country, if
                                  there were no Lee!<br> <br> You will live, die and nobody will rememeber you after death, but
                                  <strong>Lee Quan Yew will be remembered  forever as a
                                  political genious</strong> of 20th century, as a visioner, who gave
                                  a new hope to the mankind, collapsing under distructive left
                                  ideology. And the first country to honor Lee will be PRC. It was
                                  Lee who tought Deng Xiaoping how to use all achievements of Western
                                  Society and bypass all traps. Lee's Singapore was an example of the
                                  way out for China.<br> <br> All these leftist anti-government invectives in the S-pore internet
                                  bashers just show how right is Mr. Lee Quan Yew in his restriction

              <p>Hi Tyler Tim,LKY was an honest socialist who nationalised villages and appropriated the vast farmlands of landlords for a pilthy amount so that HDB flats could be sold to Kampong dwellers at costs plus (land priced at almost free). His son however, believes in inflation targeting and selling public housing at bubble market prices minus a bogus subsidy. In years of salary terms, the price of public housing circa 1960 compared to today is a world of difference.</p>
              <p>Yes, praise the father for being a socialist in the true sense, earning a low pay but doing the most work.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, his son now is no chip of the old block, earning the highest pay in the world yet doing the least work to help the poor. Enjoy the nostalgia of the LKY era by all means, but do not be mistaken, many of today's PAP policies resemble bait and switch curse of communism: "some are more equal than others"- the PAP of today is on its way down...</p>
              <p>When once affordable public housing (hpusing 90% of popuoation) is no longer affordable to the public, can the government still deserve that much in terms of respect?</p>
