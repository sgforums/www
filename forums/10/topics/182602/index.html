            <div class='col-md body'>Clinical trials are absolutely necessary before drugs can be safely marketed. The disaster in this case is extremely rare and I cannot remember one as devastating as this one before and thousands of such trials have been done over the years.<br><br>This was a Phase I trial to test the pharmacokinetics (how the body metabolize the drug) and usually a smaller dose than usual would have been administered. It is performed on healthy individuals and in this case it was a 'first in human' trial.<br><br>It had previously been tested on rabbit and primate, I think....you need to test on at least 2 animals, one of which should be a rodent, before you can move it to human Phase I trials. The compnay said there were no problems before but investigations are ongoing.<br><br>Can they do that in Singapore? Yes and they are being done. Singapore has ambitions of being a regional clinical trial centre and I think there will be more of such trials to come.<br><br>I think this case highlights the inherent risk in all such trials. Although the consent form is supposed to require volunteers to understand the risks, I doubt if they were aware that the risks can be so devastating, albeit rare. The victims may be able to sue on the grounds that the information given was not sufficient and so the consent was not completely valid. It will be interesting to see how the court will rule but I have a feeling it will be settled out of court.<br><br>I hope Singapore will learn from this lesson and ensure sufficient insurance cover for all such trials. Volunteers should also know that there is a small risk that things can go horribly wrong and that includes death.<br><br>Animal testing will not be sufficient. Perhaps the lesson from this incident is that we might have to do MORE animal testing and start with even lower doses and slowly titrate upwards.<br><br></div>

Of course animals and humans have differences, don't say animal and humans, even humans can differ from one and another...
