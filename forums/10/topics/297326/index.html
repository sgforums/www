It also broke her pair of spectacles in two and bruised her face.<br><br>The police were later called in.<br><br>This incident took place yesterday morning as SBS Bus Service 65 was travelling along Bedok Reservoir Road.<br><br>The bus captain, Mr Thanabalan Subramaniam, 34, said that he was first alerted to the problem when he heard a woman shouting near the exit door of the bus.<br><br>According to some passengers, the incident was sparked by a middle-aged woman who was apparently using a spray on herself.<br><br>The spray affected a younger woman sitting in front of her and, when the latter confronted her, the older woman became upset.<br><br>She allegedly stuck out her leg to block the younger woman as she got up to alight.<br><br>A quarrel then erupted.<br><br>Mr Subramaniam said: 'I looked at the rearview mirror to see who it was.<br><br>'The next moment, I saw a middle-aged woman stand up from her seat and smash a plastic bag containing eggs against the head of a young woman who was standing at the exit.'<br><br>He described the aggressor as a plump woman who appeared to be in her 40s. The victim was a slim young woman in her 20s.<br><br>'The older woman swung her plastic bag and used it to hit the young woman at least two to three times,' he added.<br><br>The victim, he said, tried to block the blows with her arms, but to no avail.<br><br>Mr Subramanium stopped at the next bus-stop near Block 745 at Bedok Reservoir Road and rushed to the women to stop the fight.<br><br>It was 6.45am then.<br><br>'My first instinct was to check the young woman to see if she was injured. She was not bleeding, but she had egg running down the left side of her head and her T-shirt, and egg shells were stuck all over her,' he said.<br><br>'Her glasses were broken at the nose peg into two pieces. She had picked up one side, but couldn't find the other half.'<br><br>The attack left a trail of eggs near the exit, on the ceiling of the lower deck, the stairway and a window.<br><br>Mr Subramaniam said: 'I stepped between them and told them to stop fighting.'<br><br>But his words went unheeded as the women continued shouting at each other.<br><br>Mr Subramaniam said he did not understand their heated exchange as they spoke in Mandarin.<br><br>At one point, however, he heard the older woman shout in English: 'Why should I be scared, I'm Singaporean!'<br><br>Mr Subramaniam later found out that the younger woman was a Chinese national. She was with a female friend, who called the police on her handphone.<br><br>There were about 50 passengers on board, with about 20 on the lower deck, at the time.<br><br>Mr Subramaniam said: 'The other passengers were so shocked and frightened they quickly moved to the back and stood there.'<br><br>He had informed the control station by then and allowed the other passengers to alight and transfer to another bus.<br><br>The older woman then returned to her seat near the exit door.<br><br>FRIGHTENED<br><br>'She seemed to calm down when she realised the police were on their way. She even seemed frightened,' he recalled.<br><br>She had boarded the bus at Orchard Road and he had recognised her as he often saw her on his bus.<br><br>The younger woman, who was dressed in an orange T-shirt and jeans, continued to shout angrily at her assailant.<br><br>'The older woman suddenly apologised to the young woman. She said 'sorry' in English once,' Mr Subramaniam said.<br><br>But what she did next in an apparent attempt to appease the young woman backfired.<br><br>Mr Subramanium recounted: 'I saw her take out $10 from her wallet and offer it to the young woman who got even more upset.<br><br>'She shouted at her even more fiercely while the older woman just kept quiet.<br><br>'She then put the money back into her wallet.<br><br>'The young woman looked so angry that even her friend did not dare to stand near her. Instead, she stood beside me while waiting for the police to arrive.'<br><br>Mr Subramaniam said he was concerned about handling the situation when the attack occurred.<br><br>'I was worried about the other passengers. It was almost peak hour and people were rushing to go to school and to work. I'm glad nobody else got hurt,' he said.<br><br>'It wasn't funny at that time, but now when I think about it, it looked like a movie scene. I have never seen people in real life fighting with eggs.'<br><br>The police said they received a call around 6.50am informing them of a dispute between two women on a bus along Bedok Reservoir Road.<br><br>When they arrived, they advised the two women to keep the peace and they complied.<br><br>FIRST TIME<br><br>Ms Tammy Tan, director of corporate communications, SBS Transit, said that while there have been fights onboard SBS buses, this is the first time that eggs were used.<br><br>She added that such incidents inconvenience passengers by disrupting their trips. The bus also had to be taken off service to be cleaned.<br><br>She said: 'The eggs were thrown with such force that they splattered all over the ceiling, seats and floor. We have had to take the bus off service to clean it.<br><br>'We realise that people do crazy things when they are angry, but this one takes the cake.'<br><br></div>
