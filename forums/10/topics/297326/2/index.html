Are you prepared to accept $800 per month for 10 hours of work and one day off every fortnight?<br><br>'Of course, you have to multi-task - wash the dishes, clean toilets and fans, undertake delivery, etc, for the $800.<br><br>'Expect no medical or leave benefits.'<br><br>After deducting transport and food which do not come cheap, the poor retiree who used to earn $2,000 to $3,000 takes home a much-reduced income.<br><br>The employer can afford to be smug because if the older Singaporean does not want the job, he could always look to abundant younger China workers willing to do 12-hour shifts and more work, for less.<br><br>How is it that we are allowing cheap, unskilled foreign workers into Singapore so easily that they are depressing wages and making life hard for less-educated older Singaporeans?<br><br>What can we do in the face of such unfair odds, with all the cards stacked against us?<br><br>Ang Kwang Leng<br><br></div>

SOme do integrate into our society by buying HDB, working and marrying in Singapore.<br><br>You can complain about PRC snatching jobs etc but the fact is Singapore cannot grow without any foreigners immigrants. From the viewpoint of macropolicy, importing foreigners into the country help to balance the growth of economy and lure of talents.

            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents worth: PRCs are often seen as snobbish ppl becos of the way they speak. They give you the impression that they think they're better than you and stuffs. So I'm not suprised that this happened.</div>

No doubt, there are many who are ignorant and have this unjustified fear of foreigners. But hey, there's no smoke without fire you know..<br><br>Man is a social animal, and he or she does not live and breath in a statistical vacuum. If these bunch of nitwits in power do not buck up and reform their policies, I say vote them out.<br><br>Would you expect a raise after you've stuffed up at work? You'd be happy not to be censured..<br><br>But the opposite is true. We're all sick of paying through our nose for these fellows who are distant from the ground, and only pay lipservice because it is the only thing they know how to do, without stuffing up further.<br><br>Those chaps who think there's all smokebombs and fark all here, be my guest. If you've never walked the ground, there's hardly any room for any castle-building flimsy statements which does not portray a solid foundation for real policy alternatives, and mind you, actual policymaking does not mix itself with easy-peasy words of denigration.<br><br></div></blockquote>Countries that opened their doors to foreigners have their fair of problems getting new immigrants to integrate. For some, close-knit communities formed without the need to integrate into the mainstream population. That's a normal social behaviour.<br><br>It's also normal for us to feel uncomfortable with people who are different. They are PRCs, Bangladeshis and Indians. I probably don't truly understand their culture, thought process or appreciate their food. I prefer my wanton noodles instead of their China style noodles.<br><br>An Aussie showed his aggression at my lady friend who bumped into him. She was a total stranger to him as she was working in Australia about 1 year ago and she ended in hospital for a week. I have 2 friends who recently left to work and live with their families in Australia. They have reservations on the possible wraths or hospitality to be shown to them.<br><br>Some Singaporeans lose out when jobs are go to these foreigners.<br><br>What's important is whether our employment market is bigger because of these foreigners. By offering employers/investors a bigger pool of workers, they are prepared to build their plants and offices here.<br><br>We have diversity among Singaporeans. PRCs chose Singapore because we share a similar Chinese culture. They are part of us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the ugly behavior of a Singaporean woman becomes acceptable because the other party was from PRC, it explains why Singapore society never achieved the graciousness of any developed countries. To justify her behavior by blaming on the governmentÂ’s liberal immigration policy clearly demonstrated the lack of objectivity and sound logic, such people are far from being fair.<br><br>How well an immigrant integrates and assimilates into his host country demonstrates how mature and adaptable the immigrant is. In the same way, it is how well the host society accepts the many different immigrants that determine how mature is the society. Unfortunately this again clearly shows that there are elements in the Singaporean society who are unable to cope with the cultural differences that exists in all first world countries. Lucky we donÂ’t see many immigrants from eastern Europe, middle east, and Africa, or these Singaporean would freak to death. Demanding that the immigrants blend in before we accept them is arrogance out of fear.<br><br>I wonder what would be said if the younger lady was a Caucasian? Would we ask, Â“How well are the Caucasian integrating hereÂ”? The presence of American School, United World College, Australian School, French School clearly shows that the angmoh are not here to blend in. Do they then instill any fear in our society? Why are we fearful of the PRC and not the Caucasians? Of course, there are Singaporeans who are still afflicted by the Pinkerton Syndrome, and they would gladly be subjugated by the angmoh.<br><br>There is no need to fear the PRC, or any immigrants who are here to do jobs that we donÂ’t want to do. Any fear for their presence only reflects your inadequacy, but fear to the extent of misbehaving in the public, medical attention is required.<br></div>
