Integration will certainly help ease some tensions.<br><br>When PRCs is able to win jobs against other Singaporeans, it proves that they have partially succeeded in their integration process. They are able to communicate with our mainstream population, understands our cultural heritage and celebrate our festivities. Employers give them work because they can function productively and work with majority of fellow Singaporeans. Thus, I say PRCs have done quite well integrating into our community.<br><br></div>

But locals are not willing to take the job for $800 a month to work 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. If foreigners are willing to do the job for $600 a month, 10 hours a day, 7 days a week; your restaurant owners will employ foreigners. If you force restaurants to employ only locals, they will have to raise the cost of your meal so as not to see a drop in revenue. Cost of living will rise even faster and higher...but that is something maurizio cannot understand, not having the advantage of mathematics lessions in his schooldays.<br><br>If Singaporeans do not want foreigners taking low-skilled jobs from locals, they should frequent high class restaurants that will only hire locals who speak the Queen's English and a smuttering of French to beat. In the UK, consumers have boycotted banks that outsource jobs to India, opting for banks that charge more for services but use local staff. If you are prepared to pay more for local jobs to be retained, businesses will take the cue.<br><br>If you don't want foreigners to do the jobs locals can handle, put your money where your mouth is and ban all foreign domestic maids. If there are many elderly people collecting rubbish from trash bins as some moronic bleeding hearts allege, there will be a huge demand for low skilled workers to mind their children and vacuum the carpet. Convince any Opposition Party to take that line in the next election and see them booed off the stage.

But locals are not willing to take the job for $800 a month to work 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. If foreigners are willing to do the job for $600 a month, 10 hours a day, 7 days a week; your restaurant owners will employ foreigners. If you force restaurants to employ only locals, they will have to raise the cost of your meal so as not to see a drop in revenue. Cost of living will rise even faster and higher...but that is something maurizio cannot understand, not having the advantage of mathematics lessions in his schooldays.<br><br>If Singaporeans do not want foreigners taking low-skilled jobs from locals, they should frequent high class restaurants that will only hire locals who speak the Queen's English and a smuttering of French to beat. In the UK, consumers have boycotted banks that outsource jobs to India, opting for banks that charge more for services but use local staff. If you are prepared to pay more for local jobs to be retained, businesses will take the cue.<br><br>If you don't want foreigners to do the jobs locals can handle, put your money where your mouth is and ban all foreign domestic maids. If there are many elderly people collecting rubbish from trash bins as some moronic bleeding hearts allege, there will be a huge demand for low skilled workers to mind their children and vacuum the carpet. Convince any Opposition Party to take that line in the next election and see them booed off the stage. The fact is: Singaporeans want to have a young, strong, live-in servant to work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week without any days off or annual leave.<br><br>Typical hypocrites! Singaporean the employee rant about foreigners taking their jobs in this forum but Singaporean the employer will crucify any government who dares to remove their right to a dirt-cheap domestic servant doing a job locals can easily handle.<br><br>What a bunch of sanctimonious, double-dealing hypocrites!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>In that case, you should ask the government to kick out all the local Singaporeans, because none can compete with mainland Chinese. I don't think any Singaporeans can squeeze into a 3 bedroom apartment inhabited by 34 people. They are indeed more efficient, all the Singapoeans should be put on a boat and shipped to Africa. In which case, maybe our PM and cabinet ministers should move to China to govern them, it's far easier to move 82 people than 3 million.<br><br>Competing on a cheaper priced product where your competitor (China and India) is producing, even at a cheaper price than you can produce is an illogical way of competing. Think of the innovation of Ipod, mobile phones with multi functions, GPS, etc, these products entails innovation and are priced much higher than products which China and India are producing. It's sad that you as an educated person can only think of climbing down the ladder instead of up.<br><br>Your logic of depressing wages, seems only to have occured in Singapore. Nothing of sorts has happened in Australia. My friend who emigrated to Australia a decade ago told me that the hourly rate for a supermarket stacker was AUD 15, today it's higher than that.<br><br>Obviously we have supposed doctors arguing illogically without basic knowledge of economics. In economics, when the GDP of a country increases, so does the living standards of it's people. In Singapore, as our GDP per capita increase, our wage levels fall leading to lower standard of living. You can take into account the current salmonella poisoning in Prima Deli plant as a fall in the standard of living, which could be a result of employing too many mainland Chinese which has lower standards of hygiene. But why has the P4P government depressed our wages? Places like Australia and New Zealand have equivalent GDP per capita compared to Singapore. Why are their wages 3 times that of Singaporean workers?<br><br></div>

There r many dirty jobs like cleaning, recycling, construction and servant as well as slightly higher paid job like hairstylist, foot massager, operators, bus driver which we have to find other people to substitute in like foreigners. Can u find enough singaporean willing to be a servant tat work 24 hours a day 7 days a week ? We do not even have enough nurses, which is already a professional job.<br><br>A lot of people here say tat it is hard to find job here. Really ? Is tat really true ?
