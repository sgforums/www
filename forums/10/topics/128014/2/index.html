            <div class='col-md body'>Actually MM Lee also said the same thing about credibility at stake. He even said more and something very chilling He said that those ministers who feel very strongly against the casino should leave.</div>

He is talking about collective responsibility there. Once the cabinet has made its decision, it becomes the resposibility of all Ministers in the cabinet. No one in the cabinet should be able to turn around and say, "Hey, it wasn'y my idea. Its not my fault". If a minister disagrees strongly enough, he should resign.<br><br>This system is also in place in countries like the UK. For eg. Robin Cook and Claire Short resigned over the UK's government decision to go to war.<br><br>What i am uncomfortable with, however, is the fact that this old man is still intefering in government. In my opinion, He's outstayed his welcome.. Also, i don't like the terminology he uses. What Followers? I Hope he is not refering to the public. I am a citizen, not the government's follower.  Last i heard Mr Lee, YOU are on the public's payroll.</div>

That is, don't end up a split government, '...if you feel strongly enough, he may leave...'.<br><br>However, the public, once thrown into factions in a mega manner/fashion (that the Casino issue is not only opened online, ad big time in mainstream medias, events held big...), it is not really the leaders who'd offer confusion.<br><br>Casino itself as a topic is already a confusion unleashed. Outside the government, members of public from any factions/backgrounds and such can protest and support.<br><br>There is a basic political difference between personal disagreement/agreement and official role.<br><br>Just my 1ct view.</div>
