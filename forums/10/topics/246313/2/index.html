            <div class='col-md body'>There is a big difference between the need for F1 drivers to be aerobically fit and <strong>how</strong> they acquire that fitness. This is taken from the official formula one website:<br><br>"...<strong>The most dependable form of exercise for drivers is aerobic work - running, swimming and, increasingly, cycling</strong>, as epitomised by Red Bull driver Mark Webber....."<br><br>Yes, most F1 drivers are physically fit; but they do not get that fitness by racing. If you want to get fit, F1 motoring is not the way to go...you do it the way thousands of others do...running, swimming, cycling....<br><br>Second, no matter how much greener F1 race cars have become over the years (Honda, though not all other manufacturers, has launched a low-environmental impact model), the fact remains that this is a sport that sends powerful cars running round and round a circuit for no purpose apart from the pleasure of being the fastest.<br><br>Friends of the earth isn't impressed even with Honda, the greenest of them all:<br>"...Friends of the Earth's Emily Armistead wasn't convinced, telling The Guardian that "there is some irony in the fact that Honda are attempting to promote the environment and calling on others to address environmental issues when they are contributing to climate change by participating in what is probably <strong>the most polluting sport on the planet</strong>."<br>(http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s169/st112642.htm)<br><br>It is quite disingenuous to compare passengers on an aircraft who travels thousands of miles with a F1 driver who is back to where he started after consuming litres of fuel and emitting tons of CO2. The basic tenets of being environmentally friendly is to reduce, reuse and recycle. F1 racing is not a green activity.<br><br>Whether F1 racing will promote irresponsible driving is a point of debate and it is difficult to be certain either way. What is clear is that it is a glamourous sport and that always attract young people who would want to emulate their heroes. Not all will be able to afford to travel to Sempang every weekend to practise on proper race tracks and I expect there will be more illegal street races. Certainly in the UK there have been calls to ban programmes that highlight car racing:<br>(http://www.transport2000.org.uk/news/maintainNewsArticles.asp?NewsArticleID=239)<br><br>F1 racing can certainly earn millions for the economy, based on the Asian experience in Malaysia and Shanghai. The Singapore government is carefully considering the cost-benefit issues before allowing the event. That is a pragmatic and correct move.<br><br>As for having a dedicated race track, that is out of the question. In land scarce Singapore, that will be a white elephant and costs far too much. It also defeats the purpose of showing off the sights and lights of Singapore as a night race at the Esplanade will.<br></div>
