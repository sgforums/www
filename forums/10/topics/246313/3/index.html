            <div class='col-md body'>Formula 1 has also been around for a long time, since 1950.<br><br>The use of carbon fibre on cars was pioneered in Formula 1 in the 80s. The same goes for TC as a performance aid around the same time. Wishbones were also born in the series ages ago.<br><br>Aerodynamics "is a no-brainer"? Innovations like diffusers, undertrays, ground effects and venturi devices were also born in F1. Don't forget that these enhance the efficiency of those green cars.<br><br>I forgot to mention carbon-ceramic brakes as well.<br><br>You have muddled the trivia I gave about fuel consumption. In one season, all the 22 F1 cars use only less fuel than the 747 on take-off. Fuel-efficiency without the expense of power is in the interest of the teams. It allows them to make shorter pitstops for fuel.<br><br>Car manufacturers do enter F1 for marketing reasons, but they also have to back their claims that technology trickles down to road cars.<br><br>Anyway, nothing's stopping us from bidding to host Challenge Bibendum.

Take a little time out to soak in the atmosphere...if it happens.<br><br>This is something worth cheering, but instead there's no passion coming from these quarters. It's either apathy or cynicism. Maybe you can't help it, other things that happen on this island disappoint me too. But I have never seen attitudes like this from people I've met elsewhere who were going to host WRC and F1 events for the first time.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NuLife:</div><div class="quote_body">Honestly, I feel all these talks about F1 tech trickling down to commercial cars is BS.
