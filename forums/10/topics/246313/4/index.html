The vast loadings that Formula One cars are capable of creating, anything up to a sustained 3.5 g of cornering force, for example, means drivers have to be enormously strong to be able to last for full race distances. The extreme heat found in a Formula One c-o-c-kpit, especially at the hotter rounds of the championship, also puts vast strain on the body: Drivers can sweat off anything up to 3kg of their body weight during the course of a race.</span>"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The likelihood of having the race in Singapore takes a tumble upon safety concerns. This comment comes from a driver who knows what he is talking about. With the amount of floodlights needed to light up the streets and the amount of engineering needed to make the roads safe for such a race, the environmental costs and disruption will also be considerable. Perhaps it is just as well that we do not host the event...<br><br>SEPANG (Malaysia) - World champion Fernando Alonso spoke out on Saturday against plans for Formula One to race at night on city streets.<br><br>The McLaren driver was responding to a question on Singapore's bid to stage a Grand Prix under floodlights. A decision is expected after this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.<br><br>'I think for me, it is impossible,' the Spaniard told reporters after qualifying on the front row for Sunday's race at Sepang circuit. 'I think there is a huge safety issue racing in the streets.'<br><br>'We are trying to develop tracks to make it safer. We are changing corners in Barcelona for safety reasons and now we want to go to the streets. Something is going wrong there.' Alonso said he was surprised few people had addressed the technical issues concerned with having so many floodlights trying to mimic daylight.<br><br>'Racing at night requires a huge amount of light,' he said.<br><br>'No one has thought that something might happen if the lights go out. It is not a football match,' he added.<br><br>'I think there are many, many things to sort out before night racing becomes a reality.'<br><br>McLaren team boss Ron Dennis said he was keeping an open mind on the prospect of night racing but advised world governing body, the International Automobile Federation, against making the sport a testing ground.<br><br>'I would hope that any venue considering (night racing) would probably first host a GP2 race or some other race that brings out the validity of that concept,' said Dennis.<br><br>'I don't think it should go directly to Formula One. That would be irresponsible.' -- REUTERS<br><br>Straits Times, 7 Apr</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though i like F1 a lot, i think the idea of holding an F1 race here, right in the middle of the city centre, surrounded by high-rise buildings and cramped roads and wat have u not, is RIDICULOUS. The negative externalities far exceed the positive ones. Does gahment tink we hv a lot of land? Or dat its trying to make singhubpore a "monaco of the east"?<br><br>Some more they want to make it a night race. No surprise at this idea from the pple at the top, in the hope of making it the "world's first F1 night race".<br>For fcuk? For us? For tourists? More tourists =&gt;revenue rise=&gt;only the" few good men" of this empire richer . Majority of singhubporeans slog =&gt;no pay rise, no change in qualty of life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong>I trust you can read English but perhaps you need to brush up on your comprehension. I maintain that a champion F1 racer is no more likely to pass the IPPT than one who takes up jogging.<br><br>As the F1 website admits, a champion racer maintains his fitness [b]not</strong>by racing around the track but by 'aerobic work - running, swimming and, increasingly, cycling'. If Lim Ah Kow puts in the same amount of aerobic exercise as that F1 racer does outside of the racetrack, there is no reason why he should not do as well at the IPPT.<br><br>Yes, a champion F1 driver is physically fit, but he does not achieve his fitness by racing. He has to get fit in order to win at the race. Of all people, you should have been able to make that simple distinction.[/b]</blockquote>Seems to me like you're the one in need of comprehension lessons - you can't even comprehend what you have written yourself.<br><br>Owing to the environment in which F1 drivers work, the prerequisite level of fitness to be on the grid far exceeds that of passing the IPPT.  By definition, any F1 driver would be fit enough to pass the IPPT, regardless of his fitness regieme.<br><br>On the other hand, "one who takes up jogging" is another one of your characteristically vague references.  Yes, Said Aouita, Roger Bannister and Steve Moneghetti all took up jogging, but so did Lim Ah Kow.  Just because you are "one who takes up jogging" doesn't necessarily mean that you can win the Boston Marathon, run the four-minute mile nor pass the IPPT.<br><br>Now do please learn to read and write properly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, back to the topic.<br><br>The financial viability of holding an F1 race in Singapore is not a given thing - it's up to the powers-that-be to manage it properly and make some money out of it.<br><br>Would I want an F1 race in Singapore if I was living there?  Probably.  You still see a lot more of what's going on by watching it on your telly, but petrolheads would love the experience of being trackside.<br><br>The real problem I have with all of this is the night racing idea.  For all of these years, Bernie and his flunkies have been pushing the line about making F1 an international sport.  That's well and good, but suddenly he's come up with this boneheaded idea of night races so that the viewers in Europe won't have to be inconvenienced?  International sport my arse - that's the most Eurocentric idea this evil Andy Warhol has come up with yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
