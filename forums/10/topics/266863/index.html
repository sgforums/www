However, the difference is he is rich and powerful and most of us are not. Making uncomfortable remarks to other people's nation is insensitive. The malaysian media took this opportiunity to translate MM Lee's word into something vicious. (Topple* a government)<br><br>If Singapore do become a wasteland, being rich and powerful, he can just leave when and where he would like. what about common people?<br><br>I remember there was a news reporting the Singaporean foreign minister that commented on taiwan&amp;China relationship(Forgotten the details) also caused similar issues. Taiwan minister immediately called sg a small country who talks big.(Correct me if I am wrong cos I forgotten the whole details).<br><br>Now we have a treaty pact with Indonesia that is going the wrong way.<br><br>It appears Indonesia do not welcome Singaporeans in Training in their country.<br><br>All those foreign relationships with other countries have all resulted in serious sensitive issues.<br><br>Yes I do agree with MM Lee that small country like us have a say in international issues.<br><br>Are we going too far to make that claim at the expense of Singapore's foreign relationship with the rest of the world?<br><br>Why do we pay ministers such a high salary so they can say what they want without thinking of the impact it would have caused to normal Singaporeans like you and me?<br><br>I apologise if my opinion above had been wrong(Do correct me if I am wrong).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Ionlytalknoaction<br><br>sorry, i don't quite understand what you trying to say but if it is regarding IDR then a malaysian has this to say:<br><br>Iskandar<br>Should Singapore invest?<br>Truth is Malaysia is not ready to deal with Singapore in a purely business-like manner, says Dr. Syed Alwi.<br>Jul 4, 2007<br><br>Singapore should not invest in the IDR<br>Over the past month or two, there have been many comments regarding the IDR and Singapore's participation in it.<br><br>Apparently the Malaysian Malay grassroots is very much against the idea of Singapore's participation in the IDR. Why so?<br><br>(MM Lee had said that Malaysians were not keen on Singapore investing in the Iskandar Development Region (IDR), and Singaporean investors shouldnÂ’t expect any special consideration there).<br><br>The problem here lies in economic and ethnic insecurities. Singapore (read Chinese) is seen as attempting to take control over the Malaysian (read Malay) economy.<br><br>And that's where trouble begins.<br><br>Had it been the Japanese - then nothing would have happened - no reaction. But Singapore ...aahh - thats different! Strange isn't it?<br><br>What is more strange is that Malaysia needs the FDI (foreign direct investments).<br><br>Indeed several Malaysian mega-projects have already failed because of the lack of foreign investments like the MSC, Cyberjaya, Port Klang FTZ etc...<br><br>One reason they have failed is because of the lack of skilled workers and the Malaysian NEP plus Bumiputera Quota rules. Malaysia has difficulty attracting foreign skilled workers because of this.<br><br>For Singapore to invest in Malaysia is to invite the racial issue once again. The Chinese controlling the Malay economy. It never ends. As if the Japanese and the other foreigners are not taking over the Maslaysian economy!<br><br>The way I see it - its better for all parties concerned that Singapore do NOT invest in Malaysia.<br><br>The truth is that Malaysia is not yet ready to deal with Singapore in a purely business-like manner.<br><br>The emotions and memories run too deep. Singapore's foray into the Malaysian market will only invite the perennial charge of "racial issue"!<br><br>When will Malaysia get over the issues of race and religion - I do not know. But I know one thing for sure - the world will NOT wait for Malaysia. There is Vietnam, India, China, Russia, Brazil and so on - all competing for foreign investments. Singapore will not miss out much if she does not invest in Malaysia.<br>Regards,<br>Dr Syed Alwi</div>
