              <p>Safe to say, you don't really "Own" your hdb flat when you buy it.  Its more like a long term interest free rent when you pay it off. </p>
              <p>Flip side of the coin, our HDB loans won't ever go sub-prime cos their values are "managed". I doubt the construction cost of HDB flats cost that much, but if you think of it as a "rental", its not THAT bad.  Sell off still got a decent value. </p>
              <p>I'm not too sure of the above, but someone correct me if I missed the mark from what I've observed. </p>
