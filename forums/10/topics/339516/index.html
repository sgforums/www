              <p>Yeah, and the argument is that Muslims are free to convert people, anti-christian literature can be spread (the Da Vinci code, jesus christ superstar, stuff blasphemous and derogatory to christianity), but once you dare touch the holy faith of the prophet (a warrior), chances are not only you will be hunted down like a god (depending where you are), but the Law will prosecute you in a blatant act of double-standards.</p>

              <p>that's the problem, u get agitated and cannot control yourself, u start to retaliate on people who disturb you, and the trouble start to boil over. So, be cool, u can just walk away, smile or seek clarification in a polite manner, u dun have to bother about other disturbing you when nothing concern u or when there is no interest for you. At time, silence is Golden.</p>

              In Singapore, muslim missionaries do not engage in active proselytizing  of non-muslims. There is a muslim converts association which has an open door policy and there are members of the jamaat tabligh who conduct outreach programs to fellow muslims and encourage them to be more observant. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) is a government body and as such muslim activities in Singapore are very much in line with the policies of the Singapore Government. Unlicensed preachers are not allowed to practise in Singapore mosques and the ISD keeps a close tab on foreign and unlicensed preachers. In general, the majority of Singaporean muslims perceive their interests to be in line with that of the majority of Singapore society. Where there are points of friction, a consultative body is usually set up to address the issue with input from the Islamic scholars from MUIS. Madrasahs in Singapore work hand in hand with the MOE in curiculum development in order to produce scholars who are in tune with the Islamic and National development agenda.
              
              Don't rock the fucking boat assholes.

              <p>Wow, you can say that but when your kind FEELS agitated, the last thing they are, is being open-minded and willing to be "educated". Instead you people have to destroy other peoples' lives because they so-called "offended" you. How civilised is that?</p>
