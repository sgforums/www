              <p>In Singapore, muslim missionaries do not engage in active proselytizing of non-muslims. There is a muslim converts association which has an open door policy and there are members of the jamaat tabligh who conduct outreach programs to fellow muslims and encourage them to be more observant. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) is a government body and as such muslim activities in Singapore are very much in line with the policies of the Singapore Government. Unlicensed preachers are not allowed to practise in Singapore mosques and the <span>ISD</span> keeps a close tab on foreign and unlicensed preachers. In general, the majority of Singaporean muslims perceive their interests to be in line with that of the majority of Singapore society. Where there are points of friction, a consultative body is usually set up to address the issue with input from the Islamic scholars from <span>MUIS</span>. Madrasahs in Singapore work hand in hand with the <span>MOE</span> in curiculum development in order to produce scholars who are in tune with the Islamic and National development agenda.</p>

              <p><br>FIrst of all, thank you for that information. I am sure many who had not kept abreast of events would be gladden to know that efforts to promote religious harmony here is Singapore is working well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the fear is not of our fellow singapore citizens of muslim faith, whom we have the utmost trust, of fundamentalist Islam - using words from koran to govern society or the family unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is those outside Singapore and their return to fundamentalism and its effect that will have on our shores that may prove worrisome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will it affect the overall community, and gain sympathy for their actions, afterall, they use the words from a similar deity which no mortal man may defy and  yet claim faithfulness to its edicts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not representatives be sent to the international communities, on what we had achieved, to around the world to clear misinterpretations of the holy book, and the unnecessary need to revert to fundamentalism to achieve spiritual growth, in both rich and poor or undeveloped areas?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And lastly, do spare us your angst. Calling others derisively who simply seek understanding is an open invitation to promote hate and clouded judgement responses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's all calm down, withdraw all accusations, people from all sides,  and rationally work towards a solution, with patience and fore-sightedness, shall we? If not for ourselves, at least for the sake of the next generations? </p>

              <p>Right, its law. I'm not disputing that. I'm also not going to argue about Muslim beliefs (whether its the 72 virgins myth or not). <strong>If you mean "grow up" to learn that pieces of papers are more important than human lives, then I prefer to stay a 'child' (or so you imply). </strong>It simple makes one no better than LKY using libel suits to silence opposition. The sentence "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion" is thrown around so much, yet never practiced much. Now lets not base this on the LKY context when political power is at stake. In this context, when a Muslim sues a couple (incurring tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees as well as stress, ruining their lives), it is because he feels offended by Jack Chick's (who heads that publication) opinion. <strong>If its just that, an opinion, and if that Muslim really feels that his religion is the one true religion, what impact does that piece of paper make?</strong></p>
              <p>Christian KKK? Christianity 101: Love thy neighbour as thyself. If I dont expect people to sue me over a piece of paper, I dont do it to other people. If I expect people not to riot over some pictures I draw, I dont do it myself. Hitler professed to be christian, yet gassed 6 million jews. Do you think he was really christian? Anyway, Hitler and the KKK are in the same boat. Both professing to be the master race. An ideology that stems from darwinism and has roots in the occult. After all, the full title to the Origin of Species is "The Preservation of <em><strong>favoured races</strong></em> in the struggle for life". Dont try to lump them under christianity.</p>
              <p>I understand Muslims in SG are <em>educated and open-minded. </em>So I assume you disapprove of the violent reaction to Van Gogh's <em>Submission </em>(do you deny the portrayal of women in there?) or to the danish cartoons? Well, in SG's context, the fundamental reaction is still the same. Someone criticised us, they will pay. Am I not right?</p>
              <p>Why does Islam come under fire? Well, its not simply a religion. Its an entire way of life (based on 7th Century Arabia). Do you deny that? And of course, some fundamentalist practices have been abandoned to be practical in modern society, but not all. If its simply a <strong>personal</strong> thing, a matter of <strong>personal </strong>faith, then it wouldnt pose a problem. Why do people associate Muslim with Malay in SG? Can you respond to this?</p>

              <p>Ok. Christianity isn't terrorism. Telling people they believe in devils isn't really an act that causes knee jerk reactions. Educating other people's child to tell their parents that they are worshipping devils is acceptable.</p>
              <p>Ya. Ya. Ok. That is not wrong. I have many people telling me my father is a devil worshipper. No I am not a Muslim. I don't read the Koran and I don't really need so many morons telling me my dad is doing evil things.</p>
              <p>Maybe I should stab my father with a big bad knife and let the old man die so that there is one less devil worshipper.</p>
              <p>BTW I haven't got any Muslim or friends into Islam telling me my dad is a devil worshipper.</p>
              <p>Hmmm...</p>

              <p>My point is that Islam is an entire way of life, not simply a personal affair. For most Muslims, leaving the faith and becoming an "infidel" could result in being disowned or even killed (in places like Saudi Arabia). Same thing with Sharia, its a religious-political-social system.</p>

              <p>Well, if it is propaganda distributed to sources that may inevidently affect lives deeply then we have to make appropriate measures to restrain these actions.</p>
              <p>However, justice meted out in the form of punishment is no justice just because an action is wrong. No form of punishment is adequate or appropriate regardless of the effectiveness a punishment is.</p>
              <p>Thus, it is outrageous to contemplate punishments against actions since we are of the conscious mind to decide in our lives the rights and the wrongs.</p>
              <p>It is only appropriate when we refrain, restrain and educate but such measures are only taken when the other party is of agreeing terms to be taught about acceptable behavior.</p>
              <p><br>There is no way to limit damage or substantiate punishments. It is just a method to bully judgement onto another bully.</p>
              <p>Inflicting one's sense of justice and causing damage doesn't make you a better person. It only reflects the level of acceptance you are capable of.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as I always put it, the judge of a man is the man himself. You decide your actions.</p>

              <p>Well, if it is propaganda distributed to sources that may inevidently affect lives deeply then we have to make appropriate measures to restrain these actions.</p>
              <p>However, justice meted out in the form of punishment is no justice just because an action is wrong. No form of punishment is adequate or appropriate regardless of the effectiveness a punishment is.</p>
              <p>Thus, it is outrageous to contemplate punishments against actions since we are of the conscious mind to decide in our lives the rights and the wrongs.</p>
              <p>It is only appropriate when we refrain, restrain and educate but such measures are only taken when the other party is of agreeing terms to be taught about acceptable behavior.</p>
              <p><br>There is no way to limit damage or substantiate punishments. It is just a method to bully judgement onto another bully.</p>
              <p>Inflicting one's sense of justice and causing damage doesn't make you a better person. It only reflects the level of acceptance you are capable of.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as I always put it, the judge of a man is the man himself. You decide your actions.</p>

              <p>So how would that tract "affect lives deeply"? To the man that received it, would it cause him to question his faith, maybe renouncing it and starting a new chapter with another religion? If he couldnt sue the couple, would he have gone on a rampage together with like-minded people?</p>
              <p>Anyway, just to clarify. I assume your use of "propaganda" refers to an organised effort to promote a particular belief. Its technical. These days, "propaganda" refers to lies and deceit even if its subsconscious.</p>
              <p>Has that couple demonstrated any malice? Malice that would make any apologies impotent?</p>

              <p>Really? Adults are accountable for their words? Who is holding
              Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfield and Gonzales for lying about WMDs,
              9/11 and torture? I guess the truth doesnt matter here. What
              matters is who has the gun. Or in this case, who has the ability to
              run amock and unleash chaos.</p>
              <p>I dont know what you mean. My response was meant to show that
              the KKK aren't christian, in the true sense of the word.</p>
              <p>So I want to learn about Islam from a proper source. How does
              Saudi Arabia sound? Being the birthplace of Islam.</p>
              <p>My point is that Islam is an entire way of life, not simply a
              personal affair. For most Muslims, leaving the faith and
              becoming an "infidel" could result in being disowned or even killed
              (in places like Saudi Arabia). Same thing with Sharia, its a
              religious-political-social system.</p>

              <p>Depending on the individual recipient of the objective article and their thoughts during the receiving end, the question which imposes itself is how offensive is the article. I can't possibly anticipate any outcomes.</p>
              <p>I won't comment on malice, as I am not on the receiving party of the offense. However, I am of the idea that they do not attempt to show any degree of apologies in defence since they should know what they are distributing (at least their professions speaks volumes)</p>
              <p>Like I said, live and let live.</p>
              <p>There is no reason to highlight the incident exponentially. It will only bring unnecessary attention and incite more stronger sentiments against each other.</p>
              <p>I am of the same idea with the threadstarter to let the information be left out of jurisdication. There will always be people who will perpetuate the incident and use it for their benefits.</p>
              <p>I believe you are sharp enough to see that.</p>

              <p>A kafir is an enemy of Allah because he commits a sin of denying Mohammad is the messanger of Allah.</p>

              <p>The mention of kafirs in hadiths is negative and full of hate.</p>
