              <p>FC, cut that confrontationist stand please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you know that i can just walk up a bookstore, purchase a Koran and then go to the police and lodge a sedition report?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inside contains passages after passages of accusation that I, a non-believer, is an infidel, and calling for my and others' destruction. Isn't it seditious enough? More so when Fundamentalism - going by the hoy book - an 'in' thing now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only reason i don't do such thing is not because of authoritative laws, but because i grew up in Singapore amongst muslims, had them as friends and even collegues, and they had shown no inclination of following such doctrines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I trust them explicity, and accept their condemnation of terrorists attacks in good faith. These muslims are my people - Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We here should be glad a muslim is taking part in this discussion, equally on a non-confrontational basis, to challenge held assumptions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These moderates are intelligent people, of javanese heritage and not from the arabian penninsula. They too know it would be strange to revert back to fundamentalism, back to the deserts where Islam was born.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are no longer living in the desert under imperialism of despotic and cruel Roman governors, but in a era and scientific evolutionary change, and would need to stay relevant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After 911. muslims had acknowledged that there was 'misinterpretations' in their holy book by even arab moslems. This is a common ground of which we can all accept and agree upon, and work upon it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only thing was, it seem this 'misinterpretations' were NOT corrected, for innocents still continued to die hearing screams of a deity being proclaim great. It seem instead of progressing forward, the Islamic faith had regress, back to fundamentalism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that it had occured yet again, this time, lets hold the muslim to their acknowledgement. Let us hear from the moderates, in fairness, from both sides, what misconceptions they had with non-muslims.  what are their difficulties they faced, what kind of support they need - funds or volunteers to reach out to undevelope nations and the poor uneducated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moderates are our only hope. Lets us for once effect real change through dialogue, and not hide behind so called 'taboos' and leave it for the next generation to sort out the mess that we are responsible for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's be open and rational, instead of confrontational, to find solutions so that more innocents need not die</p>

Many people think it means non-muslims but it actually means ENEMY OF ISLAM i.e. people who are going out killing Islam and muslims... 2.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The funny thing is that athough stoning has a long history in a number of different traditions (including Jewish and Greek histories) the practice has since grown to be associated with Islam and Muslim cultures. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, there is no mention of stoning in the Quran, and the practice is only implied in the Hadith in the context of the Prophet Muhammad’s dealings with Jewish Law. </span></p>

              <p>for the record, i m Christian but i personally feel that what these two chrisitans have done is overboard. Yes, evangelicalizing is always a good thing, but unsolicited evangelicalizing is against the law.</p>
              <p>If someone expresses interest / is willing to listen to what you have to say about Jesus, then its alright to prostelyize to them.</p>
              <p>If someone is not interested/dosent show interest, please respect the person's privacy and right to self-determination.</p>
              <p>therein lies the crux of the issue. By sending evangelical "spam", no one is interested. to charge them with sedition, that is really a matter of interpretation. dont think we should go there.</p>
              <p>i bet we'd see a media blackout of this case. race and religion very touchy topics still today. cant have an open constructive discussion.</p>

              <p>Ok. Christianity isn't terrorism. Telling people they believe in
              devils isn't really an act that causes knee jerk reactions.
              Educating other people's child to tell their parents that they are
              worshipping devils is acceptable.</p>
              <p>Ya. Ya. Ok. That is not wrong. I have many people telling me my
              father is a devil worshipper. No I am not a Muslim. I don't read
              the Koran and I don't really need so many morons telling me my dad
              is doing evil things.</p>
              <p>Maybe I should stab my father with a big bad knife and let the
              old man die so that there is one less devil worshipper.</p>

              <p>FC, cut that confrontationist stand please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you know that i can just walk up a bookstore, purchase a
              Koran and then go to the police and lodge a sedition report?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inside contains passages after passages of accusation that I, a
              non-believer, is an infidel, and calling for my and others'
              destruction. Isn't it seditious enough? More so when Fundamentalism
              - going by the hoy book - an 'in' thing now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only reason i don't do such thing is not because of
              authoritative laws, but because i grew up in Singapore amongst
              muslims, had them as friends and even collegues, and they had shown
              no inclination of following such doctrines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I trust them explicity, and accept their condemnation of
              terrorists attacks in good faith. These muslims are my people -
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We here should be glad a muslim is taking part in this
              discussion, equally on a non-confrontational basis, to challenge
              held assumptions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These moderates are intelligent people, of javanese heritage and
              not from the arabian penninsula. They too know it would be strange
              to revert back to fundamentalism, back to the deserts where Islam
              was born.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are no longer living in the desert under imperialism of
              despotic and cruel Roman governors, but in a era and scientific
              evolutionary change, and would need to stay relevant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After 911. muslims had acknowledged that there was
              'misinterpretations' in their holy book by even arab moslems. This
              is a common ground of which we can all accept and agree upon, and
              work upon it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only thing was, it seem this 'misinterpretations' were NOT
              corrected, for innocents still continued to die hearing screams of
              a deity being proclaim great. It seem instead of progressing
              forward, the Islamic faith had regress, back to fundamentalism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that it had occured yet again, this time, lets hold the
              muslim to their acknowledgement. Let us hear from the moderates, in
              fairness, from both sides, what misconceptions they had with
              non-muslims.  what are their difficulties they faced, what
              kind of support they need - funds or volunteers to reach out to
              undevelope nations and the poor uneducated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moderates are our only hope. Lets us for once effect real
              change through dialogue, and not hide behind so called 'taboos' and
              leave it for the next generation to sort out the mess that we are

              <p>thats what we really need here.</p>
              <p>for the record, i m Christian but i personally feel that what
                  these two chrisitans have done is overboard. Yes, evangelicalizing
                  is always a good thing, but unsolicited evangelicalizing is against
                  the law.</p>
              <p>If someone expresses interest / is willing to listen to what you
                  have to say about Jesus, then its alright to prostelyize to
                  them.</p>
              <p>If someone is not interested/dosent show interest, please
                  respect the person's privacy and right to self-determination.</p>
              <p>therein lies the crux of the issue. By sending evangelical
                  "spam", no one is interested. to charge them with sedition, that is
                  really a matter of interpretation. dont think we should go
                  there.</p>
              <p>i bet we'd see a media blackout of this case. race and religion
                  very touchy topics still today. cant have an open constructive

              <p>Heck, as a Christian, I view persistent evangelism as somewhat irritating. It's like spam.I'm of the belief that if you want to convert someone, just live your life as an example to God and religion.</p>

              <p>Anyway, believing is a strong emotion, people can hardly change one believe. And believers are protective of what they believed, that is understandable. Just respect each others believes and we shall be harmony. Here in Singapore, we have been enjoying this harmony due to our respect of each other opinons and believes. Let us enjoy more years to come, for God may gives us free wills to roam this world, and if u are a believer, u should know that God also created hell for those who misused the free wills.</p>

              <p>@MohammadF: Sure we can look at Islam and not at Muslims. But aren't Muslims supposed to be an example for Islam? If not, what is the point of being a Muslim if you cannot even uphold the tenets of Islam? I'm curious, does Islam command Muslims to hound (and screw up the lifes of) those who challenges Islamic authority, or does it advocate a "live and let live" mentality?</p>

              <p>Who was forcing anyone to convert? Did the couple take a whip to that Muslim and force him to believe what they stated, showing their presumed superiority?</p>

              <p>If Muslims distribute anti-Christian tracts, I'm sure there wont be any riots or flag burnings. Do you believe everything you read about? Are you forced to or do you have a choice?</p>
              <p>Making a big fuss over this shows the arrogance of that Muslim, that no one has the right to show him anything that makes him uncomfortable. And just because he <em>feels</em> "offended", he messes up the life of that couple. Is that arrogance or humility?</p>

              <p>Re-quote from my essay</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span><span>Side tracking a bit, I’m
                                      here to answer a certain someone on why must make this into a court
                                      battle? If someone is spreading lies, just let them be coz its up
                                      to the listener to chose whether he wants to listen to the lie or
                                      not.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Clearly, this person does
                                      not fully understand the concept of defamation and libel. Lets
                                      imagine for a while, someone who don’t like you (person A) decided
                                      to take a picture of your sister or mother and say that she is a
                                      prostitute, write her number and home address on the picture and
                                      start distributing it on the streets.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>According to this certain
                                      someone, person A should be left alone and let him continue the
                                      lie, its up to the listener to judge whether the lie is true or
                                      not. To a person with a little more knowledge, this is a flawed
                                      concept.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>By letting Person A
                                      continue the lie, your sister or mother public status or
                                      credibility will be severely affected. They will be constantly
                                      disturbed by perverts and will forever be ashamed as long as the
                                      lie continues.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span> </span>This
                                      certain someone continues with, “If that is the case, then the lie
                                      should be fought with the truth. Tell everyone he is lying and no
                                      one will believe him.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>In a classroom, this is
                                      possible. But this is the entire of Singapore we’re talking about.
                                      How are you going to find out whom Person A had lied to and correct
                                      the lie? The truth is, it is very hard to do so. But one thing can
                                      be done, cut out the source of the lie. Put a tape on his mouth and
                                      the lie will, hopefully, cease to exist.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>Like I’ve said before, a man’s words
                                      holds value and he should be held responsible for it. It just
                                      depends on how far a person is willing to go to uphold the truth.
                                      Some people chose to do nothing and the liar will go free, others
                                      chose to do something. Tell a teacher, supervisor or a judge
                                      depending on the nature of the lie.</span></p>

              <p>It is a duty of a muslim to defend Islam. If someone lies about Islam, a muslim can do one of two things. (1) Correct the lies by going around and tell everyone the truth or (2) put a masking tape on the liar.</p>
              <p>Information or misinformation is a powerful thing. It can put an inocent in jail or let a murder go free. It can create peace or start wars. That is the power of information.</p>
              <p>That is the purpose of the defamation act and the sedition act. To stop the spread of misinformation. Think about it. This couple is not only spreading lies, but what else can that lie cause? Hate towards muslim? What can happen when hate builds up? A dispute? A fight? A riot? All because of misinformation.</p>
              <p>Misinformation caused the Iraq war. That is how powerful misinformation is.</p>
              <p>And also remember, the couple did not only offend a person or two. He offended an entire community of Singapore. That is 15%+/- the population of Singapore. And offended more people who believe that religious harmony in Singapore is a sacred thing and is one of the glue that hold a multi-racial and religious Singapore together.</p>
              <p>Let this couple be an example that Singapore don't tolerate hate speaches and misinformation. They chose to tell a lie, they shall suffer the concequesces.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now about about "study Islam, don't study the muslim." Human are the smartest creature on the face of the planet and are also capable of the dumbest acts known to man kind. A school has its missions and values but surely got some mangkok students that never follow its values and became a disgrace to the school.</p>
              <p>So, if you want to know about the school, where do you look at? The good student? The bad students? The teachers? The values?</p>
              <p>SO again, if you want to study Islam, "study Islam, don't study the muslims" but if you want to study about muslims, be my guest. But remember, no two humans are alike.</p>
