More likely it is the other way round. they give themselves a bad name by bringing poor people like me for a joy ride and charging me more than the normal. Although I agree tt some are doing an honest living, it seems that most taxi drivers are part timers looking to earn a quick buck frm poor students like me. So of course in order to have a higher profit margin, they hide and wait for calls and bring ppl for joy ride lor.</div>

And the competitor companies all charge roughly the same rates, which suggests that that either economies of scale is not giving benefits or some companies are making exceptional profits.<br><br>Either that.. or there simply isn't enough competitors in the taxi company market.</div>

The cab that went past probably are on call or they r going to fetch their family for some event etc. If u feel tat taxi driver r bringing u on a joyride, then u direct them which road to go lor... sometimes it is not because they wanna bring u on a joyride but they r also human mah... they may not know the shortest route as well. Taxi driver has to go through peak hours and non peak hours... people only see the lack of taxi during peak hours but not see the emptiness of the cab during other normal hours...</div>
