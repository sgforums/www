              <p>Hahahahhahha any good genes people would not want to have anything to do with the LKY family.</p>
              <p>The only reason some people claim to be above all things is that so that they can be lower than everybody else.</p>
              <p>I read in a magazine that a psychopath cannot differentiate between rational stimulus and emotional stimulus so that their reaction would be irrational. This condition is due to a brain damage.</p>
              <p>You can even say that corrupt people are suffering from brain damage as well.</p>
              <p>It's a hereditary condition unfortunately. A defect of genes.</p>
              <p> Gary: He said to me at the lift lobby 90% of the exact words - ”Mr Tan,if you walk out of here tomorrow,you might get killed.You might meet with a mysterious accident,you might disappear and nobody will know what happened to you! Mr Tan, some things and people in this country you cannot offend! Some people are above all things! You better make sure you know this! Mr Tan,we can arrange for things to happen to you.You understand or not!”<br>I SAY FUCK THEM</p>
