            <div class='col-md body'>Debates over the past years with forumites have led me to think: "Are we whiners or are we just sharing our views out of love for the country?<br><br>Many have called us whiners. Well, you all know who.<br><br>A whiner in my opinion is someone who has suffered injustice <strong>AND</strong> rants <strong>for the sake</strong> of ranting.<br><br>Many regulars are here to contribute by sharing the truth. We keep ourselves updated about the political and socio-economic changes in Singapore. We post excerpts, articles and links to meaningful political blogs.<br><br>So do we rant for the sake of ranting? I beg to differ. We "rant" for a cause because we do not want this country where we were brought up to be ruined by a narcissistic party. <strong>AND</strong> we back it up. We are here to spread the word.<br><br>Many also think we are losers but are we? I work out of Singapore and I am not affected by GST hikes. Yet, it makes my blood boil to see every solution to every problem as a price increase. Many of us here are also professionals in our own right.<br><br>You judge.<br><br></div>
