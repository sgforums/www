              <p>PM LHL said the search for the next PM is on. That is another way of saying that he intended to carry on in the meantime when he still cannot find a potential PM probably till he is into the 70s.</p>
              <p>Let him search. He can go on searching paying more millions and only getting the mercenary like  w.k.s.or neh who are more interested establishing their own career
              path through winning favor of power that be as we all can see and to heck with solving real problems like combating rising costs of living or restructuring the
              economy.<br> <br> It is doubtful by using monies he could find the Zhu Keliang who are not easily bought with monies but people who truly want to use their ability to exchange for results.</p>
              <p>It is sad that with so much education and intellect none of our so-called scholars and million-dollar talents do not even understand such simple logic in their so-called proverbial search for talents.<br> <br> Meanwhile we the citizens just have to be independent and be self-reliant to spread our
              message thanks to the internet gift to all similar civic minded fellow citizens to think alike and work to change the present government by power and governing system. Only then can we the citizens look after our own interests and get what we want
              eventually as a people. Power finally lies with the people not all
              these hypocrite and pretenders.</p>

              <p>The next GCT "Seatwarmer". Maybe this time really install a super tyrant so that Lieutenant Li can save us peasants from the evil bastard, like his letter to his superior officers.</p>
              <p>You people should read or watch Dune with regards to Baron Harkonnen. A part of the story is that Baron Harkonnen is major bad guy in charge of a planet with resources. He has two nephews, one a thug and the other a sophisticated bad guy groomed to be his sucessor. He allows Thug nephew to brutalize the natives in order for the other nephew to come across as the hero, but in fact still a tyrant.</p>
              <p>From Wikipedia:</p>
              <p>"As <em>Dune</em> begins, Feyd-Rautha figures heavily in the Baron's plans to gain power for House Harkonnen. The Baron favors the handsome and charismatic Feyd over Feyd's older brother <a title="Glossu Rabban" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Glossu_Rabban"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Glossu Rabban</span></a> ("The Beast") because of Feyd's extreme intelligence and his dedication to the Harkonnen culture of carefully-planned and subtly executed <a title="Sadistic personality disorder" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sadism</span></a> and cruelty, as opposed to Rabban's outright brutality.</p>
              <p>Feyd is, for a while, the Baron's heir, or na-Baron. To assure Feyd's power, the Baron intends to install him as ruler of <a title="Arrakis" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Arrakis"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arrakis</span></a> after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people."</p>

              first, about the second son. he's autistic and albino.
              
              dunno LHL's 2nd son. 3rd son (xiao li fei dao) was good enough to get a SAFOS scholarship, so pretty good i guess. 4th son was from ACS IB, never take A level, scored 43/45 which is a very good score too.
              
              there's a promising one from LHY's stable, good results and eloquent and from national debate team. the other son LKY said himself, he's dyslexic.
