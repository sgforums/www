              <td colspan="2"><span class="postbody"> Fair enough GCT seems recently to have made some good points about the
              need for ministers to possess ability to connect to the people and
              persuade to accept their policies with good leadership and
              implementation ability.
              <br> <br>May be after the last GE where he made the blunder to unfairly
              threatening Hougang and Potong Pasir residents with withdrawal of lift
              upgrading if they did not vote for PAP he is now repenting and trying
              to make amends.
              <br> <br>Perhaps he realized from his greater contact with other world
              leaders he has learned to be more objective and know his duty to do the
              right things for the people or is he mouthing hypocrisy just to
              brainwash the people again politically.
              <br> <br>He now said in the upcoming cabinet reshuffle ministers who will be
              promoted should be people with ability to connect with the ground and
              convince people with leadership and arguments to accept their policies.
              <br> <br>As a test whether in the current cabinet reshuffle has the PM
              really exercised such judgment over the performance of the ministers.
              <br> <br>For example has the Minister for Transport Raymond Lim really
              connected with the ground or got the people to accept the rationale of
              non-stop extension of ERPs everywhere without differentiation of
              whether the ERP roads are expressway, major road or local access road
              for filtering out of traffic from congested expressways to lesser roads
              in the implementation.
              <br> <br>Indiscriminate extension of ERP to control all congestion is not a
              win-win situation to let motorists have the option to decide whether to
              go by ERP roads or filter out to lesser roads (major roads or local
              access road) as catching every one to pay ERP will not solve the
              congestion problem as such method will end up with heaving ERP without
              solving congestion short of giving up vehicles for which they already
              paid COE and the punitive excise duty.
              <br> <br>Is Raymond really connected to the people or has he persuaded
              people to accept ERP-everywhere policy as a more effective way to solve
              the long-standing vehicle congestion problem?
              <br> <br>If SM, MM and PM have the leadership ability, they should realize
              that many ministers like this or DPM WKS lack the ability to connect to
              the ground and make people accept their policies or implementations of
              policies with leadership or good convincing arguments or rationale.
              <br> <br> Let the people be the judge as to whether PM knows how to judge the performance of such ministers as pointed out by SM Goh.
              <br> <br> If he cannot then even the PM is not up to the standard to connect to the ground and convince people to accept policies.
              <br> <br> If such government or ministers stay on they will only cause more harm and inconvenience.</span></td>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Mr. K Shanmugam, new Minister for Law. What a miserable life.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Straits Times, the Singapore state
              controlled newspaper in a story dated March 30, 2008 "Loss to law
              profession, but gain for Singapore" is all praise for Mr. K Shanmugam,
              Lee Kuan Yew's Member of Parliament on his promotion as Minister for
              Law. Is this really, all glory for this man, or is it in truth, misery?<br><br>Just
              look at him. He is an Indian lawyer selected many years ago by Lee Kuan
              Yew to join his party and become a Member of Parliament. Knowing
              Singapore as a one party state under Lee Kuan Yew, you know how this
              works.<br><br>His main qualification from the beginning is complete
              loyalty to one man, Lee Kuan Yew. Meaning exactly that. A complete and
              utter subservience to him. And the willingness to carry out his any
              command, just as a dog will faithfully carry out his master's orders.
              His principle ambition being all along to catch Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's eye
              which he succeeded. Never mind what sort of a tyrant he may be.<br><br>Well
              he succeeded in his ambition to serve his master. He was chosen by Lee,
              lucky for him; or is it really? And all these years he does Lee’s
              bidding. Saying anything he wants said. Doing anything he wants done.<br><br>All because it is highly profitable.<br><br>And
              during all these years as Member of Parliament, no Singaporeans has any
              respect for him. None at all. Indeed they don’t even care who or what
              he is. He merely goes about doing his job. His job includes sitting at
              resident committee meetings and the monthly meet the people sessions,
              which he does mechanically. He always contests elections in Group
              Representation Constituencies because there is a doubt whether he will
              win a single seat constituency, because he is an Indian in a majority
              Chinese country.<br><br>But he always wins elections because his
              master, Lee Kuan Yew sees to it. Any opposition contender is defamed
              derided sued and sent to jail if they challenge him. With Lee Kuan
              Yew's blessing and protection, this man survives as a Member of
              Parliament and now as a Minister.<br><br>If the next moment, Lee
              withdraws his support, Mr. K Shannmugam will no longer be Member of
              Parliament, let alone Minister. He will be selling "thosai", the Indian
              pancake along Serangoon Road next to Norris Road. He won’t be wearing
              fancy suits anymore but instead the Indian lungi, and chewing betel
              nut! He is not master of his destiny, Lee Kuan Yew is.<br><br>Within
              Singapore, in reality he represents no one. No one is bothered about
              him, or even knows anything about him. In fact no body cares two hoots,
              whether he is dead or alive.<br><br>The state controlled newspaper the
              Straits Times will of course put out the standard propaganda that he is
              brilliant, that he is smart and that he is none other than superman.
              But just like everything else the state controlled paper will say; the
              people just ignore it.<br><br>This man may go abroad, meet foreign
              governments and politicians. But foreign politicians are not like him.
              They, being true politicians, truly representative of their people,
              look upon this man as nothing more than Lee Kuan Yew's page boy. They
              have no respect for him. They know he is not truly a politician. He is
              a mere employee selected by Lee Kuan Yew to play the part of a
              politician. Like me, they also know that the moment Lee tires of him,
              he will very probably, end up selling the Indian pancake at the
              aforementioned location at Serangoon Road.<br><br>If this man's life is a happy one; or a shameful disgraceful and miserable one, I leave it to you to decide.<br><br>Let’s
              look at someone else. Let’s look at Dr. Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore
              Democratic Party. Dr. Chee is not a Member of Parliament. In fact he is
              a bankrupt. He was bankrupted by Lee Kuan Yew because he crossed his
              path. He is not rich as Mr. K Shanmugam. He is defamed and demonized in
              Singapore’s state controlled paper by Lee Kuan Kew. Lee calls him a
              liar, a cheat and a rascal.<br><br>But despite all that Lee says, the
              situation is quite the opposite. The people respect him. The people
              know him as a true leader. He is not beholden to anyone. He speaks his
              mind; unlike Shanmugam who says what he is told to say. A great number
              of Singaporeans read what he has to say. They listen to his speeches
              and they are interested in his actions. Not only in Singapore, but
              throughout the world, Dr. Chee is respected. In reality, Dr. Chee
              stands as a giant, next to this man Shanmugam; no better than Lee’s
              poodle.<br><br>The European Parliament has honored Dr. Chee. He has won
              many world leadership awards. World leaders respect him as a force for
              freedom and democracy. He is unable to travel because Lee refuses to
              let him. He is in effect a prisoner within Singapore. But world leaders
              are constantly monitoring his circumstances. They care for him. They
              worry about him. They know him. They respect him. They continue to
              lodge protests against Singapore for denying his human rights. Dr. Chee
              is seen as a true leader, a true fighter for democracy and human
              rights. He is not a Minister in Lee Kuan Yew's cabinet but he remains a
              giant before this Mr. Shanmugam.<br><br>World leaders on the other hand
              have never heard of Mr. Shanmugam. Had it not been for the state
              controlled newspaper the Straits Times, Singaporeans would not have
              known him either!<br><br>Mr. Shanmugam lives his life at the mercy and
              pleasure of Lee Kuan Yew, the authoritarian ruler of Singapore because
              it is profitable. Dr. Chee lives as a free man with a conviction and a
              purpose in life.<br><br>Despite all the worldly pleasures, it can only
              be said that Mr. K Shanmugam lives a miserable life. He is not a free
              man. He is on Lee Kuan Yew's short leash. Dr. Chee Soon Juan on the
              other hand, is a giant, lives as a free and happy man; a man respected
              not only by Singaporeans but by politicians and people all over the
              world.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Fundamental laws like the constitution are good to have provided they spell out clearly the roles and duties of government versus the citizens to prevent abuse of power to serve the government's own interests or hidden agendas while ensuring that citizens are able to live their lives freely in accordance with general laws based on principles of justice equity and fair play.</p>
              <p>In our case what do we see of our laws, law makers (parliament), executives (implementors of laws), judiciary and civil servants.</p>
              <p>Are our laws serving our citizens' interests as described in the first Principle of Nation Building (see the thread of this name).</p>
              <p>If the answer is blur or a qualified one then what is the point of having another great lawyer talent like Shanmugam if he is another law minister only interested in passing all kinds of laws to serve the power that be to increase their own salaries or GST or GRC or profiteering from all the lands and assets owned by people to enrich the state at the expense of the people.</p>
              <p>I do not see the need to have another law minister paid millions just to come up with legalistic passing of more laws to entrench the power that be in power and to screw us the people.</p>
              <p>It is better to have strategic independent planners and implementors who could see beyond laws and legalistic passing of all sorts of laws in puppet parliament just to look good.</p>
              <p>What we need badly now is to have an anti-law result-getting ministers who could see the need to unscramble from too much laws and put up proposals to abolish some existing laws like the GRC or profiteering schemes of all kinds of HDB and GLCs to make our lives easier.</p>
              <p>Keep the lawyers to the back room and not let lawyers dominate the government or prevent us from too much legalistic wrangling of the whole government and interfere with our political evolution to a more open and creative system free from lawyers' interference to build a more competitive economy.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><em>...As W. I. Jennings says in more than one place in his book </em><em>Cabinet Government,
                  "It is the Government that controls the House of Commons." This control
                  is exercised through the Cabinet's control of the political party
                  machinery. This power over the party machinery is exercised through
                  control of party funds and above all by control of nominations to
                  constituencies. The fact that there are no primary elections in Britain
                  and that <strong>party candidates are named by the inner clique of the party is
                  of tremendous importance and is the key to the control which the inner
                  clique exercises over the House of Commons</strong>, yet it is rarely mentioned
                  in books on the English political system...</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>...The idea, widely held in the United States, that the
                  Commons is a legislative body and the Cabinet is an executive body is
                  not true.</strong> As far as legislation is concerned, Britain has a
                  multi-cameral system in which the Cabinet is the second chamber, the
                  Commons the third, and the Lords the fourth. Of these three the
                  Conservatives always have control of the Lords, and the same party
                  generally has control of the other two. Legislation originates in the
                  meetings of the inner clique of the party, acting as a first chamber.
                  If accepted by the Cabinet it passes the Commons almost automatically. <strong>The
                  Commons, rather than a legislative body, is the public forum in which
                  the party announces the decisions it has made in secret party and
                  Cabinet meetings and allows the opposition to criticize in order to
                  test public reactions.</strong> <strong>Thus all bills come from the Cabinet, and
                  rejection in Commons is almost unthinkable, unless the Cabinet grants
                  to party members in Commons freedom of action. Even then this freedom
                  usually extends only to the right to abstain from voting, and does not
                  allow the member to vote against a bill.</strong> Although machinery for
                  private members' bills exists similar to that in the United States,
                  such bills rarely become law. The only significant one in recent years
                  was an unusual hill of an unusual member from an unusual constituency.
                  It was the divorce law of A. P. Herbert, famous humorist, and Member
                  from Oxford.</em></p>
              <p><em>     <strong>This situation is sometimes called "Cabinet
                  dictatorship." It could more accurately be called "party dictatorship."
                  Both the Cabinet and the Commons are controlled by the party, or more
                  accurately by the inner clique of the party.</strong> This inner clique may
                  hold seats in the Cabinet, hut the two are not the same thing, since
                  members of one may not be members of the other, and the gradations of
                  power are hy no means the same in one as in the other. The inner clique
                  of the Conservative Party sometimes meets in the Carlton Club, while
                  the inner clique of the Labour Party meets in a trade-union conclave,
                  frequently in Transport House...</em></p>

Meaning exactly that. A complete and utter subservience to him. And the willingness to carry out his any command, just as a dog will faithfully carry out his master's orders. His principle ambition being all along to catch Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's eye which he succeeded. Never mind what sort of a tyrant he may be.<br><br>Well he succeeded in his ambition to serve his master. He was chosen by Lee, lucky for him; or is it really? And all these years he does Lee’s bidding. Saying anything he wants said. Doing anything he wants done.<br><br>All because it is highly profitable.<br><br>And during all these years as Member of Parliament, no Singaporeans has any respect for him. None at all. Indeed they don’t even care who or what he is. He merely goes about doing his job. His job includes sitting at resident committee meetings and the monthly meet the people sessions, which he does mechanically. He always contests elections in Group Representation Constituencies because there is a doubt whether he will win a single seat constituency, because he is an Indian in a majority Chinese country.<br><br>But he always wins elections because his master, Lee Kuan Yew sees to it. Any opposition contender is defamed derided sued and sent to jail if they challenge him. With Lee Kuan Yew's blessing and protection, this man survives as a Member of Parliament and now as a Minister.<br><br>If the next moment, Lee withdraws his support, Mr. K Shannmugam will no longer be Member of Parliament, let alone Minister. He will be selling "thosai", the Indian pancake along Serangoon Road next to Norris Road. He won’t be wearing fancy suits anymore but instead the Indian lungi, and chewing betel nut! He is not master of his destiny, Lee Kuan Yew is.<br><br>Within Singapore, in reality he represents no one. No one is bothered about him, or even knows anything about him. In fact no body cares two hoots, whether he is dead or alive.<br><br>The state controlled newspaper the Straits Times will of course put out the standard propaganda that he is brilliant, that he is smart and that he is none other than superman. But just like everything else the state controlled paper will say; the people just ignore it.<br><br>This man may go abroad, meet foreign governments and politicians. But foreign politicians are not like him. They, being true politicians, truly representative of their people, look upon this man as nothing more than Lee Kuan Yew's page boy. They have no respect for him. They know he is not truly a politician. He is a mere employee selected by Lee Kuan Yew to play the part of a politician. Like me, they also know that the moment Lee tires of him, he will very probably, end up selling the Indian pancake at the aforementioned location at Serangoon Road.<br><br>If this man's life is a happy one; or a shameful disgraceful and miserable one, I leave it to you to decide.<br><br>Let’s look at someone else. Let’s look at Dr. Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party. Dr. Chee is not a Member of Parliament. In fact he is a bankrupt. He was bankrupted by Lee Kuan Yew because he crossed his path. He is not rich as Mr. K Shanmugam. He is defamed and demonized in Singapore’s state controlled paper by Lee Kuan Kew. Lee calls him a liar, a cheat and a rascal.<br><br>But despite all that Lee says, the situation is quite the opposite. The people respect him. The people know him as a true leader. He is not beholden to anyone. He speaks his mind; unlike Shanmugam who says what he is told to say. A great number of Singaporeans read what he has to say. They listen to his speeches and they are interested in his actions. Not only in Singapore, but throughout the world, Dr. Chee is respected. In reality, Dr. Chee stands as a giant, next to this man Shanmugam; no better than Lee’s poodle.<br><br>The European Parliament has honored Dr. Chee. He has won many world leadership awards. World leaders respect him as a force for freedom and democracy. He is unable to travel because Lee refuses to let him. He is in effect a prisoner within Singapore. But world leaders are constantly monitoring his circumstances. They care for him. They worry about him. They know him. They respect him. They continue to lodge protests against Singapore for denying his human rights. Dr. Chee is seen as a true leader, a true fighter for democracy and human rights. He is not a Minister in Lee Kuan Yew's cabinet but he remains a giant before this Mr. Shanmugam.<br><br>World leaders on the other hand have never heard of Mr. Shanmugam. Had it not been for the state controlled newspaper the Straits Times, Singaporeans would not have known him either!<br><br>Mr. Shanmugam lives his life at the mercy and pleasure of Lee Kuan Yew, the authoritarian ruler of Singapore because it is profitable. Dr. Chee lives as a free man with a conviction and a purpose in life.<br><br>Despite all the worldly pleasures, it can only be said that Mr. K Shanmugam lives a miserable life. He is not a free man. He is on Lee Kuan Yew's short leash. Dr. Chee Soon Juan on the other hand, is a giant, lives as a free and happy man; a man respected not only by Singaporeans but by politicians and people all over the world.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Yay Miss Vivian - 1 portfolio. Actually should drop the other portfolio instead. She is damn suited for "Information, Communications and <strong>The Arts</strong>".</p>
              <p>Opposition should enlist Alex Au for this post - the Andrew Sullivan of Singapore. Maybe then Mediacorp will revive in Singapore the tv program "Queer eye for the straight guy". Or better still "The Queer Guide to Theatre and Opera that PAP effetists like to watch".</p>
              <p>If Uncle Ver become Minister for Arts, I promise WWE matches in the Durian and the unbanning of Playboy magazines. I will bring NASCAR into Singapore instead.</p>

              <p>"What we need badly now is to have an anti-law result-getting ministers who could see the need to unscramble from too much laws and put up proposals to abolish some existing laws like the GRC or profiteering schemes of all kinds of HDB and GLCs to make our lives easier."</p>
              <p>To be more precise its the excessive bureaucracy in running an island of 600 sqkm albeit population 4 million. But if you do things my way, unemployment goes up and I doubt people will go for it.</p>

              <p>WKS (fortunately) has timing favouring him. had the MSK episode happened earlier, he would have faced the inevitable. it is too soon. also, if WKS takes the wrap, it shouldn't happened during a cabinet reshuffle. it will overshadow the overall positive message PAP wants to deliver. I still think it will be a matter of time for him to `retire', for as long as MSK is not found. if really nothing is done still, then PAP has a lot to answer for the incompetence they breed from within.</p>
              <p>Separately, my read is that Vivian is also pegged back. His arrogance in the last few months shows how disconnected he is from the common man.</p>
              <p>Personally, i don't read too much into the cabinet reshuffle overall. the same guys gets rotated.</p>
              <p>Prof Ho should retire. I personally like Prof Ho.</p>
