              The Obama phenomenon is a hoax carefully crafted by the captains of the New World Order. He is being pushed as savior in an attempt to con the American people into accepting global slavery.
              
              We have reached a critical juncture in the New World Order's plans. It's not about Left or Right: it's about a One World Government. The international banks plan to loot the people of the United States and turn them into slaves on a Global Plantation.
              
              Covered in this film: who Obama works for, what lies he has told, and his real agenda. If you want to know the facts and cut through all the hype, this is the film for you.
              
              Watch the Obama Deception and learn how:
              
              - Obama is continuing the process of transforming America into something that resembles Nazi Germany, with forced National Service, domestic civilian spies, warrantless wiretaps, the destruction of the Second Amendment, FEMA camps and Martial Law.
              
              - Obama's handlers are openly announcing the creation of a new Bank of the World that will dominate every nation on earth through carbon taxes and military force.
              
              - International bankers purposefully engineered the worldwide financial meltdown to bankrupt the nations of the planet and bring in World Government.
              
              - Obama plans to loot the middle class, destroy pensions and federalize the states so that the population is completely dependent on the Central Government.
              
              - The Elite are using Obama to pacify the public so they can usher in the North American Union by stealth, launch a new Cold War and continue the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.

              <p>USA can pay off all debts only if the people rise up in revolution and overthrow their corrupted govt that's owned by the Federal Reserve.</p>
              <p>most of the debts is owned directly to the FED...............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to pay off China........Japan.......Germany and other foreign creditors..........it's very very simple............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>###    the USA has oil and gas that are SEVERAL times more than the whole Middle East combined...........they can nationalize the oil and gas companies in US and pay off their debts to these nations using oil and gas................plus create tens of thousands of jobs at the same time !</p>

              <p>600billions is use to buy treasury bonds, the treasury then use the money they got from the feds and use it on new stimulus plan to stiulate the economy. talking about money laundering , that is the what i call the legal money laudering in the damn whole world!.

              <p>It's more like transfering money from the future US generations to cover the current economic crisis.</p>
              <p>The signs are very clear now. The bankers were in cohort to cheat the ordinary Americans (and the rest of the world) through so called 'creative financing'.</p>
              <p>The worse thing is, the American govt never, ever redresses this root problem but works in concerted effort with these rogue bankers maintaining status quo.</p>
              <p>This crisis will drag for decades to come. Economists already predicted mini to mid-size economic bubbles, one after another, coming the world as result of US quantititive easing.</p>
              <p>Starting from what we seeing in China now, an anomaly of stagflation with food price rising more than 10 %. </p>
              <p>The future America will be bleak - more expensive, high cost, high taxation, low return place to call home.</p>
