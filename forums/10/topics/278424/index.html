            <div class='col-md body'>It's never nice to compare but I recently read in the Strait Times about Hyundai's boss, accused of embezzlement. Just so you guys can take a look between Singapore and South Korea.<br><br>Know how much he embezzled? S$90 million if I'm not wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So what was he sentenced to? <strong>Community service.</strong> What form of community service? No, he doesn't have to strap on a vest and pick up litter. He's sentenced to writing articles for newspapers and giving lectures on business ethics. Oh yeah, on top of all that, he has "pledged" to donate a billion to charity.<br><br>So yeah, it's true - money can buy you out of jail.<br><br>edit - I have to add that the South Korean Courts' reasoning behind the "sentence" is that he is a critical figure of the South Korean economy, seeing how he is the head of Hyundai, the sixth-largest automaker globally. However, I fail to see how just one man, though he is the president, can cause such critical damage to such a powerful economy. Surely the support infrastructure isn't that weak?<br><br>Hopefully Durai's appeal doesn't get through and he has to serve time between bars. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
