              <p>in that one stroke, the momentum the whole opposition fought hard to gained, ground to a halt.. people who know cannot bring themselves to vote for someone like that.. cannot bring ourselves to trust someone who would stick one in his own mentor...</p>
              <p>if you only saw CST's face... one of shock, of despair..</p>
              <p>it is so horrific that it not only broke the opposition movement and moved it back a few decades, it broke the spirit of a good man in CST... and notice he has not been able to trust anyone else to groom as successor...</p>
              <p>which is why, people like me, who saw everything first hand, will never believe that attention whore anymore</p>

              <p>If the current old/veteran candidates aren't good enough as compared to the candidates in the ruling party, then winning the election doesn't ensure losers will become prime champion winners overnight.</p>
              <p>IF these rebels realised that they aren't good enough to win by their own ability but needed DONATIONS votes from the public, then certainly they are really a bunch of LOSERS to begin with. Would you entrust the future of your children at the hands of loser rebels who NEEDED you to DONATE votes to them?</p>
              <p>Don't be silly, no countries in this world should be allowed to have such risks to fall upon them. Candidates who aren't good enough are just purely irresponsible individuals who only think about their own selfish ambitions ahead of yours. Do you really want to give them a chance to try and error in governing your country? I rather stick with someone who KNOWS what he's doing for his country!</p>

              <p>Actually,it takes much courage to tell the PAP ministers,especially LKY,that they are wrong.</p>
