              <p>Dr. Teo Ho Pin did a lot for the constituency, and frankly
              speaking, he is probably one of the low profile MP... but with high
              visibility around the estate.<br> <br> Always see him mingling with the older residents... and signing up
              Taichi and Qigong classes to get into contact with residents every
              week... and joining residents in monthly brisk walking activities.
              He is also always seen at the Bangkit Market..... so aunties and
              uncles also know him. <br> <br> The only tough part with this elections in Bukit Panjang this time
              round is that 20% of the people in his constituency would be the
              younger generation, who will be voting for the first time.<br> <br> And many of the younger generation are actually struggling right
              now... cant get into uni places... cant get a job.... and they may
              actually influence their parents to vote for the
              opposition....<br> <br> As for the promises he made in 2006.. the only thing he did not
              achieve was that he promised a sports complex that comes with a
              swimming pool..... at Petir Road... which was then shelved to
              become an open concrete sports corner. In 2008, works started at
              Bukit Panjang Park where a new sports complex will be built, but
              without a swimming pool. So far, the sports complex is still in
              construction... 2 tennis courts... with no swimming pool that was
              promised.<br> <br> I live in Bukit Panjang. Frankly speaking, I like Teo Ho Pin but i
              dun like the party he is in! How!!! SO HARD TO VOTE!!!</p>

              <p>How to get good enough candidate? You need exposure to learn ma. I ask you, how can you be a good teacher if you don't get the chance to be a teacher? How can you be a good football player if you always sit on the bench.</p>
              <p>That is why must let SDP win so that they can train and have more experience people. If they don't win, then they don't have chance to learn how to help us. Help them to help us. Understand.</p>
