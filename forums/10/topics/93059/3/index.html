So generally we have chinese learning chinese, malays students learning malay and Indians learning tamil. English is the language for mass comm and for business. Mother tongue is the language to enable the different races to maintain their respective cultures.<br>This is pretty successful among the Malays and the Indians, for all young Malays speak Malay and English (except for those who attend Madrasa!), and Indians speak Tamil and English. But for the Chinese the success is less. Many chinese now think they are speaking english when they speak 80%singlish+20%mandarin, or 80%mandarin+20%english and thought that they were speaking mandarin. Many parents, mostly those from english monolinguo family, migrate to auzi, canada or us because their children can't tahan chinese. But language is part of cultures and you are witnessing the evolution of the singaporean cultures.

But generally speaking, Singapore do speak better English than most other asian countires.<br><br>Since many many years ago (don't remember the year, but at least 20+ years), it was made compusory to use English as the media of education, so you are right. Mandarin is not use as a media of education. It is only teach as a subject on it's own. So, if you start talking about zhi jiao (Right Angle) or bian yi xi su (Standard error), very very few people will understand what you are talking about.<br><br>(Hmm.... wait, there is actually one, religious study - confucious can be teach in Mandarin last I remember when I am in school, but that might be already scrapped)</div>

Some families have people who can speak simple Malays. Some adapt and learn a little bit of Malay. Some Indonesia maid are young and can learn pretty fast and can speak simple English. Some take the easy way out and get a Philipino maid. Some gets neighbour's help when the maid cannot understand what they want. So, really depends.</div>
