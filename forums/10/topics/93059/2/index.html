We suffered the same fate as China people, last time Syonan-to<br>our women got raped..man got tortured..</blockquote>not just us, not just chinese... happened everywhere the japanese landed. but after the initial disruption, they were as eager as the ang mohs to get on with business and Chinese who were willing to cooperate were valuable collaborators. many got richer as a result.<br><br><blockquote>2.

Recognising the difference in races is not "racists"!!! There is one common human being, but there are many races, the result of thousands of years of human history.<br><br>Racists are those who believe their own race is more superior than the other races, or those who are preudiced or discriminate against another race. Recognising that I am a Chinese and you are .....does not make me a racist.<br><br>There is a difference between race and nationality. Singaporean is a nationality, not a race!! If you give up singapore citizenship, you cease to be a singaporean. If you are an indian, wherever you go, you are still an indian.<br><br>There are FOUR major different races in Singapore, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasians. But ALL are Singaporean.<br><br>"lao wai" in China refers specifically to the angmoh, not the overseas Chinese. There are terms such as "hua qiao", "hua ren". They also differentiate between the Hong Kong Chinese, and the Taiwanese Chinese. This does not mean they are discriminating against them.<br><br>Race is a beauty, if we recognise and understand the difference, we will live happily together. Isn't that what Singapore is all about, racial understanding and tolerance, "don't tell the malay because we are singaporean so why you cannot eat pork like I do."</div>

They have not stayed in Singapore long enough to have their own language, their own cuture or any distinctiveness to be identified as a race. I agree these chinese have problem calling themselves. It is not what they call themselves, it is when you step outside singapore, what do others call you? Singapore is nationality, not a race. Do you recognise you as Chinese, Indian, Malay....

"qiao" does not mean "bridge" here, it means "countrymen residing abroad". Your understanding of Chinese, overseas chinese and China, Taiwan appear to be very superficial and one sided, to say the least.

If you don't understand how race, religion, language or cultures differ, it does not mean race, religion...have no meanings.

But pls note that even our grandfathers have given up their links with china, ROC or PRC. While we have our roots traced to China, we should always remember what the old folks say:"Neighbours are better than distant relatives."<br>Chinese cultures over the last century have been modified, even in China itself, under the rule of the communists. ROC which used to be the most 'Chinese', is now turning "green" and is becoming only a small hokkian island. While Chinese throughout the world are looking for identifications to their Chineseness, those who live in independent countries, are clear and quick to identify themselves and their loyalty with the countries to which they belong. It is important that Chinese Singaporean, or Singaporean Chinese do not get carried away with the ugly nationalism which appears to be rising among some of the mainland Chinese youths.<br>China towns, symbol of chinese cultures, remain in almost every corner of the world, but mainland China, no matter how strong they are or will be, have influence whatsoever on them.</div>
