              <p><a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=arEE1iClqDrk&amp;refer=home">http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=arEE1iClqDrk&amp;refer=home</a></p>
              <p>Nov. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government is prepared to
              lend more than $7.4 trillion on behalf of American taxpayers, or
              half the value of everything produced in the nation last year, to
              rescue the financial system since the credit markets seized up 15
              months ago.</p>
              <p>The unprecedented pledge of funds includes $2.8 trillion
              already tapped by financial institutions in the biggest response
              to an economic emergency since the New Deal of the 1930s,
              according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The commitment dwarfs
              the only plan approved by lawmakers, the Treasury Department’s
              $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Federal Reserve
              <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=FARBPMDW%3AIND">lending</a> last week was 1,900 times the weekly average for the
              three years before the crisis.</p>
              <p>When Congress approved the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/hp1207.htm">TARP</a> on Oct. 3, Fed Chairman <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ben%0AS.+Bernanke&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Ben
              S. Bernanke</a> and Treasury Secretary <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Henry+Paulson&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Henry Paulson</a> acknowledged the
              need for transparency and oversight. Now, as regulators commit
              far more money while refusing to disclose loan recipients or
              reveal the collateral they are taking in return, some Congress
              members are calling for the Fed to be reined in.</p>
              <p>“Whether it’s lending or spending, it’s tax dollars that
              are going out the window and we end up holding collateral we
              don’t know anything about,” said Congressman <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Scott+Garrett&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Scott Garrett</a>, a
              New Jersey Republican who serves on the House Financial Services
              Committee. “The time has come that we consider what sort of
              limitations we should be placing on the Fed so that authority
              returns to elected officials as opposed to appointed ones.”</p>
              <p>Too Big to Fail</p>
              <p>Bloomberg News tabulated data from the Fed, Treasury and
              Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and interviewed regulatory
              officials, economists and academic researchers to gauge the full
              extent of the government’s rescue effort.</p>
              <p>The bailout includes a Fed program to buy as much as $2.4
              trillion in short-term notes, called commercial paper, that
              companies use to pay bills, begun Oct. 27, and $1.4 trillion from
              the FDIC to guarantee bank-to-bank loans, started Oct. 14.</p>
              <p><a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=William+Poole&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">William Poole</a>, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank
              of St. Louis, said the two programs are unlikely to lose money.
              The bigger risk comes from rescuing companies perceived as “too
              big to fail,” he said.</p>
              <p>The government committed $29 billion to help engineer the
              takeover in March of Bear Stearns Cos. by New York-based <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=JPM%3AUS">JPMorgan
              Chase &amp; Co.</a> and $122.8 billion in addition to TARP allocations to
              bail out New York-based American International Group Inc., once
              the world’s largest insurer. Yesterday, Citigroup Inc. received
              $306 billion of government guarantees for troubled mortgages and
              toxic assets. The Treasury Department also will inject $20
              billion into the bank after its stock fell 60 percent last week.</p>
              <p>“No question there is some credit risk there,” Poole said.</p>
              <p>Exposure</p>
              <p>Congressman <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Darrell+Issa&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Darrell Issa</a>, a California Republican on the
              Financial Services Committee, said risk is lurking in the
              programs that Poole thinks are safe.</p>
              <p>“The thing that people don’t understand is it’s not how
              likely that the exposure becomes a reality, but what if it
              does?” Issa said. “There’s no transparency to it so who’s to
              say they’re right?”</p>
              <p>The worst financial crisis in two generations has erased $23
              trillion, or 38 percent, of the <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=WCAUWRLD%3AIND">value</a> of the world’s companies
              and brought down three of the biggest Wall Street firms.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INDU%3AIND">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> through Friday is down 38
              percent since the beginning of the year and 43 percent from its
              peak on Oct. 9, 2007. The <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SPX%3AIND">S&amp;P 500</a> fell 45 percent from the
              beginning of the year through Friday and 49 percent from its peak
              on Oct. 9, 2007. The <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=NKY%3AIND">Nikkei 225 Index</a> has fallen 46 percent from
              the beginning of the year through Friday and 57 percent from its
              most recent peak of 18,261.98 on July 9, 2007. <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GS%3AUS">Goldman Sachs
              Group Inc.</a> is down 78 percent, to $53.31, on Friday from its peak
              of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007, and 75 percent this year.</p>
              <p>‘Snookered’</p>
              <p>Regulators hope the rescue will contain the damage and keep
              banks providing the credit that is the lifeblood of the U.S.
              economy.</p>
              <p>Most of the spending programs are run out of the New York
              Fed, whose president, <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Timothy+Geithner&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Timothy Geithner</a>, is said to be President-

              <p>The money that’s been pledged is equivalent to $24,000 for
              every man, woman and child in the country. It’s <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8971/Letter.2.1.shtml">nine times</a> what
              the U.S. has spent so far on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
              according to <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a> figures. It could pay
              off more than half the country’s mortgages.</p>
              <p>“It’s unprecedented,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Bob+Eisenbeis&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Bob Eisenbeis</a>, chief monetary
              economist at Vineland, New Jersey-based Cumberland Advisors Inc.
              and an economist for the Atlanta Fed for 10 years until January.
              “The backlash has begun already. Congress is taking a lot of
              hits from their constituents because they got snookered on the
              TARP big time. There’s a lot of supposedly smart people who look
              to be totally incompetent and it’s all going to fall on the
              taxpayer.”</p>
              <p>New Deal</p>
              <p>President <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Franklin+D.+Roosevelt&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>’s New Deal of the 1930s,
              when almost 10,000 banks failed and there was no mechanism to
              bolster them with cash, is the only rival to the government’s
              current response. The savings and loan bailout of the 1990s cost
              $209.5 billion in inflation-adjusted numbers, of which $173
              billion came from taxpayers, according to a July 1996 <a href="http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/ai96123.pdf">report</a> by
              the U.S. General Accounting Office.</p>
              <p>The 1979 U.S. government bailout of Chrysler consisted of
              bond guarantees, adjusted for inflation, of $4.2 billion,
              according to a Heritage Foundation <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/regulation/bg276.cfm">report</a>.</p>
              <p>The commitment of public money is appropriate to the peril,
              said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ethan+Harris&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Ethan Harris</a>, co-head of U.S. economic research at Barclays
              Capital Inc. and a former economist at the New York Fed. U.S.
              financial firms have taken writedowns and losses of $666.1
              billion since the beginning of 2007, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
              <p>“This is the worst capital markets crisis in modern
              history,” Harris said. “So you have the biggest intervention in
              modern history.”</p>
              <p>Federal Lawsuit</p>
              <p>Bloomberg has requested details of Fed lending under the
              U.S. Freedom of Information Act and filed a federal lawsuit
              against the central bank Nov. 7 seeking to force disclosure of
              borrower banks and their collateral.</p>
              <p>Collateral is an asset pledged to a lender in the event a
              loan payment isn’t made.</p>
              <p>“Some have asked us to reveal the names of the banks that
              are borrowing, how much they are borrowing, what collateral they
              are posting,” Bernanke said Nov. 18 to the <a href="http://www.financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial
              Services Committee</a>. “We think that’s counterproductive.”</p>
              <p>The Fed should account for the collateral it takes in
              exchange for loans to banks, said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Paul+Kasriel&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Paul Kasriel</a>, chief economist
              at Chicago-based Northern Trust Co. and a former research
              economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.</p>
              <p>“There is a lack of transparency here and, given that the
              Fed is taking on a huge amount of credit risk now, it would seem
              to me as a taxpayer there should be more transparency,” Kasriel
              said.</p>
              <p>$4.4 Trillion</p>
              <p>Bernanke’s Fed is responsible for $4.4 trillion of pledges,
              or 60 percent of the total commitment of $7.4 trillion, based on
              data compiled by Bloomberg concerning U.S. bailout steps started
              a year ago.</p>
              <p>“Too often the public is focused on the wrong piece of that
              number, the $700 billion that Congress approved,” said J.D.
              Foster, a former staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers
              who is now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in
              Washington. “The other areas are quite a bit larger.”</p>
              <p>The Fed’s rescue attempts began last December with the
              creation of the Term Auction Facility to allow lending to dealers
              for collateral. After Bear Stearns’s collapse in March, the
              central bank started making direct loans to securities firms at
              the same discount rate it charges commercial banks, which take
              customer deposits.</p>
              <p>In the three years before the crisis, such average weekly
              borrowing by banks was $48 million, according to the central
              bank. Last week it was $91.5 billion.</p>
              <p>Lehman Failure</p>
              <p>The failure of a second securities firm, Lehman Brothers
              Holdings Inc., in September, led to the creation of the
              Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Investor
              Funding Facility, or MMIFF. The two programs, which have pledged
              $2.3 trillion, are designed to restore calm in the money markets,
              which deal in certificates of deposit, commercial paper and
              Treasury bills.</p>
              <p>“Money markets seized up after Lehman failed,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Neal%0ASoss&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Neal

              of total rescue commitments. The FDIC’s $1.4 trillion in
              guarantees will amount to a bank subsidy of as much as $54
              billion over three years, or $18 billion a year, because
              borrowers will pay a lower interest rate than they would on the
              open market, according to Raghu Sundurum and <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Viral+Acharya&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Viral Acharya</a> of New

              of Housing and Urban Development Secretary <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Steven+Preston&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Steven Preston</a>, was
              given the authority to guarantee $300 billion of mortgages, or
              about 4 percent of the total commitment, with its Hope for
              Homeowners program, designed to keep distressed borrowers from
              foreclosure.</p>
              <p>Most of the federal guarantees reduce interest rates on loans
              to banks and securities firms, which would create a subsidy of at
              least $6.6 billion annually for the financial industry, according
              to data compiled by Bloomberg comparing rates charged by the Fed
              against market interest currently paid by banks.</p>
              <p>Not included in the calculation of pledged funds is an FDIC
              proposal to prevent foreclosures by guaranteeing modifications on
              $444 billion in mortgages at an expected cost of $24.4 billion to
              be paid from the TARP, according to FDIC spokesman <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=David+Barr&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">David Barr</a>.
              The Treasury Department hasn’t approved the program.</p>
              <p>Automakers</p>
              <p>Bernanke and Paulson, former chief executive officer of
              Goldman Sachs, have also promised as much as $200 billion to
              shore up nationalized mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and
              Freddie Mac. The FDIC arranged for $139 billion in loan
              guarantees for General Electric Co.’s finance unit.</p>
              <p>The tally doesn’t include money to General Motors Corp.,
              Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC. Obama has said he favors
              financial assistance to keep them from collapse.</p>
              <p>Paulson told the House Financial Services Committee Nov. 18
              that the $250 billion already allocated to banks through the TARP
              is an investment, not an expenditure.</p>
              <p>“I think it would be extraordinarily unusual if the
              government did not get that money back and more,” Paulson said.</p>
              <p>‘We Haircut It’</p>
              <p>In his Nov. 18 testimony, Bernanke told the House Financial
              Services Committee that the central bank wouldn’t lose money.</p>
              <p>“We take collateral, we haircut it, it is a short-term
              loan, it is very safe, we have never lost a penny in these
              various <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/Forms_of_Fed_Lending.pdf">lending programs</a>,” he said.</p>
              <p>A haircut refers to the practice of lending less money than
              the collateral’s current market value.</p>
              <p>Requiring the Fed to disclose loan recipients might set off
              panic, said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=David+Tobin&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">David Tobin</a>, principal of New York-based loan-sale
              consultants and investment bank <a href="http://www.missioncap.com/">Mission Capital Advisors LLC</a>.</p>
              <p>“If you mark to market today, the banking system is
              bankrupt,” Tobin said. “So what do you do? You try to keep it
              going as best you can.”</p>
              <p>“Mark to market” means adjusting the value of an asset,
              such as a mortgage-backed security, to reflect current prices.</p>
              <p>Some of the bailout assistance could come from tax breaks in
              the future. The Treasury Department changed the tax code on Sept.
              30 to allow banks to expand the deductions on the losses banks
              they were buying, according to <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Robert+Willens&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Robert Willens</a>, a former Lehman
              Brothers tax and accounting analyst who teaches at Columbia
              University Business School in New York.</p>
              <p>‘Wells Fargo Notice’</p>
              <p><a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=WFC%3AUS">Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</a>, which is buying Charlotte, North
              Carolina-based Wachovia Corp., will be able to deduct $22
              billion, Willens said. Adding in other banks, the code change
              will cost $29 billion, he said.</p>
              <p>“The rule is now popularly known among tax lawyers as the
              ‘Wells Fargo Notice,’” Willens said.</p>
              <p>The regulation was changed to make it easier for healthy
              banks to buy troubled ones, said Treasury Department spokesman
              <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Andrew+DeSouza&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Andrew DeSouza</a>.</p>

              <p>“The only purpose for this money is to lend,” said Frank,
              a Massachusetts Democrat. “It’s not for dividends, it’s not for
              purchases of new banks, it’s not for bonuses. There better be a
              showing of increased lending roughly in the amount of the capital
              infusions” or Congress may not approve the second half of the
              TARP money.</p>

Sounds retarded, and it is. Thats why the US national debt is at astronomical levels today, and also how the system perpetrates debt.</p></div>
