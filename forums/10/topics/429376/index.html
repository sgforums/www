He did.. <br><br>1) lift upgrading( not every level though but i...t's good enough cuz he changed for us a new n bigger lift ) <br><br>2) fire hydrant door <br><br>3) carpark upgrading <br><br>4) painting for my block <br><br>5)change pipe( sewage ) <br><br>6) jogger track( he overlaid the pavement as it was an uneven track) <br><br>7) covered walkway ( no fear of rain snow or hail!) <br><br>8) re- cementing every level ! <br><br><br>For all these, I think I'm grateful to him cuz with whatever limited n little fund that he has, he did what he could do for the residents of potong Pasir. He is really a politician from the alternate voice that I respect. <br><br><br>My husband said our conservancy rate is one of the lowest in spore, maybe it's true.. We r paying $49.90 monthly (4 rooms flat). <br><br>Ok, a few days ago, we received a pamphlet from PAP Sitoh who informed us that my block is selected for LUP (lift upgrade for every floor) and if majority vote for it , i have to co- pay 7.5% of the cost. Hmm.... With PAP in the picture , does it = pay and pay literally? (Ariel adds, "in case you don't know, all lift upgrading and extra-room-upgrading is co-pay) <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vote PAP if you want to PAY AND PAY</span></span></span></p>

              <p>We should not be still living in a infant politic society, we must learn to come into maturity with politics, then we can truly call ourselves a democratic society that can match any developed demo society like the west.

              <p>Being a good minister doesn't mean he is indispensible. an experienced minister can always be replaced, but the new one will take time to be seasoned.</p>
              <p>Why do we need to match "any developed demo society like the west"? are those societies any better?</p>
              <p>But what you said about the petition and tears are true, they need to learn to lose graciously, like george, such character is not easy to find, so it is not about indispensible, but some quality is not easy to find.</p>

              <p>Should we ask the worker party why they sent in their A team to aljunied? George has worked in Aljunied for the last 20 years, to move him out for fear of losing to the opposition A team would be admitting defeat, no good for the image of the party, no good for the morale of the team he would have left behind.</p>
              <p>We hear many conspiracy theories about putting Lim Swee Say in Aljunied, blah blah blah....but fortunately George didn't blame the party, otherwise, with members like that, who needs oppositions?</p>
