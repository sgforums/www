            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting to note the different in language used by both offices in<br>the same capital regarding Singapore's increased custom checks.<br>Badawi's comment is in stake contrast with the tone used by<br>Dr M's people who seems to try very hard to paint Singapore in<br>negative light. Disappoints me again when this Spin-Doc's clown<br>are back to their usual practice again. Don't they ever learn ?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>New Straits Times</strong><br>Singapore's right to tightened security<br>Hamidah Atan and M. K. Megan<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR,  Singapore's move to tighten border controls with Malaysia is a security measure within the republic's jurisdiction, acting Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"They are worried that a war might break out in Iraq any time. So, as a security measure, they want more stringent inspections of motorcycles and cars entering the country," Abdullah said</span> after launching the Ninth National Handicapped People's Day celebration at the Putra World Trade Centre.<br><br>Abdullah, who is also Home Minister, was commenting on Singapore's announcement that it was tightening boarder controls with Malaysia and subjecting all cars and motorcycles entering from Johor Baru to more stringent measures.<br><br>Announcing the move in Singapore Parliament was Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng, who said it was designed to thwart any attack by Islamic radicals as a war against Iraq appeared imminent.<br><br>Wong said Singapore remained a target and that it was concerned that extremists linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network might retaliate for Washington's action by hitting Asian targets such as Singapore, which has big expatriate population.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meanwhile, in Jelebu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim described Singapore's move as "a direct signal that it is suspicious of Malaysians".</span><br><br>"The move is also a direct signal that they do not want Malaysians to go there anymore. Perhaps, it wants to be on its own ... an island unto itself."<br><br>Rais, who is also Jelebu MP, was speaking to reporters after launching a reunion of students and teachers of Sekolah Menengah Dato' Undang Musa Al-Haj near here.<br><br>The minister said Singapore might have resorted to such move as it did not want to see "extra incoming materials" contravening its laws.<br><br>"The way Singapore handles it, however, is being misspelt across the causeway. Malaysia can do likewise but it has been very practical ...live and let's live.<br><br>"We will not do such things to Singapore vehicles."</span><br></div>
