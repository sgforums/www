              <p>You seem to be asking what a cultural festival is.</p>
              <p>Every peasant class stops working in the field at some point in the year. That's usually after the harvest period. There'd be some kind of celebration at this point in time. Over time this becomes part of the culture as the celebration becomes more elaborate.</p>
              <p>As times change, so does the culture. As we move further away from a peasant hierachy, the traditions lose their meaning and stops being practiced. New ones arise in it's place.</p>
              <p>Part of the Malay culture has evolved to be built around community and that hasn't changed much so their culture still flourishes in their community. Indian culture is non-existent in Singapore as it was purely class based before and there arn't enough Indians in Singapore for this cultural practice to survive.</p>
              <p>Chinese culture in Singapore was peasant culture but is fading as the younger citified Singaporean become a larger part of the community.</p>
              <p>The new culture is going to the bars/pubs/discos and drinking alcohol and talking to strangers. It's almost seen as a rite of passage to becoming an adult.</p>
              <p>BBQs are the new steamboat. </p>
              <p>Another new culture is the farewell party people throw when someone leaves a company.</p>
              <p>Another new culture is when people come back from holidays, they bring a holiday treat with them for colleages.</p>
              <p>You may be nostalgic for the peasant festivities but look around, there are many new cultural practices growing in its place. I'm more curious which ones will survive and which are just fashions or fads.</p>

              <p>It is TS who is out of touch with the ethnic culture.</p>
              <p>Or if he thinks it is not enough, he could migrate to China</p>
              <p><br>One advice for TS: Just migrate away from Singapore. We don't need people like you at all, who do nothing, yet complain complain complain. Just by your spelling, it is obvious you do not even bother to improve your English. Do you seriously think with your calibre, you can succeed in any other English speaking country? Let's don't even mention country, I doubt you have even contributed anything to the people, or the needy, or even helped anyone who needs it.</p>

              <p>if a person is a chinese, he should know his culture and be proud of it and celebrate like a chinese. some who scored A for Chinese in their air level reply you with ' me no the speakee chinese' when you talk to them in chinese.
