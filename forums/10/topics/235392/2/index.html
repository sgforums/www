Found in 1973 and excavated in 1973 and 1977, the site at present is found to consist of four ancient cultural layers whose accumulation is as thick as four meters. Hemudu (whose translation is "the Ferry Place on the Yaojiang River") was in the past called "Huangmudu" or "the Ferry-place near the Tomb of the Revered Mr. Huang" for it is the place where Huangong-one of the four venerable elders in the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 24) lived and died. In February 1982, Hemudu entered in the list of the National Key Cultural Preservation Units and later it was listed as one of the National Patriotic Education Base of the country. Hemudu Cultural Site Museum was opened in May 1993 and its name is the inscription by Jiang Zemin, then General Secretary of the CPC and President of China.<br><br>Hemudu Cultural Site Museum comprises two parts: the Exhibition Halls and the Excavation Sites. The Exhibition part is a complex of six buildings which are connected to one another by covered corridors. Each building is patterned after the 7,000-year-old Hemudu "raised house", typical of "long ridge, short eaves, and elevated foundation." Built on 456 stilts, the buildings of the exhibition halls take the shape of a rafter roof construction and on the sloping exposed walls stand seven sets of structural components, imitating the mortise and tenon components of houses 7,000 years ago. The buildings, with brown walls and red tile, are in great harmony with the environment. The front building is in shape of a flying roc-an enormous legendary bird transformed from a gigantic fish-totem of our Hemudu ancestors.<br><br>About 100 meters from the exhibition hall is the excavation site. Visitors here can enter the restored raised houses and experience the many advantages of this kind of house: warm in winter and cool in summer, dry and safe from beasts. Beside the houses is a restored wood-mouthed well. On the site there are sets of stereo models revealing the panorama of the life of the Hemudu people: life in the raised house, working on the artworks, spinning, weaving, fishing, hunting, husking rice, having meals, and feeding babies.<br></div>

The East still had an Emperor who is a Roman citizen. The Roman Govt continued to exist. Diocletian was the first to have divided the Empire into 2 halves and that was cemented after Constantine's death. Historians call the eastern half erroneously Byzantine as Constantinople used to be the Greek colony Byzantium but Constantine, judging that the city's location was both strategic and highly defensible, which was why the Empire survived the Muslims and what not for another 1000 years until 1453, declared the city Nova Roma or New Rome or Constantinopolis.<br><br>The Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe in fact had two incarnations. The first under Charlemagne, and the other under the German princes. THe Holy Roman Empire was something bestowed upon by the Popes using the fake Donation of Constantine to justify their temporal power.<br><br>Of all the Empires in known history, only the Roman Empire had administrative continuity for 2000 years uninterrupted, short of the occasional civil war.</div>
