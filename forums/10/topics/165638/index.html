I was initially indignant on this issue. How can that be? Well, this is what he said:<br><br>Although DBS is listed in SGX, the majority shareholder is still Temasek(maybe even together with GIC). Since Temasek is controlled by the govt, doesn't it make sense that employees working for DBS are working for the govt? If that is correct, then DBS employees are also a form of civil servants.<br><br>If this is correct, then Sembcorp, Keppel, Singtel, etc... all the mega companies' employees are all considered a form of sivil servants right?
