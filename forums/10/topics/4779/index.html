None of these<br>&gt;countries is today paying even the interest on<br>&gt;its remaining debts to the United States.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956,<br>&gt;it was the Americans who propped it up, and their<br>&gt;reward was to be insulted and swindled on the<br>&gt;streets of Paris.

This spring,<br>&gt;59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.<br>&gt;Nobody helped.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped<br>&gt;billions of dollars into discouraged countries.<br>&gt;Now newspapers in those countries are writing<br>&gt;about the decadent, warmongering Americans.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I'd like to see just one of those countries that<br>&gt;is gloating over the erosion of the United States<br>&gt;dollar build its own airplane. Does any other<br>&gt;country in the world have a plane to equal the<br>&gt;Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or<br>&gt;the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly<br>&gt;them? Why do all the International lines except<br>&gt;Russia fly American Planes?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Why does no other land on earth even consider<br>&gt;putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk<br>&gt;about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.<br>&gt;You talk about German technocracy, and you get<br>&gt;automobiles. You talk about American technocracy,<br>&gt;and you find men on the moon - not once, but several<br>&gt;times - and safely home again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;You talk about scandals, and the Americans put<br>&gt;theirs right in the store window for everybody to look<br>&gt;at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and<br>&gt;hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them,<br>&gt;unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting<br>&gt;American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When the railways of France, Germany and India were<br>&gt;breaking down through age, it was the Americans who<br>&gt;rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the<br>&gt;New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old<br>&gt;caboose. Both are still broke.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I can name you 5000 times when the Americans<br>&gt;raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can<br>&gt;you name me even one time when someone else<br>&gt;raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think<br>&gt;there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one<br>&gt;Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them<br>&gt;get kicked around. They will come out of this thing<br>&gt;with their flag high. And when they do, they are<br>&gt;entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are<br>&gt;gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada<br>&gt;is not one of those."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Stand proud, America!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This is one of the best editorials that I have<br>&gt;ever read regarding the United States.

So a war is going to happen soon.<br><br>remember the news say there will be series of attack on america soil, if i were them i will take a break until things start to calm down when sercurity measure have been losen to start another strike.</div>

You beast. You unspeakable bastard.<br><br>What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our<br>World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?

You just damned your cause.<br><br>Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve.<br><br>Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together.<br><br>Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome<br>family, a family rent by racial, social, political and class<br>division, but a family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of<br>expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a<br>singer's revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse.<br>We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and<br>material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with<br>a certain sense of blithe entitlement.<br><br>We are fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and<br>compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to do it. And<br>we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers<br>in a just and loving God.<br><br>Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us<br>weak.<br><br>You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that<br>cannot be measured by arsenals.<br><br>IN PAIN<br><br>Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're<br>still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still<br>working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect<br>from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a<br>Tom Clancy novel.<br><br>Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable<br>final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst<br>acts of terrorism in the history of the United States and, probably,<br>the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been<br>bloodied before.<br><br>But there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making<br>us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the<br>last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us<br>such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our<br>outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level of<br>barbarism, we will bear any<br>suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.<br><br>I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as<br>you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to<br>tremble with dread of the future.<br><br>In the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation,<br>fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen<br>and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will<br>be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms.<br>We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But<br>determined, too. Unimaginably determined.<br><br>THE STEEL IN US<br><br>You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect<br>of our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us<br>well. On this day, the family's bickering is put on hold.<br><br>As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as<br>Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish.<br><br>So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me<br>that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If<br>that's the case, consider the message received. And take this message<br>in exchange:<br><br>You don't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You<br>don't know what you just started.<br><br>But you're about to learn.<br></div>
