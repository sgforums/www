On paper, our CPF money is still there. One can believe that it is merely paper numbers and PAP has "swallowed" the real monies, but for that matter, the accounts of any country are on paper.<br><br>Ask the US President where are the FED reserves and they will probably show you their budget statement rather than take you on a tour around FED.<br><br>People who retire are still drawing their CPF monies and see for themselves that it went into their POSB or UOB accounts.<br><br>But I do agree that transparency can be improved and more checks are necessary.<br><br>Regards</div>

Indeed, the CLOAKS will shield your ability to see the real objective.<br>It is a pity that a simple desire to help those who will be in need one day has been BLOWN so much out of proportion.
