              <p>FamiLee is still a stumbling block to the remaking of Sinkapore. Old ministers sits comfortablely at their throne, while they summon so-called new junior ministers to try and change the country for the better.</p>
              <p>Everywhere you go, Gov-Linked companies with minister cronies also sitting comfortably on the board of directors doing nothing and having absolutely no clue on how to benefit the country, instead they can only think of ways to fatten their own pockets by cutting costs, hiring cheap foreigners, allowing more in to boast up the revenue of GLCs companies.</p>
              <p>A structurally change will have to boot out all these incompetent cronies fools, break up GLCs and have more companies moving fast and change their direction fast in churning out creative and sustainable products and hiring locals for the jobs.</p>
              <p>Ministers have to be changed and people have to change their mindset of working for MNCs as these will dwindle in the coming years.</p>
              <p>Too much pain for everyone and having top uniformed people with a yesman attitude will be frowned upon by anyone anyway.</p>
              <p>FamiLee will view them as imcompetent if they do not grow the GDP and the man in the streets will scold them for enriching themselves without idea on how to really improve the lives of locals.</p>
              <p>It is really not a question of having credentials for the job but really about having passion to convince the people about putting their trust in the hands of a person that will lead all to a better future, but first pain before pleasure which turns off every single Sinkaporean from ministers to commoners whose attitudes have always been," You die, Your Business!."</p>

              <p>My dear friends,<br><br>Hope you all are well and in high spirits.<br><br>I believe many of you like me have been observing the Singapore’s General Election’s buzz of ruling government and the opposition parties. It is getting louder and louder day after day.<br><br>Every five years when election season starts, I recalled my father’s advice to me when I was a young boy and he said “ Son you should never bet on donkey in horse racing”.<br><br>Cicero ever said “History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time; it illumines reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance in daily life and brings us tidings of antiquity.<br><br>In just 46 years, a fishing village has turned into one of the Four Asian Tigers. The success of the PAP, the world's longest-governing elected political party, is based on meritocracy, incorruptibility and effective policies.<br><br> Important to understanding Singapore's meritocracy is political recruitment which has been refined for half a century. Compensation for the high flyers means elected officials and top civil servants are probably the highest paid in the world.<br><br>The realistic justification is that you can retain outstanding persons. Comprehensive and effective anti-corruption measures combined with high pay means Singapore is one of the most corruption free governments in the world.<br><br>Last couple of weeks PAP has introduced new recruitments and many new candidates and I had the time to watch the first batch on 21st March 2011 by PAP’s 2nd Asst. Sec-Gen Teo Chee Hean introduces party’s new candidates for upcoming General Election.<br><br>PAP’s new candidate Desmond Choo said that he wants to ensure the education for every Singaporean child in Singapore regardless of their family’s financial status. Because he knows education is one of the most powerful weapons against poverty and conflict and he also reaffirmed the need for strong investments in education to provide citizens with greater opportunities for personal and collective advancement.<br><br>PAP’s new candidate Ong Ye Kung emphasized on Singapore’s Free Trade Agreements and continues to work hard to established close relationship, trust, synergy with the world’s top economy for mutual benefits in Asia and beyond to remains relevant to the global economy.<br><br>PAP’s new candidate Dr Janil Puthucheary tried to explained to his fellow Singaporeans that why did he decided to be the member of this unique and precious political system. After traveling and living in so many countries finally he has found his best home ever is in Singapore and became the active member of this multicultural and meritocratic system.<br>Because he knows about Singapore’s multiculturalism’s and meritocracy’s success stories and to ensure Singaporean that religion is not exploited by politicians to serve their political agenda.<br><br>People like Dr. Janil, Mr. Ong Ye Kung and Mr. Desmond Choo do not need to come to politics they have already achieved the highest in lives and living their happy lives. But they have left their happy lives and came out from their comfort zone and being committed to give something to their communities.<br><br>However, when I have watched the opposition parties’ political agenda in compare to PAP’s political agenda I became very disappointed because the workers, the reformer, the solidarity, the democrats, the democratic alliance are still with all those old cheap shot 19th century’s political agenda that are applicable for under developed and developing countries in Asia &amp; Africa but not for Singapore where as the PAP government is talking about development of new strategies and new structures as countries rush to compete in an increasingly globalized arena to stay relevant to the world’s top economy.<br><br>I think my father was right as he said to me that if I put the donkey in the horse race then that donkey will never reach the destination that I desire.<br><br>So, my dear friend possibly and enthusiastically we can pregnant the opposition leaders with our valuable votes but then we have to endure the consequences of that miscarriage in an early pregnancy.<br><br>Which is why the Singapore’s opposition parties said that “ Not Ready To Lead For Now ” published in the Singapore newspaper. Please refer to the 24th March 2011 “My Paper published by Kenny Chee”.<br><br>Wish you all happy voting but please vote wisely.<br><br>With best regards<br>Jugani</p>

              <p>Hi Jugani,</p>
              <p>I am not sure if you are from one of the elite that the government groomed and you wrote beautifully.</p>
              <p>You believe that voting the most intelligent and educated person to govern is a safe bet and that that PAP has proven it through time. Unfortuately, the world has become too complicated and the little island we lives are likewise too much for just 'intelligent' to guarantee success.</p>
              <p>Singapore need compassion. A men serve no one but himself if he has a no heart to serve. Hence, he serve the money and material that feed to him. He lost his soul.</p>
              <p>I was one called to be in service. BUT I rejected. I was not ready because I dont have yet the urge to serve. I am too young than to comprehend what politic and serving is.</p>
              <p>Singapore need diversity now. There are ready pool of 'talents', like us who has the experience, EQ and streetwiseness to serve the nation. We are not the elite and sometime, cannot even spell and speak correct English, which many Singaporean may judge as pre-requisite for elite.</p>
              <p>The next leadership call for more delicated quality..compassion, grace, exposure to the world, experience and loyalty to the people of Singapore. When I go for vote, I go for these quality. NOT those you mentioned in your article.</p>
              <p>We may disagree but after living so many years overseas, I love the country and sadden the people are divided by PAP rule.</p>
