              <p>I agree with you, Singapore's foreign talent policy is killing off our own talents. Living overseas for 6 years has also taught me about the foreign policies of that country. They have a biased protectionism that allocates tonnes of jobs to Citizens, then PRs and finally foreign skilled workers. This 3 tier approach is what we need.</p>

              <p><br>Not sure u get the figure right?  I recall the number of votes is around 60 %.  But if u argue on 37% vote for PAP.  Then I can agree in a way.  (out of the 60%, 66% vote for PAP which sum up to around 37%)  But honestly SG is too small for have a large different in different ward thus even all are contested, the number of % won't change too much.  Not to disappointed u guys here, i had come across a breakdown for this G.E in some other forum and I think i tend to agree with it.  It go this way</p>
              <p>20% - Civil servants or plp who work in govt link companies</p>
              <p>15% - Direct family for those plp on top</p>
              <p>15% - New Citizens</p>
              <p>10% - traditional PAP supporter (Elites etc)</p>
              <p>If u work this out, PAP already have 60% votes</p>
              <p>Let assume 30% are strong opp supporter, then it left only 10% swing vote which most will vote PAP due to goodies/fear etc.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>My dear friends, <br><br>Hope you all are well and in high spirits.<br><br>I believe many of you like me have been observing the Singapore’s General Election’s buzz of ruling government and the opposition parties. It is getting louder and louder day after day.<br><br>Every five years when election season starts, I recalled my father’s advice to me when I was a young boy and he said “ Son you should never bet on donkey in horse racing”. <br><br>Cicero ever said “History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time; it illumines reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance in daily life and brings us tidings of antiquity.<br><br>In just 46 years, a fishing village has turned into one of the Four Asian Tigers. The success of the PAP, the world's longest-governing elected political party, is based on meritocracy, incorruptibility and effective policies.<br><br> Important to understanding Singapore's meritocracy is political recruitment which has been refined for half a century. Compensation for the high flyers means elected officials and top civil servants are probably the highest paid in the world. <br><br>The realistic justification is that you can retain outstanding persons. Comprehensive and effective anti-corruption measures combined with high pay means Singapore is one of the most corruption free governments in the world.<br><br>Last couple of weeks PAP has introduced new recruitments and many new candidates and I had the time to watch the first batch on 21st March 2011 by PAP’s 2nd Asst. Sec-Gen Teo Chee Hean introduces party’s new candidates for upcoming General Election. <br><br>PAP’s new candidate Desmond Choo said that he wants to ensure the education for every Singaporean child in Singapore regardless of their family’s financial status. Because he knows education is one of the most powerful weapons against poverty and conflict and he also reaffirmed the need for strong investments in education to provide citizens with greater opportunities for personal and collective advancement. <br><br>PAP’s new candidate Ong Ye Kung emphasized on Singapore’s Free Trade Agreements and continues to work hard to established close relationship, trust, synergy with the world’s top economy for mutual benefits in Asia and beyond to remains relevant to the global economy. <br><br>PAP’s new candidate Dr Janil Puthucheary tried to explained to his fellow Singaporeans that why did he decided to be the member of this unique and precious political system. After traveling and living in so many countries finally he has found his best home ever is in Singapore and became the active member of this multicultural and meritocratic system. <br>Because he knows about Singapore’s multiculturalism’s and meritocracy’s success stories and to ensure Singaporean that religion is not exploited by politicians to serve their political agenda.<br><br>People like Dr. Janil, Mr. Ong Ye Kung and Mr. Desmond Choo do not need to come to politics they have already achieved the highest in lives and living their happy lives. But they have left their happy lives and came out from their comfort zone and being committed to give something to their communities.<br><br>However, when I have watched the opposition parties’ political agenda in compare to PAP’s political agenda I became very disappointed because the workers, the reformer, the solidarity, the democrats, the democratic alliance are still with all those old cheap shot 19th century’s political agenda that are applicable for under developed and developing countries in Asia &amp; Africa but not for Singapore where as the PAP government is talking about development of new strategies and new structures as countries rush to compete in an increasingly globalized arena to stay relevant to the world’s top economy. <br><br>I think my father was right as he said to me that if I put the donkey in the horse race then that donkey will never reach the destination that I desire.<br><br>So, my dear friend possibly and enthusiastically we can pregnant the opposition leaders with our valuable votes but then we have to endure the consequences of that miscarriage in an early pregnancy.<br><br>Which is why the Singapore’s opposition parties said that “ Not Ready To Lead For Now ” published in the Singapore newspaper. Please refer to the 24th March 2011 “My Paper published by Kenny Chee”.<br><br>Wish you all happy voting but please vote wisely. <br><br>With best regards <br>Jugani</p></div>

              <p>As one of the longest serving govt in the world, certainly PAP are well equipped, after working 5 years in my family 17 years of pub business, I am also well equipped with the running of business, the cost and the management of it. And if I pay my pub managers $10k per month/$120,000 per year, they will not be so stupid to be sell liquors behind me for just a few hundreds buck, moreover if they perform well, able to make more money, their paid will further increase and be rewarded. How they do it, it all depend on them, be it a cunning way or slaughtering someone way of making a living, I dun really care much. This is business. And this is what singapore govt is all about, they rule this place like running a business, pay ministers damn high to avoid corruption, how they tax and mistreat the locals, that is not the issue, as long as what they did justify their paid and the coffer of this country, just do it.</p>
              <p>When PAP candidates make their round by visiting heartlander, the grass root leaders will come to my tembling house and inform us of these group coming, ask us to wait outside, make our house presentable, and we, including most of our neighbourhood waited for half and hour, pretty well dressed and asked our maid to clean up, I also waited and call my managers to hold on to the day open of pubs till i finish with the PAP visit, and one of my neighbour lady, who is a housewife was so mad of the waiting because her soup is cooking and need to keep a watch on it, and another older gentleman also need to go for an appointment but hold back just for the PAP candidates visit, half hour gone, only the grassroot leaders keep asking us to clean up this and that, we get fed up, move our car out, close our gates, inform our maid not to go out, release our dogs, the housewife slammed her door, go back to cooking and the old man zoom off with his new BMW 7 series, shut all gates. Now, my question here is, if you are visiting us, please be puntual, PAP candidates needs to know that we did not invite you, but of course you are welcome to our house, but you are an uninvited guest. And your grassroot leaders and gangs should be doing problem solving and going around to gather feeback instead of becoming a usher and informal of your visit, what a waste!</p>
