              <p>That exactly the reason for not fighting PRC, if you study history, Taiwanese are interlinked with PRC in many ways, either through ancertory or marriages now. Indeed, non of Taiwanese have no relatives or friends in PRCs. What are they defending for? communists?</p>
              <p>If there is either an invasion by PRCs, it probably the American that defends Taiwan.</p>
              <p>As many Taiwanes believe, PRC will NEVER invade Taiwan unless PRC again fall into the hand of dictatorial governing OR Taiwan go independent which means it changes its name to Taiwan nation instead contimue ROC</p>

              <p>yes i study history of taiwan. that why i am supporter for taiwan to remain independence from PRC. before 1949 they are just party different.</p>
              <p>sorry bro i dont undertand what you trying to say about taiwanese not willing to defend against mainland china. everyone has a reason to defend their own country. lacking a reason , might be a good reason to leave the country altogether coz you cannot find a reason to convince yourself worth dying for your country.</p>
              <p>my reason is simple. I will die fighting for my family so that they had a chance to live if singapore is being invaded. not for PM, MP, governor or whatever shit. just for my family and kids!,</p>

              <p>actually I believe that the old Lee might use the military or the police in an event that the ruling party lose control to an unknown opposition in a freak election. In that event, I don't think they need the influence of the ex military or police mp, there are so many ways to mobilize the required forces, in the name of national stability.</p>
              <p>Hope that will not happen.</p>
              <p>I think the requirement that the generals and police chief have to resign, and get elected is a necessary, and a good safeguard. Besides, it is the choice of the person to decide if he would join the PAP or the opposition.</p>
              <p>Imagine we have an ex general in the opposition camp trying to use his influence in the army to go against the government, hmm....that is not very desirable also.</p>

A media should play impt role in shaping the mindset of singaporeans.  the mainstream media focus beauty show, talent show to brainwash the youngster no wonder lotsa ppl fear for the future of singaporeans.</p>

              <p>yes i study history of taiwan. that why i am supporter for taiwan to remain independence from PRC. before 1949 they are just party different.</p>
              <p>sorry bro i dont undertand what you trying to say about taiwanese not willing to defend against mainland china. everyone has a reason to defend their own country. lacking a reason , might be a good reason to leave the country altogether coz you cannot find a reason to convince yourself worth dying for your country.</p>
              <p>my reason is simple. I will die fighting for my family so that they had a chance to live if singapore is being invaded. not for PM, MP, governor or whatever shit. just for my family and kids!,</p>
