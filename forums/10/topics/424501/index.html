              <p>I do not support top military and police brass to join politics. We have to separate the role of politicians and military  personnel separate. Currently we already have lui tuck yew, Teo chee hean, george yeo, LHL all holiding ministerial position. That is already a very high % in the whole ministerial cabintet. Are we going to be rule by military regime? what kind of political path are we persueing?</p>
              <p>It also seem like the there is close behind the door relationship between the PAP and military and police topmen. it has become the breeding ground for the future leaders of Singapore too.

              <p>well it seem most ppl dont really know the difference between PAP and country.</p>
              <p>we take pledge to protect not any political parties in times of crisis. If the there is influx of top military and policemen into the political scene, we might not be able to see this difference much clearer. maybe we are leaning towards the path of military regime.</p>

              <p>To an extent, ex military leaders will have influence on some people in the military, same as ex civil servants, ex school principals, ex unionists, ex CEO ...... this is inevitable. But after taking off their uniforms, can the military leaders still get the military to support him, or the students to support the principals, or the civil servants to support their former head of department, or the ex union head to mobilize the workers to walk the street, can the CEO mobilize the wealth of his previous company for his own political agenda? the answer is NO.</p>
              <p>You also argue that an ex military leader could run the country like an army, or an ex school principal think all citizens are their students, or an ex CEO's interest is to make money for the country with little regards for the people....there are many possibilities.</p>
              <p>But for the former chief of Navy to become our defence minister, it is better for than any other who does not have any experience run a part of a total armed forces to run our national defence agency, and look after our soldiers!</p>
              <p>There is never a perfect leader!</p>
              <p>The worst that can happen is for a politician to run the country just for political reason</p>
