Send a fairly well written letter praising some ministers or government policies, it will most likely be published.<br><br>I have written occasional letters to the Straits Times on topics ranging from "Practical Efficiency and Productivity", "Neglect of technical excellence" and "Accountability and Transparency of Government" which were published.<br><br>Previously one of my letters which was written to congratulate ex-PM Goh Chok Tong on his CPF top-up for citizens was published.<br><br>To verify whether the ST would reject well considered letters critical of government policies or shortcomings, I had sent some such letters to ST with copies posted to this and youngpap forums with my prediction that letters concerning government policy errors or shortcomings would be turned down and true enough they were turned down.<br><br>For example my letters suggesting revisions of the constitution and other similar letters were rejected as predicted in my posting as some forumers could have remembered.<br><br>There was one letter which was sent to forums with my prediction as well that it would be turned down because it was too critical of government conservation policies which were too outdated and it was as predicted turned down. In it I criticized URA for failure to provide fair compensation for those affected by government conservation policy on preservation of historic buildings.<br><br>The above-stated letter which was pre-posted to this forum was finally published after my questioning the editor for lack of publishing letters of social impact to society so he had no choice but finally published it. Lately the URA has decided to change certain laws relating to compensation of property affected by preservations.<br><br>However my letters such as "Proposal to revamp the constitution" and "20 major government policy errors" were rejected.<br><br>I did not feel disappointed with the rejection of my letters. I only feel disappointed with the fact that the whole society is currying favors with the ruling party from journalists to letter writers who got their letters published because such letters were cleverly written with complements to the power that be.<br><br>It is a shame we have reached this despicable standard of government.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uh...... robert's not saying <strong>he</strong> should get more air time - he's talking about how publicity given to issues in our leading paper does not accurately reflect public sentiment.. and it appears that any issues or opinions deemed politically "undesirable" would mysteriously get less coverage, while a less popular opinion would get more coverage.. in other words, it acts someone's mouthpiece, representing the views of  (and for the benefit of ) a certain body or group of people instead of the views of  (and for the benefit of )  the masses.  With this in mind, suddenly the title "The Straits Times" seems a rather lofty, even misleading title, no?<br><br>On the issue of "animal rights", let's be realistic.  If flawed policies which lack humanity and compassion towards our own fellow human beings and/or don't benefit its purported target group are not even allowed to be discussed openly in the mass media for whatever reasons, how can we expect any better for issues pertaining to our furry friends?  Agreed?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may comment abit....<br><br>I think there are 2 things here, the HDB pricing, and newspaper censorship.<br><br>1. HDB Pricing.<br><br>I actually dont really get your point, about government making double charges and indirectly tax the people, and falsely saying they give subsidy.<br><br>I get the point that if government can lower HDB prices, it can help people's financial burden. This I understand. It makes sense, and I think it will help alot of people because housing cost is one of people's biggest chunk of spending.<br><br>But.....lets get back to the previous point....<br><br>See, what I dont understand is this.....<br><br>Lets just imagine abit.....Hong Kong....Tokyo......New York.....<br><br>They all have high property prices, correct? I think more extreme than Singapore in fact.<br><br>Singapore is also like those cities loh.......Singapore is just a small island, and many people, and it is a developed economy, quite rich, so, naturally, the housing cost is very high. This is just natural condition.<br><br>Now I read your concept of 'already buying land with peoples money' and therefore HDB should not apply charges again, or it will be double-charging and a form of indirect tax and make people go into hardship with the high property price.<br><br>This kind of concept seem abit illogical to me loh.....<br><br>All land is actually government owned or state owned....all over the world......but people can buy land, either from government owned, or organization owned, or developer owned, or another seller owned. Is this correct? All over the world is like this, right?<br><br>Where got such a thing.....that the land is a 'shared' commodity, like in some socialist or communist concept, and that so therefore the government should not apply charges when selling land to the customers, because the customers are the common people who own the land or already paid taxes to the country.<br><br>Do you get what I mean.....<br><br>HDB I think is actually a very useful organization. What is the role of HDB actually. It stands for Housing Development Board. They are a Developer. It is actually already serving some kind of socialist concept because they build mass apartments for the common people at a lower price than private developers who charge higher price for private properties.<br><br>But seem like your idea, is that they should go even more socialist a bit. But I seem to not get your point on this. How do you think they should do this? Because the natural condition of Singapore is such, like Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York, it is a natural condition that the land prices is high, and it is not because of government intervention or crafting that made this condition. In fact I think government is very far-sighted by making HDB, to try crafting or interventing in the opposite direction, that is to help the common people cope with this high prices.<br><br>Thank you, I hope you get what I mean.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2. Newspaper censorship.<br><br>For me this point is nothing much to say loh.....<br><br>It is obvious, to people here, and even to people abroad, that ST is a government newspaper.<br><br>Perhaps, with more appreciation of this fact, a different expectation will come.<br><br>With a different expectation, less frustration and disappointment will arise.<br><br>That is all I can say loh.....<br><br>You cannot write something to ST...and then expect a condition whereby, say, a condition existing here in internet forums....or a condition existing in overseas independent newspapers and publications....<br><br>If I may comment abit further on a broader issue...about strong government grip on information.<br><br>It is actually not all negative.<br><br>For instance SARS control, race-relations control, crime control, disemminating information, political stability, etc.<br><br>I see that actually strong information control can be positive. I truly believe in this.<br><br>But, as much as a free press has its good and bad, a controlled press also has its good and bad.<br><br>So it is also true some negative aspect also exist....like u say, very hard to express  any ideas or opinions which may be deemed critical towards government.<br><br>To me I think, an awareness of this controlled press, should be more recognized and registered, and people will be less disappointed that way.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>
