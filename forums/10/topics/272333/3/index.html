Even if you are not a bootlicker as you seem to be and should you vote for me it will still not be enough as the ruling party MPs will still stonewall any good representation and outvote me and what I said will be hot air any way. So to everyone I am asking all to vote sufficient opposition or independent candidate MPs to produce a one-third strength to make their number felt.</div>
