                                  SINGAPORE plans to pump in more than $1 billion into innovation and
                                  entrepreneurship. This may not mean much to most Singaporeans but I see
                                  this as another example of the Government's foresight. I cannot but say
                                  to Singaporeans: 'You are really blessed.'</p>
              <p>Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao wants to learn from Singapore's
                                  housing experience after visiting Toa Payoh. Mr Ma Ying-jeou, after
                                  winning the recent Taiwanese presidential election, says his country
                                  must learn from Singapore's clean and efficient Government. Several
                                  Arab countries also want to learn from Singapore's success.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should feel proud of these compliments.</p>
              <p>Singapore's prosperity and racial harmony are the result of the
                                  hard work of Singaporeans. Singapore has achieved such impressive
                                  results today because of the leadership of a far-sighted and
                                  hardworking Government.</p>
              <p>Just as the Chinese had the good fortune to have Deng
                                  Xiaoping, Singaporeans are blessed to have Lee Kuan Yew. Singaporeans
                                  should be moved by their veteran leaders' relentless efforts for the
                                  sake of the country.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans do not have to worry about volatile prices as
                                  they have NTUC FairPrice supermarkets to stabilise prices. They do not
                                  have to worry about having a roof over their heads as the Government
                                  provides affordable housing. They do not have to worry about crowded
                                  transport as the Government has planned for current and future
                                  transport needs.</p>
              <p> Their hearts can also be at ease over the issue of employment as the
                                  Government is looking into future job opportunities. There are no
                                  worries about basic necessities.</p>
              <p>Good traditions and experiences should be passed down to the
                                  next generations, and the Singapore Government has been doing so.</p>
              <p>I hope Singaporeans can pass on the pioneering spirit of
                                  their forefathers together with the material wealth to successive
                                  generations.</p>

              <p>you want to criticize them, make sure you know a little bit about them. Don't know about LKY, but LHL cannot converse fluently in Mandarin? check out where he studied.</p>
              <p>LKY with his team got Singapore independent from the Brit in 1967, Australia ended any British role in the government of the Australian States, and judicial appeals to the UK Privy Council on in 1986. GCT canned the yankee's backside against the direct appeal from the president of the USA, Clinton; LHL visited Taiwan resulted in the cancellation of many official visits from PRC. Talk about having balls, you haven't seen one yet.  hehehe</p>

              <p><br>please don't ask me to listen to martyn, just give a summary of what Zahari said. Was it Zahari who kicked out the Brit, but LKY started a coup and kick out Zahari and get credit for the independence of Singapore from the Brit?</p>

              <p>Personally i think its alright to praise Singapore, but i think the censors should be more open in accepting criticism from foreigners. The Complain Choir Project is quite harmless but the govt had to ban them.</p>
              <p>We dont want to live in a "make believe world" where we hear praises and good news everyday right? We also dont want biased politlcal coverage of our neighbours to make ourselves look better do we?</p>
              <p>For those who think The Complain Choir project are "intefering" with Singapore politics should agree that "praises" by foreigners are interferring too.</p>
