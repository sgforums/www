              <p>Hi forum,</p>
              <p>I read news of a country which I have to say is not the pore ;)</p>

              <p>In this world, there are many many other respectable or even more respectable experts or organisations that may offer DIFFERING or OPPOSITE views , comments or opinions and stand.</p>
              <p>What happens if the news only report quoting from the view of 1 of the many respectable people or organisations in the world?</p>
              <p>What is the CREDIBILITY of such news?</p>
              <p>How can YOUTHS and NAIVE ones, which can be the majority, be educated to learn and understand how to comprehend the news? How can PLURALITY of views be heard and presented to the public instead of spoonfeeding only 1 aspect of the possible views in the world?</p>
              <p>When such news is repeatedly broadcast to NAIVE people, they may think and accept the views spoonfed to them as the only view in the world or that the view is the only Truth and no other options exist or there is no need to find out what other forms of truth exist in the world. Practice makes perfect. When one-sided 'truth' is repeated over and over, Naive people may take that as the Truth and whole truth and nothing else but the truth. Remember , the best IQ person's archiles tendon is still his psychology.</p>
              <p>How can the Naive and Young ones be Enlightened to lead them out of Darkness and IGNORANCE?</p>

              <p>i'm afraid you sounded a bit ambiguous but i gather you wanted to
              know how we can prevent ourselves from becoming one-dimensional
              thinking.</p>
              <p>you already know part of the answer, i.e. open
              ourselves to various sources of viewpoint. with the internet we can
              have free and limitless access of info.</p>
              <p>the other part of
              the answer is to think and to have an open mind. the pluarity of views
              will show up the pros and cons and different shades of any issues or
              things we would then be able to consider them and subsequently make our
              own independent choices. but then do remember to keep our mind open for
              changes for things don't remain unchange forever!</p>

              <p>I am shocked to discover that a small country named ..a.. is ranked so lowly on the chart of Press Freedom which means the level of control on the state media.</p>

              <p>On surface, it looks like a red shiny apple.</p>

              <p>State propaganda media should not try to act as if they are fair and balanced.</p>
              <p>That is a lie.</p>
              <p>Each country should have state propaganda media to pread state propaganda.</p>
              <p>But there should be independent media industry as well, or else all one sided biased state propaganda.</p>
              <p>Singapore mainstream media is all state propaganda.</p>
