            <div class='col-md body'>From Lalaland blog: http://lalaland9.wordpress.com/<br><br>Hooligan politics by COWARDS exploiting children<strong><span class="large"></span><br><br>Now, I am a supporter of the opposition as a whole but I detest hooliganism, even in politics. In fact, especially in politics. Call me wet behind the ears but I do believe that in human interaction there must be respect, civility and maturity.<br><br>And most of all, I detest and abhor totally people who exploit children.<br><br>So, what am I talking about?<br><br>According to theonlinecitizen, some people paid 3 boys (who look like Malay boys to me, by the way) $20 to distribute anti-WP leaflets at the restaurant where the WP was holding its 50th Anniversary dinner celebrations.<br><br>It makes my blood boil just reading about it.<br><br>According to toc, the boys themselves were unsure who the person who paid them for the task was. Why would anyone use Â– yes, the word is USE! Â– 3 innocent boys to do their dirty work?<br><br>Cowards is what IÂ’d call them. Hooligans is what they are. Cowards who do not have the courage to do the dirty work themselves. Pathetic.<br><br>The word is that the person or persons involved are SDP supporters from Sammyboy forum. If it is true, I wonÂ’t be surprised. I used to support them before but now, I think they are just full of crap. This incident coincides with the recent unhappiness in the SDP over some remarks which the WPÂ’s leaders made apparently. (Go look at their website yourself. I am not going to provide a link to the crap they dish out.)<br><br>I mean, come on. So what if you donÂ’t like the remarks? Do every opposition have to agree with each other? If this is the reason for trying to disrupt the WPÂ’s 50th anniversary dinner, then it shows the dire lack of maturity on the part of the SDP and their supporters.<br><br>If you want to sully the name of fellow opposition party, then come out into the open and do it yourselves! Why involve 3 innocent boys Â– and exploiting their innocence? Worse, pay them only $20! Utterly pathetic.<br><br>I canÂ’t stand people who exploit kids. Thus for any politician or political party to do so is just beyond imagination!!!!!!<br><br>And the SDP pretends to fight for peopleÂ’s rights? Sheeeesssh!<br><br>The WP, to their credit, has taken this in their stride apparently. They have not made any big hoo ha over this. There is no response on their website about this. And I think this is the best thing to do. You donÂ’t give the hooligans the attention they are so pathetically trying to get.<br><br>Kudos to the WP! They are more sensible than some wayang party like the SDP going around to pander to the international audience.<br><br>I spit on those who exploited those 3 boys.<br><br>If you want to play uncouth, dirty gangster, hooligan politics, then come out and do it yourself. The SDP should come out and clarify if it is really their supporters or even themselves who did this dishonourable, cowardly act.<br><br>Leave our kids alone!<br><br>IDIOTS!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We must recall Chee and John Tan being disappointed with WP when IBA was here. In fact they were so disappointed that they voiced it through SDP's website. They felt hurt and undermined by Sylvia Lim's comments. They must have felt that WP as an opposition party had "sided" with PAP, the supposed "common enemy". SDP must have come to realise that if they cannot win the ardent PAP supporters, they must nessarily win over other opposition supporters and force them to make a stand, to get them disillusioned with the alternative voices in parliament and support his cause. There is no better time than now as he is keeping up with his protests and he is starting to solicit for funds from the public.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We notice that of late, the "moderates" are gaining increased publicity from the media. From the built up to WP's 50th year anniversary celebrations, to the event itself and to todays report that PAP and opposition hold hands to upgrade Potong Pasir and Hougang facilities, enabling the constituencies to be more elderly friendly. Not only SDP wants us to make a stand, i suppose the government wants us to do that as well.<br><br>Do we want to support SDP's impatience, outright Anti-PAP sentiments and without thought of consequences.<br><br>or<br><br>follow the other 2 opposition parties and do it slowly but for the sake Singaporeans, not necessarily requiring the downfall of PAP in the near future or even at all ?</div>
