In Singapore, the Elections Department is under the purview of the Prime MinisterÂ’s Office.<br><br>Because it conducts its business largely away from public scrutiny, many are as convinced of its impartiality as they would be the act of a ventriloquist over the radio.<br><br>For instance, the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee redraws the boundaries and then submits its report to the cabinet for approval.<br><br>The opposition and the public are not consulted, and the report bypasses parliament. Changes are announced only shortly before the elections. As a result, constituencies that showed strong support for the opposition party have undergone major surgery. These areas have either been redistributed to other PAP strongholds or wholly absorbed into GRCs.<br><br>Violations of the Parliamentary Elections Act (PEA) by the PAP are never acted upon. In the 1997 elections, several PAP ministers entered polling stations, which they clearly had no authority to do.<br><br>Under the PEA, no unauthorised persons are allowed to loiter within 200 meters of any voting centre.<br><br>Yet election officials did not attempt to enforce the rule. Worse, the Attorney General declined to prosecute, saying that the ministers were inside the polling centreÂ—as opposed to loitering on the outsideÂ—and, hence, not in breach of any regulation.<br><br>Complaints and reports about ballot papers being folded together (which should be impossible, because each voter is required to fold his or her voting paper and place it individually into the boxes), the number of ballot papers exceeding the number of registered voters, ballots being sealed in the boxes before polling commenced, ballot boxes not being sealed in the presence of opposition candidates and their agents, and ballot boxes taken to centres outside of the constituency for counting all went unheeded...<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/elections.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/elections.html</a></div>

However what i was trying to point out is that SDP launched an offensive against WP through their website and so did others.<br><br>There is no proof that they were behind the distribution of flyers. Anybody could have done it. SDP is equally capable of doing it and i backed up this statement with my arguments in the subsequent threads. I have provided reasons on why they might have done it and how they could have benefitted from it. However, without any proof, that may not be true as the possibities are endless.
