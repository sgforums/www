There were also conspiracy theories started by WP members and supporters in cyberspace alleging that I am a ISD agent / PAP mole / Â“ardent SDP supporter.Â”<br><br>Instead of reflecting why there is a backlash against them, it is disappointing that WP chose to point their fingers at others and started a vicious smear campaign targetting the SDP.<br><br>Let me set the record straight once and for all:<br><br>1. I am neither a PAP member/supporter or a SDP member/supporter though I'm a sympathizer of Dr Chee. In fact, I was a WP supporter who voted for them in GE 1997 at Cheng San GRC. I was full of respect and admiration for the Old Guard of WP like Mr JBJ, Francis Seow and Tang Liang Hong who were truly qualified opposition leaders unlike the present WP.<br><br>2. I set up this blog entirely on my own accord and not under the orders or directions from anybody or political party. There was a similar blog set up by an ordinary citizen like me at www.wayangparty.blogspot.com. Same name but different address, is this a mere coincidence ?<br><br>3. The sole aim of this blog is to serve as a watchdog to the WP in order to exert pressure on them to be more proactive and vocal in fighting for the rights of Singaporeans instead of parroting the usual PAP rhetoric to attack a fellow opposition leader. It is not meant to sow discord within the opposition camp as suggested by some WP members who have been trying desperately hard to divert attention from the real agenda behind this blog.<br><br>I would like to express my deepest apologies to Dr Chee and the SDP for having implicate them in my actions. I shall assume full responsibility for this blog.<br><br>To all those disgruntled WP members and supporters out there, please vent your frustrations and anger on me if you must, but please leave SDP alone.<br><br>SDP itself has already made clarifications on their website:<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/yourletters10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/yourletters10.html </a><br><br>I sincerely hope WP leaders, members and supporters can be humble and graceful enough to accept constructive criticisms from ordinary citizens like me, be a gentleman and let matter rest instead of continuing to attack the SDP.<br><br></div>
