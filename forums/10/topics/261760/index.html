            <div class='col-md body'>Further more, SCV's answer from day one is: the cost of acquiring the program has increased and cable tv operators around the world has routinely increased subscription rates"<br><br>Well, listen here SCV, my questions are:<br><br>a. cost increase from what?  you guys are buying at higher price?  Whatever your purchasing people are doing?  No negotiation power?  Everytime you purchase something, you want to keep the costs down and if you keep having to buy programs at a higher rates - then jolly well look at how you can lowe them or keep them at bay - either your purchasing people are not doing a good job &amp; should be sacked or your marketing / planning people ought to be shot.  Look at working with ESPN or major cable TV people to buy programs in bulk - to gain more leverage.<br><br>If you have to bid so much for your programs - how about looking for more sponsors?  As it is, your soccer matches are peppered with pre-game talk, half-time talk, post-game talk, after-game match analysis - we don't need that - cut those crap out - your so called experts can talk until cows come home and the favorite team will still lose - the ball is round remember?  Why not have a no-frills channel- start only when the match start, half-time all commercials - no analysis, and then when the match finish, the program ends, thats it.   - this is one way of offering lower rates.<br><br>b. Cable TV operators routinely increase rates - sure, but have you benchmark your rates against those charged by these operators?  As far as I know, Astro in Malaysia charges lower rates and offer more contents - you SCV?  Also, your move to bundle the programs together is not amusing to me - albeit your so call offering more value to consumers.  You are just forcing a minimum spending - what a lame excuse.<br><br>As it is already, singapore have a small viewerbase, by leving more on this small base is going to shrink this number further and is not doing anything to increase your bottomline.  Ps think more creative ways to increase revenue / increase viewership.<br><br>And pls don't talk about SCV offering more channles - I turn to History channel (supposedly new channel) and realise some programs are also being screened by Nat Geo - what the fark?  Also, the movies are being shown and recycled  countless times - I will accept if this means low cost but given SCV upping the rates, this is crap.<br></div>
