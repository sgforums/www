              <p>Me have a few questions on the SWF.</p>
              <p>1. Look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_fund">wiki</a>, each Singaporean worth abt 135,000(USD?) Is the money really belong to us? What are  they doing with the profits?</p>
              <p>2. If the money belong to us, why we never get any dividend frm so much money in SWF? <br>If say i migrate to other country, then shldnt i be alloted a share frm the fund, since i contributed part of it while i was a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>3. Liddat means i frm China I migrate to singapore, I theoretically 135k richer arh?</p>
              <p>4. Can the ppl who handle the money Run road?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me Dunno so I ask.... Me nt financially trained.</p>

              <p>We may be a small island without natural resource does that give the leaders the licence to tax and tax and hoard the taxes and make all kinds of profits from all the scams like GLCs to charge fees again for services which in the first place should have been financed by taxes paid.</p>
              <p>If we do not have the natural resources does it mean that citizens become the money trees for the government to tax and tax and make all sorts of double and triple profits on lands like the HDB or SLA are doing at their expense.</p>
              <p>If there is to be no free lunch and no welfarism there should be lesser government spending but do the citizens pay lesser taxes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where is the logic that just because we lack natural resources government must keep taxing and hoarding monies keeping most of the taxes as surpluses to reward leaders themselves when ordinary are struggling to pay all kinds of taxes and charges kept by leaders for their own glories.</p>
              <p>No wonder we have so much sovereign wealth funds. These so-called wealth were not created by Temasek from micropolis or shin corp investments but by the sweat and blood of every citizen.</p>
              <p>I will truly respect our leaders if these wealth funds were made from foreigners through their abilities instead of being used to rescue them at the expense of citizens' retirements.</p>
