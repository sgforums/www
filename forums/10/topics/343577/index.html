              <p>At the moment cost of wages is way too high in SG, and the SGD is far too strong even at it's current 1.45-1.5 levels vs the USD. To help MNCs and other companies control costs, cutting CPF makes the most sense.  Depreciating the SGD would be another measure, but it would be slow and might have lesser impact in reducing costs. It would be in everybody's interest to prevent the closure of companies and at least sustain them for this bleak 2009, until the projected economic upturn in 2010. CPF rates can always be reinstated in 2009.</p>
              <p>A cut in CPF, would only hurt homebuyers who bought overpriced homes in 2007/2008 and funding most of the mortgages with their CPF contributions monthly. A 4.5% cut would translate directly to a 4.5% cut in disposable income for these people, but then it's better than a 100% cut in disposable income if you lose your job.</p>
              <p>Sure, Standard Chartered can't call the shots for CPF cuts. But they won't go around making public statements if it costs them brand equity. But a CPF cut is always a distinct possibility in any recession. If we had cut CPF rates during the Asian Crisis and SARS, why not now when it's the worst economic crisis in a century? The only reason the govt would maintain CPF rates is that they want to prevent a reduction in domestic consumption, but again giving Singaporeans more disposable income doesn't mean they will spend them accordingly. This would also involve the govt to help businesses by involving other means like cutting corporate taxes hugely and use the country's financial reserves.</p>

              <p><br>That's dumb. Wages is not the most significant portion to a company's operating expenditure. Companies pay tax after expenses and wages is an expense. By reducing wage, you increase your taxable income; somewhat negating the effect. So to the government, you're reducing company expenditure to the expense of the employee and to the benefit of the government... in order words, the people is used to fund the government and the government's effort to help companies. Yet when the economy improves, the government increases their salary instead of reinstating the people's CPF.</p>
              <p>A cut if CPF does not only affect those who bough homes in 2007/2008 but <strong>everyone who currently service a home loan</strong>. A reduction in disposable incomce will only hurt Singapore economy more as Singaporeans will spend even less. Couple this with the still declining economy, it will only get worse.</p>
              <p>A more direct way to help companies is to reduce operating cost.. cut power tariff, reduce corporate tax and reduce GST (as mentioned earlier). This way, you help the company without the expense of the people and the economy.</p>
              <p>Dumbass politicians should all be fired. They are not worth a tenth of the salary they are drawing..</p>

              <p>Since you obviously have not worked before, here's salary 101.</p>
              <p>You employer pays you a salary, say $100, your employee CPF is 20% so your employer will deposit $80 into your bank account and put $20 of your salary into your CPF (in addition to the employer CPF contribution). 90% of adult employee will use to service their home loan etc.</p>
              <p>Reducing employee CPF will do fuck for employers because they are still paying you $100. The result is that the employee with have less CPF but a higher take home pay. But because of the reduction in CPF, they will have to use it to service the home loan in cash. So LPPL..</p>
              <p>Reducing employer CPF will help make the company more profitable but the amount saved is insignificant to deter them from workforce reduction.</p>
              <p>Those things that PM, SM and MM have been saying about reducing salary to have save jobs? It doesn't work in real life.</p>
