            <div class='col-md body'>If forumites might still remember, Today newspaper published a report a few days after the Nicol accident, on a reader's comment (myself) to the following effect: Due to presence of marine clay and dewatering taking place, whole surrounding surrounding road and bridges will be affected by subsidence and as a result acting as if they are a whole structure weighing in on the retaining wall.<br><br>LTA should have asked contractors concerned to produce full calculations to show how a simple retaining wall could possibly underpin such an inordinate combination of total weights of surrounding roads and bridges. It is crucial that any such lack of foreseeing of this type of problem be uncovered too by the inquiry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did you guys noticed that it was only after the collapse of the Nicoll highway that BCA/LTA made the decision to suspend several tunnel projects. Therefore is goes to show that those engineers are sitting on their arse doing nothing..<br>And when something like this happen, they just come out and point their fingers at the contractors.<br><br>From my observation, the bottom line is still cost....if LTA has been more realistic and generous about their budget, I think this incident wont have happen..<br><br>As we all know the cost of buidling material, such as steel and cements has gone up so much so fast, therefore you cant blame the contractor to try to save on material cost.<br><br>Just take a look at the construction industry now...how many of them are actually make profits...? consider this, dont you think the LTA or even HDB havent doing their homework to do the costing for the project they have awarded to their contractors?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a public sector design and build contract, the main contractor for Nicole Highway MRT circle line should have undertaken the following:-<br><br>(1) Submitting all design development in detailed shop drawings with evaluations and soil investigation tests to the requirements of LTA.<br><br>(2) Compliance with all site and soil conditions in carrying out the works.<br><br>(3) Warranting the design to meet all conditions, adequacy,  suitability and integrity.<br><br>LTA should have obtained all these shop drawings and soil reports and method statements and endorsed its consent before proceeding with works.<br><br>Did report show presence of prevalent marine clay. How much quantities of water will be drained out from the surrounding and how dewatering will affect the subsidence of surrounding roads and bridges causing the whole roads and bridge structures to weigh in our the retaining wall below the excavated site.<br><br>If design and build contract is to be administered according to the contractual terms and conditions then there is no possibility of overlooking the need to strengthen the retaining wall sufficiently to prevent massive loading from the subsided roads and bridges or other  structures.<br><br>The inquiry needs to be holistic and look at the big picture as well as the small picture at foremen and supervisors' level to get to the truths.

            <div class='col-md body'>If this were really a democratic nation... someone has to take the fall... but we've not heard of any minister leaving the office out of shame for what they did...<br><br>Why only now do they mentioned that they have found faults with Nishimatsu's designs since way back in like 2001? If this is true, why was nothing done?<br><br>If you ask me, this is the main body to blame is LTA. Lets just picture this, this project does not belong to Nishimatsu, they are only the contractors... Where is the logic that if project goes on smoothly and LTA gets to make all the bucks by the end of the day and if the project has some glitch, they do not shoulder the responsibility?<br><br>When LTA hands over the project to be done by the contractors, its just like you'll put your child in the hands of the baby-sitter. If you'd cared for your child, you'll monitor the baby-sitter, and not wait till when your child is hurt or dies then you blame the baby-sitter only, would you?<br><br>Why hadn't the authorities carried out random checks on these contractors and ensuring that the jobs done correctly and in the safety of all....sigh....what can we say, except that the authorities do fail us one too many times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forumites might still remember the Hotel New World collapse, where 33 persons were killed when the whole building collapsed due to malpractices and lack of supervision of building processes.<br><br>The Minister promised to leave no stone unturned and take thorough measures to prevent another accident. A committee of inquiry was also set up to establish the cause of the collapse and recommend preventive measures to avoid future occurrences.<br><br>MOM/MND/LTA/BCA were charged with responsibilities to prevent similar accidents or collapses as recommended by Committee of Inquiry whose report was widely hailed as the final solution to check on sporadic site safety problems.<br><br>Since Hotel New World collapse, have we improved our worksite safety. There were many more structural collapses such as collapses of veranda in Toa Payoh factory and many more.<br><br>In view of repeated work site and building failures, isn't it time again to re-examine the efficiency and effectiveness of our BCA/LTA/MOM/MND in overseeing and preventing further accidents.<br><br>Will public projects like MRT lines come under strict supervision? Perhaps, doable work processes should be set up in Department Report (Enforcement)/Work Processes as suggested in "HOW TO DO IT" posting. Without doable processes, can policies or measures really be implemented consistently and successfully. Just my humble opinion.
