It is the bloggers that are responsible for their own blogs and all the statement that is publish in the blog. (Hacking is another issue, but think it this way, who would want to hack a personal blog? And we can do something about hacking, like make a police report? Although it is a civil case that won't affect their paycheck, they might want to take care of it because of the Gahmen's goal to make SG a cyber-hub)<br><br>If we had the example of the two bloggers prosecuted for spreading racism and sowing the seeds of hatred between races, shouldn't there be another example be set up?

Other then pump ppl's tax $ into Army and let soldiers throw granade (tax payers $). Since is our money mayb we can have a say in it.<br><br>Gahmen is always like that, we voice out our concern, we are drown by their answer.

I hope you are not one of the elite also.<br><br>Why are you stupid? Ask yourself these questions;<br><br>1) Why do people donate to charities?<br>2) What do the charities do with all those donations? Please ignore NKF.<br><br>Now, tell me what compassion can do? And if you dare to repeat what you said in your post to your managers, I am very sure you will be next in line to be fired.</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;"><br><br>Unfortunately, in today's world, "compassion" is fast becoming a word to coin when one feels guilty and in need of redemption for personal or spiritual gain.  Singapore is clearly no exception.<br><br>The fact is, our business-minded gahmen likes to rub the "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" tagline in their people's faces.   Talk not of compassion to the gahmen for it will fall on deaf ears.  They see things in dollars and cents - "compassion" is merely an antonym for "liability".<br><br>Gahmen has hinted this to us by telling us to come up with "solutions" for problems we raise to them (something to this effect), and using terms like "no free lunch".  Of course, this didn't go down too well with us folks.  That's perfectly understandable.  I've suddenly realised that in order to ask for what we want successfully, we Singaporeans must be able to come up with something attractive to offer back to the gahmen.  A carrot.  U give us this, we give u what u want.<br><br>BUT, Singapore lacks the type of independent (and I mean independent) bodies with enough power and resources that might provide us citizens with enough leverage to be able to bargain, for lack of a better word, with the gahmen.  We need a bridge, and I think this may be it.  Government linked bodies are useless because they may end up striking a poor compromise in favour of party policies.<br><br>We just need the foresight and courage to unite and push for a bit of change &amp; leeway - something that I worry may not happen due to the ubiquitous I-want-change-but-don't-get-me-involved attitude.<br><br>That's what makes us look stupid to the elites.</span></div>
