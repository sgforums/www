(Derek Fans say it's because the govt doesn't want his 'all-too-true views' getting out to public, my senior says it's probably because his english sucks.) No prizes for guessing who I agree with.

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose Wee Shu Min will always have her detractors and fanatical supporters.<br><br>The fact that he started off with the line 'i'm an elitist', is actually providing a hidden meaning. As he unfolds his stand, his basic claim is that the term elitist was bestowed on the select 'cream of the crop' through stereotype and hype - this he clearly blames the people for psychologically creating such a segregation - they are actually no different from the 'average joe', and probably work just as hard.<br><br>I have been saying for ages that scholars/elitist/fast-movers are actually no different than us and any who think otherwise are indirectly perpetuating the urban myth.<br><br>If they have one common trait, is that they pick up fast, much faster than 'normal' people; alas, i agree they should not be faulted with this 'gift' as everyone should learn to have a quick sense of awareness - a learning mind shuns complacency.<br><br>Unfortunately, such mindsets are regretably almost always accompanied by arrogance; just because a person has 'bad written english' doesn't mean one should wave away his opinions, especially if they are valid. Addressing them earns respect, more so among the lower-income heartlanders who usually have greater difficulty in speaking and writing mainstream English.<br><br>One of our great 'hallmarks', admittedly a trademark of the ruling party, is their focus on paper qualification as a show of ability. In this aspect, the inability to speak fluently or write perfect English is frowned upon - a grim elitist viewpoint. Even after the Mah Bow Tan-is-a-president's-scholar backfire during Chiam's inaugural election victory did not deter them from walking down that path.</div>
