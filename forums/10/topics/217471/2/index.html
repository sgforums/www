            <div class='col-md body'>I would want to sit on the fence and suggest a timeout for everyone to think about and rationalise what is meant by elitist and elitism?<br><br>From the various postings here and other forums arising from the latest blog fiasco of Ms Wee.. its seems like being branded as an elitist means certain pre-requisites.. like going to some better ranked schools.. being able to write and opine in flawless english and having the luck of being the children of famous and powerful people or even developing certain line of thoughts towards other classes?<br><br>who is it then who actually creates such a class? is it the "elitist" themselves or those who are outside that "elitist" circle?<br><br>do the brightest of the nation automatically qualify themselves as elites just because they know how to get the grades and obtain the necessary paper qualifications? do those that wield political influence count as elites?<br><br>how about comparing those who truly knows the hearts of the people. i draw your attention to an article written by Mr Ngiam Tong Dow in today's ST. Again , I do not quite support the basis of his whole speech/article which focuses on the various classes of elites.. but it brings out something that perhaps should be discussed.. and it is the fact that there are different strengths in different people and there are those who connect better to the ground.. in that article.. he identifies these as social elites..and disappointingly he gives a very short mention to these "elites"<br><br>what it means to say is the fact that no one is perfect and .. so.. is Ms Wee considered a social elite?? I beg to differ. See how much feathers has she ruffled just over an article. I would prefer to say that there are people who are not as good in dealing with certain areas just as I would prefer to say that Ms Wee/ her father is not as perfect in the field of dealing and being sensitive to the ground.. her father is an engineer by training.. so probably dealing with public sentiments on his part there is defintely room for improving how he can deal with that aspect especially now so that he is an elected MP having a 2/3 support of his constituents.<br><br>Not that i support elites as a class of their own.. but i feel that segrating at elite classes within the societly creates unnecessary fault lines. its almost akin to spelling out the differences in skin colour of the people who make up singapore or the names which singaporeans call their god.<br><br>i recall that even LHL or some PAP MP acknowleging the fact that the ruling party was unable to gather the best brains in Singapore to run for the GE that just pass. so now do we really have the "elites" or so called running singapore?<br><br>lastly, i would want to also refer to Braveheart.. the movie by Mel Gibson.. in which there is a quote that I think should really be the crux of good governance.. i think the people who feels that they have exceptional talents should also think about it and those who still persist to think that they are elites:<br><br>"you think the people of this land exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide those people with freedom. And I go to make sure that they have it. " - William Wallace<br><br>these so called "elites" are there because we make them so. the moment that we stop calling them so.. they will also disappear.. in a democratic society.. do not experiment unnecessarily with the will of the people.<br></div>
