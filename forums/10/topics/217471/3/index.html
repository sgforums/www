            <div class='col-md body'>This debate is elistism is a hot topic because by definition, the majority of forumites are non-elites. Elites must mean a select few.<br><br>How are today's elite selected? For students, it is mostly by academic results. So RJ = elites. This is not the only way to select the elite. For adults, those who made it to high corporate positions or earn big bucks = elites (doesn't whether they are from good schools or not). Whatever criteria you use, you will always have an elite who are ranked best by the selection process. There is no way all people are equally talented in every department. The bottom line is that you have to live with the fact that there will always be elites.<br><br>The existence of elites is not the problem by itself. The problem arise only when the elites look down on the rest. Elites Wee Shu Min should remember that while she may not need to look up to many people because she is smarter than average, she should also not look down on the people who are losers or slackers. However, because we often harp on Singapore being a meritocratic society, it takes some effort to accept losers and slackers amongst us.</div>
