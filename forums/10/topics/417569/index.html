              <p><strong>Singapore spirit blows hot and cold </strong></p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 11px; color: #666666; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;">Insight Down South<br>By SEAH CHIANG NEE</h2>
              <div id="story_content" style="border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: dotted; border-top-color: #cccccc; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 0px;"><br>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If Singaporeans fear they will one day be overwhelmed by migrants in their own land, the statement from a minister that Singapore is not a country, leaves them even more uncertain.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">IN THE midst of a historical demographic change, Singapore’s hard-headed government seems less inclined nowadays to talk about national identity than it once was.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">This is a departure from the earlier post-independence years, when promoting values like patriotism and nation-bonding were top priorities.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Today, they remain important goals but are more discussed among citizens than the policy-makers.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Many Singaporeans are worried about the erosion of national fervour in an island state bloated by the recent arrivals of hundreds of thousands of foreigners.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">On the government’s part, priority seems to have shifted – at least for now – from promoting nationalism to persuading Singaporeans “to embrace foreigners”. I suppose there’s a time for everything.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">It probably seems untimely for the authorities to preach an intensification of national feelings at a time when so many foreigners – and new migrants – are settling here.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“They are caught in a bind. Harping on national sentiments now could be seen as isolating the new arrivals,” said a neighbourhood doctor.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">With its short history, Singapore still needs to continue to build a national identity among Singa­poreans citizens or risk losing its economic achievements, he said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">The question is: How, when citizens may soon become a minority?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Recent conflicting remarks by ministers have not helped to clarify to citizens where they are heading – or indeed if Singapore is a country or merely a global city.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Law (and Home Affairs) Minister K. Shanmugam surprised everyone when he told visiting American lawyers that Singapore was not a country.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">He was defending the government’s human rights records. The minister said Singapore was viewed as a deviation from the democratic norm because it was seen primarily as a country.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“This is where most people make a mistake. I have tried to explain that we are different. We are a city. We are not a country,” he said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">It sparked off a public debate, especially among young national servicemen sworn to defend the nation. Baffled party members sought an explanation.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">In an indirect effort to control damage, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said Singapore could not afford to have a ratio of more than 40% foreign workers.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“We felt we are more comfortable with that than thinking we are nothing but a global city. We are also a country,” he said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">In an earlier unrelated event, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said that despite its achievements, Singapore was not yet a nation.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“Are we a nation yet? I will not say we are. We’re in transition. Please remember this is an ideal which we may not completely reach, but because we have this ideal, we’ll continue to make progress,” he said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">All this talk has not gone down well with Singaporeans, who find it incomprehensible and reflective of government uncertainty.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Songshus blogged: “From my observation over the last two or three decades, it seems to me that our government is only trying to succeed economically.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“We should also develop on other fronts that would bind our people together, and promote cultural and identity awareness.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“The average Singaporean really does not know what future direction we are heading towards.”</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Critics of the government, however, are less surprised.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">For years, they have accused the People’s Action Party (PAP) of governing Singapore like a profitable corporation, even paying themselves as Board members.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Increasingly during the past decade, the political leaders had been talking more of Singapore as a global city.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">During his recent visit to Moscow, MM Lee said his vision of Singapore was that it would no longer be seen as just an Asian city one day – but as cosmopolitan and connected to the world.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">In view of this line of thinking, Shanmugam’s description of his country as a city – not a country – should not be surprising.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">The question is: what will happen to the national identity that the PAP had wanted to forge from day one of independence?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Can it work with so many foreigners coming and going as though it were a hotel?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Some analysts noticed that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who faces a tough general election soon, recently talked of wanting to build – not nationalism – but “The Singapore Spirit”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Not many people remember now, but in 1989, Singapore’s leaders called for a “national ideology” to prevent a “harmful drift towards Westernisation” and promote a national identity.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">No one bets it will be revived anytime soon.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">While moulding a national identity has not been a popular leadership topic these days, the same cannot be said of Singaporeans. Many are pushing for a stronger rallying effort.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">During National Day, another popular discussion centred on the question: “Will the rally make us feel for Singapore again?”</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Some Singaporeans believe the country now has an identity crisis as a result of foreign arrivals now making up one third of the population.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Others agree that while it is causing some social dislocation, “we should not blame the whole problem on the government”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Muhamad Nur appealed to all to treat Singapore as a nation – not just a city. “This is our only solution.”</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">A visiting student from Switzerland, Christabel, disagreed with those who declared that Singapore has no identity or is a sanitised corporate state.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“Remember as a country, you are only around 40 years old. Identity will come naturally, given more time.”</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;"><a href="http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?file=/2010/12/11/columnists/insightdownsouth/7594730&amp;sec=insightdownsouth">http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?file=/2010/12/11/columnists/insightdownsouth/7594730&amp;sec=insightdownsouth</a></p>

              <p>Harry Lee was reared by the british to be their dog, so he adopted the british dog mentality from young.</p>
              <p>After Singapore became independent state, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">he created Singapore and ruled it as a british dog would.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That is the key to understanding the failure of nation building in Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p>He basically imposed a british system onto a non british people. He himself is a british dog, so he had no problems with the british system.</p>
              <p>But the attempt to impose an alien british system onto non british people would ultimately serve to alienate the people and the nation state project would fail.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 16.6667px;">What makes Singapore different? The majority of Singapore's population is ethnically Chinese, but Singapore is largely free of corruption, has sound institutions and the rule of law dominates. It's nothing like China. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The answer lies in a historical division in Singapore's Chinese community between the babas and the sinkeh. </span></span></strong>The sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's population, were the recent immigrants from China, or whose parents were born in China. They spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and considered themselves overseas Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese were called the totok.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice. They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, it was the babas who dominated public decision-making. In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents.</span></span></strong> "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England.</span></span></strong> He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways? No. He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">That other great framer of Singapore's institutions, Goh Keng Swee, who rose to become finance minister and deputy prime minister, is the epitome of the baba elite. Goh was born in 1918 in Malacca, the epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His parents were English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The baba influence is now more subtle, but still there. Singapore's current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has the strongest baba pedigree of any of the country's leaders.</p>

              <p>sporeans are the ones who will vote the PAP out if they hate PAP so much.</p>
              <p>so next thing if i were a PAP leader would be to fill up all sporean jobs in spore with foreigners from cleaners,technicians,engineers to managers.</p>
              <p>the sporeans who can vote or have any position to affect PAP will be given lesser jobs n removed from spore thru suicide due to hard life in spore  and immigration outa spore.</p>
              <p>so who is voting for spore in the end??the workforce of 100% non-sporeans really where most arent allowed to vote!</p>
              <p>since up to now u dun see any legislations increasing yer salary or improving yer lives in spore...it lall ooks like some guy trying to sell u a broken dvd player in some shadowy shop.</p>
              <p>what are u all going to do?????yer votes  probably mean nothing now....probably just a waste of yer effort.</p>

              <p>Fear and greed is a powerful motivator. Fear lossing out, greed for hdb to huat sky high</p>
              <p>From wikileaks</p>
              <p>"MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a flabby old chap for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation.<span style="color: #0000ff;"> MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine."</span></p>
              <p>"Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, <span style="color: #0000ff;">similar to the situation in Singapore<span style="color: #000000;">."</span></span></p>
