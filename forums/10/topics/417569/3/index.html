              <p>But nation building failure wah. </p>
              <p>That cannot really be blamed because the nation building process was built by an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>I think that is failure from the beginning.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The two men also discussed the issue of culture, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I said that using a certain language to create a culture, the culture created can at best be a commercial culture, or technology culture, or we may call it pasar culture. It has no roots, and identifies itself with a certain material interest. It is the product of expediency.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"It is like duckweed, floating at the harbour. When it absorbs fertilisers, it will flourish very quickly. But once it rains and floods set in, it will perish,"</span></span></strong> he said in an interview conducted in a restaurant in Haadyai, near the Thai-Malaysian border.</span></p>

              <p>Japan nation building can only be done by Japanese. You ask a korean or chinese to build up a nation state in Japan, it is doomed to failure.</p>
              <p>Malaysia, only a Malay can do it, you ask a chinese go built a nation state in Malaysia, it will fail.</p>
              <p>You ask an anglo dog like Harry Lee Kuan Yew, a cultureless person, a person without identity, to build a nation state on chinese people and others, it is doomed to failure.</p>

              <p><br>Take a look at your neighbouring countries then tell me why you think the nation building has failed.</p>
              <p>It's not the people, it's because we have LKY who is our great leader and founding father and who doesn't mind to lead Singapore to become one of the most prosperous countries who does not need to rely on any natural resources.</p>
              <p>At least be grateful that you are not digging soil and your fathers and forefathers doesn't need to dig soil.</p>
              <p>But don't let your children and grandchildren to be forced to dig soil for a living because of your own insensibility and childish mentality.</p>
              <p>See the Greater Good and pledge your lives to maintain it and everyone will prosper.</p>

              <p><br>I think hire and fire practices should also commensurate with employee albilities as well. Would anyone want to keep an employee who can't work? You tell them their mistakes and yet they keep making the same million $ mistakes day in and day out. I think you are one of those brain dead employees as well.</p>
              <p>Why impose your single minded view on fellow employees? You want to strike when you can't do the work and yet still want pay? Are you nuts?</p>

              <p>Why use force when you can use motivation instead?</p>
              <p>Stop giving excuses I only pay you to work!</p>
              <p>Yes, employees who keep making the same mistakes deserve to be fired.</p>
              <p>But not when employers are thinking in their minds try to find faults with their employees so they can lay them off!</p>
              <p>They know what they themselves do! Many pregnant women have been laid off the past 2 years suddenly.</p>
              <p>People don't have evidence but God knows certainly!</p>
              <p>There are good bosses and there are also bad bosses.</p>
              <p>But I don't expect nasty ones to every now and then, expect so much that the other equal rank employers do not like as well.</p>
              <p>Also, when problems need to be done out of the box, do it as a team, not by force!</p>

              <p>First, the right to hire and fire is the perogative of employers, and the right to be hired and resign is also the perogative of the employees, the laws works both ways.</p>
              <p>Usually, the top boss who operate business here play no part in being good or bad toward his employees, it is his lower ranks, the GM, line or senior managers, supervsiors who are nasty toward employees, if any. Cos the boss just want profit for himself and shareholders, he let those politics jobs to the lower ranks, it is not his jobs. So this lower ranks, who like to show off to the boss of what they did to lower wage cost of the employees, make them work more and pay less just to be term as productivity, and discard the weak and lousy ones without remorseful nor investigate into the truth of it, end up lower rank bosses practicing favoritism, nepotism and kiasusim.</p>

Remember, local management are also employees, they certain want to enjoy life better than workers, and their disciplines can be a 100 times more worst than an employee below par.
