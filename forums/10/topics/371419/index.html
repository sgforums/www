Let me count the ways </span></span></span> <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Posted by: Shutruk_N</span> <br> Today, 10:31 AM </span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">I too, wish to take this opportunity as our
              country celebrates 50 years after shedding its colonial shackles and 44
              years of nationhood, to pay tribute to my fellow Singaporeans who
              contributed much to making Singapore what it is today.
              <br> <br>I am specifically referring to those who answered the call from the
              country (not that we had any choice since it was compulsory military
              conscription) to serve Singapore in National Service during the initial
              years since its inception. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">We
              gave two to two and a half years of the best years of our lives to the
              defense of our country and many of us came away being permanent
              physical and mentally damaged as a result. We trained under Israeli
              “military advisors” and led by the mentally incompetent who extracted
              pleasure in subjecting abuse to those under them. How many of us came
              away permanent hearing loss because we were not allowed hearing
              protection when we operated our firearms and we derided as being sissy
              when we cupped our hands over our ears when we served a firing
              assistants. How of many further sacrificed when we served 5
              in-camp-trainings over 4 calendar years when there was a desperate need
              to ramp-up the reservist divisions to counter potential external
              threats – much to the displeasure of our employers. How of us then were
              called again to serve a second round of reservists either in the SAF or
              SCDF when we were told that we possessed certain skills or knowledge
              which were needed. </span></span>And then there were our wives and
              girlfriends, who suffered with us – waiting late into the night to
              receive a phone call from us while we queued to make a call from the
              only public phone located in the cookhouse. Who bored our frustrations,
              our pain and distress during the short weekends when we could spend
              with them – and at many times, we were too physical drained and tired
              to be any meaningful company to them. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">At
              the end of it all – how many you felt cheated when we did all of this
              for our country and when we turned 50, did not receive an
              acknowledgment, or a single “thank you” from an ungrateful government
              as we were discharged from further reservist liability.</span></span> <br> <br> And so as we prepare to celebrate this National Day, I say – cheers to
              you all. But for those citizens of Singapore who answered our
              government’s invitation to take up citizenship in our fine land and are
              lapping up the infrastructure and trimmings of an economy which my
              fellow Singaporeans made possible through our sacrifices – I say “good
              for you” <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">BUT don’t
              you dare call yourself Singaporeans – because you did not shed sweat
              and blood alongside me for those two and half years and your women did
              not suffer as ours did when they waited alongside us during those
              years, and nursed us from our physical and mental injuries after it was
              all over. </span></span>Those of you with your university degrees and
              your skills which our government tried hard to convince us will help
              Singapore to survive in a competitive quagmire – <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: blue;">how
              many of you will take the first plane out when things begin to turn
              sour. I had the privilege of serving when men who are durian sellers,
              goring pisang hawkers and even 4D runners – but I will tell you that
              these men will fight and die for Singapore if the need arises. But you,
              our new found fellow Singapore citizens – not so I think.</span> </span></span> <br> <br> Majullah Singapura!</span></p>
