            <div class='col-md body'>Take a look around. All you will see are foreigners crawling around all over the place. The government has been handing out PR's like chocolates. What exactly is the diference between being a PR and a Singaporean? Only the progress package payments i suppose. I have malaysians working in my office who are in their early twenties went to University in Singapore and get all benefits of being a singaporean. The only difference they dont need to serve NS. They happy with their PR. Can still buy HDB flat. All our jobs are going to all this 'foreign talents'. Are massage parlour workers from China classified as 'foreign talents' too? Thanks PAP you have done a great job in allowing foreigners to rape our country.</div>

Other than the illegal immigrants, the number of foreign talents into Singapore is controlled (sort of).  If you see more foreign talents into Singapore, it is because the government allows (approve) them.<br><br>There are LIMIT and CAP but it is set too high, so we feel a lot of pressure competing with the big pool of foreign talents!<br><br></div>

Well, for one, I cite the sheer number of highly or well educated people produced by the system. Do you think they'd settle for minial jobs? Does it tally with all the years of tertiary studies? Ok, so if a local excepts a lower salary and not be choosy. Do you think, a salary of $1500-$2000 (before CPF) can feed a family or take care of aging and sick parents??<br>(i haven't even mentioned the stupid policies in place governing the use of Medisafe and CPF!!)<br><br>With higher educational levels, almost everyone wants to be the boss. Then who's left to be the average employee? Also note that there are those who can't study for a variety of reasons, and hence have no choice but to compete foreigners for minial manual labour jobs.<br><br>Then after all this hardship of trying to make a living, we face even bleaker prospects as old citizens - no employers wants old workers due to high medical costs, or for whatever fasionable reasons.<br><br>Who the hell, do you think created such circumstances????<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't mind if they are giving out PR. This shows the FT has been here for quite a number of years and have at least contribute something like income tax.<br><br>It is the giving out of employment passes that is the concern. Employment pass is given out for jobs that command a salary higher than 2.5k/mth. These are higher end jobs that should be reserved for our fresh graduates from Uni/Poly and the local lower-middle income group.<br><br>I know some FTs are just here to use us as a stepping stone for more lucrative jobs somewhere else. The govt should be more stringent in granting employment pass. Are we really short of qualified people? Or are companies taking the easy way out to cut labour cost at the expense of Singapore citizens?</div>

However indonesian, malaysian, filipino, chinese, and the indians are okay with a slightly lower salary and longer worktime.<br><br>6.

No maids for you... except if you are willing to pay $15 per hour for a singaporean maid.<br><br>4. Manufacturing cost will be higher. Soon all manufacturer will move to Vietnam/China/Indonesia<br><br>5. Big IT companies will move out from Singapore.

Let the foreigner do the dirty jobs, they are willing to do it with low salary. Singaporean should aim themself to do a higher status jobs. Someone who are not capable of doing higher status job can either stay jobless or downgrade their expectation. It is THEIR choice.<br><br>2. Don't worry about the numbers of PRs here. For example, in Bahrain, one of the developed country in the middle east, the amount of PRs are 3 times of their citizen. A problem? NO.

Small IT companies will be closed down since the overhead cost will be too high.<br><br>6. The shipyards and container ports will move to a cheaper place.<br><br>The correct thing to do:<br><br>1. Let the foreigner do the dirty jobs, they are willing to do it with low salary. Singaporean should aim themself to do a higher status jobs. Someone who are not capable of doing higher status job can either stay jobless or downgrade their expectation. It is THEIR choice.<br><br>2. Don't worry about the numbers of PRs here. For example, in Bahrain, one of the developed country in the middle east, the amount of PRs are 3 times of their citizen. A problem? NO. Bahrain is one of the most prosperous country in the middle east.</div></blockquote>needless to say....why dont they pay us the equivalent of their peanuts salary for us to do those jobs. im sure we dont mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Ok, so if a local excepts a lower salary and not be choosy. Do you think, a salary of $1500-$2000 (before CPF) can feed a family or take care of aging and sick parents??<br>(i haven't even mentioned the stupid policies in place governing the use of Medisafe and CPF!!)<br><br>With higher educational levels, almost everyone wants to be the boss. Then who's left to be the average employee? Also note that there are those who can't study for a variety of reasons, and hence have no choice but to compete foreigners for minial manual labour jobs.<br><br>Then after all this hardship of trying to make a living, we face even bleaker prospects as old citizens - no employers wants old workers due to high medical costs, or for whatever fasionable reasons.<br><br>Who the hell, do you think created such circumstances????<br><br></div></blockquote>What do you suggest then?
