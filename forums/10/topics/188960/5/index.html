            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Dogtor:</div><div class="quote_body">Good attitude!!  I have been campaigning privately for this issue - If India, Malaysian, China was so good - why did your ancestors end up in Singapore?<br><br>We need to promote a Singaporean identity defined by our values - some values are universal despite PAP protestations - Liberty and freedom in all respects attract people regardless of where they are from.<br><br>I hate foreign media who keep referring to Chinese- Singapore. I have nothing in common with the Chinese except skin colour and looks. I am Singaporean -period. The master race, Lord of the Realm.<br><br>Look at Australians, Canadians, Americans - the majority race is white - English or British stock  - that de-ephasized Englishness and co-opted values from other cultures as required to forged a new "race".<br><br></div></blockquote>I would rather you look at our ancestor this way: The ancestors of Singaporean were good therefore Singapore is what it is today, well ahead of China, India, Malaysia in many ways.<br><br>How have Canadians, Americans and Australians de-emphasized Englishness and what other values or cultures were co-opted?  the australian stopped saluting the queen only after 1986. Do we see any aborigines cultures in these countries being accepted as part of the country main cultures? no. At least in singapore, malays, tamil and erasian cultures and languages are accepted as on par with the majority. these countries had over 100 yrs of nation building but the australian abolished the 'white australian policy' only in the 70s. The french canadian still want to make quebec a separate state or country. Are the black in america taken as completely equal to the white?<br><br>There is no new "race" in america, canada or australia, just the same nationality in each country. there is no need to speak highly of any race in particular, but there is a strong need to be sensitive, recognise and accept the differences in the cultures, the language of different races, this is part of the freedom and rights of the people of all races, regardless of skin colours and looks, majority or minority.<br><br>Singaporean identity is there already. Many of us should realise that when we travel, even from the arrogance and lousy habits displaced by some singaporean tourists. But Good or Bad, we are singaporean. What is important is to be proud of who we are, and acknowledge who we are. Reading some of the threads here, when some "singaporean", for their unhappiness with the government over some policies, their disagreement with PAP, openly declare they are not proud to be Singaporean, they want to leave Singapore,  believing that the majority of Singaporean are retard and ignorant, WE WOULD HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO ESBALISH A STRONG SINGAPOREAN IDENTIY, but thank God, I believe these are just the minority.<br><br>We cannot build a strong identity if we are not proud of it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japan high-flyer, with S'pore nest, is grounded<br>Tuesday, June 6, 2006<br>Man who bought $16m penthouse here arrested in Tokyo for insider trading<br><br>Valerie Law<br>valerie@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>FOR some months now, Japan's best-known fund manager and leading shareholder activist Yoshiaki Murakami (picture) has been planting his roots in Singapore.<br>.<br>In March, he moved the headquarters of 400 billion yen ($5.6 billion) MAC asset management fund to the Republic.<br>.<br>Last month, he was making the headlines again by paying a record $16 million to purchase a "super penthouse" in The Boulevard Residence on Cuscaden Walk.<br>.<br>Yesterday, he was in the news for the wrong reasons. The 46-year-old tycoon was arrested in Tokyo after admitting to insider trading in the run-up to Japan's biggest hostile takeover attempt. Mr Murakami bought almost 1.93 million shares in Nippon Broadcasting System (NBS) after learning that Livedoor, the now-collapsed Internet firm, was planning to take over the radio station operator.<br>.<br>In a nationally-televised press conference yesterday, Mr Murakami admitted that the source of his information was none other than Takafumi Horie, the 33-year-old chief executive of Livedoor who used to be the poster boy of new Japanese business until he was charged with breaking securities laws.<br>.<br>Mr Murakami said Horie had told him of his plans to take over NBS in late 2004. His fund then started buying NBS shares, which surged once Livedoor launched its takeover bid in February 2005.<br>.<br>Mr Murakami made a neat profit by selling the shares his fund had accumulated to Livedoor and other market investors.<br>.<br>Trying to defend himself yesterday, Mr Murakami claimed: "I didn't think Livedoor had the wherewithal to actually go through with it. I didn't buy (NBS) shares because of my conversation, but it's true that I heard what I heard."<br>.<br>Livedoor eventually withdrew its bid, but Mr Murakami said that he continued discussing business matters, including NBS, with Horie.<br>.<br>"We saw each other at the gym, so of course we chatted," he said.<br>.<br>Both he and Horie had become cult figures for their attempts to shake up Japan's somewhat conservative business environment, where the interests of the management sometimes took precedence over those of the shareholders.<br>.<br>A defiant Mr Murakami, who famously made his first equity investment at the age of nine and has been using his stakes in various companies to ask them tough questions, said that Japan was hostile to those who challenged the system.<br>.<br>"Don't you think this country tends to kick out people who challenge?" he asked. "I may not be qualified to say this since I have done something illegal, but I hope that Japan will one day become a country that accepts people who challenge."<br>.<br>Mr Murakami added that he would resign from his fund, now headquartered in Singapore, but that it would continue to operate without him.<br>.<br>Asked to comment on this, a spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said that MAC Asset Management was an exempt fund manager which undertook fund management activity in Singapore as well as an exempt financial adviser.<br>.<br>"In Singapore, if an exempt fund manager or exempt financial adviser or any of its representatives are found not to be fit and proper, MAS can take appropriate regulatory action," the spokesperson added.<br>.<br>Officers at MAC Asset Managment's Singapore office refused to comment.<br>.<br>Mr Murakami, meanwhile, said that only a third of the fund's money has been invested, with the rest sitting on its books as cash.<br>.<br>Insider dealing carries a maximum prison sentence of three years, something Mr Murakami should know, since he was heavily involved drawing up laws on mergers and acquisition during his time as an official in the trade ministry, which he quit in 1999.<br>.<br>"This time I got a red card," he said. "I am going to leave the pitch once and reflect. I am not sure what's going to happen next, but I believe it would be right to stand back."</div>

Even fewer employment pass holders should get PR.
