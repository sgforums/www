All I know is NS is not simply a matter of instilling manners because if we're using that as a yardstick, then I say the PRC nationals beat us hands down in terms of rudeness.<br><br>NS is about personal sacrifice and it is what makes us truly Singaporean, it is about the guy next to you in the fire trench. It is about your comrades, your family. And appreciating what is your home. It is not about political affiliations. Because when the sh*t hits the fan, you can be assured that those who can afford to run (the elites who harp so much about loyalty to country, as well as the fair weathered PRs) will run. And those left behind will have to band together and rise to the challenge.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only reason why we have so many "foreign talents" in Singapore is simple... to keep Singaporeans exploited and the rich richer. You see given the cost we have here in Singapore our pay is peanuts (not the SM Goh wife's type of diamond peanuts; the real "thor dao").<br><br>So how to ensure that our pay stays as peanuts? Get foreigners in to compete and lower the wages... the foreigner can accpet such low wages because at home theie costs are much lower.<br><br>So you see the "CONSPIRACY?" Make everything expensive (especially housing so the very rich with extra house can profit) but exploit Singaporeans by keeping  the wages low and to do that; bring in the foreigners.</div>

Some communities are actually very friendly to foreigners and P.Rs. Maybe you stepped on their toes before? I dun know. If you treat them with respect and politness, they will see you no longer as a treat. Are you sure you are not the one making baseless remarks?<br><br>I am not saying there are no taxes. Other than income tax, Singapore have extra charges for? ERP, COE, Road tax? When they pass the bill, there s no opposing voice. And I need not tell you why cos ANY good opposition leader in the past is either sued or bankrupt.<br><br>Have the gahmen ever thought of how the ppl feel? Everytime they change their focus of field expertise, from like engineering to IT, how about those ppl who are engineered trained in their 40s to 50s? Work at MacDonald's? Even if they receive new training in IT field, they have to compete with young ppl who might be fresh grads.<br><br>For your information, we are a small population no doubt, but I find it strange that singapore is pushing to train world class atlethics and other talents and at the same time when they are at the peak go NS? I know people will cry foul play if a few do not have to serve NS, but exemptions can be made. Good althletics or other talent like singers and musicians( I would not want to give more examples as u got the picture... right? If not too bad lah.) make it like a reward, if they can reach that caliber, they qualify for only BMT training then off they go? Rules are man made. Anything is possible.<br>I am not with any opposition party, but I believe in a person's freedom of speech and demanding equality.<br><br>Lets not forget our pledge:<br><br>" We the citizens of Singapore, Pledge ourselves as one united people, REGARDLESS of RACE, LANGUAGE or RELIGON, to build a DEMOCRATIC society, based on JUSTICE and EQUALITY, so as to achieve HAPPINESS PROSPERITY and PROGRESS for our nation."<br><br>How many things gahmen have foresaken against our ppl?

Why are foreign students entitled to such massive subsidies at the expense of us tax payers? Maybe we should deduct all these grants from Ministers salaries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> let them foot the bill for being generous to foreigners.</div>
