Many of the FTs have only mediocre skills. So why do we employ them?<br><br>Isn't it because these foreigners are willing to work longer hours for lower pay, do shift work and accept poorer working conditions? Employers are not daft. They have to employ these lowly-skilled foreigners because locals will not take the jobs on offer.<br><br>There is an additional advantage with foreigners. Because some of them come at half the price of a local worker, you can hire 10 of them when you only need 5. Test them out. Tell them at the end of the year, you will retain the best 5 and send the remaining 5 back to their own country. You will have all of them working their butts out to impress you and you will know that at the end of it, you have the best of the crop. You can do that every year, hiring another 5 and sending 5 back each time. For low-skill jobs that do not require much training, that is a model that has been used.<br><br>That's why I think that locals must move up the food chain with skill upgrading. Employers will hire locals if it becomes necessary to spend half a year training a new foreign worker. If newly arrived foreigners have already acquired the skill for the job, it's time for you to move up the food chain or become redundant.</div>

"The emphasis then will be on re-training, flexibility, multi-skilling, the ability to adapt to new technologies, new work processes and new products."<br><br>"Technological improvements result in faster and easier communication and information exchange at the same time as the economic base shifts from manufacturing and goods production to service industries and the new economy."<br><br>"All of this is accompanied by ideological shifts emphasizing investment, trade liberalization, deregulation and private enterprise."<br><br>"The influence of de-industrialization, globalization and the changing nature of work have resulted in ideological, political and economic shifts at a broad level that have been beneficial for those in a position to take advantage of these changes. For others, however, these processes have meant economic marginalization, growing income disparities and long-term unemployment ."<br><br>"Education and traing are often seen as the solution to many current social and economic problems. There is an underlying assumption in both theory and practise that a region with educated and trained people will attract new investment, that this new investment will create jobs and that both will lead to economic development."<br><br>"Unemployed individuals with existing and transferable skills amay benefit from the kinds of skill-upgrading and job search assistance schemes traditionally offered through government programs."<br><br>"The ILO World Labour Report 'Learning to Start Afresh - The Challenge of Re-Training', states, 'Retraining is not a panacea for the problems of structural adjustment." Just as education is seen as a panacea for social problems, so re-training is seen as a panacea for structural adjustment problems. In both instances, it is not enough."</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">This study was commissioned to study the effects of government policies in Canada and UK, with both countries having experienced structural changes to their traditional employment sectors; some of the conclusions are applicable to our discussion; and I believe you will change your high expectations and realised that Government has a bigger responsibility than the low end workers.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Do I expect our workers who have lost their jobs like these miners to pick up new skills and go into a new industry?

            <div class='col-md body'>Germany companies, indeed, companies all over Europe are outsourcing many of their manufacturing plants to India and China. Many of those that remain receive government subsidies, known as EU state aid, to remain viable. (http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3351416)<br>In fact, Germany is now looking at outsourcing their R&amp;D in India, because running clinical trials are 40% cheaper there.<br><br>Making colour pencils? What is the difference in profit margins between making colour pencils (the raw materials of which have to be imported) and pharmaceutical products? Low-tech industries will not work for Singapore because cheaper economies like China and India are moving up the food chain quickly. So what if you can automate and make colour pencils more efficiently? Why can't a manufacturer move the machines to China and make it even cheaper there? Automation increases productivity by doing the same work with fewer workers, but that does not solve unemployment. We have to increase productivity by increasing the value of the goods, so that employers can afford to hire more employees.<br><br>Look at the marketing teams for pharmaceutical companies compared to those in the retail sector, say, for cosmetics. A marketing manager in the cosmetic sector typically handles a dozen or more products and there are 3 or more new product launches per month. There may be 2 or more marketing persons in the pharamceutical company handling just one drug and new product launches come once a year or longer. Yet the pharmaceutical industry employs more marketing personnel and spends far more in marketing than any other industry. Why? Because the profit margins are higer and they can afford it. They also pay better, but you can take a person off the street to sell cosmetics, but not pharmaceutics.<br><br>Any job that can be done more cheaply in a cheaper economy will be lost to us. We have to focus on jobs that cannot be outsourced because they are service jobs that must be performed locally (eg. nurses, waiters) or the skill required is beyond the capability of the foreign competitor. Service jobs may be difficult to outsource, but if foreign workers come into Singapore as they do, our workers cannot compete as well. So essentially, if our workers do not want to accept a lower wage like the foreign workers in Singapore, they have to go into hi-tech industries where we still have a relative advantage.<br><br>You must not forget that increased productivity also means you need fewer people to do the same job. The UK manufacturing industry accounts for a sixth of total exports and only 15% of the workforce. Their output has not dropped, but the workforce in this industry has been declining year on year. The reason: factories that survive have increased productivity and employ fewer workers and so remain competitive. The others have outsourced their work overseas. So increased productivity does not always mean more jobs, especially if the increase in productivity comes as a result of automation, which can also be replicated in cheaper economies.<br><br>When we think of outsourcing to cheaper economies, we used to think of them as low-cost, low-skill centres. Unfortunately, we are up against a greater challenge. China and India are fast becoming low-cost, high-skill economies and we have to go one up against them to survive. Bringing in machines and automation alone is no longer a viable solution...the Chinese are already doing that.<br><br>We have to move up the skill ladder and leverage on our reputation as being more responsible maufacturers of high-value goods like pharmaceuticals, compared to China, for example.<br><br>[/quote]</div>

I agree with that. That's why we cannot be thinking of making colour pencils in Singapore...that sort of jobs are being lost to cheaper economies rapidly. There is no point in re-training our workforce to use high-tech machinery to make colour pencils when such machinery can be acquired and used by cheaper staff in China.<br><br>We have to focus on new industries and that's why the government has put emphasis on the biotech and nanotechnology. These industries will require researchers but also production workers. Those that have lost their jobs making computer drives must now re-train to make pharmaceuticals, wear a clean suit and work shifts in making new generation computer chips etc. If our workers refuse to do so, even our new industries will turn to foreign workers and that would be sad indeed.</div>
