Some communities are actually very friendly to foreigners and P.Rs. Maybe you stepped on their toes before? I dun know. If you treat them with respect and politness, they will see you no longer as a treat. Are you sure you are not the one making baseless remarks?<br><span style="color: red;">I shall not argue on this. Different people get different treatments in different countries. Let's not generalise on this.</span><br><br>I am not saying there are no taxes. Other than income tax, Singapore have extra charges for? ERP, COE, Road tax? When they pass the bill, there s no opposing voice. And I need not tell you why cos ANY good opposition leader in the past is either sued or bankrupt.<br><span style="color: red;">ERP, COE, Road tax. They only have 1 aim - to reduce traffic congestion in tiny Singapore and its limited roads. Will Singaporeans listen if the government tells them by word of mouth, "People, please do not buy cars for the benefit of all road users. If you're filthy rich, please buy only 1 car." You think it will have effect? And you guys want opposition for such petty matters? Please be more far-sighted and think of the big picture.</span><br><br>Have the gahmen ever thought of how the ppl feel? Everytime they change their focus of field expertise, from like engineering to IT, how about those ppl who are engineered trained in their 40s to 50s? Work at MacDonald's? Even if they receive new training in IT field, they have to compete with young ppl who might be fresh grads.<br><span style="color: red;">Well, what do you suggest we do then? Let Singapore be a stick-in-the-mud and don't progress? Has the opposition got any ideas on how to solve this problem or are they still busy trying to win hearts by discussing petty little issues and avoiding national issues? They make better village chiefs I would say. National leaders? Nah...</span><br><br>For your information, we are a small population no doubt, but I find it strange that singapore is pushing to train world class atlethics and other talents and at the same time when they are at the peak go NS? I know people will cry foul play if a few do not have to serve NS, but exemptions can be made. Good althletics or other talent like singers and musicians( I would not want to give more examples as u got the picture... right? If not too bad lah.) make it like a reward, if they can reach that caliber, they qualify for only BMT training then off they go? Rules are man made. Anything is possible.<br><span style="color: red;">Personally, I agree with what you're trying to put across. But if you think of it on a national level, do u think it's possible to carry this out? How do we gauge who the elites are? And why do they deserve exemption? Lots of other people will come out with bizzare reasons on why they shld be exempted frm NS. Then the next thing tht the opposition parties will accuse the PAP of is on practising elitism...</span><br></div></blockquote></div>

This is because back home, the companies they work for do not have an establish set of procedures and they have a much complicated system of doing things. They have to exploit SAP's capabilities to counter this problem<br><br>Whereas a local SAP analyst learn their stuff in a "assumed" everything smooth sailing environment. They are well trained, but they are not as ready to counter expected problems.</div></blockquote>Nice reply but a constant issue is that Singaporeans kept getting denied opportunities to train to a higher level because it is very costly and the government does not want to pay.<br><br>One of my beef with eduation in Singapore is that the government thinks what is best for industry and the manpower requirements etc, - which is an inexact science.<br><br>We should import talent when we need them for industries as required but by and large Singaporeans should be able to freely obtain advance and super advance education and training at State cost without bonds because they are citizens so that they can compete internationally.<br><br>Besides why bond? - This impinges on academic freedom - Singapore is only one city and some of the stuff we are engaged in may not be interesting for others so if you are Singaporean - you got no choice but give up your area of expertise, research, training?<br><br>Of course not, Singaporeans should then go anywhere they can put their interests and skills to the best application.<br><br>We can offer aliens educational opportunities but they should be bonded to the hilt and do stuff that we want done - citizenship can only come through NS.<br><br>When the gap/benefit for citizens and aliens are widened - many more people will then salivate to become Singaporeans.<br><br>When you treat your own people like Shit-e, even aliens don't want to get stain with crap.<br><br>We need to insist that all future educational opportunities be maximised for Singaporeans, and tax and spend a lot more on it. Singaporeans who can make the manimum standards for training academically or vocationalyl should be trained so long as they apply for it. It typically cost upwards of US$500 000 for advanced training and support.<br><br>Maximize Singaporean freedoms by doing away with bonds especially for non-military sscholars. Then we can improve the value of citizenship and encourage true talents, intellectual development and set the course for multiple years of multiple Nobel prizes.</div>

However, when the sovrignty of our country was forged, the so were "Singaporeans". An identity. A commitment to each other that we have the common interests of our nation and families at heart. Our forefathers built this nation and have passed on the baton to us.<br><br>Im not gonna say that we can do without forign tallent. I say rather that they are almost essential to the betterment of our economy.  However i stress the important point that there should be a distinction between singaporeans and forigners. To be singaporean should be a privilage. It should carry exclusive rights. As such it should have some value. These rights and privilages should not be handend out on large scales thru reckless issuing of PR and resident status. Rather, like other countries and like singapore in the past, there should be strict criteria that determine the level of commitment individuals have to our nation.<br><br>I do not believe that our country is being raped. Rather i say that we are being prostituted. Those that we chare with the responsibility of taking the helm of our nation , sad to say, have a clear disconnect with the masses. In prostitution it is not the prostitute that makes any gain. It is ultimately the pimp that reaps the greatest reward.<br><br>We have our indipendence. Now a new war must be fought. A fight for freedom and rights.  Rights  that the people determine. Singaporeans. This will unify us.<br><br>Remember, there is no Malay, Indian, Chinese or Eurasian. SUch terms are colonial classifications and are irrelevant. There are only SINGAPOREANS and Forigners. </div></blockquote>Good attitude!!  I have been campaigning privately for this issue - If India, Malaysian, China was so good - why did your ancestors end up in Singapore?<br><br>We need to promote a Singaporean identity defined by our values - some values are universal despite PAP protestations - Liberty and freedom in all respects attract people regardless of where they are from.<br><br>I hate foreign media who keep referring to Chinese- Singapore. I have nothing in common with the Chinese except skin colour and looks. I am Singaporean -period. The master race, Lord of the Realm.<br><br>Look at Australians, Canadians, Americans - the majority race is white - English or British stock  - that de-ephasized Englishness and co-opted values from other cultures as required to forged a new "race".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Every profession faces foreign competition, whether it is the IT sector or in medicine. If foreign IT professionals can do the same job as us for a lower price, employers will either employ foreigners or move the entire company to India. Radiologists have lost their jobs to Indian doctors, so why not IT jobs?<br><br>Many IT jobs in Europe and in the US have gone to foreigners as well. The only way forward is to move to higher value jobs. There are no jobs in Singapore for diagnostic radiologists, so these doctors have to move into therapeutic radiology or lose their jobs. If there are too many Indian programmers willing and able to take your job for less, you will have to go into R&amp;D or some other higher value services that the foreigner cannot do.<br><br>Nobody owes us a living. Why go into a field that is already filled to capacity? With so many people doing IT and media studies, of course it will be difficult to get jobs in these fields. Young people should go into rapidly emerging industries such as nanotechnology, robotics and biotechnology.</div>
