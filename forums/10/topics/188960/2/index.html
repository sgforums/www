They are in the lab (chemical) department. The new person was given a dunno what scientist position cause she got Phd.<br><br>So during the her training, the diploma holders still have to teach her how to do certain chemical test.

If not eveyone would think she very good.<br><br>Let me tell your a very interesting thing, this Phd don't even know how to use a pipette. She is suppose to use those rubber sucker and attach it to the end of the pipette to suck up the chemicals.<br><br>Guess what she did!!! She use her mouth.<br><br>We all know that if a container is used to hold a chemical, we are supposed to thouroughly clean the container before putting in another chemical right?, cause we don't want any reaction mah. This simple thing she also dunno.<br><br>Now let's get back to the manager. Those who studied chemistry before should know that we cannot add water to a big volume of concentrated acid.<br><br>One fine day that kuku manager almost did and almost cause a major explosion. Luckily my wife stopped her just before she pour water into a huge container of concentrated acid.<br><br>Now are these Phd and Master degree holder foriegn talents??<br><br>YES!!! in the 'EYES OF THE GAHMEN'.<br><br>NO!!!!!!!!!

Soon all manufacturer will move to Vietnam/China/Indonesia</strong><br></blockquote>with higher wages , manufacturers should at least expect higher skilled workers, something we could try to provide though education to attract companies who need to manufacture goods of higher quality<br>no one said it would be easy , you don't have to sound like the world is going to end<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Kariage:<br><strong><br>5. Big IT companies will move out from Singapore. Small IT companies will be closed down since the overhead cost will be too high.</strong><br></blockquote>big it companies would move out and create more business room for small local it companies, in IT what matters is whether you are worth the price, if you are , the salary should not be a problem, if you suck then you shouldn't even be there in the first place, you should be here playing CS with me<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Kariage:<br><strong><br>6. The shipyards and container ports will move to a cheaper place.</strong><br></blockquote>not if we provide better services, would you rather pay more at a port with your goods intact and sent safely on their way , or less at a port thats slow and loses track of your goods the moment they're unloaded?<br><br><blockquote><br>The correct thing to do:<br><br>1. Let the foreigner do the dirty jobs, they are willing to do it with low salary. Singaporean should aim themself to do a higher status jobs. Someone who are not capable of doing higher status job can either stay jobless or downgrade their expectation. It is THEIR choice.<br><br>2. Don't worry about the numbers of PRs here. For example, in Bahrain, one of the developed country in the middle east, the amount of PRs are 3 times of their citizen. A problem? NO. Bahrain is one of the most prosperous country in the middle east.[/b]</blockquote>firstly i feel that i wouldn't mind those "dirty jobs" if they pay higher, and even if they don't pay higher, they should allow one to have chances to advance in their careers. currently the way workers are treated is appalling. and if you haven't noticed more and more of these "dirty jobs" are being taken by locals.   locals who are often cheated out of their pay of only hundreds by the same peole who hire them for these "dirty jobs", not to mention verbal abuse.<br>who in their right mind would go for these jobs if they have a choice? pay's like shIt, and you get treated like shIt too!<br><br>and this is singapore, not bahrain, at least in bahrain you don't have to face someone's Arse everytime you sit down in a train of course PRs are helping there! and don't forget, chewing gum's banned here but still being sold across the causeway. what works for others may not nesessarily work for us</div>

This is because back home, the companies they work for do not have an establish set of procedures and they have a much complicated system of doing things.

            <div class='col-md body'>One must acknowledge, that we are a nation of immigrants and decendents of immigrants. However, when the sovrignty of our country was forged, the so were "Singaporeans". An identity. A commitment to each other that we have the common interests of our nation and families at heart. Our forefathers built this nation and have passed on the baton to us.<br><br>Im not gonna say that we can do without forign tallent. I say rather that they are almost essential to the betterment of our economy.  However i stress the important point that there should be a distinction between singaporeans and forigners. To be singaporean should be a privilage. It should carry exclusive rights. As such it should have some value. These rights and privilages should not be handend out on large scales thru reckless issuing of PR and resident status. Rather, like other countries and like singapore in the past, there should be strict criteria that determine the level of commitment individuals have to our nation.<br><br>I do not believe that our country is being raped. Rather i say that we are being prostituted. Those that we chare with the responsibility of taking the helm of our nation , sad to say, have a clear disconnect with the masses. In prostitution it is not the prostitute that makes any gain. It is ultimately the pimp that reaps the greatest reward.<br><br>We have our indipendence. Now a new war must be fought. A fight for freedom and rights.  Rights  that the people determine. Singaporeans. This will unify us.<br><br>Remember, there is no Malay, Indian, Chinese or Eurasian. SUch terms are colonial classifications and are irrelevant. There are only SINGAPOREANS and Forigners.</div>
