              <p>Yes he did have to take those political actions. Thats why I
                  think he is a typical politician, just the same, not really unique.
                  What is the difference with other politicians who change course
                  depending on which way the wind blows?</p>
              <p>I did watch the US campaign. At first I have good impression of
                  this guy.......young,  energetic, and being black, there is a
                  sense of freshness and change, and being the underdog it is easy to
                  sympathize with him. I wanted him to win and rooted for him.</p>
              <p>But after a while cracks begin to show, and it seems he got
                  corrupted by the campaign whirlwind. He sells his principles out.
                  Or maybe there was no principle, it was just a show only, like a
                  good salesman conning you.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>Didnt he at first want to 'unify' , avoid 'politics of
                  destruction'  so on etc, sounds so good, but by middle of
                  process when Hillary was fighting hard and almost catching up, he
                  himself participated in this 'politics of destruction'. He did
                  negative attacks.</p>
              <p>Another one, anti-NAFTA. This is very significant. This episode
                  paints him as a total politician.</p>
              <p>What is the difference between him and Hilarry on this
                  anti-NAFTA issue? None. Both are pretending and lying, they know
                  free trade is good, but they become turncoat anti-NAFTA and racing
                  with each other trying to slam NAFTA. They said all sorts of lies,
                  saying wanting to re-negotiate, when renegotiation is not posible,
                  the treaty is done deal.</p>
              <p>Third, the most cringe worthy moment....he dumped his pastor to
                  save his own skin.</p>
              <p>Actually he didnt want to admit he attend a militant black
                  church which sometimes slam white people, it is uncomfortable for
                  him. For me, it is understandable black churches sometimes slam
                  white people, thats not such a shocking thing. But Obama is put in
                  an awkward position, embarassing position, and he had to
                  pretend.</p>
              <p>First speech abt it, sounds so noble, it is a 'craft' or a PR
                  trick to mask his true past in that church and deflect attention.
                  That is still ok. But the worst is when he strongly dumped his
                  pastor later. I got very bad vibe from this. From a guy-next-door
                  image, sincere-guy image, he totally don the mantle of an ultimate
                  politician, quick and adept, and willing to stab his own pastor
                  when occasion calls for it.</p>
              <p>In life, certain things just cannot be done. He reminds me of a
                  son who goes into business, then back-stab his own father to
                  further his business interest.</p>
              <p>What is the difference with this? Ok little bit diff. He is a
                  man who goes into politics, then back-stab his own 20-year pastor
                  to further his political interest.</p>
              <p>Ok another one.......initially I was impressed with his
                  intellect, in the debates he is very good, especially on foreign
                  policy.</p>
              <p>Now he is back-pedalling, and has to repeatedly pander to Jewish
                  groups. Endlessly and ceaselessly. You can see the plot already,
                  can see the scenario.</p>
              <p>So now, and in future if he becomes president, he will just
                  continue to 'prove' his jewish-friendliness, and all those early
                  talks about Iran and Middle East, about new direction in foreign
                  policy, will just be moot, empty talk. He will be taken hostage and
                  wont dare to take any action which might offend those groups. A
                  very typical pandering politician who has to sell himself.</p>
              <p>I have more to rant, but now I am hungry and I must go for
                  dinner....see u all later....</p>

              <p>No, the problem is not utopia. The problem is that libertarians happen to be the morons who don't like government regulation. Why? Because government regulation dampens their ability to make money. Now, fast forward to the subprime crisis. When the lack of oversight led to the crisis, the bankers screamed for government help. You can tell the disconnect right away. These fuckers just want to bitch rape the people.</p>

              <p>Hillary lost because of the democratic camp's infighting, where we see some of her supporter base voting for obama. if nominated, i think hillary will command a greater chance to win the election rather then obama.</p>
              <p>McCain had been the sole victor of this fight between the 2 candidates, and his support has risen from 20+% to 40+%. it will only be a few months before he reaches the "magical" 50% to stand a fair chance of winning. when that moment comes, no matter how bad bush's administration is, both camps will need to fight equally hard to win over votes to win.</p>
              <p>back to the clintons, i still think that choosing them will be value for money, with bill being an experienced advisor, being a former 2-terms president, who, well, did reasonably well with the economy,as opposed to bush's administration.</p>
              <p>obama, on the other hand, is inspiring, but he lacks the proposal on what and how exactly he will do to help bring USA back on track. all he has is charisma and nothing else. we didn't even heard of him, and any of his achievement (if there's any), before his nomination campaign.</p>

              Maybe angels are a homogeneous lot but we mortals are more complicated. Obama's father was an African, Ghanaian to be precise, while his mother a US ang moh. Osama, on the other hand, is middle eastern.

              <p>I am not sure about Obama being Black. His father is Black but his mother is White; he is a mixed race. But see the way he claimed to be Black. A clever political attempt to be affiliated with the Black community. <br><br>Now his attempt to affiliate with the Jewish community. This just proves that this guy can play the racial card and the playing racial card can be a dangerous game.</p>
