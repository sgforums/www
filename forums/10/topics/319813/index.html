              <p>The victory belongs to the American people - those ordinary folks in the cities, in the rural areas, in the mountains, along the coastal areas, and around the lakes.</p>
              <p>They should be proud to have rejected any efforts by any one group to shut out anyone from participating in the electoral system.</p>
              <p>They should be proud that their political parties have reached a mature level of politics that create rules that are fair and equally applicable to every political nominee willing to put their own stakes in fair competition to win the nomination.</p>
              <p>This is politics in the First World, where the print and broadcast media is not in the grip of the Government, nor fettered by threats, nor succumb to political pressures from anyone or any institution.</p>
              <p>Full and unbias information is available freely to every member of the American public, and they are exposed to the full spectrum of diverse public opinion and debate on the politics of the day through every known public media.</p>
              <p>The competition between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has seen them making very sharp and critical comments towards the politics and agenda that each has for the American people.</p>
              <p>They did not resort to name callings, ridicule, nor character assassination - and neither have they tolerated any of their subordinates using any of these afore-mentioned disrespectful ways of treating their competing public image.</p>
              <p>The entire period in which the Democratic Primary was held, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had maintained civil and respectful attitude towards each other. </p>
              <p>LKY and his Political Party has alot to learn if he believe that Singapore is a member of the First World Community - as his political methods is not far from resembling that of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe. </p>
              <p>If Barack Obama should become the first 'Black' or Afro-American President of the USA, MM LKY will have some explaning to do for his views concerning the IQ of Black People -</p>

              <p>Not much feeling.......no opinion....</p>
              <p>At first I like that guy......young....seem sincere...</p>
              <p>Then when I watch more, he is just a typical politician.....not as noble or unique like the first impression.....</p>
              <p>The things which made me 'lose feelings' are numerous.....</p>
              <p>First, selling protectionism, anti-NAFTA.</p>
              <p>Free trade is actually good for them, but he stoop low and pretend otherwise.</p>
              <p>Second, making appearances and speeches at Jewish groups. 'Pandering' is the word he often use, but he himself indulge in.</p>
              <p>Third, cant remember......alot....</p>
              <p>Worst impression I got is when he dumped his pastor to save his own skin.</p>
              <p>I just think they are all the same.....the thing 'special' about Obama is that he is a better salesman. It's all the business of selling. He can talk, like a good salesman, can pretend, can make shows. If he is a salesman, he can sell u insurance or floor mops<br>, that is his type.</p>
              <p>Actually McCain might be better in terms of personality. He is much older, has conviction, has maturity. That guy Obama is too showy.</p>
              <p>But problem is McCain party has neo-cons, which is bad for the world.</p>
              <p>I just hope under Obama presidency, neo-cons will fall out of favour. They should take the back seat, or just disappear altogether. Be gone.</p>
              <p>But Obama personally, no comment......he will continue the Bush style, I confirm....., he will lie and lie and spin and spin.....typical politician...all the same...</p>

              <p>Come on, if he don't play politics at all, he won't even stand a single chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for his pastors, do you think he should stick up for his pastor after what the pastor have said?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He tried his best to tone down the issue by delivering a very fine speech, yet his pastors is sabotaging obama's slot at the presidency for his own personal agenda.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://movies.sgforums.com/users/17946">Atobe</a>, stop praising the US like it is perfect. Did you even bother to see how bias the news reporting can be?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have fox news, CNN at times and etc, which all have their own political agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the nomination is civil? Where the hell have you been? Did you even notice what is Hiliary's campaign has done to obama?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>What? On <strong>average</strong> it is true. Black usually score lower in IQ test, but there are exceptions. Also, just because asians USUALLY score higher does not mean there isn't a dumb asian...</p>
              <p>And blacks not being able to do well is mainly because of their enviroment. Blacks americans are usually living in places where they do not have a better enviroment to study as compared to most white americans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But this does not mean we should offer any less support for black americans in their educational efforts. In fact, more focus should be aimed at peope who did not have a good enviroment to study.</p>

              <p>Yes he did have to take those political actions. Thats why I think
              he is a typical politician, just the same, not really unique. What is
              the difference with other politicians who change course depending on
              which way the wind blows?</p>
              <p>I did watch the US campaign. At first I have good impression of
              this guy.......young,  energetic, and being black, there is a sense of
              freshness and change, and being the underdog it is easy to sympathize
              with him. I wanted him to win and rooted for him.</p>
              <p>But after a while cracks begin to show, and it seems he got corrupted by the campaign whirlwind. He sells his principles out. Or maybe there was no principle, it was just a show only, like a good salesman conning you.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>Didnt
              he at first want to 'unify' , avoid 'politics of destruction'  so on
              etc, sounds so good, but by middle of process when Hillary was fighting
              hard and almost catching up, he himself participated in this 'politics
              of destruction'. He did negative attacks.</p>
              <p>Another one, anti-NAFTA. This is very significant. This episode paints him as a total politician.</p>
              <p>What is the difference between him and Hilarry on this
              anti-NAFTA issue? None. Both are pretending and lying, they know free
              trade is good, but they become turncoat anti-NAFTA and racing with each
              other trying to slam NAFTA. They said all sorts of lies, saying wanting
              to re-negotiate, when renegotiation is not posible, the treaty is done
              deal.</p>
              <p>Third, the most cringe worthy moment....he dumped his pastor to save his own skin.</p>
              <p>Actually
              he didnt want to admit he attend a militant black church which
              sometimes slam white people, it is uncomfortable for him. For me, it is
              understandable black churches sometimes slam white people, thats not
              such a shocking thing. But Obama is put in an awkward position,
              embarassing position, and he had to pretend.</p>
              <p>First speech abt it, sounds so noble, it is a 'craft' or a PR
              trick to mask his true past in that church and deflect attention. That
              is still ok. But the worst is when he strongly dumped his pastor later.
              I got very bad vibe from this. From a guy-next-door image, sincere-guy
              image, he totally don the mantle of an ultimate politician, quick and
              adept, and willing to stab his own pastor when occasion calls for it.</p>
              <p>In
              life, certain things just cannot be done. He reminds me of a son who
              goes into business, then back-stab his own father to further his
              business interest.</p>
              <p>What is the difference with this? Ok little
              bit diff. He is a man who goes into politics, then back-stab his own
              20-year pastor to further his political interest.</p>
              <p>Ok another one.......initially I was impressed with his intellect, in the debates he is very good, especially on foreign policy.</p>
              <p>Now
              he is back-pedalling, and has to repeatedly pander to Jewish groups.
              Endlessly and ceaselessly. You can see the plot already, can see the
              scenario.</p>
              <p>So now, and in future if he becomes president, he will
              just continue to 'prove' his jewish-friendliness, and all those early
              talks about Iran and Middle East, about new direction in foreign
              policy, will just be moot, empty talk. He will be taken hostage and
              wont dare to take any action which might offend those groups. A very
              typical pandering politician who has to sell himself.</p>
              <p>I have more to rant, but now I am hungry and I must go for dinner....see u all later....</p>
