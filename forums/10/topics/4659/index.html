Bush<br>- loses people who he apparently loves (even though he overkills them in the electric chairs in Texas, without substantial evidence necessarily, under the guise of justice)<br>- becomes "most popular man in the world", or something close to that<br>- becomes the biggest patriot in recent history<br>- becomes extremely smart somehow, and an EXCELLENT speaker, after apparently being really stupid and folky for a long time, and able to plan strategic attacks and scheme plans<br>- gets huge budgeting capabilities to spy on Americans all over...<br>- gets huge budgeting capabilities to enlarge the military and it's branches<br>- gets the attention diverted from the Enron scandle he was tied into illegally<br>- turns his country into a blind mass that would no longer critisize or question him, even if many clues point to him being GUILTY for Something...<br><br>George Bust Jr. did not win the voting for president, yet he magically became president... and before that, he made some wholesome sales with Osama Bin Laden's family, for much oil, which America needed because of the rising gas prices. He was seen flying around in Enron jets to campaign for presidency, even though later on he denied knowing anything about Enron or it's business. He was convieniantly far off from America when the planes hit, and the one jet that was supposed to hit Air Force One was convieniantly "saved" by some people onboard.<br>Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong...</div>
