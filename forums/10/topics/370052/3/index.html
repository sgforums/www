              <p>Well, i don't think everyone in SG is living a luxurious life. Despite what they say abt our GDP growth, i don;t think it has filtered down to every citizen in SG.

Just look at their racism &amp; religious bigotry even today, anything goes over there. That to me is no democracy, that's stupidity, bcsue you only create hatred among ppl. In the 50's, if u were black in America, u're supposed to sit at the back seats of the buses, no blacks are allowed to sit in the front seats then. WTF is that? if not stupidity.          </p>

Protest is disruptive, dedates issue that is sensitive are less diserable and urgly, but you know what it is the abilities to voice your opinon and because of this protest and talks about race that is propelling the society to move forward.</p>

Are you an even more Idiot.....wannable.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Have I said I’m against democracy? Naturally, the Govt is answerable to the voters, why else would citizens be voting? Read closely what I have said before your start sprouting your views. Least u think this is an explaination to you it is not, I certainly don’t owe u one, but its just to clarify my earlier pts.:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Here’s what I said:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">“As for freedon of speech its defiantely important if we are to grow into vibrant society with diversity of views. And while this freedom is important, so is respect for others beliefs &amp; custom followed by why I thought western democracy is stupid.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Democracy is definitely necessary if a society is to progress. What I have    issues with is not with democracy (D) or freedom of speech (FOS) in itself, but rather how in the west, among historical &amp; culture reasons, D &amp; FOS is being used to justify or fuel racism &amp; religious bigotry. – THAT”S the issue I have &amp; if that’s what’s called democracy, then its stupid!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Just because u have D &amp; FOS doesn’t give u the right to hate someone who’s a ABC, (American Born Chinese), Asian American, African American, Latinos, Or that if u are a different religious background or an atheist, they don’t wish to have any business dealings with u. The ripple effects of these is when u meet a different-colour<span>  </span>person on<span>  </span>the street, he might hate u, but this hate is not directly to u, it came from someone else who hated him earlier.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">If democracy means one can hate a person fr no rhyme or reason, or something that he/she cannot change (eg, skin colour) or because he doesn’t worship the same God or doesn’t believe in one, what’ stopping me from hating him back? And my family &amp; his family? <br>So if this what democracy allows me to do, then I say its stupid! Because eventually, if yr wife, sister works late in the night, u worry who she’s gonna bump on the streets, hopefully not a racist Or a business deal that turns sour cause u don’t belong to the same religious group, then something is seriously wrong.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;    ">Lastly, I read the western infor. for the same reason u read my post, &amp; if that makes me a idiot wannabe, then I guess it makes u a confirm one.</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12pt;    '><span>      </span></span></span></p>

              <p><br>We are not so call living a luxurious life, we dun have yachts or nice mansion and private jets to play with. For past 2 quarters, we are at 3.3% unemployment, anything below 2% is consider, full employment, cos some of these Singapore simply dun want to work, the bookies, the loansharkers, the horse racers, the pimps and their bosses, the kopitiam precarious workers etc etc are not registered as employed, so in a way, 3.3% is consider very low. The current electronic and service sector retrenchment are mostly foreigners, not countable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to racism, dun compare us with the black, the Americans have the black and white to take care of, we got more than that...half white, half black, full black, full white, brownish, half brownish etc etc...by only looking at our racial harmony for the past 50 years, we are so good that a foreigner can suit into our racial harmony state quickly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, there are lots of democracy of diverse culture and believes, same goes to communism and socialism, one country differ from the others. But the main role of democracy is still there, that is freedom to move.</p>

              <p>You are out of the Hole meh?  You chose to be in the Hole that is your decision.....but don't tell people they are not in the hole...so are you sure you are standing at the edge of the hole and want to reach out to those in the hole? Or you are simply trying to tell those in the Hole see I am better?</p>
              <p>Do you not think that you can do better if you leave the hole and really provide the resources to help those in the hole?  </p>
