              <p><br>No, if we look at other 1st world countries in Asia alone, we are still far from some of these countries. Our older generation who are from the third world to the first world is still very much old minded, few accept changes, whereas most still to old way of doing things, therefore it will take another generation before we can actually see the peak.</p>

              <p>What is decline, and what is rise?</p>
              <p>Life had always been a roller coaster ride, filled with ups and downs, downs and ups. What makes Singaporeans different is their resilience to ride downturns and 'chiong' on the upturns to rise even further ever before.</p>
              <p>Happened to our forefathers, our fathers and now upon the courage of the new generation. Cowards die many times, but brave ones die only once - when their time is up. We aint dead yet for sure, still breathing to 'piah' ahead and let the whiners rest and bemoan their fate while we show them the way forward.</p>

              <p>What is freedom to you? Singapore must be freed from the colonial rule of the brits, freed from being part of a system that favour one particular race. What is so scary about that?</p>
              <p>a few problematic stupid teens can possibly make any change, let them be free. in the unlikely event that they do make changes, it is up to us to see why, and we are supposed to be more matured and smart to decide how to handle the changes.</p>
              <p>Workers going on strikes is something people of this generation doesnt know. Many are already on strike by not working. But there is no problem, average singaporean can go home to their parents in HDB and a meal means only an extra pair of chopstick. What is going on strike?</p>

              Life has never been smooth sailing for an individual as you had described. There are bounds to be ups and downs like a roller-coaster.
              
              For a country to be in roller-coaster ride, it is definitely a scary experience for the middle class and poor singaporeans. It also says a lot about the government that it doesn't know what it is doing and where it is going.

              <p>No doubt Singapore is what it is now because LKY dictatorship. We live a luxury life, we have solid economy and social framework thanks to him. But what exactly is his goals? To be the richest country in the world? I believe its time to end this race and start concentrating on its citizen for a change. Singapore should open up to more freedom by now. We should be enjoying free speech by now. We should be living a democratic life by now. But reality is, we're still living under oppression even though we've achieved so many things. What's the point? Why trade freedom for wealth? I think its time for a change. Not only because its about time, its also because we deserve it.</p>

              <p>I don't mean to flame you or anything, but your point of view is really superficial and shallow. It seems right out of the Social Studies Textbook. While I do agree that too much freedom is bad, you seemingly are against the idea of freedom at all.</p>
              <p>How did Singapore get to where it is today? How did Singapore gain independence even? Now, if our forefathers had the same mindset as your POV, they would be going "Hmm why do we need freedom? Why do we need independence? Isn't life under the British good enough? Why strike? Why fight?".</p>
              <p>Ultimately, a population of less than half of what we have now had the right mindset. A mindset to choose freedom and support those who led the fight for it. They had the freedom to choose of who should lead them, and they made a relatively right choice. How can you even say that freedom or choices is disadvantageous. It was the factor that led us to where we are today. While we have the right, we better exercise it properly and don't take it for granted that gahmen will lead us well into the next hundred years. Think thoroughly before acting.</p>

              <p>With the continued troubles that the Singapore economy has been facing since 2005 till now - in mid-2009 - it will not be a surprise if that 40% size of troubled Singapore households would have ballooned.</p>
