            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Details of the Racial Discrimination Policy against Singaporeans in the "Peitu Mama" single parent Peoples Republic of China mothers in Singapore!</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>On January 9, 2008, I wrote the following blog, "Lee Kuan Yew's racial discrimination should be condemned." In it I pointed out there exists a policy of bringing mothers with young children from the Peoples Republic of China to be educated at government expense in Singapore at the exclusion of native born Singapore citizen children.<br><br>I have received a comment on my blog on this policy which explains in detail this illegal work being done in Singapore and how their Chinese single mothers either divorced or with illegitimate children end up as prostitutes at Singapore's red light areas!<br><br>I thank the writer in describing this illegal racial discriminatory practice.<br><br>The gentleman's comment is in italics below and in bold letters.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><strong>Lee Kuan Yew's racial discrimination should be condemned.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I hear Singapore government encourages young infant children from People's Republic of China to attend schools in Singapore. Several thousand, already in Singapore; are given scholarships of $500.00 per month including free schools fees and books. Their mothers, for some strange reason, not their fathers, are permitted to immigrate to Singapore to care for them. These mothers who are usually divorced or single mothers usually find work in Singapore in massage parlors and as sales girls where the clientele is entirely Chinese, since they or these children, speak no English.<br><br>These scholarships are given only to Chinese children from the PRC. Not Malay children or Indian children even though Malays and Indians are also Singaporeans!<br><br>As the Singapore press is both state owned and controlled, it is impossible to read any independent opinion on this. The government censors suppress any information about this. LeeÂ’s reason for this policy should be obvious...<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/01/details-of-racial-discrimination-policy.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/01/details-of-racial-discrimination-policy.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I found the following on the author's website which is quoted as the source.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Anonymous said...<br>This is a true fact which is being kept from the Mainstream Media &amp; from the public. Instead of infant, these are actually school-going PRC kids (6 years &amp; over) who come with their mothers to live/study/work in Spore. Of course, with Spore's high cost of living, the mothers or "Peitu Mama" [Mandarin meaning accompanying student's mother] often either shacked up with a well-to-do Sporean boyfriend or find work in vice eg. massage, prostitution or hostessing in Karaoke lounge. The husband or father in this equation is a non-entity or will soon be when the peitu mama find her sugar daddy. This has been a known fact since 1999 when the door opened up to them. Since then there have been numerous social problems as marriage breakups, illegal massage parlours, rampant prostitution &amp; sprouting of many seedy karaoke bar along Joo Chiat &amp; Geylang areas. Despite the social issues, the govt persists with it as revenues from each PRC child/mother comes to thousands of dollars for the privilege to live/study/work in Spore. Also, a network of migration agents [slavers] that exploit &amp; benefit from this scheme.<br><br>Also, there are even boarding schools catering to PRC students whom are given university scholarships as well as having their room &amp; board paid for by the govt. According to a reliable source, they are operated by well connected to govt persons who are given this business opportunity to "make money without any risk". On the other hand, native Sporeans can't even go on to university because a great deal of the places are already allocated to these PRC scholars. Many ex-Sporeans migrated to Australia &amp; NZ because their children couldn't even get a place in Spore's unis. Their children have done well at uni because they have good command of English unlike PRC scholars. This will be Spore's loss. The leading reason given when apply for Good Conduct Certificate required for migration is "for children's education". The govt is well aware of this brain drain but chose to carry on its own political agenda.The reason why PRC students are given such privilege are political &amp; pure economics. The PRC school system is rigid requiring students to be submissive &amp; obedient which dovetails well with the Spore system. In fact, their school curriculum is so outmoded &amp; backward that PRC students are at a disadvantage on a global arena. PRC students are required to learn Chinese classical studies, drama, ancient texts etc. In a digital age, these are rather irrelevant &amp; useless. In PRC schools, PC networking are rare as they can't type in English beyond elementary phrases &amp; also for political reasons. English &amp; IT proficiency are the 2 key areas of Spore education. This is the main reason why Spore education is so coveted by PRCians &amp; the mothers are even ready to sell their bodies to fund it for their kids. The revenues behind this scheme is considerable for the govt. Secondly, PRCians are conditioned from young not to create problems on a political stage - thus they are deemed suitable for Spore &amp; future citizens.The govt's political agenda intends to marginalize native Sporeans by depriving their children of a higher education while allowing foreigners to benefit. What kind of govt does that to its own people? or rather, the people who gave away their powers to be subjugated to this extent [Disenfranchised]. Sad!</span></div>

These citizens are able to distinguish right from wrong, etc.  As long as we keep the children, who still need adult's protection, away from the vices, there should be minimum negative impact to the society.  If there is a demand for it and the and the benefits outweigh the side effects, then I'm all for casinos and prostitution.

              <p>From talking to educated Singaporeans, it seems that they are open-minded and know how they want their  country to be.  They pretty much can control their weakness for the vices.  The controls that the government put in place are as reasonable as other governments.  For example, in some countries, the nightclubs and bars have to close by 2 or 3 am, so the citizens can have a decent chance of making it to  work the next day.  In SG, the gov does not limit the closing time, assuming that their citizens have a mind enough to go home at respectable hour and go to work the next day.  There are other examples.  But, overall the rules in SG are not much different than some of the rules other gov put in place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore needs to make the country as tourist-friendly as possible if it ever wants to compete against countries with much more to offer like Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, etc.  Sentosa is just about what SG has to offer, and not very good beach at that.  If a Japanese tourist can choose one country to visit in SEA, it would likely not be SG, unless SG has something that can't be found elsewhere or unless the SG gov makes it worthwhile.</p>
