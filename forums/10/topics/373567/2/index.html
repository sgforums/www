              <p><strong>When coal miners strike occur during the worst winter periods, and public transport workers suddenly walked out of their work places during the most inconvenient times - Magaret Thatcher made it her goal in her second term to curtail the powers of the union, and removed the ability to launch wild cat strikes in UK.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Did that not benefit everyone ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do realise that reducing the power of the unions is not the only thing she did? I have no problem with her reducing the power of the unions, but her policy of privatising the national industries in the UK.</p>

              <p>Maybe I disagree with the PAP's view of giving benefits to the majority while ignoring the minorites?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Prior to Margaret Thatcher's becoming PM of UK, the previous PM was Edward Heath, who was subjected to pressures from the various powerful trade unions that were not answerable to the electorates, and did as much to protect their own interests. Interestingly, in an autobiography of her, it stated that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=bVaNaOeY4BUC&amp;amp;amp;pg=PA67&amp;amp;amp;lpg=PA67&amp;amp;amp;dq=margaret+thatcher+industrial+output+increase&amp;amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;amp;ots=5vVKMRgm_k&amp;amp;amp;sig=Qh0tgNMkE2Z5Kj_i8YRh3vBn9sQ&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;ei=gseaSrnqGtCLkAWBxsmcBw&amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;amp;resnum=8">industrial output did not drop much (if at all) and certainly not the 40% one might expect showing just how much overmanning existed then. (*1) </a></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Was it the fault of her policies that resulted in high unemployment in the early 1990s - just before she stepped down, or was it due to the recession that hit UK then ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wait? You are using Margaret's own autobiography to defend her?Even if the drop in manufactoring output is not 40 percent, why do you even think that Britian's industrial output should drop to begin with?</p>
              <p>So your only defense of Thatcher is she did not screw up bad enough?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Between 1979 and 1985, 1.5 million workers are laid off, industrial output dropped by 11 percent, trade in manufacturing dropped from a surplus to a deficit,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And wait, so you are also defending her because the economic meltdown occurred after she step down from office? So if the economic meltdown only occurs after Bush step down from power and when Obama is in power, you won't blame Bush and his policies for the economic meltdown?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do I need to defend Margaret Thatcher when her records are for every possible interpretation to fit everyone's different agenda in having a view about her ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Was it some people who expressed their frustration with the ruling party for a long period, or can you not accept the opinion of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2009-08/30/content_8633754.htm">nearly 14 million, who expressed through their vote in Japan’s general election (*2) </a>- based on news report of the count up to this hour ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How the hell do you determine that the majority of the people are voting against the ruling party for staying in power for a long period of time based on a few interviews? Can you seriously tell me that five or ten interviews is enough to say 14 million voters are voting based on the fact that the ruling party has been in power for 50 over years?</p>

              <p><strong>Same question is being asked with Singapore - why have we tolerated this situation for 52 years - since 1957, or 44 years since 1965 ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Is it not due to the same old "kiasu and kiasi" over cautious attitude of not facing a new world boldly, and believing in the same old fears that the incumbents continue to exploit for their own benefit ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The unemployment rate has hit 5.7% in Japan now, and they have been in similar economic limbo for the last ten years.</strong></p>

              <p>You are the one who defended Thatcher by saying it is the fault of the recession that increased unemplyoment rate in UK, yet you are backpedalling and saying that we should vote the PAP out of office due to the fact that we are in an recession?</p>

              <p>Was my statement about Thatcher a defense of her position ?</p>
              <p>Does she need any defending when her records speak for herself ?</p>
              <p>The view stated was an abstract from a review that I read over the web when googling for details, perhaps I should have qualify it better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We should vote the PAP out of office for the false claim of themselves being elites able to manage Singapore economy of GDP US$240 Billion, and deserving the approximately three million dollar wages paid to each of them.</p>
              <p>Yet they will need to wait for the positive results of the actions from the US President, who is paid less then US$500,000, to resolve his US economy with a GDP valued at US$14 Trillion.</p>

              <p><br>U may have an objective, the skill of politician is not the plan, as you know politics is dirty, you must know how to conn the public into believing in you,..the selling point is not to change the economy, that will be a manifesto that most will fall asleep,..know your audiences, the economy is not what peoples is looking for,..it is the society and the daily livinghood that peoples are up to it. In singapore, you cannot change much on the economy, and worst, if you make a promise that dun surface, you are going to get knock off the seats. Sell the idea of bring down the cost of living, tax and foreign influx will be more appropriate to get people to vote you.</p>

              <p><br> U may have an objective, the skill of politician is not the plan,
              as you know politics is dirty, you must know how to conn the public
              into believing in you,..the selling point is not to change the
              economy, that will be a manifesto that most will fall asleep,..know
              your audiences, the economy is not what peoples is looking for,..it
              is the society and the daily livinghood that peoples are up to it.
              In singapore, you cannot change much on the economy, and worst, if
              you make a promise that dun surface, you are going to get knock off
              the seats. Sell the idea of bring down the cost of living, tax and
              foreign influx will be more appropriate to get people to vote
              you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For eg, lowering of Minister paid, reduction of FTs, reducing of
              tax that will bring cost of living down will get you tremedous
              applaud and support from the ground ya.</p>

              <p>Politics is not something that is supposed to be fun. It should be boring, it should bore the hell out of people and make people think about who are they voting for and etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every single political party can easily promoise all those things, but only an idiot would vote for them based on simple political promise alone. You vote for them based on their political ideology, you vote for them because you view that their political ideology is able to fix the nation or fix the economy. If this is the case, then the party that simply talk the loudest and promise the most amount of thing would have come into power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not the view the PAP should adopt, this is not the view the opposition should adopt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If conning the public to vote for you is all that matters in a democracy, then democracy have failed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can lower tax for all you want and gain tons of votes, but that does not mean you are running the nation well.</p>

              <p>Yes, and justify why from your view of Thatcher based on your political views is valid. </p>
