              <p>The winds of change is blowing again, with Japan's Alternative Political Party - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/japans-opposition-favored-to-win-election-2009-08-20">the Democratic Party of Japan being sleighted to win and form the next government in September 2009(*1); </a> </p>
              <p>The incumbent Liberal Democratic Party will be replaced after governing Japan for more then 50 years.</p>
              <p>Amidst such uncertain times, it takes courage for the Japanese Citizens to take a bold step and opt for change to its present state of political and economic limbo that has existed for more then 10 years.</p>
              <p>Will the same cold wind blow and strengthen the hearts of Singaporeans ?</p>

              <blockquote>

              <h1>Opposition widely favored to win Japan election</h1>
              <p>By <a href="mailto:ltwaronite@marketwatch.com"><span style="color: #004176;">Lisa Twaronite</span></a>, MarketWatch</p>
              <p class="leadin">TOKYO (MarketWatch) -- Japanese voters will head to the polls Sunday, where they will likely send the ruling Liberal Democratic Party a message similar to the one heard in the U.S. last November: We want change.</p>
              <p>The main opposition Democratic Party of Japan has promised to deliver that change. It seeks to form a government with a focus on boosting domestic demand, rather than the LDP's traditional emphasis on supporting businesses and industry.</p>
              <p>But the DPJ has been vague on how this ambitious shift will be funded, in a country where government debt already tops 170% of gross domestic product.</p>
              <p>"The challenge facing Japan's government is obvious: diversifying the Japanese economy's base of growth from over-dependence on expansion of external demand," said Naomi Fink, Japan strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in Tokyo.</p>
              <p>"The financial crisis has indeed undermined Japan's postwar economic model, yet has created the potential for a reform-oriented administration to tap Japan's plentiful private-sector wealth," she said in a research report this week.</p>
              <p>The LDP's grip on power has been only rarely interrupted during the past five decades, but analysts say it is unlikely to fare well this weekend, when Japan holds its first lower-house election since September 2005.</p>
              <p>Recent opinion surveys predict a landslide for the DPJ, with an Asahi Shimbun poll tipping it to take 320 of the 480 seats up for grabs in the lower house, according to a Kyodo news report Thursday.</p>
              <p>The DPJ and smaller opposition parties already control the less-powerful upper house of the Diet. But the lower house, which holds the reins of power, is controlled by the LDP and its junior ally, the New Komeito party.</p>
              <h3>Greetings and promises</h3>
              <p>The election campaign period officially began last week, with candidates driving around the streets of their constituencies, waving and blaring their greetings and promises from megaphones.</p>
              <p>When DPJ Secretary-General Katsuya Okada was asked at a press briefing earlier this month about the key differences between his party's policies and those of the LDP, he reportedly said that "theirs is tailored toward agencies and organizations, while ours is toward each and every one."</p>
              <p>The global crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers last autumn "proved that Japan's traditional growth strategy led by exports no longer works," Okada said.</p>
              <p>The DPJ has promised to pay cash allowances of more than $3,000 per child to families, abolish highway tolls, make public high school tuition-free and provide more social programs -- all while postponing a hike in the country's 5% consumption tax. Yet officials haven't detailed how such measures would be funded.</p>
              <p>"Although the [DPJ] party has most recently issued an addendum to its manifesto outlining its growth strategy (aimed at increasing households' disposable income), public doubts abound over the practicality of plans to procure funds for its programs without aggravating Japan's already monumental fiscal deficits," Fink said.</p>
              <p>In real terms, the Japanese economy returned to positive growth in the April-June quarter, when GDP rose 0.9% from the January-March period, at an annualized pace of 3.7%.</p>
              <p>But nominal GDP fell 0.2%, meaning "the so-called recovery was entirely due to a 1.1% fall in prices," Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research wrote in a note. <a href="/story/japan-pulls-out-of-recession-in-april-june-quarter-2009-08-16-202300"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004176;">See full story on Japan GDP.</span></span></a></p>
              <p>"It may be thought that recovery from recession will help restore some support for the government. But it is worth noticing that this recovery was a statisticians' construct," said Reading.</p>
              <p>Data released Friday painted a relatively grim picture of Japan's economic situation in July, with unemployment hitting a new postwar record of 5.7% and deflation increasing at the fastest pace in decades. <a href="/story/japans-jobless-rate-hits-record-high-in-july-2009-08-27"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004176;">See full story on latest Japanese economic data.</span></span></a></p>
              <h3>Foreign investor keep buying</h3>
              <p>Outside of Japan, investors watching the political developments from afar appeared unfazed by the likely LDP defeat.</p>
              <p>Weekly data released by the Ministry of Finance has shown that overseas investors were net buyers of Japanese stocks for five of the last six weeks. In the one week seeing net outflows -- Aug. 16-22 -- the sales were attributed to profit-taking amid a rise in the yen, rather than any political factor.</p>
              <p>"Well aware of the pending shift, foreign investors have stepped up purchases of Japanese equities in recent weeks," and are "voting with their feet or pocket books," said Marc Chandler, head of global currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, in emailed comments.</p>
              <p>Given the DPJ's emphasis on boosting consumption, many strategists expect companies with high domestic-demand components to fare better than their foreign-demand-focused counterparts.</p>
              <p>Peter Eadon-Clarke and Shih-Han Huang, analysts at Macquarie Research in Tokyo, said in a recent report that a DPJ government would be "pro-consumption and clean energy at the expense of public investment."</p>
              <p>They recommended possible DPJ-victory beneficiaries such as education and child-care products maker Benesse Corp. <span id="quote670972853" class="quotepeekbase bgQuote down"><span class="bgChannel">/quotes/comstock/!9783</span> (<span class="symbol"><a title="Benesse Corp" href="/investing/stock/9783?countrycode=jp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004176; font-size: x-small;">JP:9783</span></span></a></span> <strong><span class="data bgLast symbol"><span style="font-size: x-small;">4,370</span></span></strong>, <span class="data bgChange symbol"><span style="font-size: x-small;">-40.00</span></span>, <span class="data bgPercentChange symbol"><span style="font-size: x-small;">-0.91%</span></span>) </span>, and Panasonic Corp. <span id="quote1997559906" class="quotepeekbase bgQuote down"><span class="bgChannel">/quotes/comstock/!6752</span> (<span class="symbol"><a title="Panasonic Corp" href="/investing/stock/6752?countrycode=jp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004176; font-size: x-small;">JP:6752</span></span></a></span> <strong><span class="data bgLast symbol"><span style="font-size: x-small;">1,478</span></span></strong>, <span class="data bgChange symbol"><span style="font-size: x-small;">-11.00</span></span>, <span class="data bgPercentChange symbol"><span style="font-size: x-small;">-0.74%</span></span>) </span>, which could profit from a boost to disposable incomes. <a href="/story/investment-plays-eyed-for-the-japanese-election"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004176;">Read more on Japan election plays.</span></span></a></p>
              <p>But so far, there is no evidence that a shift to domestic demand has begun, said Cantor Fitzgerald economist Uwe Parpart.</p>
              <p>Parpart said in emailed comments Thursday that companies tilted most toward foreign demand have fared the best so far this year and are continuing to do so.</p>
              <p>Citing a study by Nikkei, he said stocks of firms with at least 60% of total sales coming from outside the country had risen 40.4%, compared with a 19.7% rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Average through the close of trading Aug. 14.</p>
              <p>The foreign-demand stocks account for 14% of Nikkei components but comprise more than 25% of the index's value, he said.</p>
              <p>"But quite possibly such underperformance to date is a plus and an opportunity as the DPJ takes power and jacks up domestic demand," he said.</p>
              <h3>Family tradition</h3>
              <p>If the DPJ's victory unfolds as expected, the head of the party, 62-year-old Yukio Hatoyama, will likely become Japan's prime minister. Hatoyama started out in the LDP before leaving the party in 1993.</p>
              <p>One change a Hatoyama administration won't bring is a move away from perceptions of nepotism.</p>
              <p>The three prime ministers who preceded Aso all had fathers who were either a Cabinet minister or served as prime minister themselves.</p>
              <p>Hatoyama wouldn't break this family tradition: His father was foreign minister, and one of his grandfathers was prime minister in the 1950s. In fact, that grandfather, Ichiro Hatoyama, was the LDP's founder and first prime minister, and his main opponent was Shigeru Yoshida -- current Prime Minister Aso's grandfather.</p>

              <p>Since its first election victory in 1955, the Liberal Democratic Party had governed Japan continuously since.</p>
              <p>Now Japanese votes have decided to throw out the long term Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in favor of the Alternative Party - Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) - for all the shannigan dealings within the LDP that could not solve the economic woes of Japan.</p>
              <p>Channelnews Asia reported in the 9.00pm news that the DPJ won 241 seats compared to LDP's 60 seat.</p>
              <p>Tokyo Broadcasting System had earlier given a forecasted landslide for DPJ of 321 seats in the 480 seat Lower House of Japan's Parliament.</p>
              <p>While Nippon Television predicted a DPJ total of 324 seats against the LDP's 96.</p>
              <p>The designated new Prime Minister from DPJ is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/1001707/1/.html">‘Yukio Hatoyama, who pitches himself as someone fighting for change for the people of Japan, plans to slash wasteful public spending and cut down the authority of the bureaucrats. (*1) </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What possibly is the main cause for this wind of change to take effect in Japan - a nation reputed for its  political wisdom to maintain economic and social stability ?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1001716/1/.html">‘The LDP is credited with guiding Japan through its "economic miracle", but is also blamed for the malaise that set in during the 1990s and for free-market policies seen by many to have widened social inequality.’ (*2) </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could the DPJ have succeeded - if the LDP had played politics in the same manner as the PAP ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans will have to learn from the Japanese that the future is in the hands of the citizens, we are responsible for the situation that we find ourselves in - by allowing a political party to monopolise politics for 44 years, and blind to the continuous and frequent changes to the perimeters of fair play that only benefit itself.</p>

              <p>Magaret Thatcher came into power as PM of UK from 1979 and stepped down in 1990 - and was PM for THREE consecutive term in being re-elected.</p>
              <p>Her main achievement was dealing with the coal miners and its union that held UK consumers to ransom, and they were defanged during Thatcher's term.</p>
              <p>Besides defanging the trade unions, it was during her term as PM of UK that she reduced state intervention in the economy, embraced free markets and encouraged entrepreneurism.</p>
              <p>The previous decade of Labor Party of nationalisation was terminated, and all the various nationally-owned enterprises were privatised.</p>
              <p>The runaway inflation that plagued UK throughout the 1970s was faced head-on by Thatcher with her daring fiscal policies, which created controversies through out the late 1970s within the Conservative Party and with the economic gurus.</p>
              <p>It was only by 1983, when the UK economy responded to all her fiscal policies that UK became stronger with inflation beaten, and the unions disciplined.</p>
              <p>Magaret Thatcher remained popular even when her tough policies bite into the pockets of everyone but which had benefitted UK overall with her unique controversial approaches being called Thatcherism - which was recognised as setting the UK on the path to recovery and long term growth.</p>
              <p>Her resignation from the Conservative Party was not due to her failure with economic policies but with internal disagreement in having UK joining the Euro Single Currency - which she felt will undermine UK's own sterling pound currency.</p>
              <p><strong>How did Magaret Thatcher screw up the economy</strong> - when at the time she resigned from the Conservative Party, UK's economy was at its best since the inflationary period during the Labor Party rule in the 1970s - which saw the blight of constant union cat strikes that destabilised the economy ?</p>
              <p>Do you know who took over from her to lead the Conservative Party to lose the next election to Tony Blair from the Labor Party ?</p>

              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Magaret Thatcher came into power as PM of UK from 1979 and
                                      stepped down in 1990 - and was PM for THREE consecutive term in
                                      being re-elected.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Her main achievement was dealing with the coal miners and its
                                      union that held UK consumers to ransom, and
                                      they were defanged during Thatcher's term.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Besides defanging the trade unions, it was during her term as PM
                                      of UK that she reduced state intervention in the economy,
                                      embraced free markets and encouraged entrepreneurism.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The previous decade of Labor Party of nationalisation
                                      was terminated, and all the various nationally-owned enterprises
                                      were privatised.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The runaway inflation that plagued UK throughout the
                                      1970s was faced head-on by Thatcher with her daring fiscal
                                      policies, which created controversies through out the late
                                      1970s within the Conservative Party and with the economic
                                      gurus.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It was only by 1983, when the UK economy responded to all her
                                      fiscal policies that UK became stronger with inflation beaten, and
                                      the unions disciplined.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Magaret Thatcher remained popular even when her tough policies
                                      bite into the pockets of everyone but which had benefitted UK
                                      overall with her unique controversial approaches being called
                                      Thatcherism - which was recognised as setting the UK on the
                                      path to recovery and long term growth.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Her resignation from the Conservative Party was not due to her
                                      failure with economic policies but with internal disagreement in
                                      having UK joining the Euro Single Currency - which she felt
                                      will undermine UK's own sterling pound currency.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><strong>How did Magaret Thatcher screw up the economy</strong> -
                                      when at the time she resigned from the Conservative Party, UK's
                                      economy was at its best since the inflationary period during the
                                      Labor Party rule in the 1970s - which saw the blight
                                      of constant union cat strikes that destabilised the economy
                                      ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Do you know who took over from her to lead the Conservative
                                      Party to lose the next election to Tony Blair from the Labor
                                      Party ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wow, her policy benefited everyone?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you even know that proverty level in the UK has doubled despite the increase in GDP?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Industrial output of the UK has also dropped under her? What about the employment rates under her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Additionally, personal anacedotes aren't worth a damn. You can't say frustration with a ruling party for a long period of time is the primary reason why the LDP fall just because some people who was being interviewed is saying that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many people in the whole of Japan actually shares the same view? Can I have some sort of public polls?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, why do the Japanese have to wait for 54 years before they make a move? Why not vote against the LDP a few years earlier?</p>

              <p>Same question is being asked with Singapore - why have we tolerated this situation for 52 years - since 1957, or 44 years since 1965 ?</p>

                                      certainly not the 40% one might expect showing just how much
                                      overmanning existed then. (*1) </a></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Was it the fault of her policies that resulted in
                                      high unemployment in the early 1990s - just before she stepped
                                      down, or was it due to the recession that hit UK then ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wait? You are using Margaret's own autobiography to defend her?Even if the drop in manufactoring output is not 40 percent, why do you even think that Britian's industrial output should drop to begin with?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So your only defense of Thatcher is she did not screw up bad enough?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Between 1979 and 1985, 1.5 million workers are laid off, industrial output dropped by 11 percent, trade in manufacturing dropped from a surplus to a deficit,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And wait, so you are also defending her because the economic meltdown occurred after she step down from office? So if the economic meltdown only occurs after Bush step down from power and when Obama is in power, you won't blame Bush and his policies for the economic meltdown?</p>

              <p><strong>Was it some people who expressed their frustration with the

              <p>How the hell do you determine that the majority of the people are voting against the ruling party for staying in power for a long period of time based on a few interviews?

              <p><strong>Is it not due to the same old "kiasu and kiasi" over cautious
