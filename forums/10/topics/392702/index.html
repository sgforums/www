              <p>BEIJING: The family of a Singaporean killed in a car crash in China has been awarded compensation 2-1/2 times higher than usual, prompting heated debate among Chinese over whether a foreigner’s life is worth more than a local’s.</p>
              <p>Citing the higher cost of living in Singapore, a court in China’s central Hunan province ordered defendants to pay the victim’s family 800,000 yuan ($165,000) – more than twice the compensation set for locals.</p>
              <p>The defendants are appealing against the rare ruling, which has drawn scorn from local netizens and newspapers. They decried it as unjustified special treatment for foreigners – even as legal scholars backed the court’s decision.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old victim, Mr Chen Rui, was visiting his parents in Hunan’s Hengyang city when he died in an accident last March, the Singapore Consulate-General in Guangzhou told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Citing court documents, the China Youth Daily newspaper said that on the morning of March 9, Mr Chen was a passenger in a car that was involved in a four-vehicle pile-up on a highway in Hengyang. Mr Chen was the only fatality. Three locals were injured.</p>
              <p>A police investigation said the driver of a trailer and the driver of the car carrying Mr Chen were to blame for the crash.</p>
              <p>Following that, Mr Chen’s parents sued the two men for four million yuan in compensation.</p>
              <p>According to the China Youth Daily report, mainland-born Mr Chen had gone to Singapore to study years earlier. Upon graduation, he became a Singapore citizen. His parents were quoted as saying that he was their only child, and that his death had brought them significant emotional and economic distress.</p>
              <p>Traffic accident laws in China state that compensation for death and injury is calculated based on the average incomes of urban or rural residents in the region in which the accident took place.</p>
              <p>Using this, the defendants’ lawyers argued that Mr Chen’s family should be awarded 330,000 yuan, as would happen if he had been an urban resident from Hengyang.</p>
              <p>But the court ruled that that would be ‘unfair’. It ordered a much higher compensation of 800,000 yuan, arguing that Singapore, where Mr Chen lived, had higher income levels and living standards.</p>
              <p>The defendants are now appealing against this ruling.</p>
              <p>The case, first reported in Chinese newspapers on Wednesday, has prompted thousands of postings on Chinese online forums, the vast majority of them slamming the court’s decision.</p>
              <p>Several branded the judges ‘traitors’ and demanded to know why a foreigner’s life was ‘worth’ more than a local’s.</p>
              <p>A netizen nicknamed ‘Doctor Li Jing’ asked: ‘Are the Chinese people second-class citizens in their own country?’</p>
              <p>While it is not unusual for a news item to draw tens of thousands of angry comments online, newspapers have jumped on the bandwagon.</p>

              <p>A columnist in the state-controlled Global Times argued that ‘a life is a life’ and that ‘the standard should be the same for everyone’.</p>
              <p>But legal experts who spoke to The Straits Times found no fault with the ruling. Law scholar Gong Xiantian, of Peking University, said that while the law makes no special mention of foreigners, the court did right in granting a higher compensation since the victim lived in a place with higher living costs.</p>

              <p>Fair mah, at least the judge in beijin are getting wiser and more impartial, last time, i think you get nothing.  I am glad that china really mark up their court.</p>
              <p>It kind of the same if westerner get hit here, the family would had sue for more than a local singaporeans, and we hv to accept that, but the problem now is, a romanian envoy here can hit a few guys here and still can go free. That is something I hate about laws, what is so big deal about immunity, are ambassador or envoys not human??? By right, they are oblige to respect the laws of the country they are in more seriously than a local.</p>

              <p>This is not something just for overseas matter.

              <p>They will say the same thing if an ABC were compensated more than a local chinese. Some chinese netizens are like some singaporean who think that the angmo's life is more costly than chinese or asian. They don't enhance the value of life of the angmo, asian or chinese, they just cheapen their own life and identity.<br>I won't be too bothered about that.</p>

              <p>Is it really the money althought as sited as the reason of protest or the hidden message.....that the Singapore passport holder was infact perceived as a PRC borned origin thereby should not be treated differently between their own citizen vs PRC origin.</p>
              <p>Singaporean may focus on Money but in this case the hidden message perharps are for those who left China.....and take up 2nd passport in the US or other developed nations.</p>
              <p>Again because we are small countries we have no human rights protection it is always safed to be pick on....</p>

              <p><br>i think if u look at it, is said that the cost of living of the particular person living in that particular country is taken into account, not really on the nationality. If a bangala worker died here, the workmen compensation will calculate his singapore earning power and spending, not bangadesh one, so his dependents get more than what it is then if he died bangadesh.</p>
