              <p><br>you don't need 3D to see the issue, the local law wher the accident takes place applies, in UK it is British Law, in Singapore then Singapore Law. the question is, should nationality be considered in such instance.</p>

              <p>the problem begins when you start identifying the victim according to his nationality, a singaporean, a prc, a bangladeshi.....</p>
              <p>the issue should be simply, a road user died due to the negligence of another road user, and he should be compensated for, and his compensation should be calculated according to his lost of income.....if he is an old men, no income, then payment will be high, but if he is a young men who just made million in his first year of work, you calculate lah... </p>

              <p>Sure, that is how it goes, and the lawyers or insurers claiming the compensation from the wrong doer ( the one who hit him), then let the court decide. If not happy with the payout, the deceased family can appeal further. The arguement can be he earned million this years, and he can earn 2 millions next years, and so on.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore court, there is a limit/cap in such compensation, but in the west, you see family getting millions out of it, that is why their drivers are very careful, they respect pedestrians more than any other car users.</p>
              <p>If no income and old, it depend on the median age of our life span which is 76yo for men and 80yo for women, but it is extending further due to better life and medication. Morever, if that old person is a dependent for his wife, you hv to compensate it, anyway, if you buy a 1st party car insurance, this are mostly covered, but if you bought a third party, which insure only u and the car, god bless u if you hit someone.</p>

              <p>In PRC, insurance company prescribe a price to the life. 300K RMB or 60K SGD irregardless of your profession and earning power. You dont need to insure 3rd party beyong this amt because the court dont give compensation beyond that.</p>
              <p>My point is..not abt law is fair of not in China or Spore BUT the value of Singapore passport being perceive in the eye of the foreigner now. I went to Germany last month, they turn my passport upside down (dont know what they look for) and ask me if I was born in sg etc etc..I asked him if you is suspecting me carrying a fake passport and instead he question me why I speak differently from a PRC..sign.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think in PRC, provinces laws differ greatly, you need to know the municpal (council) of each provinces laws inorder to operate business and insurance well, quite a substantial foreigner investor dun make it in China, because they think the laws from beijin is the laws of China, just like in state, NY and the state of Arizona or Pennsylvanvia are different, that is why you can see american criminal seeking different courts just to get the least sentences out of it.</p></div>
