If there is nothing done to the management, it might serve as a green light for the govt. that the people of S'pore are ok with this and that they will just "move on".<br><br>We must "make noise" to make sure that the govt. "hears" what we want so that they will act accordingly to our wishes.<br><br>I would not take no for an answer if there was no action taken against the management of NKF, especially TT Durai as well as Mr. Goh Cheok Tong. After all, she stood up for him during that eventful episode when everyone was questioning him.<br><br>She must understand that there is a price to pay if you say the wrong things and stand on the wrong side. Especially since all the money were from us- the general public! The money was for the NKF patients! Really should slap oursevles for letting this happen. And do you know why this happened?<br><br>IT'S BECAUSE WE TRUSTED THE GOVT TOO MUCH! IT'S TO A POINT WHEREBY WE DO NOT QUESTION THEM AT ALL! WE REALLY HAVE OURSELVES TO BLAME!

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. NKF have to be closed down, or at the very least its name will have to be changed. Even if that is done, charity shows on TV are going to carry a stigma for years.<br><br>Even my lao peh says he would not be donating any more $ to these shows where everybody takes a cut. Far better is to help those peddlers on the streets or save the money for charity on yourself.<br><br>NKF is National Kidney Foundation. The word "National" is an eyesore. In its heyday, it is held as a model organisation. Now it is National Disgrace!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
