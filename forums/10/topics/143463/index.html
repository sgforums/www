            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sir,<br>Re: Â“Concept of FamilyÂ”.<br><br>I would like to state the fact that Â“WelfareÂ” isnÂ’t a Â‘bad thingÂ’<br>- Welfare is NOT a societal disease and most NSmen relate positively to the term Â‘welfareÂ’.<br>- Â‘WelfarismÂ’ is actually part of governing society as a Â‘familyÂ’.<br>- To prevent suicide terrorist operating in our backyard, Singapore (SG) should be united as a family.<br><br>Currently we are a society believing that Â“survival is only for the fittest (individual, group/ organization)Â” - A premise that can only escalate interpersonal distrust, and general disunity.<br><br>The recent CNA Â‘bag experimentÂ’ is a case in point- A haversack that was left for an hour at Dolby Gaut MRT, Raffles Place and a crowded bus stop drew no public suspicion. It could have easily contained a bombÂ… but we were all too busy to care...<br><br>What were the thoughts of those whoÂ’d noticed the bag?... that someone else would call 999?<br>What has govt taught usÂ… that we should NOT expect food/ shelter from society should we become jobless?<br>So similarly, Â‘IÂ’ and society are different entitiesÂ… someone else will callÂ…<br>(i.e. Society wonÂ’t guarantee my welfareÂ… so why should I contribute to the welfare of society?... [my work is tough enough]).<br>(i.e. Mr TT Durai: Â‘My privacyÂ… none of your businessÂ’)<br>- We have all become defensive and selfish.<br><br>Thus some possible improvements in SG governance could be:<br>1. Promote the concept of Â‘familyÂ’- in a society where ministers/ CEOs earn $millions/yr in salaries, surely the poor can be Â‘promised*Â’ some free food and lodging? [*simple conditions should apply].<br>2. Rectify the GRC system (lead by example) to promote a Â‘level political playing fieldÂ’- and in so doing- exemplify the meaning of Â‘responsibility/ professionalismÂ’ and Â‘fair rivalryÂ’.<br>3. More opposition party members in parliament will probably lead to a livelier debate Â– resulting in better discussed laws/ gov statutes.<br>4. Education should ideally focus on teaching children their democratic rights and realizing their talents- (not just getting 4A1s/ 2S for A levels). Let true democracy realize each citizenÂ’s expectations to the fullest. May no Â‘family memberÂ’ be left feeling Â‘oppressedÂ’, ignored, Â‘miserableÂ’/ Â‘wantingÂ’?<br><br>In short:<br>- Welfare is the duty of the government and Â‘everybodyÂ’. It is a culture of Â‘togethernessÂ’, forgiveness and harmony.<br>- Terrorism is like a Â‘cancer withinÂ’- and Welfarism (in line with the concept of Â‘familyÂ’)- an integral ingredient in the Â‘solutionÂ’.<br>- We do not have to hear a Â‘loud bangÂ’ to learn of another family memberÂ’s dissatisfaction/ misery/ misconception.<br>- May the govt attempt to satisfy almost every citizenÂ’s expectations, lest such expectations manifest as Â‘wantsÂ’ that might be influenced by Â‘deviant teachingsÂ’ of some unsavory characters (Osama &amp; friends).<br>- True democracy in practice should be educational and discussive and ideally conclusive. If maturely discussed, many thorny issues will yield harmonious solutions. Only then will society be united. Â‘UnityÂ’ being our only modern day defense against the Â‘terror withinÂ’.<br><br>What do U think of my opinion?<br>Correspondence:<br>Bic_cherry@yahoo.com.sg<br></div>
