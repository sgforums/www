              <p><strong>Govt will need to continue search for more women to join politics: Lim 
              Hwee Hua</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The government will need to continue to search and 
              persuade more women to join politics and the effort has been encouraging
               with more women in Parliament now. </span></p>
              <p><span>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, said 
              this after a forum on women's leadership role in the New World.
              <br> <br> The panel also discussed challenges that women face in the business 
              world and what could be done to address them.
              <br> <br> Also taking part in the forum were prominent women such as entrepreneurs
               Merry Riana and Genecia Luo.
              <br> <br> Another issue raised was whether Singapore should have a quota to ensure
               more women in the political arena.
              <br> <br> Lim Hwee Hua, Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for 
              Finance &amp; Transport, said: "The application of a quota in Singapore 
              is not quite as useful because women are not being denied the 
              opportunity to as some of the participants also raised. 
              <br> <br> “More importantly, women don't want to feel like they are not sure why 
              they are actually chosen for those positions whether it was because of 
              the quotas or their own merit."  
              <br> <br> Mrs Lim also responded to a question from Channel NewsAsia on the 
              walkabouts of the opposition parties at various constituencies.
              <br> <br> She said: "I suppose they are preparing for the General Election. And in
               a way trying to work the ground so that they can at the General 
              Election truly say that they've been working the ground unlike the rest 
              of us who have been working the ground. 
              <br> <br> "I think it reflects the expectations of the electorate. People do 
              expect you to know the ground and to have done things for the people and
               to be able to demonstrate that you're committed to being there and not 
              just for the General Election itself." </span></p>

              <p><br>Lim Hwee Hwa also good mah, Grace Foo also good mah, for opposition l like sylvia Lim, but she seldom come out in public leh, i think opposition should market themselve more of their good image, but instead, not only they like to keep quiet, they also like to sell their internal strife to the public, this is bad marketing. Imagine to a typical young lady like me, u dun show yourself, and yet you quarrel among yourself, that is very bad for us to imagine??</p>
