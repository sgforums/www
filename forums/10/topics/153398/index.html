            <div class='col-md body'>UN Convention against Corruption gets go-ahead after 30 ratifications<br><br>UN.Org<br><br>15 September 2005 Â– The first international treaty against governmental corruption, a major obstacle to development in poor countries, today received the 30th ratification it needs to go into effect with Ecuador's approval during the treaty event of the United Nations World Summit.<br><br>The UN Convention against Corruption will enter into force 90 days after today's action, which occurred following Secretary-General Kofi Annan's invitation to world leaders to sign, ratify or accede to a range of treaties during the Summit.<br><br>The Convention, which opened for signature in December 2003 and has since been signed by over 100 countries, provides for international cooperation in the return of assets illicitly acquired by corrupt officials, as well as preventive measures to detect the plundering of national wealth as it occurs.<br><br>"The costs that corruption takes on development will now be confronted by the robust articles of the Convention," said Antonio Maria Costa, the Executive Director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) at a press conference following the Convention's entry into force.<br><br>The convention will affect private sector corruption to some extent, since a good amount of such crime involves the bribing of officials, Mr. Costa said. Through provisions on banking transparency and against money laundering, it will also help to fight organized crime.<br><br>World leaders today also continued to sign onto the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which first opened for signature yesterday morning. So far, the terrorism treaty has garnered 44 signatures.<br><br>In total, as of yesterday evening, 36 States undertook 54 treaty actions related to 14 treaties. So far, 33 countries have been represented at the Heads of State or Government level.<br><br>Today's signings continue an initiative begun at the Millennium Summit in 2000 that has since become an annual event for treaties, for which the Secretary-General is depositary, during the opening of each General Assembly.<br><br>The treaties selected this year, rather than focus on any specific aspect of international law as has been the case in the past, reflect what the Secretary-General calls "the central challenge for the twenty-first century Â– to fashion a new and broader understanding Â… of what collective security means."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More background information on this Convention..<br><br>Taken from <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crime_convention_corruption.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crime_convention_corruption.html</a><br><br>In its resolution 55/61 of 4 December 2000, the General Assembly recognized that an effective international legal instrument against corruption, independent of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (resolution 55/25, annex I) was desirable and decided to establish an ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument in Vienna at the headquarters of the Centre for International Crime Prevention, Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. The text of the United Nations Convention against Corruption was negotiated during seven sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee for the Negotiation of the Convention against Corruption, held between 21 January 2002 and 1 October 2003.<br><br>The Convention approved by the Ad Hoc Committee was adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 58/4 of 31 October 2003. The General Assembly, in its resolution 57/169 of 18 December 2002, accepted the offer of the Government of Mexico to host a high-level political signing conference in Merida for the purpose of signing the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The Assembly invited all States to be represented at the Conference at the highest possible levels of Government.<br>Convention highlights<br><br><strong>Prevention</strong><br><br>Corruption can be prosecuted after the fact, but first and foremost, it requires prevention. An entire chapter of the Convention is dedicated to prevention, with measures directed at both the public and private sectors. These include model preventive policies, such as the establishment of anticorruption bodies and enhanced transparency in the financing of election campaigns and political parties. States must endeavour to ensure that their public services are subject to safeguards that promote efficiency, transparency and recruitment based on merit. Once recruited, public servants should be subject to codes of conduct, requirements for financial and other disclosures, and appropriate disciplinary measures. Transparency and accountability in matters of public finance must also be promoted, and specific requirements are established for the prevention of corruption, in the particularly critical areas of the public sector, such as the judiciary and public procurement. Those who use public services must expect a high standard of conduct from their public servants. Preventing public corruption also requires an effort from all members of society at large. For these reasons, the Convention calls on countries to promote actively the involvement of non-governmental and community-based organizations, as well as other elements of civil society, and to raise public awareness of corruption and what can be done about it. Article 5 of the Convention enjoins each State Party to establish and promote effective practices aimed at the prevention of corruption.<br><br><strong>Criminalization</strong><br><br>The Convention requires countries to establish criminal and other offences to cover a wide range of acts of corruption, if these are not already crimes under domestic law. In some cases, States are legally obliged to establish offences; in other cases, in order to take into account differences in domestic law, they are required to consider doing so. The Convention goes beyond previous instruments of this kind, criminalizing not only basic forms of corruption such as bribery and the embezzlement of public funds, but also trading in influence and the concealment and laundering of the proceeds of corruption. Offences committed in support of corruption, including money-laundering and obstructing justice, are also dealt with. Convention offences also deal with the problematic areas of private-sector corruption.<br>International cooperation<br><br>Countries agreed to cooperate with one another in every aspect of the fight against corruption, including prevention, investigation, and the prosecution of offenders. Countries are bound by the Convention to render specific forms of mutual legal assistance in gathering and transferring evidence for use in court, to extradite offenders. Countries are also required to undertake measures which will support the tracing, freezing, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of corruption.<br><br><strong>Asset recovery</strong><br><br>In a major breakthrough, countries agreed on asset-recovery, which is stated explicitly as a fundamental principle of the Convention. This is a particularly important issue for many developing countries where high-level corruption has plundered the national wealth, and where resources are badly needed for reconstruction and the rehabilitation of societies under new governments. Reaching agreement on this chapter has involved intensive negotiations, as the needs of countries seeking the illicit assets had to be reconciled with the legal and procedural safeguards of the countries whose assistance is sought.<br><br>Several provisions specify how cooperation and assistance will be rendered. In particular, in the case of embezzlement of public funds, the confiscated property would be returned to the state requesting it; in the case of proceeds of any other offence covered by the Convention, the property would be returned providing the proof of ownership or recognition of the damage caused to a requesting state; in all other cases, priority consideration would be given to the return of confiscated property to the requestin[g state, to the return of such property to the prior legitimate owners or to compensation of the victims.<br><br>Effective asset-recovery provisions will support the efforts of countries to redress the worst effects of corruption while sending at the same time, a message to corrupt officials that there will be no place to hide their illicit assets. Accordingly, article 51 provides for the return of assets to countries of origin as a fundamental principle of this Convention. Article 43 obliges state parties to extend the widest possible cooperation to each other in the investigation and prosecution of offences defined in the Convention. With regard to asset recovery in particular, the article provides inter alia that "In matters of international cooperation, whenever dual criminality is considered a requirement, it shall be deemed fulfilled irrespective of whether the laws of the requested State Party place the offence within the same category of offence or denominate the offence by the same terminology as the requesting State Party, if the conduct underlying the offence for which assistance is sought is a criminal offence under the laws of both States Parties".<br>Implementation mechanisms<br><br>The Convention needs 30 ratifications to come into force. A Conference of the States Parties is established to review implementation and facilitate activities required by the Convention.<br>Documentation</div>
