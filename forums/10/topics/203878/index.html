            <div class='col-md body'>Share a little story of mine about 10+ years ago.<br><br>I was running a small Music CD shop and due to the cost of Cds are quite expensive and to avoid too much balance stock, i normally dont order alot.  But sometime it is hard to predict the sales, so for some titles, they will sell out very fast.  Some customer dont mind order it from me and wait, but their main concern is at least able to look at the cover before ordering.<br><br>So what i did was some of the popular titles i would scan the cover from original copies and print them out.  When i sold out my last copy of original, i would temporary use the printed one until my new stock arrived.<br><br>One fine day, my shop was raided by CID and music companies rep.  After 2 hours of searching by the reps, they could not find any pirated music CD, while i was chatting away with the CID that accompany them. Those Reps still insist on searching until the CID insist that there are no more place to search and it is obvious there are no pirated stuff, a little arguement between them and finally the CID raise his voice to declare End of Raid, no more searching.<br><br>They brought back 500 pieces of original CDS and 20 printed covers.  3 months later they send me a summon to go to court and charge me for the 20 printed covers which i have all the original CDs(among the 500 pcs). I spoke to my lawyer and decide to fight the case seems the charges seems dumb and any person with the right mind would find me guilty.<br><br>After a few discussion between the lawyers, my lawyer told me it might not be advisable to fight the case, would be better to admit guilty.  I was like WTF? why?.<br><br>He told me all the 20 scans i have their are logos from the music companies.  They are able to come up with 7 charges base on that 20 logoes. They are going to reduce to 1 charge if i plead guilty.  If i dont, i have to prepare for a fight which does not gurantee any winning.<br><br>During that time, 1 pirated CD was fine $200-300, so he thinks for my case it would be maybe 50-100 since it is not a CD, it is just a logo.  Assuming i was lucky, the judge will fine me for $50 for each logo, total = 20 x $50 = $1,000<br><br>lawyer fees = $2000, and also i have to compensate the music companies for a total of $4,000.  Total Damage = $7,000 and that would be the best situation.<br><br>If i would fight the case, lawyer fees = $20,000 and no gurantee that i would win, and base on previous cases, chances of winning is definitely less the 1/2.<br><br>So as a owner of a small music shop, looking at the figures, i decide to plead guilty. Losing $7,000 is better then losing $20,000 for sure plus court fine if i lose.<br><br>So i plead guilty and guess what, the judge fine me for $500 for each logo.  1 whole pirated CD is $200-300, 1 Logo = $500? My lawyer was stunned by the fine too.<br><br>in the end my damage = $14,000.  $10,000 fine, $4,000 compensate music companies.  My lawyer decided not to charge me any lawyer's fee since he was very sorry with the outcome.<br><br>I learn something from this incident, poor people dont have the means to prove they are innocent at certain situation.  So if you suay suay kana, then thats too bad.<br><br>The legal system is fair? greatest lie ever.<br><br>But without it, would be even worst.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, let me narrate my story, if there are people new to this forum:<br><br>A budding graduate from one of the local universities, I was staying with my mother only because my dad died young. Mum had to work as a cleaner, earning a meagre $700 a month in the 1990s to put me through to university. Had 15 distinction in 15 subjects for national exams. Ace my uni tests all the way and secured a good paying job.<br><br>Applied to a senior management post in a few years and got a pay rise to $5K+ a month.<br><br>Worked really hard. Got a secretary in her late 30s, reaching 40s. Not chio, not sexy but whiner.<br><br>Company going thru a lot of deals and I was made busy. Had to make my secretary stay back to do faxing, emails, letters, administation etc. She was okay at first but subsequently becomes very tulan when I raise my voice at her because of pressure.<br><br>But i made it a point to let her off by 10pm while i slogged to 2am and sometimes stayed over.<br><br>One day, I was detained by 4 IOs who raided my office and accused me of molest, in front of 20+ other colleagues and some other kay poh colleagues from next door. Sobbing secretary had reported me to the police for molest, as I had found out in the police station.<br><br>IO was utterrly hopeless and greedy to climb up the ladder. Not going to mention names because he has family to feed as well.<br><br>Rides a bike, stays in Jurong near swimming pool. If he is reading this, he should know who he is. I aint cursing you my IO but after what you have done, I dont think I have the heart to help u if I were to see you and your bike lying on PIE one day seriously injured from the collision with another vehicle. That is how I perceive your cheap life to be. I will help others but not u and you yourself know why. You are a heartless bloke, one devoid of any emotions and willing to put in lies after lies to cover your ass and the secretary's ass.<br><br>Back to my incident, charged in court and subsequently acquitted because my lawyer got CCTV from a nearby food-centre that during the alleged time of the molest, I was having my dinner downstair at 10pm+.<br><br>The bitch who bluffed deliberately got off scot free. No charge was brought to her. Justice serve? Bullshit.<br><br>My mum who is in her 70s had to fork out her entire life-savings to bail me out. The emotion and trauma is too much for her to bear. Now, she is in and out of the hospital and I was told by the doctor, who happened to be my primary school fren, to keep her acommpany as best as I can.<br><br>I got the hint. After my wife left me, my beloved mother is leaving me soon.  She had grown so weak after the entire episode.<br><br>To the bloody Dog IO and Police force, next time, attack me if you must. Leave my mother and my family alone.<br><br></div>

I must say this, fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck the law !!<br><br>anything, no prove no shit no nothing, a woman can accused you of molesting her as long as you was with her.<br>about that guy.. the one attempt to hit police officer.. how the the police manage to know it's him, anyways, if that is true, i really pity that guy, singapore is f<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ucked up...<br>about your CD shop, i pity you too.. just forget about it..<br>you see last time when serving NS, how many people died and how many people went mad... and what they fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>cking get ? a measly of $+-400 a month ?? If you go work full time as a low class worker also can earn more than that, you think the salary increment of $400 is good enough for those who serve NS, $400 is bullshit. You go work low low low class 1 day 18 hours i think you also can earn 1k a month, 1k a month x 24 months = 24k liao leh.. you need to work how long to get back those 24k if you just get that $400 increment in salary, if my family is rich, i would leave this country too.<br>Those people related to ministers/government/top richest, always get the best, normal people always suffer, minster get so much salary all bullshit, to prevent corruption ? i feel by taking away other people money is already being currupted !<br>I say enough liao, hope this won't get featured if not i die liao...</div>

I told him never to return to this useless piece of land called Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>I've a distance relative living in Perth...She told me life is better living there.<br><br>In Australia, you have a choice whether to live with luxury or just as simple....you could save more if you are able to DIY most of the things.....<br><br>Take for instance..in singapore. If you were to cook at home..costs will be more expensive than eating in hawker centre. Food and dishes are not cheap in singapore..she said.  Beside buying food and dishes...brought home, you have to wash it, cook it, after meal you will have to wash all the plates and bowl and utilities bills are neither cheap here!<br><br>So..you see.  Living in Australia...you have choices for what sort of living standard or costs.<br><br>I asked her.<br>In Australia, I heard there are always racist discriminating and minority races are always treated as second class citizens.<br><br>She replied:<br>There are racist discriminating everywhere in this world! Is just the matter of how obivious...<br>Best way to avoid that..one has got to dress neatly, respect others, talk with sense, behave well and people will treat you the same.<br><br>So what the fark is in singapore?</div>
