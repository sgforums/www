              <div id="post_message_475901" class="vb_postbit"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PM's sense of entitlement and paranoia against opposition spreads wide amongst all Singaporeans.</strong></span><br> (This prose written in response to <em>'Immigration issues dominate discussions on REACH'</em>[<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1079692/1/.html">CNA, 7Sept2010</a>].)<br> <br> It is my observation and concern that perhaps the Singaporean wariness, 
                  if not contempt against foreigners might be a 'transference' of PM Lee's
                   extreme paranoia and prejudice against opposition politicians in 
                  Singapore.  <br> If the PM finds it so difficult to work with other equally well 
                  intentioned politicians, albeit those with differing or neither partisan
                   memberships, to the extent that he very publically declared (in 
                  GE2006), smack in the heart of town about his predisposition to :<em> "spend all my time thinking what's the right way to fix them, to buy my 
                  supporters votes, how can I solve this week's problem and forget about 
                  next year's challenges.."</em>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">YouTube/@1m10s</a>], how then, can it be logically expected that the electorate- the citizens of the republic whom are (quote: <em>"concerned about competition from foreigners for jobs and housing.- ..worried about over-crowding and the cost of living"</em>[<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1079692/1/.html">CNA, 7Sept2010</a>]) be expected to accept foreigners wholeheartedly.<br> <br> Noting the similar problems of partisan politics (British and 
                  Australian) that resulted in a temporary 'hung' parliament- the 
                  intermediate result in both recent  elections, aren't these cases proof 
                  enough that an educated electorate ought to be so equally split between 
                  uniquely attractive political parties/ ideologies, with no one political
                   party/ politician having monopoly over the best ideas about the future 
                  of a country- that a hung parliament ought to occur? <br> That for the sake of adopting all the best ideas unique to each and 
                  every party, 'partisan politics' and divisive tendencies ought to be 
                  relegated to national interest; politicians of all partisan leanings 
                  ought to shed their inhibitions, bury party whips, and close ranks for 
                  the good of society.<br> With environmental, economic and social challenges facing both Singapore
                   in particular and the world at large, is there time enough for 
                  politicians to luxuriate in self aggrandizement whilst faltering in the 
                  light of these challenges?<br> <br> Perhaps the PAP has gone too far in its <em>manipulation of elections </em>[<a href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?p=467896#post467896">A1forums, 25Aug2010</a>], <em>state coffers and its encroachment upon rights and responsibilities of opposition MPs</em> [<a href="http://geraldgiam.sg/2009/10/hdb-should-be-neutral-and-stop-playing-politics/">GeraldGiam, 3Oct2009</a>]. It is perhaps time, if not overdue for PAP pick up its socks and resist the temptations of <em>self aggrandizement</em> [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">YouTube/@1m10s</a>]  and <em>entitlement mentality</em> [<a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-615.htm">ST 26June2006</a>] and [<a href="http://aboutsingaporeproperty.blogspot.com/2009/10/lift-upgrading-why-chiam-and-low-are.html">ST- 8Oct2009</a>]-  that if left unchecked, would as surely as the sun rises, lead to the downfall of the PAP if not Singapore.<br> <br> Only time will tell.<br> Majulah Singapura.<br> <br> Quoted References:<br> - <strong>'PM Lee says countries worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system'</strong>:

                  the need for foreign workers.<br> <span style="color: red;">But they were concerned about competition from foreigners for jobs and housing.<br> They were also worried about over-crowding and the cost of living.</span><br> There were also calls for the government to exercise stricter criteria to ensure immigrants can truly contribute to Singapore.<br> Some raised the issue of integration and suggested new citizens could serve at voluntary welfare or grassroots organisations.<br> Feedback contributors also felt that "brain drain", where talented

              <p>Although Aust and british have their problems associated with partisan politics, their parliament is bigger and has a wider spread of ideas- therefore healthy competition.</p>
              <p>Bet there isn't as blatant a monopoly and manipulation as by PAP in SG. None of the progressively manipulated and resultingly super obtuse GRC policies, open govt meddling with minority constituency grassroots business. Neither is perfect government but think their bicameral parliament and 'healthy competition' is more stable than the no EQ one of SG that has almost  zero experience in dealing diplomatically with opposition in politics I guess.</p>
              <p>Environmental issues and militant radicalism would take its toll on society and be the real challenges facing the next generation; that no multiple in terms of YOG/ F1/ IR hosting alone would help SG-PAP govt overcome so long as it maintains political monopoly based upon its unilateral, obtuse and shady electoral tactics- thus end up facing challenges only when its much too late.</p>
              <p>Double standards and our failure to embrace diversity would be our downfall- dis what I think.</p>
