              <div class="small color-666">
              <p>Jon Moulton, the private equity chief, warned a City lunch this week that he
              feared serious civil unrest. There was, he said, a 25 per cent chance of one
              of the 15 member countries of the eurozone pulling out of the currency club.
              That, he said, would be a catastrophic shock leading to a “far greater
              financial crisis” than the current one.</p>
              <p>The mind boggles at a financial crisis far worse than the current one. Is such
              a thing possible? Even with this one, it may already be too late to prevent
              social unrest, especially in Britain, which is tipped to be one of the
              worst-hit countries economically.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The spectacle of bankers continuing to award themselves bonuses while taking
              taxpayer support is feeding an extraordinary public rage and a fierce sense
              of injustice. With 40,000 people losing their jobs each month, it is a
              recipe for trouble, come the traditional rioting months of the summer. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">It won’t be bankers being lynched, of course, but small shopkeepers in
              inner-city areas having their windows smashed and their stock looted. The
              only surprise is there haven’t already been antibanker demonstrations in
              Threadneedle Street – secretly cheered on by 99 per cent of Middle England. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The seething sense of unfairness is almost palpable. The view that a small
              elite not only caused the crisis, but continues to profit at the expense of
              everyone else, is near universal. Gordon Brown’s promise of no rewards for
              failure in state-supported banks is looking ever more threadbare. We now
              know that Peter Cummings, the highest-paid person on the HBOS board, headed
              a division responsible for £7 billion of losses last year, yet he was still
              given a reported £660,000 payoff when he left in early January clutching his
              £6 million pension pot. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The suggestion by Lord Myners, the City minister, that some bankers simply
              have no sense of the broader society around them is getting harder to
              refute. To be preparing to pay out billions of pounds in discretionary
              bonuses over the next few weeks suggests an ignorance of the public mood and
              a single-mindedness bordering on sociopathic. </span></strong></p>
              <p>All this may be a bit of a side show for Sir Victor Blank and Eric Daniels,
              chairman and chief executive, respectively, as they try to stop the water
              slopping over the gunwales of the combined Lloyds/HBOS. Yesterday’s
              bombshell was grave for the bank, dispiriting for taxpayers and damaging to
              the chief executive. The timing is acutely awkward, coming just 48 hours
              after he appeared before the Commons Treasury Select Committee. MPs might
              have pressed him rather harder if they had known what was just around the
              corner.</p>
              <p>The £10 billion loss at HBOS is humiliating enough, but the admission that the
              losses are £1.6 billion worse than when shareholders were asked to approve
              the deal in November is worse. Lloyds got HBOS to sweeten the terms twice.
              With hindsight it still wasn’t enough. Mr Daniels admitted to Parliament
              this week that he was not able to conduct as much due diligence as in a
              normal deal. His shareholders and UK taxpayers are now paying a heavy price
              for that failure.</p>
              <p>The 32 per cent slump in the Lloyds share price yesterday speaks volumes about
              the market’s fears. Although Lloyds insists its balance sheet is still
              strong, the need for additional capital will be back on the agenda. If
              HBOS’s corporate loans could have soured by £1.6 billion in the space of
              just a month, its surplus capital cushion could quickly be wiped out. That
              could lead to full nationalisation eventually.</p>
              <p>Lloyds says that one of the reasons for the losses was the more conservative
              methodology it uses for gauging potential loan losses. That comes close to
              suggesting the old HBOS board was somewhat less than conservative itself. If
              the reputation of the old guard at HBOS, including Gordon Brown’s former
              favourite Sir James Crosby, is capable of sinking any lower in the public
              estimation, it will now be doing so.</p>
