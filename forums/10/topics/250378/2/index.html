Headquartered in Singapore, ComfortDelGro also has operations in China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia. Currently, overseas ventures account for up to 44% of the company's revenue. The Group intends to derive half of its total revenue from abroad in the next four to six years.<br><br>query : So tiny Spore actually provide 56% of the group revenues? and the revenues are used to fund its overseas expansion?<br><br>============<br>ChairmanÂ’s of the co said :<br><br>"We entered our fourth year of operations in 2006 with grave concerns over volatile high oil prices which had persisted from the previous year. The situation had a large negative financial impact on us and our share price. In China, the authorities helped the taxi and the bus companies to offset the huge oil costs.<strong> In Singapore, on the other hand, we had to  subsidise our taxi drivers heavily so that they could continue to earn decent incomes.</strong>Despite the volatility of oil prices, we managed to hedge successfully. The Group continued to grow globally despite the various challenges."<br><br>"In 2006, we invested  S$117.9 million overseas. Together with our<br>past investments, our total investment abroad is now<br>S$741.6 million."<br><br>==========<br><br>Query :Is  PTC  in a very difficult position whether to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reject </strong></span> bus hikes given the social reponsibities this co vow to undertake?<br><br>Shouldnt PTC has a member from the opposition party ? since the co is owned by the GLC, which is turned contolled by govt Min of Finance, which is in turn controlled by PAP.

A simple calculation shows that the prices of Comfort and DelGro had risen by an average of close to 23% compounded annually or the past four years. This is in addition to the huge dividends paid each year based on at least 50% of the  profit as well as special dividends paid to take advantage  of the Section 44 tax credit balance.
