            <div class='col-md body'>We have heard enough of PAP's "Knowledge Based Economy" and about "upgrading skills", "Economic restructuring and such.<br><br>Back in May, one forumite and I started a thread on "Thinking Economy". We are not aware that in the International Economic Development field, they were actually studying the next phase or source of economic growth and development; "Innovative Economy". The two ideas are identical but "Thinking Economy encompass a wider perspective.<br><br>My argument is that for a vibrant Thinking Economy to evolve, we need a certain configurations of social fabric and structures to be in place, which sadly, is lacking in Singapore's social-economic model.<br><br>Nevertheless, this thread will be dedicated to this topic, revisit once again.<br><br>I will start off with a link link"<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>http://www.asu.edu/copp/morrison/fuzzyeconiden.pdf<br><br>(Part of the content)<br><br>The Challenge of the Thinking Economy<br><br>As Seth Godin of Fast Company magazine writes, Â¡Â°The first 100 years<br>of our countryÂ¡Â¯shistory were about who could build the biggest, most<br>efficient farm. The second 100 years were about the race to build<br>efficient factories. The third 100 years are about ideas.Â¡Â±<br><br>To succeed in the long run, Arizona must participate in the process<br>of generating ideasand finding better ways of doing things, rather<br>than simply executing economic tasks that are dreamed up by knowledge<br>workers elsewhere. In the words of Columbia UniversityÂ¡Â¯s Michael<br>Crow, Arizona must become a Â¡Â°knowledge producerÂ¡Â± rather than a<br>knowledge importer."<br><br>Knowledge production is important notonly in dreaming up new products<br>and processes but also in upgrading products that already exist. ItÂ¡Â¯<br>s true that a growing chunk of production in the modern economy comes<br>in the form of intangibles based on the exploitation of ideas rather<br>than material things. But at the same time, manufactured goods, from<br>Mercedes to Nike, have Â¡Â°knowledgeÂ¡Â± embedded in them.<br><br>Thus, the twenty-first century economy willfavor areas that are<br>Â¡Â°knowledge producers,Â¡Â±places flush with research and development<br>activities, the creation of new intellectual products and services<br>and the most recenttechnologies. Those areas strong in knowl-edge<br>production will be the white-collar,front-office parts of the new<br>economy. Areas dependent on knowledge imports Â¨C manu-facturing and<br>processing centers, like Arizonais today Â¨C will be stuck with the<br>blue-collar, back-office parts of the new economy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following posting is made in YPAP forum in Aug this year.<br><br>I know it would sound pretty confrontational to many of you here, but that's the way I put it in PAP's forum to rouse things up abit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>So much has been talked about PAP leadership has been "steering" our country out of recession, but one must ask, do they really understand<br>"Economics"?<br><br>It seems to me that Economics to them are "external factors", "foreign investments"...etc..etc. Is that really so?<br><br>We have come to a cross road of economic development. Sad to say, what will become to Singapore in the next phase of economic development will definitely depend on PAP's leadership. Why "sad", you might ask. SAD because it needs PAP to willingly relinguish their control mechanism installed in every aspects of Singaporeans' lifestyle. But with their aloof attitude, I do not expect any progress in this direction. We have wasted much time since 1991 in dingdong economics...trying to adjust towards economic cycles instead of creation of wealth by means of providing the clear direction of economic development model.<br><br>We keep hearing PAP leadership uttering words of "upgrading", "higher value add".... but do they seriously know what they are talking about? At which productino cycle, does the highest value add exist?<br><br>They talk about "R&amp;D", "Bio Tech" and such, but do they really knows what "R&amp;D" or "High Technology" involves? Apparently they are lost in such processes and big talks, only capable to give big words like these.<br><br>While the more developed world has been moving on to "Innovative Economy" or what I call "Thinking Economy", our PAP leadership is still stuck with "Knowledge based Economy". Even this is not a new concept or word invented by PAP leadership but adapted from "out-dated" economic model. The reluctance of PAP leadership embracing the new economic development model is glaring; this got to do with more liberalization of the four pillars of the society Political, Cultural, Economic and Social fronts of our country. It is PAP leadership that is too used to having full control mechanisms installed in this country that is reluctant to change, not Singaporeans. The control mechanism has successfully guaranteed the almost total monopoly of power by PAP in Singapore. The "myth" about having both of good worlds, the monopoly of power as well as high economic growth for Singapore, has expired in this era. Monopoly of power is essential (necessary though not sufficient) for initial economic development for a newly industrialized economy. This is necessary basically because growth could be achieved by mobilization of inefficiently used factors of productions....particularly labour, land, financing and other resources. This is the process that China is going through; growth is engined by the reconfigurations of resources utilization. This could be engineered by having strong "governmental interventions" such as building up infrastructure, re-configuring the "educational system", restructuring of the financial system...etc. The potentials of these various resources have been released and utilized in a more efficient ways, so to provide a high growth path for the economy. In short, these are termed as "investment driven" economy, same as what we have been doing for the past decades. But this sort of development path could only last for the initial foundation years of economic development. And it got nothing to do with "Asian values" or particular cultural setup, as PAP has always wanted to portray.<br><br>Among the four Asian Tigers, we are the last to engage in reforming our economic cum political model, basically due to PAP's obssession of maintaining monopoly of power. Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong have progressed into higher "value added" economic models not only by introducing technological intensive industries, but the liberalization of the society IN EVERY ASPECTS, including political, cultural, Economic as well as social aspects.<br><br>Wealth creation does not depend on techonology alone. Wealth creation lies in cultural liberalization. Many people thought Nokia is a technological driven entity; it is not. It is the ability of understanding and exploring cultural plausibility that Nokia excelled. Similarly for car manufacturers.<br><br>The highest "value add" ladder ends in the patented ideas, copyrights of brandings that each corporates held. For example, Disney basically doesn't own any factories but there are tons and tons of merchandise bearing its creative branding. It is this ownership of cultural creativity that makes it earn big....not technology (though it plays a part in the creation process), not factories.... That is why the western developed countries are so involved in fighting copyright infringements.<br><br>Thus, the highest value add lies in the "Thinking Process"...more accurately, the "Cultural Thinking Process". If we want to progress into such economic model, we must liberalize our "thinking environment". This includes the liberalization of the political and cultural aspects of our society. We have a wealth of cultural heritage, basically due to our racial setup. Sad to say, we have been suppressing the potentials of the thinking process for far too long, due to the misguided belief of the myth that political/cultural tight control could co-exist with economic growth.<br><br>Liberalization of the cultural setting must go hand in hand with political liberalization or reforms. You couldn't possibly encourage someone to walk freely at the same time while you keep planting mines all around the places!<br><br>I do not think PAP has the moral courage to make such drastic reforms which will directly or indirectly threaten their monopoly of power. But such reforms are necessary to really bring us to the highest value add level. It is about the delimma of self-preservations and social advancement. In short, PAP is the entity that is becoming the biggest hinderance of our overall development, particularly our economic development.<br><br>My only hope for the new Prime Minister is for him to have such political courage to face the reality fast. WE must engage in the whole revamp of the political cum cultural settings if we are to progress and transform ourselves into a truly well developed economy. If not, all are just empty talks, covered in "sybolism" of bar top dancing.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br>_________________<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following will be recent reports on how other economies in the world rethinking their economic development strategies.<br><br>Oct. 6, 2004. 01:00 AM<br><br>Ontario economy needs new strategy for growth<br><br>DAVID CRANE<br><br>NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKEÂ—If Canadians are to narrow the wealth gap with the<br>United States, they cannot do this unless Ontario has a successful<br>economy, given Ontario's dominant position in the Canadian economy.<br><br>This message, from TD Economics in a special report on Ontario, sets<br>the stage for the Ontario Chamber of Commerce's economic summit,<br>taking place this week in this centre of wine and tourism. The purpose<br>of the summit is to draft a set of ideas on how to improve Ontario's<br>economic performance in a world of increasing global competition and<br>rapid technological change.<br><br>To narrow this gap, and generate the wealth for a high quality of<br>life, the Ontario economy would have to grow faster than the U.S.<br>economy, by at least 1 percentage point each year on average, TD<br>Economics says. But "with Ontario's economy on track to grow at a<br>slower rate than its U.S. counterpart through 2006, the gap is more<br>likely to widen than narrow over the near term," it warns.<br><br>Moreover, the TD Economics report says, Ontario ranked eighth in<br>Canada in growth in per capita GDP in the decade since 1992, calling<br>this performance "mediocre." At the same time, over the past decade<br>"most low-income families continued to fall further behind in<br>Ontario," with widening inequality. Ontario has a poverty problem.<br><br>A key issue is productivity. Sustained improvements in wealth creation<br>and living standards deepened on sustained gains in productivity. And<br>productivity is based on capacity for innovation Â— in finding new ways<br>to do things or producing new or improved goods and services with high<br>value added.<br><br>This is the real Ontario challenge, and indeed the Canadian challenge.<br><br>In a recent report, Exploring Canada's Innovation Character, the<br>Conference Board of Canada finds that Canada is simply not generating<br>a high level of new knowledge, as measured by what it calls the<br>triadic patent family.<br><br>A patent family is measured by the set of patents filed simultaneously<br>in the European Patent Office, the Japanese Patent Office and the<br>United States Patent and Trademark Office. On this measure Canada<br>generates 16.5 triadic patent families per 1 million population,<br>compared with 51.9 for the United States, 73 for Germany, 89.5 for<br>Japan and 102.4 for Sweden.<br><br>One reason is that Canada underspends on research and development.<br>Canada's R&amp;D spending is about 1.9 per cent of GDP, compared with<br>about 2.8 per cent for the United States and more than 4.25 per cent<br>for Sweden. This gap is clear at the corporate level. Canadian<br>business spending on R&amp;D is just over 1 per cent of GDP, compared to<br>just over 2 per cent in the United States and over 3.5 per cent in Sweden.<br><br>A key factor here is the quality of business leadership. Too few CEOs<br>have the vision, determination and skills to develop Canadian-based<br>firms with the scale and scope to operate at the frontiers of<br>innovation. There are some companies that do this well, such as<br>Research in Motion Inc. or CAE Inc., but they are too few.<br><br>A top priority for Ontario, and Canada, is to develop more strong<br>Canadian-headquartered companies with the scale and scope for<br>high-value participation in the global economy. We want innovative<br>companies that can pay high wages, develop goods or services the rest<br>of the world wants and make a profit.<br><br>Another factor explaining weaker Canadian productivity is<br>underinvestment in new machinery and equipment. Since the early 1990s,<br>Ontario companies have invested less in machinery and equipment than<br>U.S. companies as a share of GDP. Innovative companies tend to be<br>companies that are at the leading edge of manufacturing and service<br>systems.<br><br>In an update this week on its cross-Canada review of the future of<br>manufacturing, the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters association<br>argues that "tax policies should aim at strengthening investment in<br>innovation" through incentives that reward investment, such as faster<br>depreciation for new technologies and an investment tax credit.<br><br>As TD Economics points out, there are many other factors in building a<br>successful economy, including the quality of education, infrastructure<br>and opportunities to upgrade skills.<br><br>But without greater vision and leadership in Canadian companies, with<br>a sharp focus on innovation leading to higher-value products and<br>services rather than a preoccupation with simplistic cost cutting, all<br>of the other things will be insufficient. This is the biggest<br>challenge for the Ontario Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>David Crane's column appears on Wednesday and Saturday.

            <div class='col-md body'>Voinovich, Fingerhut differ on economy<br><br>By Carey Checca<br>Gannett News Service<br><br>NEWARK -- U.S. Sen. George V. Voinovich and his opponent in the race<br>to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate, State Sen. Eric Fingerhut, agree<br>they aren't far apart philosophically about what Ohio needs.<br><br>However, they have different perspectives and different plans to<br>rejuvenate Ohio's economy.<br><br>Voinovich, former governor of Ohio and former mayor of Cleveland,<br>calls himself the most qualified candidate because of his 40 years of<br>experience and perspective in government.<br><br>"I'm really concerned about you and me, but (also) the legacy for my<br>children and grandchildren," Voinovich said.<br><br>Fingerhut, who has served in the state Senate and the U.S. House of<br>Representatives, said voters should thank Voinovich for his service<br>and move on.<br><br>"It's time to look at the future through new eyes," Fingerhut said.<br><br>Ohio is heading the wrong direction by every objective measure,<br>Fingerhut said. The state is losing jobs and young people.<br><br>And helping small businesses through tax credits, as Voinovich has<br>done, is "hugely inefficient," Fingerhut said.<br><br>Instead, Fingerhut said three things are critical to getting Ohio's<br>economy growing again:<br><br># Invest in research and technology and upgrade machinery and<br>equipment so Ohio can be the nation's most productive and innovative<br>manufacturing center.<br><br># Bring down health-care costs by expanding the use of technology in<br>managing patient care, including developing a network of electronic<br>medical records, punishing attorneys who file frivolous malpractice<br>cases and promoting physical fitness, among other initiatives.<br><br># Create a federal-state partnership to reduce the cost of higher<br>education and, in turn, attract companies to Ohio.<br><br>Fingerhut also proposed a five-year moratorium on paying back student<br>loans for graduates who start their own businesses after graduation.<br><br>Voinovich, who is known as a "fiscal hawk" in the U.S. Senate, said he<br>will continue to be very conservative on federal spending and work to<br>reduce the national deficit and balance budgets.<br><br>Federal stimulus packages passed each of the last three years have<br>shortened the recession, he said.<br><br>Voinovich said he would:<br><br># Stop the "litigation tornado" of malpractice and class-action<br>lawsuits through federal lawsuit abuse reform that will make sure<br>plaintiffs have legitimate grievances.<br><br># Work to keep natural gas and energy costs low for Ohio's<br>manufacturers and other businesses.<br><br># Propose moving from companies providing health insurance to portable<br>policies, which move with workers.<br><br>As for Iraq, Voinovich has voted for money to support the war.<br><br>"Between now and the end of this year, all hell is going to break<br>loose over there," Voinovich said.<br><br>However, the United States can deal the extremists an enormous blow if<br>it can set up a secular government in Iraq, Voinovich said.<br><br>He called for support for intelligence gathering, and said it "is the<br>best weapon we have against terrorists."<br><br>He also said he's working to expand NATO.<br><br>Meanwhile, Fingerhut agreed that the country needs to protect itself<br>at home and abroad.<br><br>However, he said the U.S. did not have a plan for success when it<br>invaded Iraq.<br><br>"We have nowhere near the resources, strategy or international support<br>for what we are facing in Iraq," Fingerhut said.<br><br>Originally published Wednesday, October 6, 2004<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Wednesday, October 6, 2004<br>Driving the local economy<br>by Stephannie Johnson<br>Main Story Picture<br>icon icon Linda Hanson, owner of Northern Coffee and Confectionary,<br>believes that small businesses provide more than an important part of<br>the economy, they are also meeting places for the community.<br><br>PARRY SOUND - "Without small businesses we're doomed," said Parry<br>Sound Area Community Business and Development Centre manager Bill Spinney.<br><br>October 17 to 29 is Small Business week. The theme being You're the<br>Power Behind the Canadian Economy.<br><br>For small businesses just getting off the ground, Mr. Spinney said<br>there are a few necessary steps that have to be taken, before the<br>CB&amp;DC can write a cheque.<br><br>"It's coming in and sitting down with our lending officers and putting<br>together a business plan, if they don't already have one, and put an<br>application into the board for whatever is required, up to $25,000 per<br>client.<br><br>"There's no grant, both the province and the federals got out of that<br>in the mid '90s, so there's no grants available here, from this<br>office, it's all loans."<br><br>Mr. Spinney said that as far as larger businesses go, Parry Sound<br>isn't home to a lot of them.<br><br>Multi-faceted<br><br>"[Small businesses] do everything for the community, they're it," he<br>said. "It's depending on how you define small business. I don't think<br>we have large businesses here, if you take the any of what the major<br>economic think tanks consider small business to be anything under 250<br>employees and $5 million in sales and that's what we have here. But,<br>they're not small businesses to the operators, they're their life."<br><br>Statistically, the CB&amp;DC has helped several existing businesses in the<br>region, however, most aren't willing to come forward and say they've<br>used its services.<br><br>Helping hand<br><br>"Some [small businesses] are proud to say they've utilized this<br>service, some of them are a little embarrassed, because we are a<br>lender of last resort," said Mr. Spinney. "When everybody else says<br>'no,' we might say 'yes,' that's what we do, we do the high-risk<br>lending. In terms of the banks these days, anything commercial if it's<br>north of Highway 7, they don't consider it worthy of their<br>involvement, which doesn't do much for the north."<br><br>Another program available to budding small business owners is the<br>Self-Employment Business Program that offers step-by-step help to get<br>that business off the ground in 11 months or less.<br><br>It is open to those who are eligible for, or who have been on<br>Employment Insurance and gives a weekly training allowance of $350<br>once the business concept has been approved.<br><br>The program receives upwards of 20 applications per month in the Parry<br>Sound-Muskoka region. Of those, usually only 10 decide to stick with<br>the program following the orientation.<br><br>Since 2001, the Self-Employment Business Program has helped 20<br>businesses in the area and boasts a 90 percent success rate.<br><br>More than products<br><br>Owners of Northern Coffee and Confectionary Linda and Robin Hanson<br>agree that small businesses are the backbone of any community.<br><br>"A small business offers community," said Ms. Hanson. "A sense of<br>belonging, it can offer personalized service that is flexible,<br>innovative and this will meet the customers requests."<br><br>Ms. Hanson worked in the shop before she and her husband purchased it,<br>a little over a year ago.<br><br>"I have a background in food and candy purchasing," she said. "When<br>the business came up for sale we purchased it, because it was a good<br>match with my experience."<br><br>For those interested in setting up, or buying their own business, Ms.<br>Hanson has a few bits of advice.<br><br>"Have knowledge about the business you are going to purchase or start,<br>love what you do, work hard and follow rule number one, and rule<br>number one is the customer's always right.<br><br>"Socially, a lot of people meet here. It's just one of those community<br>spots and I think that many, many of our small businesses are like<br>that. When you're saying what do we give to a small town, we give just<br>that, a place to meet and greet."<br>Originally published at<br>http://www.parrysoundnorthstar.com/story--1097079902/View_Full_Story.htm<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Public sector to lead challenge<br><br>Oct 6 2004<br><br>Dylan Jones Evans, Western Mail<br><br>THE news last week that a fire extinguisher manufacturing plant in the<br>Rhondda was closing with the loss of 154 jobs, whilst a new call<br>centre was creating 300 jobs in Cardiff, probably tells us more than<br>we think about the sectoral and geographical shifts in the Welsh economy.<br><br>In this context, it was worth noting the results that were published<br>by the Office for National Statistics in the middle of last week.<br><br>The statistics related directly to business turnover within the Welsh<br>economy and show that for the period 1998-2002, overall business<br>turnover peaked in 2000 at Â£68.6bn and declined for the next two<br>years, mainly because of the dramatic reduction in the contribution of<br>manufacturing, which fell by Â£5.5bn.<br><br>In contrast, services have not compensated for this dramatic loss in<br>production, as turnover only increased by Â£2.2bn in the period 2000-02.<br><br>The Welsh economy is not alone in suffering such a decline, as<br>Scotland also saw a dramatic fall in the overall business turnover of<br>its economy, although all English regions showed an increase.<br><br>Given this, it will be interesting to see the figures for the relative<br>prosperity of the Welsh economy when they are published next year. You<br>may think that I would predict a scenario of further doom and gloom<br>but, in contrast, I expect an increase relative to the rest of the UK,<br>especially given the growing impact of the public sector in Wales in<br>terms of capital spend (particularly in terms of infrastructure<br>projects) and employment.<br><br>This may explain where the biggest challenge lies for the Assembly<br>Government in that it can only control the influence of public sector<br>expenditure and, without any direct legislative powers, is largely<br>restricted in its influence over the private sector economy.<br><br>To be fair, it can "out-grant" many regions of the UK in attracting<br>call centres to Cardiff but seemingly cannot do anything about the<br>globalisation revolution that is quickly transferring manufacturing<br>out of Objective One areas into low-wage countries such as China.<br><br>The only real intervention it can make in the long term is to change<br>the business culture of Wales to make it more entrepreneurial and<br>innovative. We keep hearing stock political phrases about "adding<br>value" to the Welsh economy to make it more competitive, but this<br>seems to be predominantly rooted in developing or attracting<br>high-technology businesses to Wales. Whilst important, this ignores<br>the fact that we already have a business base of over 150,000 firms<br>that could, collectively, make a real difference to the development of<br>the Welsh economy, especially if the capacity for change within these<br>businesses could be improved in a range of areas.<br><br>In particular, there has been a failure over the last decade to<br>improve the management capabilities of Welsh businesses, with almost<br>no serious investment in the development of high-level management<br>skills in Wales, especially within our poorer regions. For example,<br>even with the availability of Objective One funds, there has only been<br>one serious initiative - the Â£10m Management Development Centre at<br>Bangor University - that has been supported to create a centre of<br>excellence in this area. Even this worthwhile project is allegedly<br>well behind schedule, over-budget and struggling to attract matched<br>funding support from the private sector.<br><br>As I mentioned last month, other nations such as China have seen the<br>important link between education and economic prosperity and, despite<br>the valiant efforts of the grossly under-resourced Wales Management<br>Council, very little funding is available within the Assembly's vast<br>education and training budget to promote and support the development<br>of higher-level management skills within Welsh enterprises.<br><br>In this environment, it saddens me that, collectively, our business<br>schools in Wales seem to be teaching more overseas postgraduate<br>management students than employees of Welsh firms.<br><br>This cannot be right, and if we are to ensure that turnover within our<br>private sector in Wales improves, then we must start to invest some of<br>the Assembly's training budget to upskill the managers who will make<br>our businesses more competitive in the future.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>THE INNOVATION ECONOMY -- MANAGING FOR INNOVATION<br><br>http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_41/b3903462.htm<br><br>Building An Idea Factory<br>Inspiration is fine, but above all, innovation is really a management<br>process.<br><br>Ask most people who invented the lightbulb, and they will promptly<br>provide the wrong answer: Thomas Alva Edison. Truth is, the famous<br>inventor's 1879 debut of his incandescent light trailed others by<br>decades. So why does he get all the glory? Mostly because of what he<br>did next, notes Andrew Hargadon, author of How Breakthroughs Happen:<br>The Surprising Truth about How Companies Innovate. To get his creation<br>to the masses, Edison and his team of engineers in Menlo Park, N.J.,<br>spent years building the entire electric system, from light sockets<br>and safety fuses to generating facilities and the wiring network. Only<br>then did the electric light flare into the innovation that lit the world.<br>Advertisement<br><br>In short, Edison beat all his predecessors at one crucial task:<br>managing the whole process of innovation, from light-bulb moment to<br>final product. Today that task is scarcely easier than it was 125<br>years ago. Sure, it's easy to get lucky once in a while. The real<br>trick is doing it over and over again. "Managing innovation means<br>cultivating an environment where lightning can strike twice," says<br>Paul Saffo, research director at the think tank Institute for the<br>Future. "It's extraordinarily difficult."<br><br>To hard-headed business people, innovation often seems as predictable<br>as a rainbow and as manageable as a butterfly. Penicillin, Teflon,<br>Post-it Notes -- they sprang from such accidents as moldy Petri<br>dishes, a failed coolant, and a mediocre glue. It's no wonder so many<br>executives throw up their hands. "Our approach has always been very<br>simple, which is to try not to manage innovation," shrugs Silicon<br>Valley venture capitalist Michael Moritz, a partner with Sequoia<br>Capital. "We prefer to just let the market manage it."<br><br>Yet even in the Darwinian chaos of Silicon Valley, innovations are<br>made, not born. The world's most innovative companies, from Procter &amp;<br>Gamble (PG ) and Toyota Motor (TM ) to Apple Computer (AAPL ) and<br>Edison's own General Electric (GE ), make their own luck. They plunge<br>ahead on new ideas even though they know most will fail. "You have to<br>go down blind alleys," says Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and chief<br>executive of pioneer online retailer Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN ). "But<br>every once in a while you go down an alley and it opens up into this<br>huge, broad avenue. That makes all the blind alleys worthwhile."<br><br>"COMMODITY HELL"<br>Problem is, a lot of forces today conspire against innovative products<br>getting to market. Small outfits that are often the most innovative<br>get short shrift because buyers aren't sure they can deliver or even<br>survive to keep supporting their products. And for large corporations,<br>there's the "innovator's dilemma" coined by Harvard Business School<br>professor Clayton Christensen. By catering to their best customers<br>with increasingly advanced and more expensive products -- a seemingly<br>sensible approach -- successful companies ignore or even discourage<br>less profitable low-end products. But as startups produce these<br>low-end products and they improve, they eat into the core markets of<br>large companies. Thanks to such innovations as Internet phones,<br>discount airlines, and open-source software, the innovators' dilemma<br>is now afflicting blue-chips AT&amp;T (T ), United Airlines (UALAQ ), and<br>Microsoft (MSFT ). Says Gerard M. Mooney, vice-president and director<br>of corporate strategy at IBM (IBM ): "All big companies have trouble<br>coming up with the Next Big Thing."<br><br>Managing innovation better may be the only way out of the "abyss<br>called commodity hell," as GE Chief Executive Jeffrey R. Immelt has<br>put it. Today, having the biggest factories or running the most ads is<br>no longer enough to stay ahead. Shorter product cycles,<br>ultra-efficient contract manufacturers that upstarts can use to enter<br>a market fast, and a glut of factory capacity that depresses prices --<br>all of those render traditional Industrial Age competitive advantages<br>moot. Serial innovation may prove to be the key skill of the<br>Information Age. "Serendipity is nice, but we can't leave this to<br>happenstance," says John Seely Brown, a visiting scholar at the<br>University of Southern California's Annenberg Center for Communication<br>and former chief scientist and head of Xerox Corp.'s legendary Palo<br>Alto Research Center. "We just don't have the money any longer to<br>screw around."<br><br>The good news is that crisis is the mother of innovation. The economic<br>boom of the 1990s produced a raft of nimble new rivals, forcing<br>established companies from IBM to Procter &amp; Gamble to shake up<br>longstanding habits. And even if some of those threats looked less<br>fearsome as the economy soured, the savviest CEOs realized it was a<br>competitive advantage to continue pushing their troops to rethink how<br>they develop products and services -- in a sense, to rethink<br>innovation itself. "We went through a really tough patch in 2000,"<br>says P&amp;G Chief Technology Officer G. Gilbert Cloyd. "That got us moving."<br><br>Some of the methods companies are using to spur innovation, such as<br>setting impossibly high goals and relentlessly experimenting, will<br>sound familiar in places like Silicon Valley. But they're often<br>considered unwise or frilly by traditional corporations. Others, such<br>as opening up company procedures and research to the outside world,<br>are new and controversial. One thing underlies them all: courage. The<br>companies that have endured are those whose leaders bet the future not<br>just on marketing savvy or manufacturing might but on innovation.<br><br>RISKY GOALS<br>For one, they're not afraid to think big and tackle goals that others<br>deem too risky. Consider Apple Computer Inc. In early 2001, the<br>Cupertino (Calif.) personal-computer pioneer hit on the idea of making<br>a digital music player as easy to use as Sony Corp.'s (SNE ) Walkman<br>was for cassette tapes. Yet while the iPod debuted just nine months<br>later, CEO Steven P. Jobs realized that selling hardware wasn't good<br>enough. That's when he set to work on the seemingly impossible:<br>providing easy, legal access to lots of songs, something no one had<br>yet managed.<br><br>By April, 2003, Jobs had done it. By painstakingly working out<br>digital-rights issues with recalcitrant record companies, Apple opened<br>an online download store that featured 200,000 songs, soon to grow to<br>an unprecedented 1 million. Now Apple owns tech's hottest product,<br>with total sales of 3.7 million iPods grossing $1 billion. Says Jobs:<br>"We can invent a complete solution that works."<br><br>What's more, Jobs's big bet has helped him redefine the company.<br>Apple, with a negligible 2% share of the PC market, has a shot at<br>becoming a dominant force in the exploding market for digital<br>entertainment. That kind of radical shift stands in stark contrast to<br>the safe path too many companies take, says A. Richard Newton, dean of<br>the College of Engineering at the University of California at<br>Berkeley. "What's missing today is inspired leadership that has a<br>lofty enough vision to spur great things along the way," says Newton.<br><br>Thinking big is important, but sweating the details is just as<br>critical to spurring continuous innovation. Several years ago, Toyota<br>Motor Corp. (TM ) made one change to its production lines, using a<br>single brace to hold auto frames together instead of the 50 it took<br>previously. In the context of Toyota's famously complex production<br>system, it looked almost insignificant. But this Global Body Line<br>system helped slash 75% off the cost of refitting a production line.<br>And it is the reason behind Toyota's ability to make different models<br>on a single line. The change contributed to manufacturing cost savings<br>of $2.6 billion last year, helping produce profits in the year ended<br>Mar. 31 that topped those of Ford Motor Co. (F ) and General Motors<br>Corp. (GM ) combined.<br><br>It's a testament to the importance of managing the thousand-and-one<br>small innovations that together become something transformative.<br>Through a process called kaizen, the Japanese word for continuous<br>improvement, the auto maker relentlessly tries to find ways to enhance<br>every step from design through assembly. "Every day, every minute,<br>they're trying to improve their production systems or productivity or<br>quality," says Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. (GS ) auto analyst Kunihiko Shiohara.<br><br>That requires perhaps the most fundamental quality of innovative<br>companies. They never stop hammering away at problems and<br>opportunities. They know that if they do, someone else will hammer<br>them. Says John L. Hennessy, president of Stanford University and<br>co-founder of chip designer MIPS Computer Systems (MIPS ): "It's<br>better to shoot yourself in the foot than to allow somebody else to<br>shoot you in some more vital part of the anatomy."<br><br>When Amazon.com managers noticed in 1999 that eBay Inc. (EBAY ) was<br>taking off, for instance, they launched their own auction site to tap<br>into the same group of sellers -- and the high-margin stream of<br>commissions. But eBay's momentum was too great, and Amazon's auctions<br>largely fizzled. Amazon also opened zShops, a gallery of independent<br>merchants on its site, but that attempt to create a marketplace didn't<br>catch fire either. In late 2000, an Amazonian came up with yet another<br>idea: Let other sellers offer their wares on the same page as Amazon's<br>own products. "Inviting third-party sellers onto our prime real estate<br>-- that made some palms sweat," Bezos admits.<br><br>But the Seattle-based company plowed ahead, and this feature has<br>turned into a hit. Now some 26% of unit sales on Amazon.com are by<br>other sellers, who like how easy it is to list items. "The<br>Amazon-selling platform is second to none," says Scot Wingo, CEO of<br>ChannelAdvisor Corp. in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which helps<br>large merchants sell on eBay and Amazon. The 60%-plus profit margin on<br>the commissions and fees it charges other merchants has overcome any<br>cannibalization. Bezos says people who buy used books buy more new<br>books, too. All that has helped the company to log four straight<br>profitable quarters.<br><br>"CONNECT AND DEVELOP"<br>Bezos isn't just stubborn. He makes his constant experimentation<br>economical by keeping project teams small and nimble. That way, even<br>when they fail, they haven't spent much time or money. Says Bezos: "To<br>the degree that you can get people in teams small enough that they can<br>be fed on two pizzas, you'll get a lot more productivity."<br><br>Increasingly, companies are rethinking where innovations come from.<br>The best ideas aren't always inside corporate research and development<br>labs, notes Henry Chesbrough, visiting assistant professor at UC<br>Berkeley's Haas School of Business and author of the book Open<br>Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from<br>Technology. So it's becoming crucial to knock down walls inside the<br>company -- between research and manufacturing or marketing -- while at<br>the same time reaching outside the company for ideas. But it's not<br>easy to do. Says Chesbrough: "There are powerful forces resisting the<br>opening up of companies' innovation processes."<br><br>Nowhere was that more apparent than at Procter &amp; Gamble. Growth and<br>profits at the Cincinnati packaged-goods company stalled several years<br>ago, partly because some costly products developed in-house tanked.<br>New CEO Alan G. Lafley shook things up, replacing half of the<br>company's top 30 officers and urging product groups to "connect and<br>develop" by pulling in experts from unrelated brands to help on new<br>product creation.<br><br>For example, when P&amp;G decided to move into a new market, the home<br>car-care business, researchers didn't start from scratch. They looked<br>around P&amp;G for related expertise -- and struck gold. The company's PuR<br>unit's water-filter experts knew how to deionize water to get rid of<br>minerals, and its Cascade unit already had a compound in its<br>dishwasher detergent that reduced water spots. They used both<br>technologies in what became Mr. Clean AutoDry, a $24.99 handheld<br>sprayer system. It's so popular that it has helped to more than double<br>overall Mr. Clean brand sales in the past year. It also showed the<br>company a new way to innovate. Says Karl Ronn, vice-president of P&amp;G's<br>home-care division: "Innovation nowadays is more like improvisation in<br>jazz than playing out a score that's already written."<br><br>Lafley didn't stop there. He also decreed that half the company's new<br>product ideas eventually come from outside, up from 20% last year.<br>That push has produced several popular products such as Olay<br>Regenerist, a new antiwrinkle cream based on a skin-repair compound<br>from a French company. The approach seems to be paying off. P&amp;G's<br>overall unit growth before acquisitions has jumped from zero in 2001<br>to 8% last year. For the fourth quarter ended June 30, overall profits<br>shot up 44%, to $1.4 billion, on a 10% rise in sales, excluding<br>acquisitions.<br><br>Other companies are reaching out in more radical ways, such as tapping<br>their own customers' expertise to develop fresh products and services.<br>EBay CEO Margaret C. Whitman wasn't exaggerating when she told<br>thousands of attendees at the online marketplace's annual conference<br>of buyers and sellers in June, "You are in the room with us whenever<br>we make a decision." EBay watches what they trade on the site and<br>flies in buyers and sellers for feedback. Effectively, it lets its<br>customers decide where to expand next. That approach has paid off: 11<br>categories, from cars to jewelry, now top $1 billion in annual gross<br>sales each, and eBay's stock is worth $59 billion.<br><br>EBay's approach may be hard for many conventional companies to<br>emulate. But the notion of bringing customers inside to help develop<br>new products is catching on in mainstream corporations as well. In<br>2000, for instance, IBM signed a deal with GM to co-develop a<br>supercomputer for GM's car design and crash testing. The machine saved<br>GM $1 billion in product-development costs in the past three years and<br>cut by as much as 64% the time to get a car from the design stage to<br>the dealer's lot.<br><br>IBM may have gained even more. The work put into IBM's microprocessor<br>chip, operating system, and other software to make it a leader in<br>supercomputing also helped supercharge its commercial-server business.<br>"We got a huge competitive edge," says Bernard V. Schwartz, IBM's<br>global account executive for GM product development. In late August<br>market watcher Gartner Research (IT ) said IBM expanded its leading<br>share of the $11.5 billion server market to nearly 31%.<br><br>The ultimate in innovation, though, is not merely to come up with new<br>products and services. It's to create entirely new markets where none<br>existed before -- and better yet, to provide something that changes<br>the way we live and work. Innovation was never just about new gizmos<br>and gadgets. But in a service economy, innovations more than ever must<br>transcend objects. Some of today's most successful companies, from<br>Virgin Group Ltd. to eBay, create not only innovative products or<br>services but also novel business models.<br><br>"THIRD PLACE"<br>Most people might think of Starbucks, for instance, as a fancy coffee<br>joint. Not Chairman Howard D. Schultz. He sees the 8,000-store chain<br>as a "third place" for people to hang out besides home and work.<br>That's why a seemingly unrelated service -- offering wireless Net<br>access in its stores starting two years ago -- turned out to be a<br>winner. Although Starbucks Corp. (SBUX ) won't quantify the revenue<br>impact, people using the service stay nine times longer than the usual<br>five minutes, almost certainly buying more lattÃ©s. And 90% of<br>customers who log on are doing so after peak morning hours, filling<br>stores during previously light periods. Says Anne Saunders, Starbucks'<br>senior vice-president of marketing: "If we'd only thought of ourselves<br>as a coffee company, we wouldn't have done this."<br><br>The wireless network also inspired a new initiative that could again<br>remake the Seattle-based company. Its new Hear Music Coffeehouses,<br>about to be rolled out in existing Starbucks stores in Seattle with<br>plans for up to 1,000 sites by the end of 2005, feature dozens of<br>listening stations where people can make custom CDs, at about a buck a<br>tune, from hundreds of thousands of songs. In addition to offering a<br>new service to 30 million weekly customers, Schultz has said he thinks<br>Starbucks could transform the music business. At the least, he's<br>transforming Starbucks once again.<br><br>Who ever would have thought that Apple and Starbucks might compete?<br>Therein lies a fundamental constant of innovation: Nothing stays<br>constant. Contending with innovation's disruptive influence requires<br>what Amazon's Bezos calls a "culture of divine discontent" in which<br>everyone itches to improve things. "Most people, unleashed, are<br>innovators," he says. "We're this great species of tool-using animal<br>who likes to make our world better." The companies that can unleash<br>that particular animal instinct are the ones that will thrive.<br><br>By Robert D.
