            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the topic's kinda... not right. Man are animals too... but oh well.<br><br>I was just wondering... if it was right for humans to rear animals for food.<br><br>While it is only natural that humans eat meat from those animals, because that's part of the food cycle... Are we abusing the animals by rearing them, making them grow up and all that, eventually slaughtering them to fill our stomachs?<br><br>Is it necessary to do so? Can we survive without meat, only subsisting on vegetarian foods?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no need to be vegetarian, if u think it's cruel then eat only the animals that don't produce enough brain cells to know what is pain. like fish, fish feel no pain.<br><br>if u are on vegetarian diet u are less likely to give birth to a boy. And if u do have a son, he's five times more likely to suffer from hypospadias, a condition in which the urethra opens below the tip of the penis. vegetarians may suffer loss of sexual function, while vegan diets deficient in minerals and vitamins can lead to blindness.<br><br>This is copied from ananova.com<br><br>A Dutch scientist says he can create artificial meat in laboratories without killing animals.<br><br>Wiete Westerhof, from the University of Amsterdam, plans to use the same method used to produce artificial skin.<br><br>He believes he will be able to grow lumps of meat weighing up to 50kg in large containers.<br><br>The meat would be produced using collagen particles and muscle cells taken from "animal donors" who would not be harmed.<br><br>The muscle cells would then grow and multiply on the collagen.<br><br>Mr Westerhof anticipates containers able to hold more than 5,000 litres, in which the meat would grow in a nutrient solution.<br><br>This liquid would contain 62 ingredients, including 20 amino acids, 12 vitamins and various enzymes.<br><br>"The product will have the structure and taste of lean meat, but animals won't have to suffer for it," said Mr Westerhof.<br><br>The dermatologist says pork, beef and chicken meat could all be produced artificially as well as kangaroo, whale and shellfish.<br><br>Mr Westerhof and two businessmen own the worldwide patent to the method and are looking for investors<br></div>

Fish cannot feel pain, the largest study into piscine neurology has concluded.<br><br>An academic study comparing the nervous systems and responses of fish and mammals has found that fishes' brains are not sufficiently developed to allow them to sense pain or fear.<br><br>The study is the work of James D Rose, a professor of zoology and physiology at the University of Wyoming, who has been working on questions of neurology for almost 30 years. He has examined data on the responses of animals to pain and stimulus from scores of studies collected over the past 15 years.<br><br>His report, published in the American journal Reviews of Fisheries Science, has concluded that awareness of pain depends on functions of specific regions of the cerebral cortex which fish do not possess.<br><br>Professor Rose, 60, said that previous studies which had indicated that fish can feel pain had confused nociception - responding to a threatening stimulus - with feeling pain.<br><br>"Pain is predicated on awareness," he said. "The key issue is the distinction between nociception and pain. A person who is anaesthetised in an operating theatre will still respond physically to an external stimulus, but he or she will not feel pain. Anyone who has seen a chicken with its head cut off will know that, while its body can respond to stimuli, it cannot be feeling pain."<br><br>Professor Rose said he was enormously concerned with the welfare of fish, but that campaigners should concentrate on ensuring that they were able to enjoy clean and well-managed rivers and seas.<br><br>Despite the findings of Professor Rose's study, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has invested heavily in an anti-angling campaign, said: "We believe that fishing is barbaric. Of course animals can feel pain. They have sensitivity, if only to avoid predators."<br><br>The Telegraph, London<br><br>http://uk.outdoorsports.yahoo.com/030210/233/dsvmh.html<br><br>Report Says Fish Do Not Feel Pain<br>By Graham Marsden<br><br>The biggest ever study into fish neurology has found that the brain of a fish is not developed enough to feel pain or feel fear.<br>James D Rose, 60, a professor of zoology and physiology at the University Of Wyoming, USA, has published the report in the American academic journal Â‘Reviews In Fisheries ScienceÂ’ and has compared the nervous systems and responses of fish and mammals and found that pain is an emotional or psychological response controlled by a part of the brain that is not present in fish.<br><br>He said that previous studies that claimed that fish do feel pain were confusing the emotion with the fishÂ’s ability to detect when it had an injury.<br><br>Professor Rose stated: Â“A person who is anaesthetised in an operating theatre will still respond physically to an external stimulus but will not feel pain.<br><br>Â“There are people who arenÂ’t comfortable with my findings but even those who donÂ’t accept them have yet to raise any scientific challenge.Â”<br><br>FISHINGmagic says:<br>This is a severe blow to PETA and other animal rights organisations who have campaigned for years on the grounds that fishing is just another blood sport where the fish feel as much pain as any other animal.<br><br>For the same number of years anglers have strenuously denied this, citing thousands of actual incidents that prove, to anyone with a modicum of common sense, that fish do not feel pain. For instance, a creature than can pull back against a hook through itÂ’s lip, or carry on feeding when mortally wounded following an attack from a predator, cannot possibly feel pain.<br><br>The report is certain to provoke PETA and the like into yet another wild scheme similar to the hanging dog advert in order to claw back a little credibility.<br><br>The truth, however, will always prevail.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my take on the issue is. . .<br><br>well humans are animals.<br><br>and animals do use any means possible to make it easier for them to get food.  humans are also following the same animal trend of thought when thinking of ways to save them the trouble of having to go forage and hunt for food.<br><br>so what is so non-animal about breeding animals for food?  and if people dun breed animals for food, u'll prob run out of wild life pretty fast</div>
