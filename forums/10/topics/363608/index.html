              <h5>Briena Barrett</h5>
              <cite>June 10, 2009 - 3:29PM</cite></div>
              <p>A rapidly expanding social networking site has been slammed for its racist taunts against immigrants to Australia.</p>
              <p>The Facebook Group, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=48449193335"><span style="font-style: italic;">F*** Off, We’re Full</span></a>, has nearly 65,000 members and believes any immigrants coming to Australia must adapt to what it calls the ‘Aussie lifestyle.’</p>
              <p>“This
              idea of Australia being a multicultural community has served only to
              dilute our sovereignty and our national identity,” the site states.</p>
              <p>“As Australians, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle.”</p>
              <p>The website is full of debate on its discussion board. The latest topics put up for comment include: <span style="font-style: italic;">Will Indian race-rioters be hunted down?</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">All foreigners need to be euthanised</span>.</p>
              <p>Matt, an active member of the group, said he joined because he believed immigrants were ruining the Australian way of life.</p>
              <p>“That’s
              why I joined it because I’m a very proud Australian and I love this
              place and I wouldn’t give it up for the world,” he said.</p>
              <p>He believed the Federal Government’s current immigration policies were too lenient.</p>
              <p>“Personally
              I think that it should be put out there that we will shoot or destroy
              any vessel that comes into the Australian waters without the applicable
              visas or the Australian Government knowing of their existence,” he said.</p>
              <p>Female member Courtney said she recognised the site was racist but stood by its beliefs.</p>
              <p>“I believe if you are going to come here, then do what we do and if you don’t like it then leave,” she said.</p>
              <p>Another member, who doesn’t want his name used, mirrored this view.</p>
              <p>“I
              don’t see why it should be a problem to have a group that is basically
              of an opinion that our country is full at the moment and we don’t need
              any more bloody third world immigrants coming over here and making
              things worse than they already are,” he said.</p>
              <p>Murdoch University senior psychology lecturer Dr Anne Pedersen said the Facebook members were contradicting themselves.</p>
              <p>“Why
              should we make people of colour assimilate to the white Australian
              culture, when in fact Indigenous people were the first people here,”
              she said.</p>
              <p>Project SafeCom coordinator Jack Smit, who advocates for refugee rights, said the site was incredibly offensive.</p>
              <p>“Stop vilifying migrants and stop vilifying refugees who are running for their lives... and need to come here,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Everyone
              who attempts to exclude a whole swag of nationalities from what they
              regard as true Australians commits a form of racism.”</p>
              <p>Dr Pedersen believed shutting down the group would be pointless but said there was a limit to freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>“I believe in freedom in speech, but with free speech comes responsibility and this is irresponsible,” she said.</p>
              <p>The
              Australian Protectionist Party, which describes itself as the patriotic
              movement Australia is looking for, says multiculturalism is ruining
              Australia.</p>
              <p>Party spokesman Darrin Hodges regularly
              uploads topic discussions on the site and says the Australian identity
              needs to be protected.</p>
              <p>“Every country does have its
              own culture and way of life and they should be looking to preserve that
              rather than turning all countries into a globalised mish-mash,” he said.</p>
              <p>“In terms of protecting the identity, that comes back down to immigration and who is allowed into the country and who isn’t.</p>
              <p>"We would see immigration turned back to the more traditional forces of being Europe and Great Britain.”</p>
              <p>But Dr Pedersen said Australia was already a multicultural society and had been for a long time.</p>
              <p>“It’s
              just that we’re not white anymore, walk down the streets, we’re not a
              white city anymore and thank god we’re not, “ she said.</p>
              <p>A
              spokesman for immigration minister Chris Evans said the Government
              strongly opposed the fostering of extremism, racial hatred, division
              and incitement to violence "and we condemn those who promote the
              vilification of ethnic groups within the community".</p>
              <p>"Australia is a country of migrants," he said.</p>
              <p>"About
              45 per cent of our population... was either born overseas or has at
              least one parent who was born overseas. This means that nearly half of
              all Australians are either migrants or children of migrants.</p>
              <p>"Along
              with the significant economic benefits of migration, Australia has been
              enriched by the cultures and traditions of migrants from more than 200
              countries around the world who have chosen to make a home in our great
              nation."</p>
              <p>Facebook’s Statement of Rights and
              Responsibilities states that any content that is "unlawful, misleading,
              malicious or discriminatory" could be shut down.EOQ</p>

              hearing that South Australian changed its opinion and let a Muslim
              woman have her picture on her driver's license with her face covered...<br><br><br><br>Quote written by an aussie citizen and published in an Australian Newspaper:<br>"Immigrants,
              not Australians, Must ADAPT. Take it or leave it! I am tired of this
              nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their
              culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali, we have experienced a
              surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians."<br><br>However,
              the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the 'politically
              correct' crowd began complaining about the possibility that our
              patriotism was offending others. I am not against immigration, nor do I
              hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to
              Australia.<br><br>However, there are a few things that those who have
              recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to
              understand.<br>This idea of Australia being a multicultural community
              has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As
              Australians, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language
              and our own lifestyle.<br><br>This culture has been developed over two
              centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and
              women who have sought freedom.<br><br>We speak ENGLISH, not spanish, lebanese, arabic, chinese, japanese, russian or any other language.<br>Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, <br>LEARN THE LANGUAGE!<br><br>If
              the Southern Cross offends you, or you don't like 'A Fair Go', then you
              should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet.<br><br>We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really dont care how you did things where you came from.<br>This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this.<br><br>But
              once you are done complaining, whining and griping about Our Flag, Our
              Pledge, Our National Motto, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you
              to advantage of one other great Australian freedom..<br><br>THE RIGHT TO LEAVE!<br><br>If
              you arent happy here then move on! We didn't force you to come here.
              You asked to be here. So Accept the country YOU accepted.<br><br>Pretty easy really, when you think about it.<br><br><br>If
              we all pass this around or invite your friends to read this sooner or
              later this will get to the complainers and THEY WILL GET THE POINT!<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
