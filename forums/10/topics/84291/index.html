I have no connection with the circle line watsoever...</span> </blockquote></strong>Ya after reading I know you are no one or just trying to hide in this forums. Whoever, this is just to know what it about(not all yet)for the nation project like NELP, CCL and the upcoming Pinnacle @ Duxton <strong><blockquote> <span style="color: red;">The point </span>about "Do u think they will build out something tat cannot earn money ? " is to mention tat the company tat had caused the collapse had taken into account all the cost yet manage to come up with a cost price tat is cheaper than the other companies, thus should be awarded the contract.<br><br>About NEL, r u sure they purposely go and find a contractor tat had request for a high price ? I thought the cost of NEL is due to the implementation of <span style="color: red;">"high technology"... </span></blockquote></strong>The point is you still did not know what is low and <span style="color: red;">way way below </span>the cost of building. <span style="color: red;">It mention in the last 2 post on </span><span style="color: blue;">3) they simply do not know anything.</span>As for "high technology" i will come to it in the below part. read on what high tech is!!! <strong><blockquote>Maybe u can try to <span style="color: red;">cut down words like JV </span>as probably few people knew wat it is about. Why don't u try to provide information about the JV instead ? <span style="color: red;">BTW the company tat cause the collapse is not a local contractor...</span></blockquote></strong> JV ~ Joint Venture, you din even know what the whole thing is and try to defend it. Never mind read on, lots of Singaporean dun know fxxk sh|t what is going on anyway. Yes it one Jap company and WHO?? do you know? Most national projects will be done by this so call JV thing as the garment know that the local had and till today has no such knowledge and equipment.(Why not you find out more a years back or so why one of the LTA SPE in that nicoll site kill himself, and btw SPE stand for senior project engineer if like what you say you are no one and dun even know what JV is. After nicoll his wife did say that before he kill himself, he keep saying it not a safe site to work in.) <strong><blockquote>WAAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAAA ! Big difference leh !!! </blockquote> </strong>yes, it is. <strong><blockquote><span style="color: red;">Wat is your point ? </span>The fees for <span style="color: red;">NEL is still higher </span>than the MRT line owned by SMRT isn't it ? <span style="color: blue;">They use their cost price to determien the fare for the public, </span>thus is they <span style="color: red;">spent more on building </span>out the stations, tis costs inevitably will be passed down to us consumers. Therefore it<span style="color: red;"> make sense for LTA or watever to accept low bidders </span>isn't it ? </blockquote> </strong>The point to you is you <span style="color: blue;">can offer to the reasonably low tender</span> but sure <span style="color: red;">not to those way way below </span>which as they know that there is no way they themselves can build on that budget.<br>Back to <span style="color: red;">high technology</span>. high tech. ~ Driverless? if you never take the NEL b4 or din notice the news or whatever maybe you dun know it driverless. Driverless ~ safe cost? It was say to be have save cost as it cut down manpower. So from you that they used their cost price to set the fare back than but why it is still higher than SMART? In your case all was count in than why it still higher? <strong><blockquote>JV = ? Who he JV with ? <span style="color: red;">Since u know he is Jap company and hold certain standard, then wat is your complains </span>?</blockquote></strong> Look at what JV is from above and fine out which locol coy is with them. even they are not bad to you, it is still hinder lots of thing within the site. Most of all what was LTA doing than. Go check, ask around <strong><blockquote>Since the safety factor is higher or the same, then why complain tat they do not calculate the safety cost when they bid in your earlier reply ? </blockquote></strong>Read again, I am asking you can you say that the safety factor is the higher if not the same? And hello, for design and cost is 2 diff things, design it self need cost and to carry the safety measure you need the other cost. <strong><blockquote>So in the end there is checks conducted to make sure they do not use shortcut or inferior materials. So why blame Gov for <span style="color: red;">accepting low bids </span>?</blockquote></strong> Again you try to jump away from the point. What do you know abt the check done by them? At what frequency? How detail? Last, till now I am trying to say it was and most of the time given to the low and way below bids. Get back to HDB, which MNC will want to tender and do you think HDB will give to them for that kind of bid HDB had in mind. It is still PUBLIC but becoming privatise. smartisstupid.</div>

R they closed shop or at receivership ? To build up a reputation need time and many successful projects. DO u think they will just default and ran everytime ? Why don't u just admit tat there is no reason for them to bid low unless they can afford it ?<br><br><blockquote>Get this pt. again If you wish to exchange pt here in this topic than you should go check up on things, facts, and what abbreaviation ppl in this field used, if not what the pt here?Your reply is empty other than my english is poor. </blockquote>U r right, tat is the whole point of tat passage. But then u have earlier include passages tat speak nothing but my bad english like using "public" transport fees or condemning me for not knowing your little abbreviations like JV etc. As I said before, it is your responsibility to explain each abbreviation before u write it, not I to find it out the meaning for every abbreviation u find it interesting to write it down.<br><br><blockquote>Out of point. You had no idea of what equipment/s you are talking for such project. MNC can bid lower? For you knowledge, for this tunnel project, the machine and equipment can only be used once due to geotechnic reason. Again empty If like you say than MNC dun have to buy the machine, local must? Why not say the local have no idea on how to bid on such project. </blockquote>I am pretty sure the number of cranes, trunks and cement mixer can be accounted as equipment. MNC probably can deploy <strong>more</strong> cranes, trucks, pile driver and workers etc to a project isn't it ? They know how to bid for your one time equipment too, isn't tat considered equipment as well ? maybe they have a closer connection than u think and can buy it in discounts. And r u sure the do not need the use of special equipments tat can be used many times ? If u r so smart, maybe u can try to be your own boss and bid against the foreigner too.<br><br><blockquote>Again out of pt. Anything to do with knowing this ppl personally? If yes, so? NAME just one coy that start when Singapore form till today that is doing very well. None that you mention is. Lian Beng, Hong Lai Huat, Chip Eng Seng had call me few time. Hock Chuan Ann back out from CCL. Know this ppl, ya they are good at paying themselves 1st, end year say not making, all get nothing but they change bigger or new car? </blockquote>Firstly, u seems to be interested in just "history" of companies. I am showing examples of companies tat were relatively successful up till now. Why do number of years the companies r in have to be considered into tis discussion ? I believe some of them r already at least 10 years old, u dare to say all of them r younger than 10 years ? Isn't 10 years good enough ?<br><br>They change to bigger cars and watever just means they r good at milking their employees... it doesn't mean they r bad in business.<br><br>Lastly, why does Hock Chuan Ann back out in the last minute ? I thought u have this impression that thgey will go around and bid incredibly low prices then ran away altogether ? Why don't Hock Chuan Ann do tat ? It is because he want to maintain his reputation and he want to continue doing business. There is no rationale for bidding low<br><br><blockquote>As long local Constructions Bosses carry on paying peanuts, he will just keep getting monkeys on site. Till today none is changing for better? Even Hyflux Ltd are not paying local but rather pay FT(foreign talent) Singapore dun have construction manager? Why need one FT(Expensive one)? Singapore dun have Safety Office? Why again get FT(Cheap FT)? </blockquote>Paying foreign talent not people meh ? Do u think u will be a better boss than them ? Does paying highly to local people means better busines sense ? Do u judge a company just by how much salary they give ?<br><br><strong>They have agreed on a time for completion of work. If they cannot finish in time, then don't agree.

Check with Hock Chuan Ann, why they back out, is one of the reason due to progress claim? You say you are not in this field, you dun take what i said, than you will have to check it out and than get back at me. it just show you are empty </blockquote>So u have a problem with Progress claim ? So when they switch their policy to progress claim u felt it is a sign they r running out of funds ?<br><br><blockquote>Hazi... what is that you dun get, the 'team management' is for show, it has no say at all, the PM(project manager) CM(construction manager) SM(site M.) engineer and ppl down the line had no a single power of decision making, even for ordering of material for work? All only the PD(Project Director) can. Isn't this a one man local coy? </blockquote>So in your opinion if only a man can decide certain decisions, then it is a one man team ? In Macdonald only the manager can decide if they can compensate certain items for an angry customer. Does tat means it is a one man team and the cashiers, cooks and cleaners doesn't count ?<br><br><blockquote>LTA only start to look into details after so many incident had happened, but till now for CCL stage 4 and 5 tender it is said that C854 still the lowest get.

FYI, the percentage difference between Taisei and Obayashi is a mere 7% difference. As u have known, tis is an approximation and people have known to charge 10% for profits and 5% for negotiation fees and another 10% more for safety margin.

They cite one of the reason for the higher cost is due to the manless system. Wat do u mean by asking the people if they want a low fare or high fare ? Being a user I will ask it to be free, i.e no fare to be paid. Surely a company has to gage the price of its service instead of asking a customer to set one. Customer of course choose it to be free or near free. </blockquote>I am saying that GOV keep on saying they will ask ppl pt b4 any decision is made but in this case why the reason given in the end was mention differently 1st place as high tech cost more. If high tech cost more, why not used manual and it will also create job as well.<br><br><blockquote>t was linked because the media and people r suggesting the possibility of the disaster is due to the acceptance of low bids.

If it the same why 2 MP need to answer to the question? ppl like you just like to link things together anyhow. Well that has been the way. I wrote that all those local coy that tender in Pinnacle with way below cost prize to go bust. But somehow it ended up here with nicoll incident in it of which you can drill on it only without much fact.<br><br><blockquote>Can u be certain tat if the tender is given to a higher bidder, all the problems will vanish ?

Will u pay a higher price for the same goods ? </blockquote>As your wish if you still insist that those work way under the cost can do it and not have any problem on the finish product as in this case blocks of HDB flat, than be it. Who is in the field b4, me or you? As you say something like you are no one and not in the field. You can insist all you want without fact or witness it yourself for all I care.<br>As a <span style="color: blue;">developer </span>(<span style="color: red;">company is not the words here</span>) all will used logical business sence to give to the bider that he can work on a comfortable margine as the developer will calculate and have in mind what it is going to cost. Simple math, if it need $10 to do it and some one come with $0.10 and you give it to him, what logical business sence are you talking here?<br><br><blockquote>Do u know wat u r suggesting ?

My pt is <span style="color: red;">do they know anything in the 1st place</span>Btw FT was not bring into the picture here. It will just get more complex.

So doesn't tat make perfectly good reason on my part to ask if u r involved in the project. </blockquote>You must have a very poor understanding of english. Hmmm... no must be my english that you dun understand, more than 2 time i did wrote that I am out of construction field and here you drill on it. It a fact from what i had see in the past where and when I am around. So why you had to say I am the cause. When did I curse the ppl and singapore that pinnacle will fail?<br>One man local coy will cause it to fail. Why not you just take note how many one man local coy will closed shop for this project. I will see how long this project will take. It was say to be complete by 2009 and full completion is somewhere 2013 if I am not wrong. I will like to see how many crane going to topple for this project as well.<br>I stress again, the project will not fail for even if it take 20 years it will still be complete. If it takes more than the contract stated time frame 1 day to 20 years, you and those who had pay the deposit is not consider fail than it not. So far no one has ever claim any delay from HDB.<br>I stress one more time, the pt within this discussion was on the poor management of local construction company and poor logical business sence that the developer had and have today.<br></div>

If someone promise to sell u a nike shoe for $200 while the store next door sell u $180 for the same model, which will u choose ? This is not just business sense, it is common sense.

The result of stringent checks may be double work, but it is for the best. If they do not know anything, since they r the customer u should do your part and inform them, not thought oneself as lao jiao, act as big f$#k and show them attitude problems .

Wat is the point of the below statement then ?<br><br><strong>Last, happy staying on the top floor of Pinnacle if it did complete</strong><br><br>Wat do u mean by "if it did complete" ? Wat r u trying to imply here ? Who is the one tat bring pinnacle into the picture ? Aren't u saying tat because of low bids from construction company, tat is why something bad is gonna happened to it in the end ?<br><br><blockquote>One man local coy will cause it to fail. Why not you just take note how many one man local coy will closed shop for this project. I will see how long this project will take. It was say to be complete by 2009 and full completion is somewhere 2013 if I am not wrong. I will like to see how many crane going to topple for this project as well.<br>I stress again, the project will not fail for even if it take 20 years it will still be complete. If it takes more than the contract stated time frame 1 day to 20 years, you and those who had pay the deposit is not consider fail than it not. So far no one has ever claim any delay from HDB. </blockquote>Okie, lets see about it. Lets see if they will extend the date of completion away from 2013 or not. Lets see if there r any companies gonna close shop because of tis project. Why don't we take note of this thread and if any of us still remember about it then we come to the conclusion about who is right or wrong about low bids. But then u r already cursing somethign wrong is gonna happened to the project isn't it ? Cranes toppling, date extended... something no future house owners like to hear...<br><br><blockquote>I stress one more time, the pt within this discussion was on the poor management of local construction company and poor logical business sence that the developer had and have today. </blockquote>My point is taking low bid is common business sense. If u feel tat taking low bids r dumb, then too bad I am not gonna take it.</div>

It is your responsibility to inform the reader first about it. About those lkk, knn thingy, it is to illustrate tat putting down abbreviations tat no one knows is pretty dumb.<br><br><blockquote>Do you know what you are saying? more cranes, trucks, pile rig doesn't it cost more this way and more does not mean will be good.

Seriously me tired of explaining most of the thing here to you.<br>Oh I am not smart, just that in this case I know a bit more than you as you had say you have no link to any and a no body. </blockquote>Well surely these cranes and trucks can be used many times. They can be used on other projects before and they can use it on future projects too. They r already paid for by previous projects. In the end the more they use these equipment, the lower cost price it had become. So in the end they can afford to bid lower isn't it ? Other than knowing about building, do u know about economy ? Can't recover the machine in the tunnel ? So they left it there and bury it ? Do they left cranes and trunks in the tunnel and bury it ?<br><br>U know why u r tired of explaining ? It is because u can't explain.<br><br><blockquote>Successful? All you mention infact are hanging around. I am asking for doing very well till now.

Surely if they can handle certain big projects, they r already successful enough. How well do u want it to be ? World biggest construction company ? Then how about Sembcorp Construction ? He is listed isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Anyone who milk on employee will never be good in business as the employee are not working to the best and it a pt where you quote me that I am telling all not to work for companies. </blockquote>Tat is your opinion.

(lost count on how many out of pt here) It in (-) as high pay FT and low pay FT</blockquote>I am not a FT (foreign talent). As said before, it is your opinion tat those who milk employees r not good companies. IMO the important thing is moltivation, not just monetary. Japanese companies certainly milk their employees more than local companies, so they r all crap and unsuccessful ? Out of point ? U don't knwo how to read bah<br><br><strong>Good pt. on the delay like NEL. Do you know what is the claim made by SBS on LTA?

Delay is never an option in construction. </strong><br><br><strong>They have agreed on a time for completion of work. If they cannot finish in time, then don't agree.

Isn't this out of pt here. </blockquote>Tat is to reply on your "Do you know the types of claim was made for the delay? Why? Cover lost? Delay is never an option in construction" which is the later part of your reply. From your funny language here, the only idea I get is they claim something from the line of constructors because of some delay. So here I am saying tat if they cause delay then it is their fault. Why is it out of point ?<br><br><blockquote>So a no one is talking abt policy now??? A progress is met and a claim submitted why payment had to be delay. Policy? It a contract here. Internal policy has nothing to do with it at all. If this is not out of pt, pls tell me what base on this pt? </blockquote>The thing here is on funds. They give a delay in giving payment doesn't mean they have no funds, to me it just means they suffer more red tape. BTW wat do u mean by "If this is not out of pt, pls tell me what base on this pt?". Have u ever read which reply am I answering to ?<br><br><blockquote>Thank for a good example. the manager here is like the PM, CM, SM.

So if this is not a one man coy to you, what can I say. </blockquote>The cashier here is not the manager and cannot decide on certain issues like compensation for customers. The cleaner do not have any rights either. Only the manager can make such a decision. However the manager need the help of the other worker for a successful Macdonald joint. It is not a one man team, but a team. Certain decisions have to made by higher management, but it doesn't mean it is only an individual working and not a team. I am sure the decision on sellign away the company has to be made by the board of director and not the cleaners there.<br><br><blockquote>So again some no one here give % to me. I did say a guide or a benchmark is needed b4 offer to the bider if it is near there it fine with me dun you get? </blockquote>As said by u, it is just a guide. The guide do take into consideration safety margin, negotiation fess and profit. SO in the end u r empty and can't prove your point tat they purposely bid ultra low for ... well, IYO for running away...<br><br><blockquote>What do you mean by talk again, so you are telling me there is under table going on here is it? And to top it up with cash is that not a lost? If the lost is too great will they not pack up and run? </blockquote>I am saying there r always discussion between the companies. They have to update on their progress and problems to the main company isn't it ? If they got problems they can always talk with them. Why does things have to be "under the table" ? Tis is an open and legal means isn't it ?<br><br>Will a reputable company pack up and run ? DO u think they r so dumb to bid ultra low to the point of heavy loss ? Again wat is the rationale for doing tat ?<br><br><blockquote>Yes and I dare. MNC do do that. We are talking abt Construction field here and inculde those in the Oil, petrol, gas and chemical and some building developer they the MNC will top up to the contractor as I have witness it myself when the next closer tender to the benchmark calculated by MNC. Even with the top up, that contractor oso cannot make it. So what do you have to say now for those who had no idea or simply they dun know how tender. Why talk to them as you memtion earlier is it? For the local context it never a win win situation but for the MNC it seem like it or I should say YES it is</blockquote>I am saying does <strong>ALL</strong> MNC do tat. Can u say tat does <strong>all</strong> MNC do tat, not if any MNC do tat. I can be sure there r MNC tat operates like HDB too. And for your example, if they can't make it even with the top up, then it just means tat company is dumb, can't calculate and is just one case. I can give hundreds of examples tat the company refuse to top up and the contractor still finish the job.<br><br>BTW wat the hell do u mean by "For the local context it never a win win situation but for the MNC it seem like it or I should say YES it is"<br><br><blockquote>I had never say low is wrong business sence as i had stress a few time, It way below. The same example again, if you need $10 to do something and some one come saying he can do it with $0.10 and you let him. it just show how good you are. </blockquote>I have give a good answer to tat before. Your definition of "way below" is not really way below. Your earlier real life example seems to be a mere difference of just 7%. Is tat <strong>way below</strong> ??</div>
