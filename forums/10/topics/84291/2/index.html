            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Hello, the topic get start from where do you remember??? Pinnacle was the centre of the discussion here in the 1st place. If you did not get the top floor why so eager?<br>As i mention it out of point for so many time and from the previous topic i move to here on tender often given to the lowest. </blockquote>I am not saying u r out of point when u brought in pinnacle, I am saying u r cursing them, claiming tat some incidents is gonna happened when building has not started. I am not living in pinnacle nor had I apply for it, but there r probably thousands of people tat will stay there in future. Just because u feel tat 7% lesser is "way too low", then u start to curse them is not desirable.<br><br><blockquote>So you did get the top floor, and i am wishing you a happy stay on top. </blockquote>Sorry man, I did not apply for it at all.<br><br><blockquote>Something bad will happened can be anything from the time it start to construct to the time when ppl like you move in to find cracks and leaks. Why? Try stop me from saying all this. A fact will be a fact. Cheap contractor cannot make it will never make it.</blockquote>Yah right... nothing has been built yet and u claim tat things r gonna fall apart. As I said before, lets see how the construction go about instead of cursing and hoping the building fall to prove your point. Maybe the house u lived in is also built by cheap contractors too. Hope your house collapse. U like to hear such comments ?<br><br><blockquote>You dun like to hear so what, i dun say, what right have you here?<br>Isn't that when someone say something bad that thing change for the better when ppl like you report back to them. </blockquote>First I am not a future house owner of pinnacle, second instead of talking nonsense, lets see wat the actual situation will becomes. Lets see if the pinnacle do face any problems during their construction then.<br><br><blockquote>Shorty is going to make tons of $$$ here kay. 1800 unit at what prize did you buy har? Arrrr now you can do what is cost prize, whole sale prize and retail prize of which retail is the prize you buy at. kekekekekeke</blockquote>Don't know wat u r driving at but it is probably based on some dumb assumptions tat I had bought the pinnacle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> U r probably one tat like to make wild accusations and conclusions based on your replies.<br><br><blockquote>Why you have to take away low low, way below from me? Those agreed on the way below what supposed to be that is dumb. those who can not see the pt, is dumb. </blockquote>Okie, so I have to put 2 low is it ? So how low low is your example u have given ? 7% difference ! Wat is the actual percentage difference betwen the bids for CCL or Pinnacle ? Also about +- 10% at most ! The only low low example u can dish out is a mere 7% difference ! Why do u give example of difference up to 90% or 80% ?<br><br>Put the figures in now it should be one store is offering $107, the other is offering $100. Which one will u choose ? None of the bid goes below 90% or 80% or 70% of the price of the last bidders. Why give such obtuse examples ? I reiterate, your example is a mere 7% difference. Your idea of low low bid in real life is 7% difference. Why do u say they bid way low low when they didn't ? Wat is the rationale of bidding low low ? U can't even give an answer to tat and u start to accuse them of so !</div>

Firstly u only made 4 replies which is registered just few days ago. Secondly u like to colour and bold the quotes from another person. If one care to notice, joshua and hali likes to use bold on people quotes and then use red colour to address the point he want to say. This is rarely performed by other posters. Thirdly the manner writing style in which u 2 write is similar. Impatient, rude, broken english and filled with scolding words. Please notice the use of words "oni" for only which these 2 writers has shown.<br><br>Let the reader judge themselves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If u r really jushua yourself, u have just proven yourself to be ah gua, dumb, a cheat and a real empty vessel.<br><br>Nevertheless, the reason why I had chosen to reply 1/2 way is because I want to tackle an issue one at a time.
