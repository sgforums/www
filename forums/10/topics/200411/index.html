            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE'S early successes were built largely on the back of a scholarship system that - broadly speaking - followed imperial China as a way to recruit the 'best and brightest" to serve the country.<br><br>For 1,300 years of imperial examination history, China's emperors had selected 100,000 state-level and more than a million provincial scholars to administer the vast country.<br><br>Although the details differed, the objective of ancient China and 21st Century Singapore was similar - aimed at getting the best scholars who do well in education to help run the country.<br><br>But it worked well under their respective circumstances.<br><br>For China, however, the method became outdated and was ended in 1911 because the world had changed.<br><br>The imperial exam tested only literature, poetry and essays, but not science, math or any of today's modern studies that were needed by a changed world.<br><br>The question now is whether Singapore's scholarship system of selecting the best has also outlived its days in the 21st Century that needs entrepreneurial and innovative skills.<br><br>The government spends millions to provide some 200 to 250 university scholarships each year to the best students here based on examination results, out of 1,200 to 1,400 applications received by the Public Service Commission.<br><br>Competition, just like in ancient China, is strong and the successful are chosen for the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me schools. They are sent to the best universities abroad and given high-paying official positions.<br><br>The Chinese imperial system was a method to evaluate ability and select officials in dynastic China on the basis of merit rather than social position or political connections.<br><br>Similarly, Singapore leaders also advocate meritocracy. Lee Kuan Yew was an admirer of Confucian teachings, which formed a big subject in the imperial exam.<br><br>But both systems had unintended side effects. In China, the majority of those who sat for the exam were from the wealthy class.<br><br>In Singapore, a recent report said that 75% of scholarship winners lived in private condos or landed property, the rest in cheaper public housing estates. The rich continue to have an edge.<br><br>Lee, now Minister Mentor, admits that academic grades cannot determine the best intelligence or capabilities but until a better way is found, he said they remain the criteria.<br><br>But in the innovative world, can it continue to work when circumstances are changing so rapidly? Today private enterprise and human innovation, not knowledge of science and engineering, are the new gods needed for survival here.<br><br>Some Singaporeans believe that Lee's scholars' class may also become obsolete just as the imperial examination went out of fashion.<br><br>In fact, the Lee government had exceeded imperial China in recruitment.<br><br>Over the years, the large intake of scholars into the bureaucracy and military leadership was so heavy that it has created a hole in the economy. It has deprived the state of a rich source of potential entrepreneurs.<br><br>The brightest students are filtered into a secure, well-paid bureaucracy where they developed an ability to 'play safe' and avoid taking risks so that they can keep their jobs, the opposite of the new Singaporean we need.<br><br>Despite of - or because of - the scholar class, Singapore remains sadly behind its trade rivals in entrepreneurial spirit and capabilities.<br><br>It has led Lee to get the government to release up to half of its state-supported civil service scholars to move into starting enterprises, with questionable results.<br><br>For years scholars have been running state-owned enterprises, but it is not the same as taking risks with their own money and careers. Few are prepared to take personal risks to start their own companies.<br><br>Good grades may not make good businessmen and often have nothing to do with them.<br><br>Scholars may produce good bureaucrats and administrators but they do not necessarily have sound judgment, market ideas or profits, qualities needed in the new economy.<br><br>Dr Phua Kai Lit, a sociologist who received his PhD from Johns Hopkins, wrote that Singapore had become a country "increasingly ruled by economists, engineers, and other technocratic experts with First Class Honours undergraduate degrees, Oxbridge and Ivy League Master's degrees and PhDs."<br><br>"Whether this society truly fulfils (the Singaporean) dream and meets his expectations is a question worthy of debate," he said.<br><br>Another reason why it may not survive long is that it promotes an elitist class, which despite the leaders' best efforts, is growing more unpopular with the new generation.<br><br>Actually, offering high civil service jobs to scholars is not uncommon in many countries - but not in politics. The unique feature in Singapore lies in its use to select Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament in the ruling party.<br><br>In other democratic countries winning elections is a deciding factor, but the predominant strength of the People's Action Party virtually rules out this criterion.<br><br>R.K. Vasil wrote in 1992, "The PAP has established a unique system of recruitment of its top political leaders and Ministers.<br><br>"Talented individuals are 'spotted' and have to pass through a barrage of observations, interviews, attachment to a veteran MP and, allegedly, even psychological tests before being offered safe parliamentary seats to contest (under the PAP banner) in General Elections.<br><br>"After winning these safe seats, they may be offered responsibility as junior ministers and if they pass this test, they would then be offered higher level positions with greater responsibilities"<br><br>For the present, nothing much will change but, as the leaders themselves say, nothing remains the same for long in this fast-moving world.<br><br>Source: www.littlespeck.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Despite noting that our education is somewhat outdated, current policies are nowhere near to 'update' or renew the system.<br><br>Take the science for example, gonna are 'dead' pratical sessions and Skill based learning practicals are in place. Named as SPA, students are expected to learn 4 different main skills and sit for a test with regards to certain skills.<br><br>The result? <span style="color: darkred;">Rote learning method</span> is still used as students need to score for SPA EXAMS which counts towards their O/A's levels.<br><br>Teachers are filled with more work, as they need to carry out such exams 3 to 4 times a year ... with reports and data need to be handed up to MOE for checks after each and every SPA Exam ...<br><br>I am not sure how and what changes are happening and the Pri and sec schs level, with the change in chinese syllabus being the big wuha recently. The new JC curriculum is still somewhat messy. Teachers are clueless to teach students HOW TO HANDLE EXAM QUESTIONS, and workload of teachers have increased with the different variations of a subject, H1, H2, H3. SHortage of manpower means that students have less choices. On the admin side, ppl have to pore thru more paperwork with a wide range of subject combinations and producing out a timetable ...</div>

American kids test much worse but do better in the real world. Why?</strong><br><span class="small"><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10663340/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow"><strong>By Fareed Zakaria<br>Newsweek<br>Jan. 9, 2006 issue</strong></a></span><strong> -<br><br>Last week India was hit by a terror attack that unsettled the country. A gunman entered the main conference hall of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, tossed four grenades into the audience and, when the explosives failed, fired his AK-47 at the crowd. One man, a retired professor of mathematics from one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, was killed.<br><br>What has worried some about this attack is not its scope or planning or effectÂ—all unimpressiveÂ—but the target. The terrorists went after what is increasingly seen as India's core strategic asset for the 21st century: its scientific and technological brain trust. If that becomes insecure, what will become of India's future?<br><br>This small event says a lot about global competition. Traveling around Asia for most of the past month, I have been struck by the relentless focus on education. It makes sense. Many of these countries have no natural resources, other than their people; making them smarter is the only path for development.<br><br>China, as always, appears to be moving fastest. When officials there talk about their plans for future growth, they point out that they have increased spending on colleges and universities almost tenfold in the past 10 years. Yale's president, Richard Levin, notes that [b]Peking University's two state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication linesÂ—each employing a different technologyÂ—outshine anything in the United States.</strong><br><br>East Asian countries top virtually every global ranking of students in science and mathematics.<br><br>But one thing puzzles me about these oft-made comparisons. <strong>I talked to Tharman Shanmugaratnam to understand it better. </strong>He's the minister of Education of Singapore, the country that is No. 1 in the global science and math rankings for schoolchildren. <strong>I asked the minister how to explain the fact that even though Singapore's students do so brilliantly on these tests, <span style="color: red;">when you look at these same students 10 or 20 years later, few of them are worldbeaters anymore.</span> Singapore has few truly top-ranked scientists, entrepreneurs, inventors, business executives or academics.</strong><br><br><strong>American kids, by contrast, test much worse in the fourth and eighth grades but seem to do better later in life and in the real world. Why?</strong><br><br><strong>"We both have meritocracies ," </strong>Shanmugaratnam said. <strong>"Yours is a talent meritocracy, ours is an exam meritocracy. There are some parts of the intellect that we are not able to test wellÂ—like creativity, curiosity, a sense of adventure, ambition. Most of all, America has a culture of learning that challenges conventional wisdom, <span style="color: red;">even if it means challenging authority</span>. These are the areas where Singapore must learn from America."</strong><br><br>Shanmugaratnam also pointed out that American universities are unrivaled globallyÂ—and are getting better. "You have created a public-private partnership in tertiary education that is amazingly successful. The government provides massive funding, and private and public colleges compete, raising everyone's standards."<br><br>Shanmugaratnam highlighted in particular the role that American foundations play. "Someone in society has to be focused on the long term, on maintaining excellence, on raising quality. You have this array of foundationsÂ—in fact, a whole tradition of civic-minded volunteerismÂ—that fulfills this role. For example, you could not imagine American advances in biomedical sciences without the Howard Hughes Foundation."<br><br>Singapore is now emphasizing factors other than raw testing skills when selecting its top students. But cultures are hard to change. A Singaporean friend recently brought his children back from America and put them in his country's much-heralded schools. He described the difference. "In the American school, when my son would speak up, he was applauded and encouraged. In Singapore, he's seen as pushy and weird. <strong>The culture of making learning something to love and engage in with gusto is totally absent.</strong> Here it is a chore. Work hard, memorize and test well." He took his child out of the Singapore state school and put him into a private, Western-style one.<br><br>Despite all the praise Shanmugaratnam showered on the States, he said that the <strong>U.S. educational system "as a whole has failed." "Unless you are comfortably middle class or richer," he explained, "you get an education that is truly second-rate by any standards.</strong><br><br>Apart from issues of fairness, what this means is that you never really access the talent of poor, bright kids. They don't go to good schools and, because of teaching methods that focus on bringing everyone along, the bright ones are never pushed. In Singapore we get the poor kid who is very bright and very hungry, and that's crucial to our success.<br><br>"From where I sit, it's not a flat world," Shanmugaratnam concluded. "It's one of peaks and valleys. The good news for America is that the peaks are getting higher. But the valleys are getting deeper, and many of them are also in the United States."<br></blockquote></div>
