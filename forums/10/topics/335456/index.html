              I REFER to “Different strokes 
              required”(Oct 29), and would like to highlight that not only are students of 
              current times different from those of yesteryears’ but that teachers have 
              changed with the times.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Most local teachers are products of the 
              educational system and our changing society and it is appalling to read of 
              teachers being convicted or investigated for molestation or outrage of modesty.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              A week ago, in the first case of its kind 
              here in Singapore, a female teacher was charged with having sex with an underage 
              student. And there was a recent media report about teachers moonlighting as bar 
              top/pole dancers.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Besides paper qualifications, are 
              teachers’ character assessed before they are hired? When more than 90 per cent 
              of Singapore students rely on private tutors and commercial tuition centres as 
              helping hands towards attaining academic excellence, I wonder what exactly are 
              the roles of current school teachers?
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              What has gone wrong that teachers who 
              spend at least six hours a day, five days a week with their students are not 
              commanding sufficient respect? Do they themselves lack discipline in the first 
              place? Are they worthy of respect in the first place?
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              I REFER to “Different strokes required” 
              and “Splitting up the classes may help” (Oct 29).
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              I do not envy teachers these days. Not 
              only is the nobility of their profession not respected, parents now also believe 
              it’s the teachers’ role to nurture and groom their kids.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Ill-behaved children? Of course there 
              are. The question is, are they just being children or being disrespectful? I 
              teach Sunday classes. The preschool kids are lovely because they’re young, 
              innocent and impressionable.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              There is a big difference between parents 
              being liberal and open minded with their children, and being simply over 
              indulgent. “Over compensate” is the word Mr Ho Kong Loon used. I couldn’t agree 
              more. Was there not a recent media report about a young woman whose parents give 
              her money to buy designer bags?
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The constraint on teachers where 
              discipline is concerned is getting ridiculous. If the parents shirk disciplining 
              responsibility and hand it over to the teacher, then they should let the 
              teachers discipline their kids with the cane, rod or whatever they deem fit and 
              not interfere.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              I’ve seen too many brats who are not only 
              spoilt in the material sense but lack social graces and graciousness. Basic 
              courtesy and civic mindedness have gone down the drain. Mr Arthur Lim says 
              there’s a lack of tolerance in society and children need their “space”. I agree, 
              but how much space is enough before we realise they are getting out of control? 
              And split up classes? Doesn’t he know that we are facing a shortage of good 
              teachers? </span></div>

              <p>Please dun generalise how...not all teachers are like that. There are still some who still earn respect...</p>
              <p>But sometimes I think it places too much responsibility on the teachers...like the recent news about the teacher who likes to wear bikini...dunno why the reporter so kepoh...what the teacher wants to wear out of office hours is up to her. And she is at the seaside, what can she wear besides swimsuit and bikini?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>It is not like she is wearing it to school. People should stop seeing teachers as saints and angels and give them a break. There are human beings too...it is fair to expect them to be role models at school and be professional but outside of school they should be allowed to lead their own life without being scrutinised endlessly...</p>

              <p>Too many parents think that it is the teachers' responsibility to make sure that their kids grow up to be people of good character..but I think it is just bullshit.

              <p>Most teachers are indeed not like that...</p>
              <p>Do you know how f-up our sg education system is? Teachers are overworked, students are overly filled with homework.... and as mentioned, many students require private tuition outside school just to do well/better in exams...</p>
              <p>Not only does a teacher have to handle nearly 40 students at one go, teachers nowadays have to, as put by a principal, 'serve' the students and treat them like 'customers'. There's a whole lot of admin things to do, things that can be easily done by hiring a full-time admin staff (and which some independent schools do). Teachers have to be in-charge of CCAs as well, and attend a whole lot of courses. There's also a lot of back-stabbing, and now especially because in the current system of grading teachers, a certain percentage must get Ds, and a certain percentage get As; it's performance relative to other teachers =&gt; the worse you can make a teacher look in front of principals, the higher you can step above.</p>

              <p>Persons, personalities if you wish, can be made only in communities. A
              community is made up of intimate relationships among diverse types of
              individuals--a kinship group, a local group, a neighbourhood, a
              village, a large family.</p>
              <p>Without communities, no infant will be
              sufficiently socialized. He may grow up to be forty years old, he may
              have made an extremely good living, he may have engendered half a dozen
              children, but he is still an infant unless he has been properly
              socialized and that occurs in the first four or five years of life.</p>
              <p>In
              our society today, we have attempted to throw the whole burden of
              socializing out population upon the school system, to which the
              individual arrives only at the age of four or five.</p>
              <p>A few years ago
              they had big programs to take children to school for a few hours at age
              two and three and four, but that will not socialize them. The first two
              years are important.</p>
              <p>The way a child is treated in the first two days
              is of vital importance. He has to be loved, above all he has to be

              <p>A state of individuals, such as we have now reached in
              Western Civilization, will not create persons, and the atomized
              individuals who make it up will be motivated by desires which do not
              necessarily reflect needs. Instead of needing other people they need a
              shot of heroin; instead of some kind of religious conviction, they have
              to be with the winning team....</p>

              <p>Most teachers are indeed not like that...</p>
              <p>Do you know how f-up our sg education system is? Teachers are overworked, students are overly filled with homework.... and as mentioned, many students require private tuition outside school just to do well/better in exams...</p>
              <p>Not only does a teacher have to handle nearly 40 students at one go, teachers nowadays have to, as put by a principal, 'serve' the students and treat them like 'customers'. There's a whole lot of admin things to do, things that can be easily done by hiring a full-time admin staff (and which some independent schools do). Teachers have to be in-charge of CCAs as well, and attend a whole lot of courses. There's also a lot of back-stabbing, and now especially because in the current system of grading teachers, a certain percentage must get Ds, and a certain percentage get As; it's performance relative to other teachers =&gt; the worse you can make a teacher look in front of principals, the higher you can step above.</p>

              <p><br>my kids are in a very good pri sch here. last year, in one of the parents-teachers mtg, many parents were openly questioning the teacher's teaching methods, dissecting words in exam papers so they know exactly what their kids need to answer to score in the exams, etc. etc. i was bored to tears.</p>
              <p>in a way, the teachers too felt the pressure becos the parents were exerting undue pressure on the teachers.</p>
              <p>i then asked the question to the form teacher of my boy if they can be given less homework instead. (my kids workload are horrendous. i don't even work as hard after office hours. imagine a kid after school, he/she needs to do a ton of homework some more.)there was a momentary silence in the classroom. you could hear a pin drop. of cos, i was then given a lecture on why homework are good, etc. , typical bs. after experiencing 2 mtgs, i decided that i will not attend anymore. in any case, i dun think i am welcome there by my fellow parents anymore after my folly.</p>
              <p>my kids do not go for tuition except chinese. i strongly discourage that to the chagrin of my better half. i have a pact with my kids that as long as they tried their best and not make careless/silly mistakes in their exams, we are all good.</p>
              <p>the main reason i am quitting this place is mainly becos i want a more rounded education for my kids. victoria education in ozland placed a lot of emphasis on character development and seemed a lot more well balanced in its approach to children education. i have observed for myself. there is a huge gulf of difference between a 9yr old aussie kid and a 9 year old singapore kid.  </p>
              <p>in truth, i do not need to leave. i can pretty much have anything i want here. i have held off leaving for a least a couple of years. but i don't see the light.</p>
              <p>i took a risk of quitting my job. i will still be good for a few years. but with god's grace, i found something down under even in such terrible job climate. perhaps the signs are clear for me.</p>
              <p>i agree the intent of education here is good. but in implementation, it went awry. (having said that, in this region, singapore education is still better than others, say indo or malaysia)</p>
