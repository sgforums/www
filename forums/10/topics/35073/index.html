            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, we only need to chase away their armed vessels.  In this case, they cannot invoke the right of innoncent passage.  Since they are not passing through, but attempting to patrol.<br><br>Also, we are to maintain status quo until ICJ decides otherwise.  That no Malaysian flagged ship may enter the water, conduct research, survey, fishing and any activities having no direct involvment with their passage.<br><br>However, if they are really that free, they may sail over in their sampans or whatever boats, carry protest signs n boards around PB.  That I don't think we should chase them away, but rather sit back and enjoy the show.  See how long they can fast without food and water.</div>

Jaya is not stepping forward further to give a warm handshake, rather stay in his position, bending his body a bit forward to offer a handshake to Hamid.

Only trouble is that Hamid show is too obvious, especially when Jaya say S sovernity at PB and Hamid insistence on joint patrol part.<br><br>Anyway, good to be observance on people. Don't believe, try catching a person when he lie. He will either roll his eyes, avoid eye contact or soften the "lie part" conversation when answering to you.<br><br>BTW, if you are ever handshake a person who greet you profusely with two hand covering your etended hand. 80% chance that he is cunning and insincere.
