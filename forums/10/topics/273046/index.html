Our people are adapting and working smarter. We are organising ourselves more efficiently and making better use of our resources.<br><br>"In short, we have increased our productivity. Our efforts to transform the economy are paying off."<br><br>Looking ahead, Mr Lee said Singapore is poised to take off, with many projects already underway.<br><br>Among them are the integrated resorts and the banking and financial centre.<br><br>The prime minister said: "From here, I can see dozens of cranes. It's a bit hazy today, but there is buzz and excitement in the air, as our city changes before our eyes, day by day.<br><br>"Even the NDP this year is different and exciting. For the first time, the parade will be held on water at Marina Bay. It will be on the largest floating stage in the world, with the new city skyline taking shape all around us."<br><br>While Singaporeans come together to help build the nation, Mr Lee said there is a major challenge which could affect the country's social harmony and national cohesion, and that is the widening of income gaps here and all over the world.<br><br>Mr Lee said while Singapore cannot stop or reverse this global trend, it can do a lot to help Singaporeans cope with it.<br><br>He said one reason for the widening income gap here is the ageing population, so the government is making changes to help Singaporeans work longer, earn more and build up their retirement savings.<br><br>It will enhance the value of HDB homes and improve the CPF system so they can enjoy a steady income and peace of mind in their golden years.<br><br>PM Lee said: "The government cannot solve all these problems alone. Everyone must play a part. We each must take responsibility for ourselves, make the effort to do well, and provide for our families and our old age.<br><br>"At the same time, the more successful Singaporeans must pitch in to help the weaker ones. The more you have gained from society, the greater your obligation to give back something to your fellow citizens."<br><br>Mr Lee said the government would tackle these issues one by one and Singaporeans have every reason to be confident about their future.<br><br>"The global backdrop is favourable. The winds and tides are with us. Our spirit is high, and our ship is ready," he added.<br><br>Mr Lee's call to the nation is to seize the moment to sail ahead into the bright and exciting future.<br><br><strong></strong></div>

Any variable outcome not stated in their textbook will just be tai-chi-ed back to the people.  I don't fancy our people having to pay millions for seatwarmers.. millions for reading out of a textbook, now that's a sweet deal.<br><br>About your friend, sorry to hear abt their situation.. apparently my paternal grandma faced similar difficulty with her 8...yes 8.. children.. she wasn't even a difficult person to live with... in the end my mom took care of her right up till the end, hospital bills, maid and all.. it was only during the funeral that the unfilial bunch (sorry but they pissed me off) quietly made their final and only contributions.<br><br>Yes, my uncles n aunties did shirk their responsibilities.. but like u said the govt's not in touch with the situation on the ground, and part of the reason my grandma had such difficulty was because those families really couldn't afford to have her around as taking care of her required a dedicated 24/7 person (eg a maid).  None of them wanted to bear the blame/guilt if anything happened to my grandma if she had been left alone.  When you force people into a corner, their ugly side inevitably gets lured out.. and our govt's current policies do just that - by providing the bare or below minimum, they drive people into a corner.<br><br>I always smile wistfully at the irony when I come across hard-sell love-thy-country propaganda or speeches.  They always say something about achieving something "together" but apparently "together" is a word with a very different meaning in the PAPpy dictionary.<br><br>Um, my last reply for now, am going to bed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Gd morning and will tune in again soon.</div>

There can be no social justice without social responsibility - and much as this regime would like to tout, failings like those you mention shouldn't be ascribed to what this regime conveniently labels as <span style="font-style: italic;">Asian Values</span>.<br><br>After all, you wouldn't have such a problem if you were living in Sweden or the UK with a generous, free public healthcare, would you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let us be frank. Everyone has their own responsibilities to their family and everyone has to be self-sufficient in this world. To close the ears and say that children are responsible for their parents as an act of filial piety is grossly outdated especially if the people in question need the money for their own kids, their own retirement etc. Everyone is for themselves. Passing the buck is in fact symptomatic of a cyclic dependency that cannot be sustainable in the long run if pay does not rise and living costs do. Poverty cycles exist in many forms and eventually something has got to give.</div>

He pays himself such a huge lump sum of salary, doesn't he exercise any conscience, practicality, credibility when he talks to the people of Singapore.  He owes us the people of Singapore to be honest in all he says and we don't owe him anything!  It is not worth it to pay a sub-standard PM such huge amount of salary.<br><br>Seems like he is getting more and more stupid judging from the blunders he made in GErmany and at the NDP.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  He is pathetic, fails to earn the respect of the people of Singapore.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
