              <p>Often we complain and moan about mistakes of others. We never look inward. The financial recession is more a panic reaction to an average problem caused by a minority. By complaining, we are only contributing more to the gloom and doom.</p>
              <p>Time for a reality check.</p>
              <p>Money does not disappear into thin air. For every loss, it becomes someone else's gain. Example; - Alpha insurance loss $300 billion in stock - it only means someone else had withdrew $300 billion from Alpha insurance and the money is either sitting at their home or invested in govt bonds.</p>
              <p>The govt injects $1.2 trillion dollars into the market. It only means $1.2 trillion dollars will be flowing in business sectors. Even if it fails to move market, THERE IS $1.2 TRILLION DOLLARS IN SOME PEOPLE'S HOME!</p>
              <p>We had seen the capability of graduate finance experts, which left much to be desired. They were the ones who created the mess.</p>
              <p>Now is the time for another group of intelligent people to find a solution to create wealth - HOW TO GET SOME PEOPLE, OR MOST PEOPLE, TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR MONEY BACK INTO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM!</p>
              <p>My Nobel Peace prize solution is:- ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY!</p>
              <p>People are now hoarding money. Keynesian theory  had been proven right to keep the capitalist and democratic system working - MONEY MUST FLOW. People are not trusting banks or investment. But people are human. They have needs and one of them is to feel good - be entertained.</p>
              <p>Media moguls better get together and be creative, come up with fantastic 'feel good factors' to make people contribute their money into the market. Acting industry's great names crowd pullers must get into the act. Writers and script writers get wired with new bulbs. New and better games be in the pipeline, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>MONEY MUST FLOW, or we will be facing amageddon 2009.</p>

              <p>The reason for recession that many believe is that the market needs to undergo correction every now and then. And from history, it has been estimated that such major recessions occur in about a ten year cycle.</p>
              <p>The last major one was 1997<br>And the one before that, 1987<br>And in the 1970s<br>etc<br>etc</p>
              <p>Already when I learned about this cycle thing in 2001 during my A level economics, I knew the importance of finding a job before year 2008. That is the reason why I applied for, and got a position, in 2005. And that's why although I graduated in 2008, I have a job; it's very much harder to find one right now.</p>
              <p>There has been excessive money flowing around the economy because most of our money are in digital form, especially in the stock market. This is already very very different from ancient times, where money wasn't used as a medium (digital somemore), but when barter trade was more common. And that is one reason why gold is a good hedge against inflation.</p>
              <p>However, in times of recession, there are still certain things that people must spend on. This includes food and healthcare, and the telecom industry.</p>

              <p>The govt's role now is NOT to spread confusion and worry about the economy. IT is  already a forgone conclusion we are facing amageddon next year with the collapse of the world economy.</p>
              <p>Drop the blame game or the export indices, savings or 'confidence' in the banking investment systems! <br>The govt's role now is TO MAKE THE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD! By making the money hoarders feel good, , satisfy to their human needs, will they dare to contribute money back into the system.</p>
              <p>With money back,in the entertainment industry, will they pump the money into banks and investments, and the circulation of wealth spreads to the poor to get jobs and pay for necessities.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Savings is great and cool. Money on hand is always best. But the paltry 'kept at home' savings by est of 80% of the human population on Earth is not gonna last for long. <br>With no investments or loans, companies will fold, things and even basic necessities will only become more expensive as 'economies of scale' will be gone overnight. It becomes more expensive to manufacture a product for sale and ultimately, 80% of Earth human's savings will be wipe out within months.<br>However, if these 80% of human were to plough back just a fraction of the savings, it will help grease our financial system to work again. MONEY NEEDS TO FLOW! <br>Set up spectacles of the like we have never seen before! Jump start the economy through entertainment and the feel good factors. New creative advertising and promotions! Anything, anything at all, to tempt the dollar out of a saver's pocket, will the human race get jobs to live and survive this crises of epic propotions of the like never ever seen before on Earth!<br>The alternative - Armageddon 2009. Better to face death with a smile or a laugh on your face than to die with hunger and wet with tears.</p></div>

              <p>The reason for recession that many believe is that the market needs to undergo correction every now and then. And from history, it has been estimated that such major recessions occur in about a ten year cycle.</p>
              <p>The last major one was 1997<br>And the one before that, 1987<br>And in the 1970s<br>etc<br>etc</p>
              <p>Already when I learned about this cycle thing in 2001 during my A level economics, I knew the importance of finding a job before year 2008. That is the reason why I applied for, and got a position, in 2005. And that's why although I graduated in 2008, I have a job; it's very much harder to find one right now.</p>
              <p>There has been excessive money flowing around the economy because most of our money are in digital form, especially in the stock market. This is already very very different from ancient times, where money wasn't used as a medium (digital somemore), but when barter trade was more common. And that is one reason why gold is a good hedge against inflation.</p>
              <p>However, in times of recession, there are still certain things that people must spend on. This includes food and healthcare, and the telecom industry.</p>

              <p>You mean our govt not spending as much as it should?</p>
              <p>Now it must to fork out a huge sum to bail out the failed financial institutions?</p>
              <p>If banks don't lend money, businesses will declare bankrupt and fold up. Retrenchment will follow.</p>
              <p>I think global govt must bail out the banks but the CEOs must be penalised for their failures.</p>

              <p>Dear Lionnoisy,<br>To find out the causes for the current financial crises will take a long time for it is too complex and too deeply entrenched within the corridors of coporate and governmental powers. Many in the world would be dead long before the causes can be determined.</p>
              <p><br>We are facing an Extinction Level Event of a unpredecented scale of the likes never seen before. Allow me to briefly explain.</p>
              <p><br>There was once when i quit my job and live on my savings of $70,000 for one year to pursue my interests in the arts. I only spent on basic and average necessities of clothing, lodging and meals, not on frivilous expenditures. In one year's time, my savings of $70,000 was gone.</p>
              <p><br>The average life savings of a family of 3 or 4 after 10 years would probably be estimated around $60,000, excluding CPF in the case of Singaporeans. For retirerees, it would probably be an average of $30,000.</p>
              <p><br>Should everyone withdraw their savings from banks in panic, and live frugally, how long would their savings last? Without money, banks ceases to exist, or those that remained, would give low interests and not even bother lending money. WIthout money, where can  there be capital to set up enterprises and create jobs? WIthout jobs, how are humans going to survive?</p>
              <p><br>Majority of mankind are now living in urban centres. When their money runs out, they will be homeless, and attempts will be made to move back to countrysides, which are owned and will only cause trespassing, leading eventually to barbarism in order to survive. The strongest will survive, which means in the end, only 1 person will be left alive on our planet- the strongest. 99.9% of the human race will be eventually wiped out. When the last mortal earthling dies, mankind will be extinct.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, we are, with brutual honesty, facing an extinction level event before our eyes. I would have preferred a meteor strike, at least death would be instantaneous and not long drawned in months watching your loved ones and those you care about die like flies around you if you yourself survive long enough.</p>
              <p><br>But there is a way out to prevent mankind's extinction, and that is to -KEEP MONEY CIRCULATING. There is no need for frivolous or profligate spending. Just continue spending on items that meets your needs normally, and seek investments with a smaller percentage of savings, either with recapitalised banks or blue chip stocks. In this way, every single cent on every dollar will eventually be circulated within the global economy - jobs and wealth creation.</p>
              <p><br>Science fiction writers and movie producers often depict extinction level events as caused by external events such as mythical aliens, meteors, nature's biological and physical changes. In truth, we men may be the ones who will eventually do ourselves in without even external help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The propensity for idiocy in mankind is as natural as earth's  regular platonic shifts. Havard colleges should be closed immediately and its files be sized for investigation. The rot and mess propably began at that elitist education centre of business fools. Rest assured, that when investigations complete, someone will be made to pay the price for almost annhilating mankind</p>
              <p><br>Fortunately, what men can destroy, so to can men rebuilt. If you, my fellow reader, had considered my  post, and send out emails to 6 of your friends ( the world is only separated from you by only 6 persons) to continue spending and not hoard money, you will be one those latter kind - the kind that will save and rebuilt the world, not only for yourselves, but for your loved ones and those you cared about as well. Never under-estimate the power of your own click on mouse to send an email. It might just save the world.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading my post.</p>

              <p>Hmm ..... not sure what u r relating to but if it's the stock market u r talking about, it isn't always a zero sum game. The last stock price is a result of the last person's bid, and that can create a notional value that all the stocks are worth this much. This creates, to a certain extent, a false sense of impression. Just because the last paid $100 for Stock A doesn't mean everyone will. At some point in time people start bailing out and that's when everything comes crashing down.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>"At some point, people will start bailing out."<br>That point had been already been breached. Now you are watching everyone bailing out, causing stocks to dive rapidly. A panic reaction which serves no one any good, as even good blue chip money making stocks as well as banks get hit as well on a massive global scale.<br>What's happening isn't the end of the world...at least no yet, as most moneys are now kept at home instead of being put to use in banks for lending and investments. There still is money by humans, which is a trading commodity for exchange of goods.<br>The bad news is that such money will run out soon. Even quicker for those who have little money. Without replenishing such money thru jobs, savings will run dry. Bank's arent lending money, which means enterprises have no capital for investments, expansions, creating new jobs or even buying machineries.<br>The poor will be the first to die off. The middle classes a little later, and the rich will have to spend huge sums buying protection for themselves and loved ones.<br>All this can be prevented. It only needs your dollar, to circulate within the economy and wealth will be passed on to everyone, not kept at home.</p></div>

              <p>Often we complain and moan about mistakes of others. We never

              MONEY MUST FLOW. People are not trusting banks or investment. But
              people are human. They have needs and one of them is to feel good -
              be entertained.</p>
              <p>Media moguls better get together and be creative, come up with
              fantastic 'feel good factors' to make people contribute their money
              into the market. Acting industry's great names crowd pullers must
              get into the act. Writers and script writers get wired with new
              bulbs. New and better games be in the pipeline, etc, etc.</p>

              no natural resource and being an entreport for shipping goods from
              Asia to the west - we wont be the last. More will come if nothing
              is being down.</p>
              <p><br> Taking a peg off the haughty Singapore may be fun to some, but real
              people get hurt in the process.They may starve to death soon. No
              govt in the world has that kind of money to feed everyone forever,
              more so if money is kept at home and not being put to use.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only you and you alone have the power to save the world
              collectively. To rebuilt by spreading the message of hope or to
              destroy mankind by spreading more fear and panic is truly now in
              your fingertips.</p>

              <p>This global crisis had taught Singapore export manufacturers a valuable lesson on its dependence of the US market. It may be late, but it is still never too late to diversify.</p>
              <p>China had been eyed as a huge market of 1.3 billion people. Even though their purchasing power may be lower than US market, its sheer volume is more than enough to keep our exporters smiling ear to ear.<br>The only thing is - what does China needs that it cannot produce on its own other than oil?<br>The answer can be found in the latest milk scandal - <strong>TRUST<br></strong>Their quality control and hygience checks are horrible and will never be able to measure up to the standards of the world anytime soon if ever due to the size of the population. Corruption is rampant no matter how clean they will ever try to be. Asians will be asians. The mentally to gain at all costs is monumental.<br>Thus, our strict health control reputation may be a sought after label in the chinese market, in food products such as soya sauces, drinks, etc. We could even purchase raw materials from asia and label it with our reputation and repackaged it to China. <br>Not only in food products, but in medical and even other products where TRUST is an issue no China family has faith in their national administration.<br>Hopefully it may help our diversification into the China market and help us steer clear of future 'technical recessions' and even path the way for the rest of the world to tap into the 1.3 billion people market.</p>

              <p>I think global govt must bail out the banks but the CEOs must be
