              <p><br>Lehman had been around even before the great depression, not only survive it but thrive after it. There was a great deal of trust in that institution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hell! It's even older than the republic of Singapore. No one could have known it could collapse overnight, with its numerous years of profitability and excellent record sheets.</p>
              <p><br>When the subprime crisis erupted last year, many held firm the belief that yes, there were defaulters, but it was not every cdo becoming worthless, afterall - the debts had 'collateral', and would fetch some money in auctions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Property bubbles may exists, but in time, population growth figures will outstrip supply, causing a demand and prices will rise again. Auctioning now would be to lose money. Auction later and there will be more money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus CDOs deriatives were banking on a fixed maturity date to return investors their principal sums.</p>
              <p><br>Unfortunately, there was mismanagement by Lehmans and many other hedgefund operators. They had run out of liquidity to fund their investment operations in other business sectors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Banks were concerned and stop lending. Lehman and gang were stuck in between a rock and a hard ground, to pay off dividends, and had to filed for bankruptcy.</p>
              <p><br>There were rumours, by economists and punters, but there was no hard facts to support their disputable armchair theories. Lehman and gang abused the free market system by cooking their books to get better ratings for their assets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one, no relationship manager, no govt, no outsiders knew how heavily Lehman and gang were extended, except CEOs themselves.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, blaming everyone except Lehman and gang now is totally unjustified. Lehman and gang are the criminals that should ought be hanged and made example of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not innocents who have no access to withheld information, which now better regulation must address.</p>
              <p><br>At the end of the day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">investments are all risks</span>. It is only how one manages risk. If our society and govt are to prevent risks, then there will be no stock market in Singapore and every individual banned from even putting money even into banks or setting up their own companies, no more freedom of choice for itself comes at a price call risk.</p>
              <p><br>Do understand what you will be getting by blaming others for your mistakes or taking the political opportunity to make a swipe at society and our representatives - the govt, for their failure to have supernatural powers. Everyone will be affected by stiffer regulations to make up for mortal disability to curb human nature, more so if it becomes draconian.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stock brokers or even insurance agents, people will doubt their words and check what they say.</span> A BANK? You are supposed to trust BANKS. People trusts banks and bankers and that it why they put their money with BANKS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now the banks turn around and say, "Who asked you to trust me? It is just too bad that you trusted me." If the BANK was not sure, then the bank should not have sold the products in the first place. People buy because they trust the banks.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now that they have sold the products on trust, now that it turns out that the products are faulty, the banks must pay.</span></span></p>
