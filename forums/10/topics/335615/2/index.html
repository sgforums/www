              will doubt their words and check what they say.</span> A BANK? You
              are supposed to trust BANKS. People trusts banks and bankers and
              that it why they put their money with BANKS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now the banks turn around and say,
              "Who asked you to trust me? It is just too bad that you trusted
              me." If the BANK was not sure, then the bank should not have sold
              the products in the first place. People buy because they trust the
              banks.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now that they have sold the products on trust,
              now that it turns out that the products are faulty, the banks must
              pay.</span></span></p>
