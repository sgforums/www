              hailed as a national hero yesterday, despite his bitterly disappointing

              Malaysians followed

              medal since 1996 (the pair of Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock won the
              silver medal in the men’s badminton doubles at Atlanta) and has

              <p>whats difference do you think you have with the pap? you're often seen here posting your own views and idea and rejecting anyone who don't agree, HA! and you think i'll believe you'll protect my democratic rights if people like you take power??!!?</p>

              <p>his mother is not the only one suffering from her conditions. are you claiming everyone else with massive brain hemorrhages deserved it? and they're all  dishonorable? if its true, what she did is unforgivable. i'm not a saint but at least my mouth isn't as evil as yours. and again i ask, with thoughts like these, what difference are you from the despot?</p>

He did not come to Singapore simply to participate in the Olympics. The British did not use Singaporeans' hard earned money to buy him just for the Olympics.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In Bejing 2008, the despots lose $750K for a fake medal which could have gone towards training thousands, if not tens of thousand of Singaporean children.

              <p>Please Lah.......You are what you name for yourself <strong>Stupid</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anybody in the US who is a US citizen can joint the US swimming Team. There is even a Web site....Usually they encourage parents who have children age of 9 or 10 yrs old to joint up, Wether they made it to be Team USA it is up to their individual motivation and hard work that put them in this competitive position. Swimmer only get sponsorship by private companies if they shown potential in international competition and <strong>win</strong>.  Michael Phleps was already receiving about US$4 million in endorsement before olympics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is totally different from PRC when the kids are stream into various sport and attend sport school and all thru their training their living expenses are being paid for. Until their usefullness are USE UP or injured than their financial support ceased.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF YOU DON"T BUY it ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pls check how many PRC use their sport skill to migrate out from China if they really so passionate to their sport why quit. Result speak for itself. So stop pasting Gold to yourself.</p>
