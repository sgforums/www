              <p>Anybody in the US who is a US citizen can joint the US swimming Team. There is even a Web site....Usually they encourage parents who have children age of 9 or 10 yrs old to joint up, Wether they made it to be Team USA it is up to their individual motivation and hard work that put them in this competitive position. Swimmer only get sponsorship by private companies if they shown potential in international competition and <strong>win</strong>.  Michael Phleps was already receiving about US$4 million in endorsement before olympics.</p>

              <p>each country has it's own way to handle the issue, and whatever problem that has to be figured out, it has to be figured out by themselves.</p>
              <p>some countries have lax immigration law, so every tom, dick and harry can go in, and end up having cab drivers who do not know the way,</p>
              <p>others invite immigrants based on the immigrants qualifications, +++ other methods.</p>
              <p>in the sports scene in Singapore, with or without these imports, unless one is very smart and very atheltic, one is not going to go far. So therein, the environment does truly supports the nurturing of sports people. Whether the environment is caused by the system or the family is quite debatable.</p>
              <p>not sure if you are married or have children, but how many parents you know will actively encourage their offspring to pursue a sporting career, especially if these parents do not have the economic means to support such a goal?</p>

The defense agency claim proudly that this armored car was built using 100% indigenous technologies, design and tout it as a significant technological milestone for their country’s military industry. However, from Janes weekly, it was soon discovered that the armored car was nothing more than a local assembly version of the Belgian Sabiex AV-4 armored car. Everything, from the design, the opto-electronic systems on board are made by the Belgians. So the only thing that is so- “country x” was the fact that the defense agency of Country X slap their company logo and Country X’s flag onto it.</span></span></p>

Transfer this back to SG TT team. Yes we may to a certain extent say LJW is a Singaporean as she came here since 13, but how about Wang and Feng? They came only recently and were awarded SG citizenship in 2007, just in time for Olympics, isn’t it? So how different are we, in terms of pride, when we compare our TT team with the so called “achievement” of country X defense agency? </span></span></p>

              <p>Yes there are foreign born athelics in the US but more importantly the US recruited foreign born coaches who had won medal and they train american athelics. See the diff.</p>

              <p>I agreed with the statement but let me ask 1 simple question does our foreign born table tennis have the desire and motivation to beat the Chinese or contented with Sliver?  The coaches, players said they had accomplish their goal. (Sound more like a job)  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Athelics goes beyond the mental pressure and the desire to win, and that bring up the sportmanship makes them a medalist. And many many people have fail to win any medal and they return to their live or try again 4 yrs later. Yeah I call that sacrifice for years of training for an eternal glory.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would not use the word -- Sacrifice for our Table tennis rather than a contractual relationship. PRC player would be less well off if they were to remain in PRC that is why these folks use their skill to migrate out once they got the chance.   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here is my final question. DO you think "pyschologically" the table tennis team gave it all or held back it a little.  (no right or wrong answer!)</p>

              <p><br>again, I don't disagree with you.... but reality is, if you are a parent, say middle class, have a relatively talented child, will you be more concern with him doing good in his school, PSLE, O Level, A Level, or would you ask him to chase his dream and send him to some remote place to be trained?</p>
              <p>fact is, reality sucks.</p>
              <p>IMO, all the sports that we excel in, swimming, sailing, bowling, is because é˜¿çˆ¸ and é˜¿å¦ˆ got money, can afford to play and engage private tutor.</p>
              <p>I think even if LKY himself sponsor, most parents also don't want to do it.</p>

              <p>Is Singapore government doing enough for sports? Which sports? golf, tennis, bowling, track and fields, or soccer? I don't think Singapore should put money into developing talents for all sports. But I think enough is done for some sports, like soccer, swimming and table tennis. What else we need to do?</p>
              <p>Motivation for sports begins at home. But kids are very much influenced by their parents. If parents are both music teachers, you are not likely to find the kids having interest in rugby.</p>
              <p>Motivation also comes from schools. but some schools have their tradition. table tennis, in particular is a sport of the old Chinese schools, like Catholic High, Nanyang. You find it a tradition for RI, ACS and St. Andrew to fight it out in rugby. You don't find any students who study in RI, ACS or St. Andrew from Pr. 1 to JC and can excel in table tennis. I do know that if you play table tennis well and apply for RJC, you will be accepted even if you academic score is below the normal entry mark. Foreign talent?</p>
              <p>Soccer is the only sport that is enjoyed nation wide, but what have we achieved?</p>
              <p>But what is most important, the mentality of parents. do you want to send your kids to a special school (not in a ulu area, for there is none in Singapore) just to focus on a sport? I haven't seen any true blue singaporean parents who have that kind of passion, tell me I am wrong. It is not money. I see young kids, more and more, carrying their golf bags, go under private coach, special program. are there Tiger Woods want to be? No, but golf is a game good for business, for social, a game and a sport, good for the future in business. Also tennis, tennis rackets, renting of tennis court costs a lot, but many well to do families send their kids for special lessons. Are they Nadel or federer want to be? No,  no, sportsman in Singapore tan bu jia.</p>
              <p>Want to establish national identity? first you decide who are your fellow true blue Singaporeans. Only the born in Singapore, the bumi? then you have to find who among those who hold Singapore passports are local born, how many MPs, civil servants, who are born overseas, give them the pink IC and reserve the red IC for the local born. Foreign born become citizens by the constitution of the Republic of Singapore. If you don't identify with them, they don't have to identify with you. What national identity you want?</p>
              <p>National character, I would be very glad to want to know what is the true blue Singaporean character, care to share?</p>
