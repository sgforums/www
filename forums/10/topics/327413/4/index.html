              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">martyr </span></strong>? thats a word you can hardly use on him, the only thing getting exposed right now is his own stupidity. </p>
              <p>the only direction he's going in is driving people like me who are on the fence over to pap's side. should the day come when he actually has a chance of winning anything i'll moblise everyone i know to help vote against him and this is even though i have a strong dislike of pap. so do you think he's doing good for the oposition's cause?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>good people to come out and stand? what type of good? capable? or morally good? either way CSJ isn't "good", or do you have another type of interpretation i haven't come across?</p>
              <p>now that you've mentioned this, why don't you list out someone who's "good" and is doing well in politics.</p>

              <p>no, they'll just announce its the people's mandate thus showing singapore is a democratic nation which has voted for the most promising canditates in a democratic process. thereby ensuring the next round of wage hikes for the ministers in order to retain the best talents in the market.</p>
