A family car would set him back by $120,000.<br>An Asian foreigner's cost of living back home is so much lower than ours. Hence, he is more willing to work for $3,000 to $5,000 a month. But a Singaporean graduate earning $4,000 a month will be trying to keep up with inflation.<br>It does not make sense that a foreign PME working here has a bright future, while his Singaporean counterparts are struggling with their living expenses, unless they are in strong sectors like banking and health care, where pay is high.<br>A levy is imposed when one hires a maid, but there is no such tax for hiring foreign PMEs. No wonder foreign PMEs were replacing local ones at an increasing rate until tighter restrictions were imposed last year.<br><strong>At the moment, the local PME retrenchment rate is still high as employers are hiring foreigners for the cost savings.<br>Over the medium to long term, this will weaken Singapore's economy as local PMEs will become structurally unemployed as they lose their skills and employability.</strong><br>Lim Kay Soon<br><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/premium/forum-letters/story/local-pmes-dont-have-it-easy-20140531">Local PMEs don't have it easy</a></td>
