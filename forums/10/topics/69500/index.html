            <div class='col-md body'>Shutterbug?!? Is it that bad?<br><br>I went back to sg once. This couple that i knew from way back were obviously having issues in their relationship. The girl used to make her boyfriend jealous on purpose. At this stage they were 24/27 i thought that mind games were too juvenile for this bunch.<br><br>She used to admit to me that they were having issues but they were not resolving it. The last i heard they applied and received the key for the HDB flat. With supply outstripping demand these days, they got the ok earlier than they expected from HDB. Consequently... they had to rush and ROM.<br>Why did they still want to get married??? I didn't understand.. just because it was the 'right' thing to do.. so might as well do it??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think people ( specially the younger ones ) aren't tying their knots and committing to multiple babies because they wanna achieve more, and basically enjoy life a little longer - or more. It's also a lot harder to enjoy life these days then before. It costs more...<br><br>As it is well known, stress levels in making a living here has gone up, competition in everything, and I guess, people generally don't wanna risk it, or like someone said; don't wanna bring in another life into such a stressful existence. While those who can afford it, are setting up roots elsewhere - they became Foreign Talents.<br><br>And then some, find they have no time to babysit, and don't have the means to hire maids because of ever increasing levees, and costs of childcare services. This all, still points to costs..<br><br>You know, I just wonder which part of the word C-O-S-T-S, that our government don't understand??<br><br>If it isn't for high costs of living, why then, are so many families functioning with two, or combined incomes? And then the topic about our Education System, is quite another matter to live with, or up to.<br><br>So what gives?

            <div class='col-md body'>In one of his last National Day Rally speech at the Kallang Theatre (before handing the PM's chair to GCT), LKY had reflected on the satisfaction, after-thoughts, and regrets of all the policies initiated and pushed forward by himself, during his long period of as the First PM of Singapore.<br><br>One of his stated after-thought on a policy that had PROBABLY caused the large number of UNMARRIED Women with Higher Education (Tertiary Education) - was the Women's Charter.<br><br>The Women's Charter protects the Women's rights, and require the Singapore Man to have only ONE Wife - (except for Muslims, whose marriage rights are governed by the Suriah Laws)<br><br>His thoughts were influenced by his observation that there exist a large number of highly educated ladies being left as Singles; which he felt was due to the nature of Singapore Men, who had a strong preference to MARRY-DOWN the education scale - or the Men preferring to marry someone LESS educated than themselves.<br><br>LKY felt that the Women's Charter may have worsened the situation of the already worsening large numbers of Highly Educated and SINGLE Women.<br><br>He, quite seriously, said that PERHAPS without the Women's Charter, then Singapore Men may have been able to LEGALLY 'adopt' a few more women to be their spouses, as had been a practise amongst the older generation of capable and venerable men.<br><br>If this process was available, this will result in Highly Educated Women being married to Highly Capable Men, and perhaps more Children with high potential can be pro-created.<br><br>There will be LESS number of Highly Educated Women who need to remain Single.<br><br>With one push of the pen, the Women's Charter was legislated that eventually caused all the hardship for Singapore Men - having to conduct their love affairs in an illicit manner, with illicit by-products, and causing all the miseries to established marriages, and the final result of heart wrenching divorces.<br><br></div>

She is a princess and needs to be on her own for like 2 years to grow up and deal with her issues. She also needs to know that she can't have everything her way and to live and let live. Her tantrums is causing too much disruption to their relatives including me.<br><br>Could this be one of the causes? The people are generally getting married cos they are almost 30 and it is expected of them? They forget that age doesn't come with maturity of the mind. It could also be peer pressure or pressure from the family. If i hear once more when am I getting married, and i'm in my early 20's... i will crack!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I believe, the reasons for divorce would be simply, the 2 people were not right for each other. They entered a very serious committment without any planning or wisdom of what they were doing, and what could possibly result from such a union. I myself, if i ever had a girl, would not rush a marriage or anything like that. I believe communication from both parties is essential. Perhaps now the government will have "marriage" workshops heh, but that would not be a bad idea,,, to let people know that they have to be serious about marriage, and not to regard it as something they can back out of.<br></div>

You would know they are trailer trash. I'm not refering to one person. There is a group of people who live on Pension Cards which my $800/mth tax deductions pays for. They do not want to get proper jobs. Procreating is how they earn my tax money from the government. I'm not disputing about how much they love their kids. I'm talking about dole bludgers.</div>

Sometimes, you should wander what type of home they live in and their living conditions, do you think they want to stay in poor conditions? Is it by choice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Share a heart, its a benefit the government gives to the less fortunate people a small chunk of the tax payers money. I am sure, there some people who abuse this system, but there are more less fortunate people than these abusers. One thing is, they all fall under the same category.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
