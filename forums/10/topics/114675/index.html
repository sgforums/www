            <div class='col-md body'>You should be extremely careful when using the word "nepotism".  Anyway, i agree with you that the current system is open to abuse. I'm not sure that it has not happened already, and one can only hope that things do not get worse.<br><br>Also, it is not in the present government's interest to change. They, the ones who are benefiting from the current system, should not be the one to be relied upon to change. It is the voters whose job it is to change them.<br><br>Vote accordingly (if you get to that is).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nepotism might not have been the best choice of words.  Contextually it was referring to governments in general.   Yeah, its true about the chinese sayings, am kinda confused as to which generation we are actually in.  The 2nd or the 3rd?  It is the exact mentality that is troubling me, the general lack of interest or maybe disillusionment.<br><br>Disillusionment plays a big part IMHO, its like seeing the problems and having the desire to try and correct it in a way through the act of opening up new avenues of thought and having that surppressed as it does not tally with the objectives of the organization.<br><br>Sorta like the experience of having burnt by fire lingering in one's memory.</div>
