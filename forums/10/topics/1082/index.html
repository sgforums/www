            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, actually a lot of people like to wayang in the public to show how religious they are, but they are not necessarily morally any better than those who are free-thinkers. I'd rather they spend more time thinking how to be a better person than trying to 'buy their way into heaven'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the school tells them to stop wearing the tudungs, then they should stop wearing it.  Final.  They can appeal, but if higher authorities reject it, all the more they should stop forcing their childrin to wear it.  Why they rather let their children get suspended from going to school, I will not understand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True. My sympathy is with the children. Why deprive them of the right to a good education, and get them embroiled in a political debate? They dont even know what all this is all about! Furthermore, they have all the time to wear a tudung when they are out of school, what are they fussing about? Its all just a political stunt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately there are people  who don't think like we do. To them, their children's education and well-being is secondary to their religion. To you and me, it might be a horrible skewed vision to the world, but to them they are right. Thats why to this day, Osama might be a murdering madman to you and me, but to certain people hes a freedom fighter...<br><br>Its a sad thing, but thats the way it is...<br><br>I do believe that there are elements within the Malay/Muslim community(not all just a minority) who constantly want to push the government and see what they can get away with. To them its not enough that Singapore doesn't discriminate against the minority, but they want the privileges accorded to theur brethren in you-know-where, and they constantly puch for it, with you-know-which-country's help. Anywhere else in the world, that country would be doing what we call "formenting subversion", but we tolerate it anyhow.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For some cases, muslim parents who had committed some wrong-doings in their life will impose several strict religious ways of living on the children. e.g making their children wear the tudung since very young age or making them prayed several times a day.<br><br>Those parents hope that by doing that, their (the parents) "sins" will be removed &amp; "god" will favour such sacrifice. Some parents will send the children to religious schools &amp; hope that the children will be "heavenly-trained" &amp; bring the "heaven" into their homes.<br><br>If that's the case, the parents are likely to be very stubborn on the tugung issue &amp; will refuse to listen to others comment regarding the inappropriateness of tugung in schools.<br><br>As u can see, the 3 local parents even refuse to listen to advise of religious leaders &amp; they also critize the Malay MPs.<br><br>But, their children are quite pitiful...wonder how come they could have such parents who actually "sacrifice" their kids education &amp; reputation in school.</div>
