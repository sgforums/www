            <div class='col-md body'>UN panel votes for death penalty moratorium<br><br>The resolution, which calls for 'a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty', was passed 99-52 with 33 abstentions on Thursday. --<br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20071116/ST749275001_01_0001.jpg"><br>PHOTO: AFP<br><br>UNITED NATIONS - A UNITED Nations committee voted in favour of a resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty in a key step toward the passing of the nonbinding motion by the world body.<br><br>Opponents had tried to derail the resolution in the UN General Assembly's human rights committee by inserting amendments on the right to life of unborn children.<br><br>More than 15 amendments were voted down in two days of acrimonious debate that touched on whether the death penalty was a human rights issue or a domestic matter. Some Caribbean and other countries accused the European Union, a key backer of the text, of seeking to impose its values on other nations.<br><br>The resolution, which calls for 'a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty', was passed 99-52 with 33 abstentions on Thursday. It is likely to go to the full 192-member assembly in mid-December where supporters say they expect few countries to change their position.<br><br>'It's a question of coherence - a country that votes in a certain way here will do so there,' Italian Ambassador Marcello Spatafora said shortly before the vote.<br><br>Eighty-seven countries - including the 27 EU states, more than a dozen Latin American countries and eight African states - jointly introduced the draft resolution, though opponents singled out the EU as the driving force.<br><br>Two similar moves in the 1990s failed in the assembly. This time, the text of the resolution stops short of an outright demand for immediate abolition.<br><br>Angry opposition<br>Mr Vanu Gopala Menon, ambassador of Singapore which has a mandatory death penalty for most drug offences, accused those who brought the resolution to the committee of being 'sanctimonious, hypocritical and intolerant'.<br><br>Barbados was among the most vocal in complaining that 'a group of countries' was trying to impose its will, saying it had been threatened with the withdrawal of aid over the issue.<br><br>Human rights organisation Amnesty International welcomed the vote as a 'historic resolution and a major step towards the abolition of the death penalty worldwide'.<br><br>'Although the resolution is not legally binding on states, it carries considerable moral and political weight,' Amnesty International said in a statement.<br><br>China, Iran, Iraq, the United States, Pakistan and Sudan account for about 90 per cent of all executions worldwide.<br><br>According to Amnesty, 133 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice - a statistic that opponents of the resolution contested. They said more than 100 countries retained capital punishment on their statutes, even if they did not all use it.<br><br>Botswana's representative Rhee Hetanang said the death penalty was a domestic criminal justice issue. 'No amount of intimidation and bullying will cause us to go against the expressed wish of the people of Botswana,' he said.<br><br>Egypt and Iran were among countries proposing a last-minute amendment that would have urged member states 'to take all necessary measures to protect the lives of unborn children'. The United States, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe were among the countries voting for that amendment. It was rejected 83-28 with 47 abstentions.<br><br>'We are in agreement with the view expressed in this amendment that the lives of the unborn deserve the strongest protection, and we agree that countries that advocate for the abolition of the death penalty should be at least equally scrupulous in showing concern for innocent life,' US representative Joseph Rees said.<br><br>The United States abstained in a vote on a more strongly worded amendment that would have said abortion was only admissible in necessary cases, 'in particular where the life of the mother and or the child is at serious risk'. -- REUTERS<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/World/STIStory_177297.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/World/STIStory_177297.html</a></div>

The eligibility for parole must be agreed by all 12 jury member. Rarely succeed.<br><br>He's 58, plus 25 years, that's 83.  He might not live that long.<br><br>It looks like the court is lenient but it makes no difference whether he's convicted for first or second degree murder. The jail term is the same. IMO, it's worse the death.<br><br><blockquote>In Canada, the so-called "Faint Hope Clause" (Section 745.6 of the Canadian Criminal Code) specifies that prisoners serving the maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years, may apply for early parole after 15 years has been served. It is so called because very few prisoners are actually granted this early release. This section of Canadian Criminal Code was added after Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976 and replaced it with mandatory life sentences for first and second degree murder. This particular provision was added in order to encourage convicted murderers in Canada to rehabilitate themselves and to reflect the fact that other countries allow convicted murderers to be paroled after on average 15 years of incarceration.<br><br>This section of the criminal code was amended in 1997. Applications for early parole made under the section are now first reviewed by judge who determines whether or not the application should be submitted to a jury for consideration. Previous to the amendment, applications were not reviewed and always went directly to a jury for consideration. The 12 person jury is also now required to be unanimous for the application to be accepted (previously only eight out of the 12 jurors had to agree). Also, the section was amended so that people convicted of more than one murder in Canada, where one or more of the murders was committed after January 9, 1997, must now serve 25 years before being eligible for parole.</blockquote></div>
