AI has a story about a murder that happened in \England in 1978. The police did an extremely detailed investigation and found that all evidence pointed to one person, a 19 year-old boy. That boy was sentenced to death. So the case was laid to rest. Then, five years later, the housekeeper of the victim stumbled upon another piece of evidence, and this evidence proved the boy's innocence. The police, horrified at thier mistake, quickly compensated the boy's family and the judge himself gave a post-thumous declaration of teh boy's innocence. Obviously, it was too late. 2 years later, England dropped the Death penalty completely.<br><br>Like the Dalai Lama says, the Death Penalty is merely a shortcut for government to escape the real social ills. oh, n im ROman Catholic, not Buddhist.

            <div class='col-md body'>15 grams is indeed the weight of a 20 cent coin.<br><br>However no one take drugs in their pure form. The concentration of the drug tat they take is very low, possible less than 1%. The question to ask is not about the weight, it is about how long can it sustains an average drug addict ? Fact is, such an amount will lasts a drug addict weeks. Drug addict know the drug abuse act more well than u and I do. If they r not drug traffickers, they will not carry on themselves more than 15 grams at any one time. Thus when people r caught with tat amount of drugs, most likely they r real drug traffickers.<br><br>Drug addict can be couriers, or donkeys. However, these couriers and donkeys r already helping with the distribution of drugs to the people. If they assist in making the drugs more accessible to the public, if they assist in making more people drug addicts, then too bad they had already done irrepairable harm and thus rightfully being labelled as drug traffickers. Drug addicters being forced into being drug trafficker just shows us the cruelty and seriousness of the problem of drugs. Everyone should know drugs can make fillial person murder their mothers, cowards be armed robbers and innocent girls into postitutes. Therefore we must try to reduce their infleunce as much as possible.<br><br>Anyway, most people are pressurised or facing stress in a certain area when they commit crimes. Thieves may be hungry and kidnappers may have a medical fees to pay for their mother. Can we pardon them all ? NO ! The number one reason why laws is in existence is to create an orderly society, where ones possession and well being is protected. Then will stability and growth be achieved.<br><br>Laws however do shows compassion too. In our legal system. It is called, ligitation. It cannot be used to wipe off the offence but it can be used to reduce the punishment of a certain offence. If a drug addict is really being forced by cicumstances, and he had fully coorporate with the police, then most likely he can be released from the death penalty.<br><br>About ISA, can someone enlightened me about the recent abuse of it by the Gov recently ? I mean the 90's and 20's.</div>

HEAVY compensation, of course.<br></blockquote>addicts know better. we've mentioned before that they avoid carrying more than 12g cos they know its the death penalty if they get caught. furthermore, u gotta be a damned hardcore addict to snort 12g of pure heroin a day... most also cannot afford to carry so much. its not like going to Giant or Carrefour to "stock up" when u run out u know... they have a problem, they have an addiction, if they're willing to kick the habit, avenues ARE available to them. its really just a phone call, a reality check and a dose of methadone away. all it takes is the will to make the change.<br><br>BUT if they're resorting to trafficking to sustain their habits, i don't have any sympathy for them any more because it no longer just involves them. they are dragging others into the hole as well.<br><br>so... going by your reasoning, while society has to be responsible to the criminals it produces, criminals can just take solace in the reasoning that they are "forced upon" their life of crime and they have "no choice"??? that "addiction" deprives them of free will?<br><br>here's news for you: u drag an addict into rehab against his will, u force methadone down his throat and make him sweat and puke through his withdrawals until he kicks the habit, u let him out, and he'll go right back to the habit. THAT's free will for u. if they didn't CHOOSE to kick the habit, they won't.<br><br>and compensation? what is just compensation for trafficking narcotics? community service  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ? so they can go right back to do it again once they're set free? cos its no big deal and all u get is community service.<br><br><blockquote>As for murder, i still think that the death penalty should not be meted out, juz in case non-incriminating evidence could be found later...</blockquote>thats why the onus is on the police to make sure they have enough evidence, and the judiciary to judge the evidence to ensure that it is sufficiently conclusive. i see your example as a case of sloppy police work and a rare exception. i don't see how locking a guy up for 20 yrs and letting him out after that saying 'sorry we got the wrong guy' is any better... he's just as ruined.<br><br><blockquote>Like the Dalai Lama says, the Death Penalty is merely a shortcut for government to escape the real social ills. oh, n im ROman Catholic, not Buddhist. So, if you wish to prove me wrong, detail me a case of murder in Tibet. Surely, no Falun monk murders pple! in fact, its more of them getting murdered!</blockquote>dalai lama presents a religious viewpoint. amnesty international presents the liberal perspective. most of us here prefer to live in the real world and we all see the limitations of such arguments.<br><br>i don't agree that crimes are the result of society. i believe in free will. an individual can choose whether to do good, or evil. isn't that what the Judeo-Christian God gives to man? free will. u eat the forbidden fruit because why? temptation and free will. what's the role of society in it? don't make excuses. society shapes us, but we are who we choose to be and we choose what we want to do.<br><br><blockquote>btw, ur pt on the irresponsibility...<br>it is our responsiblity to reduce and prevent crime in the nation. So you are essentially shirking responsibility if u heap the blame on the criminals purely. Remember, it takes 2 hands to clap.<br>the pikamaster</blockquote>and how do we "reduce and prevent" crime? education as u mentioned before? maybe... but like i said, its open ended. religion? some will choose to be atheists and still not be crooks. by being civic minded and watch our for criminal activities? that is prevention and to a large extent, deterrent. because its ultimately based on the proper enforcement of the law.<br><br>and of course i blame the criminals! is it fair that u heap collective guilt on society for the unlawful actions of a minority? why is it society's fault when someone breaks into my house and steals my property? why is it society's fault when an individual brings in a ton of narcotics? are YOU gonna compensate me for my losses if i get pickpocketed since YOU are part of this society which i live in and hence, at least partly to blame for my lost wallet???? should i blame myself for bringing my wallet outside the safety of my safe deposit box? what kind of society would THAT be?<br><br>its a very basic principle: u do the crime, u do the time. why bring "society" into it? if society has a role at all, it is to say in one loud voice that "WE HATE CRIME" and make sure that those who refuse to live by society's laws are properly dealt with, with capital punishment if necessary.<br></div>

I NEVER heaped any collective guilt on the society for the criminal's actions. of course crime is wrong. BUT I DO "heap the blame on society" for not doing the best it can to prevent crime in the first place. Education is not exactly open-ended. if it is, then you might as well say that whether or not one wants to learn a skill is dependent on oneself. That is true, of course, but that's what teh CE Act is for, isn't it? TO force people to do schooling. The problem with us is that our moral education system is as horrid as the rest of teh education, and our teachers aren't so moral either. So, the result is that students pick up bad morals and end up as criminals...\<br><br>n again, u misquoted my point on compensation. the compensation is what the CRIMINAL pays the VICTIM. In stealing for example, the thief would have to pay back say, twice the amount he stole. TODAY provided a very interesting example. A farmer caught for illegal logging was sentenced to planting 30000 more trees. BNot only is that a deterrent, but at the same time the farmer really gets to understand the impact of his crime. In the case of drug-trafficking, the Drug-trafficker could be made to watch addicts being rehbilitated and pay rehab fees for the addicts in rehab for a cerrtain period. There, isn't that a solution? this is what is called a reformative penalty. For murder, im not really sure, perhaps the murderer could pay for teh funeral expenses and keep visiting the grave year after year just like Dutch hit-and-run drivers do, to remind themselves how bad killing is. Naturally, they have to be kept under surveillance. the Death Penalty is mainly exacting vengeance for teh victim, and exacting vengeance is never moral. Plus, as I stated before, the murderer's family has to experience unnecessary grief. At the same time, does killing the murderer bring back the victim from the dead? No, not at all!<br><br>I was reading "Sunrise, Sunset" by the late Gopal Baratham last year. the story relates a man searching for the murderer of his fiancee, not to exact the Death Penalty on him/her, but just to find out the rationale for murder. If all victims' families would be like this man, then you can see how stupid the Death penalty really is. If you talk about positive effects, the positive effects are just like those of alcohol- a temporary uplifting of teh spirit. But it does not last forever. And in the end, the victim's family would still have to pass their lives without any help, and that is really bad. On the other hand, if the murderer were allowed to live, he could be asked to support the victim's family for teh rest of his life and be required by law to do it. In this case, both innocent parties- the victims' family and the murderer's family wun haf to suffer.<br><br>n btw, to ur first sentence, u should amend it to "...proper enforcement of the <span style="font-style: italic;">proper</span> law".<br><br>n also, remember that "empty vessels make the most noise" and "actions speak louder than words". So if society only keeps groaning "we hate crime" but does nothing to remove it as good as possible, then it is totally useless.</div>

Even the press has not been silent. Not long after the report, ST gave roughly 1/3 print area to a letter praising DPM Lee for his many "virtues". The letter warned Singaporeans about reading and being misled by information, and cited Amnesty's report as a "misleading report", urging Singaporeans to ignore it.<br>Anyway, I have kind of a nagging feeling that the government is actually PROUD that we are number one in having used such an "effective" method to keep crime low. n of ocurse, with the media feeding propaganda, it is doubtful that any normal SIngaporean would believe Amnesty anyway. Naturally, that is a blow to HR in Asia. In fact, I was shocked that ST carried a commentary in a recent newspaper praising Castro for the economic turnaround he brought about in Cuba. That articl is extremely disturbing, especially when we know Cuba is still very very poor. In fact, the article even suggested that CUbans re-elect Castro. The article did not even mention the amount of "disappeared" in Cuba or police torture etc. How horrendous!<br><br>n btw, could you pls be a little more active in this, your own thread? i find it peculiar that someone actually posts a topic and then ignores it entirely.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>for the first case, one side faces injustice one way or the other. so there is no "lesser than the two evils" argument. </blockquote>Well then, the murderer children do have to visit their parents grave when they were hanged. However the question is, is visiting graves can even be considered as a punishment ? If tat is true, then when a murder has take place, the murderer had already start punishing all the victims relatives since they had to visit the victim's graves too. Can visiting graves be used to deter people from committing serious crimes like murder ? Your silly "murderer child theory" is nothing compared to the "victim child theory" so forget it !<br><br><blockquote>in the case of logging, it is not stated that he was a commercial logger. in fact, he is a FARMER. logging simply means deforestation.

So is he still a farmer ? Let's say a female kills another and became a murderer, is she still a woman ? Unless u have proof he did burn down trees, then I can still say from the article tat he <strong>cut</strong> the trees, not burn them. I do not want to debate tis stupid issue on whether he got burn trees or not. I ask another question. Have u heard of haze problem in China ? Even if he did burn them, is tat a significant crime he committed ?<br><br><blockquote>n u misunderstand me when you say "token of appreciation";. obviously, the murderer would be under close scrutiny and FORCED to pay the amounts by the judiciary.

Good news since u r coming closer and closer to being practical. For your info, rehab fees for addicts for a certain period of time is very cheap.

I just pity the drug addict as their humiliating moment is being enjoyed by both the "watchful" police and drug trafficker. So is tat a punishment ?
