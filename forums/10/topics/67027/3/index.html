Before parliamentary sittings, the MPs have a meeting of sorts to understand the new laws that are going to be passed.</blockquote>all politicians everywhere do that... the problem in singapore is not that we have politicians who horse-trade and do quid pro quos, but that there isn't an equally powerful opposition capable of blocking that... and if there were, i'll bet u money that they'll be horse-trading and scratching each other's backs too.<br><br>anyway, i've said before that it obscures the issues when u lug in politics and start bitching about how imperfect the PAP autocracy is. screw that. stick to the topic. DEATH PENALTY.<br><br><blockquote>the non-brainwashed pikamaster</blockquote>not being brainwashed is not about arguing for one position to the extreme exclusion of all compromises and resolution. that just makes u a bigot. YOUR way isn't the only way and it remains to be seen if your "enlightened" ideas really work in reality... care to cite some case studies? kinda boring to just hear broad visions.<br><br>repentance? well, until a time when we can qualitatively measure that, i say the interests of the law abiding public ranks higher than that of hardened death-row criminals, just to take 2 extremes.</div>

"This evidence should be excluded."<br><br>Nguyen has pleaded not guilty to carrying about 396 grams of heroin during a stop in Singapore while flying from Cambodia to Melbourne in December last year.<br><br>Under Singapore law, hanging is mandatory for anyone convicted of carrying more than 15 grams of heroin.<br><br>The defence team presented detailed arguments that the mandatory sentencing policy for drug crimes breached the country's constitution and international law by imposing "cruel and inhuman" punishment and by denying judicial discretion.<br><br>But they said the police treatment of Nguyen and the handling of the evidence against him made the prosecution case unsound and the prospect of the death penalty unthinkable.<br><br>Mr Tito said a package of heroin allegedly found strapped to Nguyen's back as he prepared to board a Qantas flight to Melbourne, and another recovered from his hand luggage, had not been handled according to narcotics bureau regulations.<br><br>When the alleged drug parcels were returned after later chemical analysis, one was heavier and the other lighter than initial records and no explanation was given for the discrepancies.<br><br>"The prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the exhibits were properly handled," Mr Tito told the court.<br><br>He argued that even if the court were to convict Nguyen, it would be wrong to apply the death penalty given the irregularities in the prosecution case.<br><br>"No capital offence can be made if there is no reliable evidence about the weight of the drugs," he said.<br><br>But prosecutors said there was no evidence that the drug exhibits had been tampered with and said Nguyen had confessed to carrying drugs in further police interviews made after he met with consular officials.<br><br>The case is continuing.<br><br></blockquote>i have just one question despite all that supposed "uncertainties" about inconsistencies in the "procedures" or questions of whether the evidence had been handled "properly"...<br><br>just ONE question aside from all that judicial hanky panky and diplomatic obstruction.<br><br>did he, or did he NOT have more than 15 grams of heroin strapped to his back with masking tape?<br><br>cheese... pple sure like to split hair on the insignificant.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't be sure about that. look at the former ussr. Their Mafia still thrived , even with the KGB going around.And without a heavy deterence such as death sentence, how are you going to ensure that drug traffickers will not make singapore their transit point? And besides as i said, Are we willing to spend money to shut such a large amount of supposedly deathrow criminals for life? Why spend on our precious resources on such people when we don't even get to have pensions?</div>
