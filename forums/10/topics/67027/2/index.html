            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>and what is the cause? ironically, it is what allegedly gives us racial and religious harmony: secularism. One thing that religion does that any law, no matter how perfect it is, cannot do, is to give the person a fear of supernatural consequences or a desire to be elevated to teh same level as a supernatrual deity. Either way would be more effective in preventing crime than any law could. the religion im talking about here is not any cults or religious extremists. Im talking about the Establishments, like true CHristianity, Pure Islam and Hinduism and Buddhism. </blockquote>I am pretty sensitive toward religious issue, and sad to say I find the above paragraph a bit hard to digest... Sorry but I had to sidetrack a bit...<br><br>Can religious stop crimes from taking place ? R u sure ? I believe it very much depend on ones' interpretation of the religion. If religion can prevent crimes, then there will be no such things such as terrorists and religious wars.<br><br>I have heard of people saying this, "I won't hesistate to kill u as I know Jesus and God will forgive me". Of course people will complain tat he had a twisted interpretation of the religion, thus cannot be linked together with the main religion. But then again who knows wat should the real interpretation should be ? Why is there the differentiation between Catholic and Christian when the bible is the same ? Does Al Qaeda member really have a twisted interpretation of their religion ? Not really because their holy scripture really do mention about the jihab or holy war. It is like an exception clause... Muslims should like peace and not violence. But if their brethen is bullied they had to draw arms to assist them. Religiously and literally speaking, the self bombing religious fanatics aren't wrong. The "real" form for Muslim may not be the one mainstream is applying now. This "real" form is only because tis is the form the Gov or society prefers. If being religious will prevent crime, then there will be no such incident like jailing of Galileo and witch burning incident in the west ages before. The bible speaks God of mass murdering people (Noah's Ark, Moses, family member of Job) without valid reasons, making it very useless in preventing people from committing wars and murders.<br><br>Personally I had heard of another wrong interpretation of religion in the following story. A Muslim is caught being a drug abuser. When he was in lock up, he paid overwhelming details about his religion like whether his bunk mates r eating halal etc. When question why does he take drugs then, he replied Quran says they can not eat pork and take alcohol, but they do not say anything about drugs and smoking so it is okay for them to do it. (NOTE : Tis is an example of a person having a wrong interpretation of his religion. I am not trying to put down the religion. Muslim scholars had said tat the real interpretation of Quran is Muslim should not do anything harmful to their body, thus drugs and cigarrettes r no no too)<br><br>Again I have to say, religion acts like a double edge sword. It may help in small crimes like theft and cheating. However it justifies terrible sins like war and terrorists and illegal imprisonment. It depends on how people interprete their religion. Sad to say, there r always a lot of people having the wrong interpretation in religion. Or sad to say, sometimes religious made people lose the way instead of finding it.</div>

"A single sly female" is a witness trying to prove tat the Man is guilty. The court thus is determining if he is guilty from the statement of the 2 parties. It is innocent before proven guilty isn't it ?<br><br>Frankly for molest cases, little evidence can be gathered. A man molest a girl in private. Wat other evidence can the girl produce to prove she is victimised ? In tis sense, the law believes a woman will not take the trouble to charge a man in court if there is not a shred of truth in it. The other question is why doesn't the girl charge other people but only the molester ?<br><br>Several defenses can be employed, if the alleged molester can proves she has a personal feud with him, it may help his case substantially.

And it dosen't take a alrge ammount of corruption in a judge to do a person in.

The two former intents are mostly fulfilled, but the issue is whether there are more civilised and less wasteful alternatives. As for the rehabilitative goal, there is evidence to say that it has failed.<br>.<br>Even in Singapore, where the prison system is doing well by world standards, a study released by the research and statistics department of the Subordinate Courts showed that 58 per cent Â— or 33,167 of the 56,904 crimes committed in 2002 were by repeat offenders. It was a 10 per cent increase over 2001.<br>.<br>More worrying was the finding that repeat offenders were committing more than one crime, at an average of 2.3 crimes in 2002 compared to 1.7 in 2001.<br>.<br>Did prison stays make them worse?<br>.<br>In the US, the Plain Truth magazine reported that, despite being called correctional institutions, the prisons have become so overcrowded that "the American justice system has all it can do to house inmates while they serve their time. Seeking to reform inmates is no longer a priority in most facilities".<br>.<br>Also in the US, statistics indicate that many released prisoners return to crime Â— often worse ones Â— and become targets for recruitment by organised crime in and outside the prison system and by terrorist groups.<br>.<br>The Plain Truth asked: "Have the very institutions we established to redeem errant citizens been turned into factories for hatred and violence?"<br>.<br>Other than locking up criminals whose freedom will be a menace to society and to serve as a deterrent, jail benefits no one. The state incurs huge expenditure in the trials, maintaining the system, dealing with the consequences of jailing someone, the army of counsellors for the prisoners and their families, the welfare arrangements and the post-release monitoring.<br>.<br>The convicted suffer punishment in excess of the jail terms Â— destroyed careers or businesses, shattered and separated families, legal fees and exposure to the excesses of prison such as violent behaviour or temperament, sexual deviation, homosexual rape and molest, organised crime, racism and disease.<br>.<br>Prison separates them from the institutions that could help them change Â— family, friends, religious communities and meaningful work. The victims endure the trials, loss of time, the medical and legal costs and little compensation. Even the fines go to the state.<br>.<br>So, what are the alternatives?

            <div class='col-md body'>well... maybe u have double post the readers comment in the same reply, making it unnecessary long... can u edit it so it can be posted on the main section of the thread ?<br><br>The examples quoted by Silva Kandiah, to be frank, can only worked for criminal acts of little consequences. In other words they r petty crimes. It cannot work for criminal acts such as murder, drug trafficking etc. Let me give an example. Imagine u r an accountant for a large firm. Somewhere in your course of work, u get to have a chance to embezzle a few million dollars to your account. If the penalty of embezzlement of funds is just doing charity work at an ophanage for the rest of your life, heck I will risk forgery to get the money. Same for kidnapping too. If the penalty for kidnapping is just cleaning up grafiti at the void deck, I will do it since if I don't get caught, I will still end up with a lot of money. It will be the same for armed robbery, drug trafficking etc. Commiting crime will then be like a gamble where the winning is great and I can afford to lose. Very soon singapore will becomes a lawless state.<br><br>BTW singapore has some restitution and compensation measures in place too. For molesters, it is a compoundable offence (something wrong with spelling). Meaning if u can make the victim forgive u, she can close the case there and then. Of course to make her forgive u, u probably have done some form of compensation and restitution. There r also a lot of other compoundable offence like slander or assault too.<br><br>Singapore is also famous for CWO, or Corrective Work Order. In fact it is the other countries tat had followed singapore example and implement it as a punishment for petty offence like littering and spitting. Singapore also allowed insane people to be force to mental Hospital instead of spending time at jail too.<br><br>Although jailing may seems to be harsh to u, it is better than cutting off your hands or gourging out your eyes. Wat other punishment do u suggest tat will serve as a deterent for people not to commit offence ? The punishment must be harsh enough for hard core adults to be afraid, otherwise it will serve no purpose. Just doing social service make hard core criminals laugh and commit crimes as often as possible.<br><br>Just a joke about doing public service. Let say there is no jail nor death sentence. Mr A commit a crime and is ordered to do community service. Mr A don't care and refuse to do the community service, wat is the police and court going to do ? Tell him to serve more time doing community services ??? Mr A just can just refuse to do any community service and the Gov can do nothing to him.<br><br>Anyway my interpretation of gracious society is tat they r courteous and have integrity. They should not skip queue, pig themselves at buffet, look down on other nationalities and keep a lost wallet for themselves. Remember there r many different kind of people in the world. If u r too "gracious", people will take advantage of u. If we r forgiving to a stage where drug trafficker only need to clean up parks, then very soon we will see singapore be the capital of drug activity in the region.<br><br>BTW... I thought Nathan is the head of DSO or some ambassador before his office of president while Ong Teng Cheong is the Minister of Transport ? DSO, police and other step board is not equal to PAP, otherwise by your definition 1/2 of singaporean r PAP.<br></div>
