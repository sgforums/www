            <div class='col-md body'>i am not surprised that Amnesty International has honoured Singapore with another No. 1 status, this time we all can really be proud as Singaporeans!<br><br>Also, am not surprised that  our highly paid people in the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a statement in the St today (17/1/2004), stating that "i do not know-------------execution rate ---is shrouded in secrecy." Even our Prime Minister who is supposed to be the No. 1 man did not know the execution rate in his own country when he spoke to the press last year.<br><br>i think that Amnesty International claims are actually more than fair and am sure they had not considered about 100 foreign workers and maids that had losts their lives in "serving" our country each year. The government, for some reasons, had so far refused to take actions against these employers.<br><br>So let us start a campaign, lobby our MP's for a start, against not only the  death penalty but also bring the employers to full justice for the death of their employees from the 3rd world countries!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The concept of hanging is deemed suitable more as a deterant rather than a humane sentence. Even the idea of hanging seems morbid to anyone on death row.<br><br>Sure lethal injection may be a better method but it may not be viable in singapore. I dun condone hanging but at the moment, there isn't a convincing alternative.<br><br>This section deviates from the topic a little...for those who think our legal is just and efficient, does any of you recall the expat who rammed the korean family, killing the mother and ther two children? However did she get acquitted? Not a shred of blame fell on her shoulders...is that justice?<br><br>The korean father, later interviewed, expressed supreme disappointment with the decision, saying that even if his family was mainly at fault, the expat should also shoulder some blame. And it is this aspect of reasoning that i agree totally with.<br><br>Damn! Even i think i should send some inconsiderate jaywalkers into orbit sometimes, but drivers have an obligation to exercise due caution, especially on the road, more so if it's raining (as in the case of the korean family)...<br><br>In the end, i still think a jury system gives a more satisfactory verdict than a judicial commissioner or a downright judge<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Very Good Points raised by Atobe and BillyBong, Putting a person to death is not the solution as proven in Singapore and all the other countries that carries out the death sentence.  If the death penalty is really effective than surely our crimes should also decline!  But this is not so and the truth is that we have an advanced levels of crimes in contrast to other countries, in terms population density.<br><br>How else can one view the case mentioned by Billy Bong, or the Michael McCrea's case, are these not discrimination?<br><br>Even our Chief Judge can be wrong, as proven in a recent case, so how can we be sure that all the people he and his merry men had sent to the death are really Â“guiltyÂ”?<br><br>If we Singaporeans are actually Human Beings, than the monetary aspects to educate our prisoners should not be an issue.<br><br>An Eye for EyeÂ’ or a Â‘Tooth for ToothÂ’ has no place in our civilized society, if we really want develop our Humane qualities then we have to note that Hatred will only cease by Love as shown in History, No other short cuts, This is the Eternal Law!<br><br></div>

I recently did a web search and found out that all the major religions in the world are against the death penalty: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and even Taoism. so there. out of these, the last three are certainly Eastern Religions. All religions have certain similar basic concepts, whether western or eastern, and these include forgiveness for sins.<br><br>For the Death penalty, although many Justice systems don't consider this a detail worth investigating, there are certain motives for killing. Motives include anger and resentment, and obviously these have causes. hence, a more effective way of preventing murder cases from occurring is to tackle these root concerns.<br><br>The Death penalty is merely a tool of revenge. and just as the victim's family is not allowed to kill the murderer either, neither is the State justified. Are the judges any more pure than the victims' family members?<br><br>the pikamaster<br><br>I wholeheartedly support an appeal to those countries who at present employ the death penalty to observe an unconditional moratorium. At the same time we should give more support to education and encourage a greater sense of universal responsibility. We need to explain the importance of the practice of love and compassion for our own survival and to try to minimize those conditions which foster murderous tendencies, such as the proliferation of weapons in our societies. These are things even private individuals can work towards.<br>-His holiness the Dalai Lama<br><br>btw, im catholic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U know how much is 15g ? is actually quite substantial since the purity level on the drug for sale is actually quite low. It may be able to develop into a kg of salable drug. And tis fact is very well known among fellow drug abuser, thus they will try to avoid carrying more than 15g at one time. As such, it seems to be quite effective in determining if u r trying to sell it or u r trying to buy it. Buyers will buy in small doses at one go, traffickers trying to get drugs from overseas have to risk carrying such amount.<br><br>Anyway hanging is not inhumane... they tied weights on your feet thus ensure instant death. And the cause of death is not due to suffocation but a broken neck.<br><br>If education can reform prisoners, then there wouldn't such things as repeat offenders. In fact, there would not have a need to have prison at all. We might as force them to go for school while living in the comfort of their house. It is good to try, but thinking it can replace punishment is futile.<br><br>Thinking about the loopholes of judges, I need to say something. Before the case is presented to be held, there must have substantial evidence from Investigators that points to his guilt. If not, it would already be swiftly rejected by the Public Prosecuters before the hearing. This explained the notion of Innocent Unless Proven Guilty which we took from British laws.<br><br>About the possibility of errors made by Judge, this cannot be helped. Which country doesn't have such errors being committed ? Even established countries like US and British have many such cases too.<br><br></div>
