Yes, i agree with you that communism is idealism and so is utopia. But my ideas are not mere idealism. Idealism comes in the form of huge generalizations- I gave concrete examples. Even if some of my suggestions mayseem impractical, they are not pure idealism.<br><br>you ask me if i have seen a drug addict before. well, have you? actually, my mum has, and she tells me that they are pathetic characters with real dire situations that force them into what tehy become. they are possesed by a beast that won't go away. anyway, i read up much on drug addicts and have watched documentaries on them. i do not believe that they are people without souls. perhaps, some may have blocked off what is within them, agonizing memories or so. (Hey, not everyone is like Philip Lee!) Drugs are always a form of escape from other problems. ironically, they end up becoming a problem of their own class. and anyway, if it is impossible to reform a drug addict, then why does govt set up rehab centres?<br><br>and as for accepting others' arguments, yes i accept what they think. but i do not accept that their views are morally right. that is teh reason for my strong rebuttals. and at least i bother to rebut. U juz stand there and refuse to acknowledge my views. so much about me being a troll. look at the mirror and see who's the troll yourself!<br><br>the disgruntled pikamaster (with a moral duty)<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

Even the USA Foreign office cannot prevent itself from emntioning that Singapore is the Capital fo teh Death penalty. Even the Australian Foreign Minister made a comment on that in 1998, so where does that leave you? adn you have oproven to me once again that you are a Freudian. Only Freudians and Qin-dynasty-type legalists think that humans are intrinsically evil. There is NO RELIGION in this world that believes such a fallacy, i tell you.<br><br>then, u contradict yourself, which shows the weakness in your argument. first of all, u say that Drug Addicts do not want to change, then you say they do. and then you use the flimsy argument of psychological dependence to support it.<br><br>then, funnily you talk about the detterents not being possible to stop this situation and we should prevent the drugs from coming in the first place! which is ironically, exactly what i have been trying to prove to you, to which you repeatedly claimed that Detterrents were essential!<br><br>nad now, i'll give you the ultimate reason that supports my supposed "fallacy": LOVE. Forgiveness is love, and in our mechanically destroyed society, that is the one thing that is lacking. Lack of Love is what causes most addicts to go on drugs in the first place and to crime as well. whether it is love by teh state, by teh schools, by the family, or by the corporate bosses. if LOVE in society would increase, all ills would decrease.<br><br>if you want statistics, the total crime rate for drugs in New Zealand is 1 per 1000, and this is from New Zealand's official crime statistics. New Zealand does not practive teh Death penalty at all. Yes, i say that statistic is from the NZ GOVT, not AI!!<br><br>If only the world had more love...<br><br>the pikamaster<br></div>
