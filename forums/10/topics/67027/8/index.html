            <div class='col-md body'>There's no sense of economics in the death penalty, if economics were a concern in dealing with crime, we would find other more creative forms of punishment then locking criminals away and maintaining them with taxpayer's money.<br><br>Crime and punishment is not about money, it is about punishment.<br><br>In the end, the death penalty is a form of payment. Is is an all emcompassing solution to crime? I don't think so, but is it fair? Certainly, while I don't find it tasteful, I see the need for it as an option in our judical system. Not because it is not humanitarian or cruel, but because it is fair.<br><br>For some crimes the ultimate punishment must be used, after all, there will always be some jokers out there which consider a life in prision worth killing another person over, a life for a life.<br><br>There are some things that if we do, we jolly well accept the consquences, there's no way about it. If we deserve death, we get death. Getting freed from the death setence is not a right for us to expect or demand through our rights, but a issue of grace when it happens.</div>

I have clearly read a statement that teh Church prefers reformative punnishment to the Death Penalty. n funnily, this site is the first site i have seen that actually rejects what the famous Black-rights activist Martin luther King said.<br><br>number two, being an avid reader of C.S. Lewis, i can easily tell that the writer of the article has twisted the author's word to fit his won ends. C.S. Lewis plainly mentions in many of his poems that he opposes all forms of killing. in one of his poems, he talks about genocides in Eastern European countries and the Mock trials in Russia.<br><br>number three, European Governments are poisoned in their wells by being termed as elitist. I watched teh coverage of the Hutton Report and the parliamentary sitting before that on the BBC and there is nowhere that implies that the UK government is elitist. in fact, to me, UK is beginning to look much more democratic than the Land of the Free.<br><br>number four, the writer uses a utilitarian point to talk about unusuality, which is totally irrevelevant.<br><br>number five, even biologists and people in the law profession concede that DNA testing is not very reliable in determining a criminal. that i got at a talk i attended last year on biotech.<br><br>number six, the author uses figures for Florida to unjustify the national estimate. i also have a suspicion that he only read the results of court proceddings, and not analyzed exactly what each person said. Obviously, results would show that "not one innocent person was executed".<br><br>number six, i am certain ACLU does proper research before coming up with such data. anyway, theNew AMerican is so pro-bush that i don't think it bothers to double-check statistics released byt eh WHite House.<br><br>number seven, although its argument on teh cost could be correct, nonetheless i don't thnk that cost should even be a factor considered when one is debating on morality. Does cost decide morality?<br><br>in anutshell, it is safer not to believe the New American completely, since it is extremely biased and thus, unreliable. SO CX, try to find some more reliable sources. At least Amnesty is endorsed by the UN, and thus that loans it some credibility.<br><br>the *sighing* pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fair enough,those who kill someone deserve death penalties.But you see,when one kills someone in a road accident, he may only get fine and suspension of his driving license.Furthermore,a person kills someone due to anger,he probably won't be prosecuted for murder and so he won't get death penalty.But drug traffickers can get death penalty.Can you see all the inconsistencies of the principle?<br><br>I advocate the govt set an example to the people by not using death penalty as punishment.<br><br></div>
