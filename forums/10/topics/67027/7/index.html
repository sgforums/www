            <div class='col-md body'>This, I think is a right and wrong thing. There's a word for it, but just can't think of it now.<br><br>Yes Singapore is a place you easily die in, if you aren't careful about what crime you commit. But I think in any country, except for some states in the U.S., murder usually incurrs a death sentence. Though in all religion, taking away another's life or right to live, is WRONG, some crimes committed by some people are just not possible to forgive. As for drugs in Singapore, we all know; do the stuff, and you'll pay with your life. But I believe what erks Amnesty is the "swift" manner in which our system deal out the death sentence for drug pushers and traffickers - being that once you're caught with the offending substance, you're already half dead. I mean, there could be some shreds of evidence that a convicted trafficker is innocent to some degree, but the gravity of the penalty often hangs the party in question without much ado. This refers to the recent case of a Malaysian trafficker.<br><br>However, the warning were clear about drugs, maurders, and kidnappings. But if people dare risk the act, then they should be prepared to die.<br><br>Personally though, I think to kill one for the killing of another, doesn't make up for the wrong that was done. To me, it just creates another wrong. The law says it is VERY WRONG to take another's life, but it goes ahead and takes the life of the wrong-doer. Somewhat contradicting it seems, but I know if I were the next of kin of the murdered victim, I'd want to kill the bastard too... ( ! ) sheesh<br></div>

There's a word for it, but just can't think of it now.<br><br>Yes Singapore is a place you easily die in, if you aren't careful about what crime you commit. But I think in any country, except for some states in the U.S., murder usually incurrs a death sentence. Though in all religion, taking away another's life or right to live, is WRONG, some crimes committed by some people are just not possible to forgive. As for drugs in Singapore, we all know; do the stuff, and you'll pay with your life. But I believe what erks Amnesty is the "swift" manner in which our system deal out the death sentence for drug pushers and traffickers - being that once you're caught with the offending substance, you're already half dead. I mean, there could be some shreds of evidence that a convicted trafficker is innocent to some degree, but the gravity of the penalty often hangs the party in question without much ado. This refers to the recent case of a Malaysian trafficker.<br><br>However, the warning were clear about drugs, maurders, and kidnappings. But if people dare risk the act, then they should be prepared to die.<br><br>Personally though, I think to kill one for the killing of another, doesn't make up for the wrong that was done. To me, it just creates another wrong. The law says it is VERY WRONG to take another's life, but it goes ahead and takes the life of the wrong-doer. Somewhat contradicting it seems, but I know if I were the next of kin of the murdered victim, I'd want to kill the bastard too...

Even Amnesty International dislikes murderers for their violating of human right to life i.e. killings. AI has remined USA and countries like Mexico and Congo to step up measures capturing serial murderers and pple involved in homicides. the major contention is the manner of punnishment, not whether or not the murderer ought to be punnished.</div>
