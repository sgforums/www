"humane" punishment? please... call a noose a noose.<br><br><blockquote>and, do you know the song, "Heal teh World"? I think it is a good song, whether or n0ot the singer is now in jail or not. You should download it and listen. There is much injustice in the world. We must strive our best to remove it.</blockquote>i know the singer's a suspected child molester. won't even go into the legality of downloading music...<br><br>"remove injustice" ... and what is justice to you? a state of affairs where a convicted murderer escapes corporal punishment isn't justice to me.<br><br>if we're afraid that we might've gotten the wrong guy, then like i said before, it makes it all the more important that police work be effectively undertaken. nothing is foolproof. would u put your arm in a cast just 'cos u cut your finger? and u want to remove the death penalty and replace it with something that has no deterrent value, no certainty of success and very likely, serve no purpose other than to ease a few bleeding hearts' conscience? i'm not buying that...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"> <span class="large">Immigration Act:</span> </span> <span style="color: red;">Guilty unless proven innocent </span></strong><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><span class="small">Straits Times. April 7, 2000<br>By TAN OOI BOON</span><br><br>THE Immigration Act, which deals with the crime of harbouring and employing illegal immigrants, is tough because it presumes that an accused is already guilty unless he proves that he is innocent.<br><br>This is contrary to the criminal-law principle, which states that a person is normally presumed innocent unless proven guilty.<br><br>Such legal presumption is also applied to other laws. In the Misuse of Drugs Act, a person is presumed to be a trafficker if he is caught with the equivalent of 2 g of pure heroin or more.<br><br>In immigration cases, once an illegal immigrant is caught staying in a flat, the owner is deemed to have harboured the immigrant knowing that the tenant has no entry permit.<br><br>In previous cases, Chief Justice Yong Pung How had said that for the owner to prove his innocence, he had to show that he had actually checked the tenant's documents diligently.<br><br>This includes examining the tenants' passports and comparing the particulars with their work permits. The owners must also check with the tenants' employers if the documents are in order.<br><br>If such checks are carried out, lawyers say, the courts are less likely to find the owners guilty as they would have rebutted the presumption. "Even if the documents later turn out to be fake ones, the owners can escape if they have done the necessary checks because it could be that the forgery is so good that even the employers are fooled," said a lawyer.<br><br>But he noted that in most cases, the offenders either did not check the documents at all or conducted only a cursory check.<br><br>CJ Yong has ruled that when employers or landlords make such checks, they must verify the documents personally and cannot ask others, such as employees or housing agents, to do it on their behalf.<br><br>If they are caught, they will go to jail, not the negligent employee or agent.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000407s1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000407s1.htm</a><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Sorry, you must go to jail: Judge to deacon </span></span></strong><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><span class="small">Straits Times. April 7, 2000<br>By ELENA CHONG</span><br>Mandatory penalty means deacon can't be spared jail even though he rented flat to illegal immigrants unwittingly<br><br>VERY sorry, but nothing can be done. You have to go to jail.<br><br>This was Chief Justice Yong Pung How's message yesterday to a church deacon who had broken Singapore's tough laws on harbouring illegal immigrants.<br><br>A jail term is mandatory, and the minimum period is six months.<br><br>Seow Boon Wah, 43, from the Baptist Fellowship Church in Serangoon Gardens, had rented out a flat in Tiong Bahru to immigration offenders unwittingly.<br><br>Last October, a district court heard that in March last year, he had used a housing agent, Mr Desmond Chia, to get three tenants for his mother's flat in Bo Bo Tan Gardens in Chay Yan Street.<br><br>He had then met the trio and Mr Chia had asked for their permits. One of the would-be tenants showed a high-quality forged work permit; the other, an employment pass without a photograph; and the third, a valid pass without a photograph.<br><br>In April, when Seow went to collect rent, he was handed photocopies of two work permits, which he glanced at before leaving.<br><br>When the flat was raided in May, the immigration offenders were arrested.<br><br>Seow, who has three children, was convicted in November of harbouring them and sentenced to seven months' jail.<br><br>In appealing against both the conviction and sentence, Seow's lawyer, Mr Kirpal Singh, said a proper tenancy agreement had been signed.<br><br>But the CJ felt this was irrelevant: "The main point is -- was there sufficient diligence in determining the characters of the tenants?<br><br>"That is the entire case. Parliament has been very strict on this."<br><br>For instance, people must make several checks on prospective tenants, such as their original passes or permits -- these must be genuine and must be compared with their passports.<br><br>The would-be tenants' employers and the authorities must also be contacted for checks.<br><br>In Seow's case, he checked only the permit and passes.<br><br>"I think it is necessary for them to show that they took every precaution," said the CJ.<br><br>"I know it is very very strict. It pains me to have to dismiss the appeal on this basis, but the law there is so strict."<br><br>He noted that once someone employs or shelters an immigration offender, he would have to go to "the ends of the earth" to prove his innocence.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"> "There is almost absolute liability. The law is so strict. I feel sorry for the people who are charged and convicted," </span>he said. </strong><br><br>Mr Kirpal Singh said that in Seow's case, there were no aggravating factors to justify seven months' jail.<br><br>But the CJ said that unless it was "manifestly excessive", he could not cut it to six months.<br><br>"I will make myself a laughing stock. I am very sorry," he said.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000407st.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000407st.htm</a><br><br></div>

Both girls denied any prior knowledge of the drugs and said they had been befriended by a Chinese couple in Bangkok who had taken them out to dinner and on sightseeing tours, and later bought suitcases for them. "My sister is a simple and naÃ¯ve girl who can do foolish things sometimes", Poon Yuen-chung's sister later told the Sunday Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper.

In fact, this is one of the main aims of the UN. the UN would NEVER have been formed if nobody believed in teh concept of making an unfair world fairer, and that is also the premise for the UDHR.<br><br>Old food stinks, and from the look of it, rottting bread stinks the most!<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>ever wonder where the traffickers would go after they're released?<br>most probably not to mac'donalds to work, what do you think are the chances of them going back to the same trade. since you have people who knows how strict singapore is and still wants to attempt this sort of stuff, there isn't really any reason not to hang them, since they cant control their own desire, why not we "control" it for them with death.<br>since you know the risk<br>you should pay the price<br><br>and as for catching druglords, if they would be that easy to catch they wouldn't have become druglords, all they would be are henchmen<br></blockquote>it seems to be human nature to take the easy way out. As many prominent parties have pointed out, there is sth called reformative therapy, which nobody seems to take. Earlier in this thread, when i tried to suggest a method, i was laughed at and mocked at...but funnily nobody went on to suggest another method. Instead, all of you conservatives zoomed straight back at bootlicking the Death penalty.<br><br>Anyway, like I said before, the druglords don't care a hoot about their henchmen, but they DO care about their drugs. So you hurt them as long as you take away their source of revenue. Whether you kill the henchmen or not is of no concern and probably won't raise any alarm bells in the Druglord.<br><br>Of course, it is not easy to catch the druglord. But that's the point of the police right? TO protect national security, no matter how hard it is to protect? SO the police should be responsible for hunting down the druglord.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

How does one become an alcoholic? He/she becomes addicted to alcohol. Yes, you can say tha toriginally, it is he'she who wants to consume large amounts of alcohol and so on, but eventually ADDICTION IS NEVER BY CHOICE! they go right back to it, because the urge for teh drugs is too strong for their will to overcome. Since you like focusing on the general thing, i'll tell you that addiction is a demon that posseses a person (I read that out from a book) and possession is never by choice.
