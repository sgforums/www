            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Mr Y.K. Tan, managing director of Kenyon Engineering, said he hired a fresh engineering graduate as a 'worker' last year. His responsibilities? To pull cables on site projects on a starting pay of $900 a month.<br><br>But after five months of doing menial work and proving his worth, the employee has now been promoted to engineer.<br><br>His pay has also jumped to $2,100 a month.<br><br>As fresh graduates lack the working experience, Mr Tan said that it is best if they are trained at lower wages, and see if they are up to the job.<br><br>He received applications from some fresh graduates who are asking for $2,400 to $2,600 as monthly starting pay.<br><br>'These go straight into the wastepaper basket,' he said, as it is not realistic.<br><br>He pointed out that since the Asian financial crisis in 1998, pay packets are 30 per cent lower now - following the constricting job market for graduates.</blockquote>I read with amusement especially the opinion stated by this YK Tan from Kenyon Engr.

There is no such labor law in Singapore, which only confirm that an employee is entitled to seven working days of leave annually, with full pay.<br><br>On the point of Petroleum Companies, not all workers are highly technically qualified to qualify for the high salary paid by Petroleum Companies.<br><br>The Accounts Clerks in a Petroleum Company are known to be better paid when compared to their peers in other sectors of the economy.<br><br>For the same jobs done in other sectors of the economy, the Petroleum Company will pay twice or three times as much as other companies, even bonuses are paid three to four times more.<br><br>This is due to the high turnover and high profit margins that the Petroleum Company is able to achieve from an essential commodity sold to the public.<br><br>Not all small companies are necessarily profitable.<br><br>Some remain small, due to their lack of capital, and due to the product type handles, which has a limited niche market that affect the size of turnover or volume of sales value.<br><br>Certainly, it is not correct that a Local Company should treat its Employees any worse.<br><br>Then again, it is an open market of Supply and Demand of a limited pool of labor.
