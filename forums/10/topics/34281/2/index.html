But what I meant was that I believe the manager employed the $900 engineer with the intent to exploit the weak economy as well as the desperation of the poor chap. Had he done such a thing in the past when the economy is good, then that would be a different story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  If you want to bring up the supply and demand stuff again, I will rest my case.</div>
