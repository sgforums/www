The quran never stated anything about killing an apostate. This law is made by a government and can be changed by the government. Time has changed and so should the law.<br><br>But that doesn't mean I want the law to be abolished. Remember, being a muslim is like being a countrymen. And by wanting to leave the country is still an act of treason and will set a bad example to the community. Thus I would like to see the law remain but the punishment to change.
