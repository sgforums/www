It is also the parents' duty to protect their children, against bad influence of the society. And these are done out of love for their children, never to be claimed as the right of the parents!<br><br>But even in the barbaric society, the parents also teach their children, how to hunt, how to kill. So what makes us different is what we teach our children.<br><br>We teach them to love as we love them, we teach them to respect as we respect them and others. No christians, nor buddhists, nor hindi, nor Taoists, teach their children to embrace their religions or else they would end up like some muslims who became terrorists and blow themselves up into pieces. We teach our children our religious belief for what are taught in the Bible, by the monks or the respective prophets, never by running down, or misquote the other religions. If islam is truth because other religions are superficial, then islam is hypocritical. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>We teach our children so that they will grow up respecting the secular laws, but also to be aware in case some secular laws are bad laws. We never use secular laws to enforce compliance in our families.</div>

This was how Justice Richard Malanjum described the insistence of the National Registration Department (NRD) for Lina Joy to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Federal Territory Syariah Court or any Islamic authority.<br><br>The Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak said that under applicable law, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Syariah Court in the Federal Territory has no statutory power to adjudicate on the issue of apostasy</span></strong>.<br><br>Â“<strong>The (NRD) insistence is unreasonable for it requires an act that is almost impossible to perform</strong>,Â” he said.<br><br>Justice Malanjum alleged that NRDÂ’s unreasonableness would have consequential effects in some states where apostasy is a criminal offence.<br><br>Â“<strong>Hence, to expect the appellant (Lina) to apply for a certificate of apostasy Â– when to do so would likely expose her to a range of offences under the Islamic law Â– is, in my view, unreasonable</strong>.Â”<br><br>Disagreeing with the Court of AppealÂ’s majority judgment, he said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it completely disregarded the fact that Lina had made several applications for a change of name</span>.</strong> Therefore, it should be regarded as a continuing act.<br><br>He said to confine the matter to LinaÂ’s third application was completely ignoring her dealings with the NRD.<br><br>He agreed with submissions by LinaÂ’s counsel that if the NRD had correctly acted on her choice of religion for a replacement identity card (in October 1999) instead of rejecting it on the grounds she had not produced a certificate of apostasy, there would have been no necessity for the last application to correct the particulars as regards to entry of Â“religion.Â”<br><br>Others reasons stated by Justice Malanjum include:<br><br>&gt; <strong>NRDÂ’s implementation of its policy has a bearing on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">LinaÂ’s fundamental constitution right to freedom of religion under Article 11 of the Federal Constitution</span></strong>.<br><br>&gt; <strong>NRD director-general was wrong in stating that apostasy was exclusively within the realm of the Syariah Court as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">apostasy involves complex questions of constitutional importance</span></strong><br></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>continue below</strong></span><br><br></div>

Sorry, just had to rant that out.<br><br>Sure you've found out Islam is the truth, but I find it uneccessary you had to polarize the abrahamic religions, east and west, secular and religious world into good versus bad. Did not your Quran say monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques are all where God's name are abudantly extolled? Did not your Quran say look not to the east or west, wherever you turn to, there is the face of God? And did not your prophet say to seek knowledge, even as far as to China and China is a secular buddhist/taoist country?<br><br>So I find that the multifariousness of the world is a natural thing, nothing to be disdainful of. That is why some religions insist on going a pilgrimage. Its to stop being only a village idiot and find how one can relate to the world, not to hold off the "Others" on unfounded fears.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Siti Fatimah married her husband according to Hindu rites and got into trouble. She was  detained and sent for religious counselling in a rehabilitation center. Her baby daughter was taken away from her husband and handed to a Muslim relative to raise her as a Muslim.<br><br>A short article on interfaith marriage according to Islam.<br><br>As far as the interfaith marriages are concerned, Islam does not encourage them. The general rule of Islam is that Muslims should marry Muslims. A Muslim male or female should not marry a non-Muslim male or female. (al-Baqarah 2:221). The only exception is given to Muslim men who are allowed to marry the girls from among the People of the Book (al-MaÂ’idah 5:5), but Muslim women are not given this permission. So it is Haram (forbidden) for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man. This is the law of God and a Muslim when he or she learns about a law of God and His Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) should only say, Â“I hear and I obey.Â”<br>(Note: People of the Book Â– Christians and Jews)<br><br>HereÂ’s a commentary on interfaith marriages in Islam.<br><br>By Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi<br>For the satisfaction of your heart, let me explain why Muslim men are allowed to marry women from among the People of the Book and why Muslim women are not allowed to do so. First of all, it is not an honor or a privilege to marry a non-Muslim. It is a burden and a big responsibility. It is better to abstain from such marriages. Muslim men who are living in non-Muslim countries in particular should not marry non-Muslim women. However, man being the head of his household is more capable to handle the needs and problems of his non-Muslim (Christian or Jewish) wife. Muslims believe that Moses and Jesus were prophets of God and so they give them full honor and respect. Jews and Christians do not consider Prophet Muhammad as the prophet of God. Thus they are unable to give the same respect and honor to him and to his followers. A Jewish or Christian woman with a Muslim husband will be in a much better position than a Muslim woman with a Jewish or Christian husband will.<br><br>Even then, there are many non-Muslim women who married outside their faith say that they wish their religion too had forbidden them, because they know how difficult and hard it is to be the wife of a husband who has a different faith.<br><br>A Muslim woman should know that God has really honored her and made it easy for her by not allowing her to marry a non-Muslim man. According to the QurÂ’an, the husband is the head of his household, his wife should obey him. God does not to put the Muslim woman in a position that a non-Muslim become her head in her own private life. God has spared her from being under the authority of a non-Muslim husband.<br>Please abandon the idea of marrying a non-Muslim, unless he truly accepts Islam. If you(Muslim woman) marry a non-Muslim, this will be a major sin. You will be living in sin and your relationship with that non-Muslim will be illegitimate in the eyes of God. May God protect you from all sins.<br><br></div>
