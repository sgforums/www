Allah addressing the Prophet says: Â“...and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs. And...when thou art resolved, then put thy trust in AllahÂ” [22].<br><br>Since the principle of mutual consultation (Â“shuraÂ”) is mandatory [23], it is a MuslimÂ’s fundamental right, as well as responsibility, to participate in as many aspects of the communityÂ’s life as possible. The QurÂ’anic proclamation in Surah 2: Al-Baqarah: 256, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: red;">Â“There shall be no coercion in matters of faithÂ” [24] guarantees freedom of religion and worship</span></strong></span><span style="color: darkgreen;">. This means that, according to QurÂ’anic teaching, non-Muslims living in Muslim territories should have the freedom to follow their own faith-traditions without fear or harassment. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">A number of QurÂ’anic passages state clearly that the responsibility of the Prophet Muhammad is to communicate the message of God and not to compel anyone to believe [25]. The right to exercise free choice in matters of belief is unambiguously endorsed by the QurÂ’an [26] which also states clearly that God will judge human beings not on the basis of what they profess but on the basis of their belief and righteous conduct</span></strong></span>, as indicated by Surah 2: Al-Baqarah: 62 which says:<br><br>Those who believe (in the QurÂ’an) And those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), And the Christians and the Sabians, Any who believe in God And the Last Day, And work righteousness, Shall have their reward With the Lord: on them Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<br><br>The QurÂ’an recognizes the right to religious freedom not only in the case of other believers in God, but also in the case of not-believers in God (if they are not aggressing upon Muslims) [27].<br><br>In the context of the human right to exercise religious freedom, it is important to mention that the QurÂ’anic dictum, <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Let there be no compulsion in religionÂ”</span></strong></span> [28] <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">applies not only to non- Muslims but also to Muslims</span></strong></span><span style="color: darkgreen;">. While those who renounced Islam after professing it and then engaged in Â“acts of warÂ” against Muslims were to be treated as enemies and aggressors,</span> <span style="color: red;">the QurÂ’an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not prescribe any punishment</span></strong> for non-profession or renunciation of faith. The decision regarding a personÂ’s ultimate destiny in the hereafter rests with God.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;">The right to freedom includes the right to be free to tell the truth. The QurÂ’anic term for truth is Â“HaqqÂ” which is also one of GodÂ’s most important attributes. Standing up for the truth is a right and a responsibility which a Muslim may not disclaim even in the face of the greatest danger or difficulty While the QurÂ’an commands believers to testify to the truth, it also instructs society not to harm persons so testifying [29]. </span></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>continue below</strong></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zulkiflim, please do not bring your islam apologetics here and try to prove a point that Christianity is false and Islam is the truth. You even dare to make comparison of the bible and say it contradicts with one another!<br><br>You want to know the real truth? Well since you started all this, I will continue too!<br><br>Your religion is started by a madman! Who thinks he met with "angel gabriel" who out of his holy attributes, shows anger and stupidity by shaking muhammad heavily and don't even know muhammad can't read! Is anger part of devil or angel attributes? And what on earth is muhammad doing in a cave for days for? Is it a norm to go away for days in caves and leave the poor rich wife alone??<br><br>Remember after he ran out of the cave feeling scared and stuffs, he didnt told khadijah his wife what happen. It was his wife who saw him in the state and immediately say, he is a chosen prophet!! Then he is committed to start a new career for himself!!<br><br>Not forgetting he looted caravans, and wage wars with nations proclaiming, Allah has set the spoils of wars as booty for the invasion!!<br><br>Your dearly prophet has kept slaves, a murderer who assign people to kill his opposition, a lustful womanizer, a pedophile and a very good war general no doubt.<br><br>Its also convenient for Allah, to replace, Jesus(Isa) with another man to die and bring Isa up to heavens, while this self proclaimed favourite of Allah died in the hands of a jewish woman!???<br><br>And lets talk about the satanic verses... He received "wisdom" from Allah, and said that, You can worship *** and ** and *** ( i forgot the names) as intercessors to Allah.....<br><br>And thus, the pagans around Arabia were happy that they can still worship the old idols! And when muhammad realised that it contradicts his ONE GOD POLICY religion, he retracted the verses and say, IT WAS THE DEVIL WHO SPOKE THE VOICES TO ME. WTF!? And can you actually trust the entire quran is the word of allah?? Of cos you can... why? Because the Quran says so....<br><br>I do agree Islam has fine and good teachings in it... But I do not agree with the founder and prophet of Islam....His characteristics defied prophets attribute....<br><br>Heck, thank god i left Islam!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
