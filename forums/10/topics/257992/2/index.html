Why do people who find it difficult to understand a single volume of God's revelation feel it necessary to refer to 50 volumes of hadith books for clarification! Would God reveal a message so difficult to understand, yet expect people to follow it? This does not make sense.<br><br>So do not attempt to study the hadith on your own. It is almost impossible for anyone to go through all the books of hadith without getting confused and totally lost. Ask for guidance from a Muslim scholar.<br></div></blockquote>I am speaking from a Jewish point of view. I presume they work on the same premises?<br><br>Actually Allah revealed the Quran to a selected group of people, not the whole world. The Quran is meant to be interpreted with the Hadith.<br><br>The Hadith could be more cryptic than the Quran.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Catholic Christianity and Islam are not the oldest faiths in the history of mankind. The oldest practising faith should be Judaism. And Judaism does not encourage conversion of the spouse. The biblical precedent would be the case of Naomi who married an Israelite. When her husband died, the mother-in-law tried to discourage her from joining the ranks of Judaism.<br><br>2. While the offsprings are baptised as Catholics (I'm not sure whether this is compulsory or not), it does not mean they are Catholics when baptised.
