            <div class='col-md body'>The Muslims in Singapore enjoy more religious freedom. They can smoke and drink if they want to. There are a few(mostly young) who renounce Islam and were disowned by their parents. So they seek refuge in sanctuaries.<br>I personally know of two Muslim ex-colleagues, one renounce Islam so that he can marry a childhood sweetheart whoÂ’s a Christian. His parents mustÂ’ve been disappointed but did not disapprove.The other one loves cha siew bao.<br><br>I remember one article in the Malaysian newspaper mentioned that more than a hundred thousand Malaysians have renounced their Muslim faith. However they would not go to the Syariah court. They know that they would be sent for repentence classes. And if they refused, they would be charged with contempt of the Syariah court and be sent to religious rehab camps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Punishment for Apostasy Â– Quran and Hadith<br><br>The hadith prescribes the death penalty for apostasy.<br><strong>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 260:<br>"If anyone leaves his religion, then kill him."</strong><br><br>Quran, on the other hand, makes no provision for the killing of apostates.<br><strong>Quran 2:256 affirms complete freedom of religious belief:<br>"There shall be no compulsion in religion ..."</strong><br><br>God is willing to welcome an apostate back into his fold if he(apostate) repents and seeks forgiveness.<br><strong>[Quran 3:89] Â“Except those who repent after that and amend, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.Â”</strong><br><br>This is understandable. Surely God will say Â“the heck with youÂ” but it's not a death penalty. The apostate can seek solace and santuary in another religion.<br><strong>[Quran 4:137] Â“Surely (as for) those who believe then disbelieve, again believe and again disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them nor guide them in the (right) path.Â”</strong><br><br>Some say we need the hadith to explain the Quran because the Quran is too difficult to understand. Why do people who find it difficult to understand a single volume of God's revelation feel it necessary to refer to 50 volumes of hadith books for clarification! Would God reveal a message so difficult to understand, yet expect people to follow it? This does not make sense.<br><br>So do not attempt to study the hadith on your own. It is almost impossible for anyone to go through all the books of hadith without getting confused and totally lost. Ask for guidance from a Muslim scholar.<br></div>

So they view people who convert out not as making any choice but as making a mistake that they must be rescued from. For them there is no question or choice about it... you are a muslim from the day you are born until they day you die no matter what you do.<br><br>That's why they are far less chin chai about people converting out, and if you scale this up to the national policy level... well then here you go.</div></blockquote>The only thing is that each one of us is born as a Human Being first rather than a muslim or christian.  I can understand why if one person adopted muslim it cannot change because it is a betray to the Almighty, Similarly to christian but i think faith is an important decision that each one of us have to made that spritual connection, and comunication.  Religion is a personal thing.  To shave it down into the throat, Religion don't work that way.</div>

Present day skeptics will view the Pope in those ages as a 'WARLORD'. Is it any surprise that it can come full circle, with islamic fundamentalists being branished as 'WARMONGERS', being labelled as the founders of modern day terrorism.<br><br>To a certain extent, the current war on terrorism could subtly be termed the modern day 'crusade'.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is growing sentiments in the religion that it is fundamentally fawed.<br>That it is up held by fear, peer pressure and draconian measures and blind obedience. And is protected by legislation, apleasement and common courtesy of the non followers. Belief of its divine source is eroding.<br>It has cult characteristic. Fear and political clout is its underlying principle. Not fear of God or compassion. The innocent sheep in their midst fooled us all, and blind us to the political agendas of the teachers.<br><br>The communist attempt at world domination through imporvished workers is over. We  are now facing the same threat all over again. World domination through religion. And another round or suppression, persecution and anhilation.<br>Sheez!<br>Hopefully common sense will prevail and all these averted.</div>
