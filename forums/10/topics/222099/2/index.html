Let's re-examine it carefully:<br><br><blockquote><br>If you are working for Nokia, won't it further your purpose if you claim that Nokia is a better product as compared to another product. As opposed to a man on the street who claims that Nokia is a better phone, the man on the street has no benefits from making that claim.</blockquote>You said that if a man works for Nokia, he will say that Nokia phones are good since it will further his purpose. In the next sentence, all you said was that a man on the street who claims that Nokia is better derives no benefits from doing so.<br><br>You didn't say anything about the latter's views being unbiased. So I interpreted you as saying that the man on the street can't possibly be making such a claim since it doesn't benefit him in any way - carrying the reasoning forward from the previous sentence.<br><br>This is what happens when you're vague.

It is for that reason that the WP leadership has decided to impose rules on their members posting on internet forums. They simply cannot (as past experience confirms) be certain that members of the WP will be disciplined enough not to give the party a bad name and render them liable for prosecution.<br><br>The government has been criticized for not allowing greater political freedom, but it is the critics that most strenuously seek to muzzle any views that do not agree with them.<br><br>People like the threadstarter has just proven my point time and again: Singapore is not ready for western-style democracy.</div>
