            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with fudgester, fymk and LazerLordz.  God knows I've had a few tiffs with OM, and we have certainly exchanged barbs, but it's always been in the context of some other point that we've disagreed upon.  Most of the time I'll still say he's wrong because of a lack of facts, but he does occasionally make a reasonable point.  Bashing OM for the sake of bashing him, instead of taking him on his arguments, really serves no purpose at all.</div>
