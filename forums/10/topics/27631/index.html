            <div class='col-md body'>be that as it may, such aggressive posturing really doesn't help them achieve any of their aims other than to piss Sg off...<br><br>even if they're right about newater, that Sg is not yet self sufficient yet and it just might be their last chance, so what?<br><br>do they intend to <strong>NOT</strong> honour the agreement before the first one expires in 2011? i don't think thats an option. u cut the water before the agreement's due, u burn in hell... thats always been Sg's position regarding this.<br><br>do they <strong>REALLY</strong> wanna bring in a third party for arbitration?<br>legally, they're almost sure to lose. Sg has got all its facts right, but who knows... this whole issue might just get tied in with this war on terrorism and they might get one up just so that Bush can retain a moderate muslim ally.<br><br>and even if it doesn't get tied in with any other issues, arbitration is a notoriously slow way to settle a pressing issue... quite DuH really to even suggest that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the key contentious issue is the words...<br><br>AFTER 25 years.<br><br>singapore's position is that after 25 years... means the immediate year after the 25th year.. that is the one year time frame after the 25 year since the agreedment was sign... and not beyond.... and certainly NOT happy happy any dumb dumb year they want...<br><br>malaysia's position is that after 25 years... means ANY year they want after 25 years... that is to say... they can choose to negotiate the price of the water at any year after the 25th year... be it 30 or 40 or 50 years since the agreedment....<br><br>singapore's position is however... IF malaysia wanna negotiate the price.. it should have done so within the immediate year after the 25th year,.... BUT if malaysia dont want to do so within that year... IT should get singapore's permission FIRST.... to negotiate the price at a later time... rather than simply choose whenever it likes to negotiate a price without singapore's official acceptance...<br><br>the words of the terms is most telling.. and i must say.. favor singapore's position....<br><br>AFTER 25 years.... is NOT the same as <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>ANY YEAR </strong></span>AFTER 25 years....<br><br>that 2 words in bold and italic up there is damn important in legal argument...<br><br>to renegotiate after 25 years means negotiation must be done on the 26th year...<br><br>to renegotiate ANY YEAR after 25 years... would mean a totally different thing....<br><br>I think maharaja needs to go back to school and restudy his ang mo.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got this from the malaysian catcha site, it's post by a Singapore Forummer:<br><br><strong><br>BY: andygan168 ,Posted:2002-09-15 15:41:15 catcha.com.my<br><br>Everyone,<br><br>I am a Singaporean, but I have relatives that are citizens of many countries (including Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, USA, China, Taiwan, Thailand, France, London, Australia, Sweden, Canada)... just to name a few.<br><br>And half of my colleagues are Malaysian, and they are as technically competent and capable as Singaporeans, if not better.<br><br>In fact, one of my Malaysian relative is a secretary general of a branch office of MCA in a particular state. And one of my relative in Singapore was an opposition MP, and one of my cousin was the classmate of the ruling Lee family in Singapore. So you see, I am not taking sides with this posting.<br><br>So please do not take offence if I happen to quote a few facts that MAY offend Malaysians &amp; Singaporeans (including my relatives). I humbly request anyone to correct my mistakes and calculations if any, so as to have a meaningful discussion.<br><br>I hope rational Singaporeans forumers will not take the facts here to shoot and insult the Malaysian forumers.<br><br>If any forumers wish to argue just to win without concise facts and figures, please go ahead because I will not respond, I will simply let you "win" the argument.<br><br>FACTS AND FIGURES OBTAINED FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE CAUSEWAY<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>1) All agreements (Water Pact, Points of Agreement on RTM land in Singapore etc) are meant to be binding. Breaches of agreement comes with damages and compensation, and that is a fact, unless both parties come to an amicable solution. The Points of Agreement (POA) on RTM land was legally binding (i.e. RTM must move the CIQ, and train station to either Bukit Timah or Kranji) by 1997 or 1998 (correct me if I am wrong here), otherwise Singapore can demand compensation and damages. Being a neighbour (good or bad, depending on your percption), Singapore withhold the right (but not relinquishing the right for damages) for compensation instead opting to discuss the POA together with the Water Agreements as a package.<br><br>2) Every countries &amp; persons do things for their self-interest, however big or small they are (look at the biggest thug in the world - USA). So it is part &amp; parcel of negotiation tactics (just read any book on negotiation tactics), to use just about everything to off-balance and "win" the negotiation (e.g. NeWater, ToiletWater, Pee-Water). So all the "heated" messages in the newspapers in both countries are normal (although it would seem Malaysian papers are more "heated" than Singapore papers, because I read papers from both sides).<br><br>3) That brings us to rationality of argument put forth by forumers and editors of newspapers in both countries. Some has political agendas to advance their parties or patrons, or just to simply boost the sales of their papers. Therefore all "hot" topics are fair game. Some editors may just "hate" the other side for some unknown or historical reasons, and will therefore write unfair or wrong things (intentionally or otherwise) just to "inflame" emotions.<br><br>4) Here are the details and facts:<br>a) Singapore buy raw water from Johor at MYR$0.03 per thousand gallon<br>b) Singapore treats the raw water at MYR$2.40 per thousand gallon in Johor with treatment plants build by Singapore with Singaporean tax-payers money. This includes the building of dams to hold back water into a reservoir and pipelines to Singapore and Johor distribution points.<br>c) Singapore pipes the treated water to Johor and back to Singapore.<br>d) Singapore makes a huge loss of MYR$1.90 per thousand gallon of treated water sold to Johor, because Johor buys at only MYR$0.50 per thousand gallon. In effect, Singapore subsidises Johoreans drinking water. But it is OK with us since many Johoreans work and study in Singapore and Singaporeans like to shop and dine in Johor.<br>e) Johor buys about 37 million gallons of treated water per day from Singapore (20 million gallons above the limit as stated in the Water Agreements). The 37 million gallons of treated water a day costs Singapore tax-payers about MYR$70,300 per day to subsidise.<br>f) Johor buys the treated water at MYR$0.50 per thousand gallon, meaning Singapore receives from Johor MYR$18,500 per day for buying of treated water.<br>g) Singapore is already being a good neighbour by allowing Malaysia to buy an extra 20 million gallons (i.e. 37 million gallons) of treated water per day (well above the 17 million gallons stated in the Water Agreements) out of goodwill and reasons stated in (4e). So therefore do not accuse Singapore of always following by the book.<br>h) Johor resells the treated water to Johoreans at MYR$3.95 per thousand gallon. In effect, Johor government "earns" from Johoreans MYR$127,650 per day (just by observing the Water Agreements) after deducting MYR$18,500 per day in paying Singapore for the treated water. So all the talks about Malaysia losing money selling raw water at MYR$0.03 per thousand gallon does not hold water.<br>i) Malaysia is commited to sell Singapore 350 million gallons of raw water per day, assuming Singapore buys at the legal limit, Singapore will pay about MYR$10,500 per day. In reality, Malaysia does not lose any money from selling water to Singapore (compared the numbers in 4h and 4i). Of course, MYR$10,500 is not much from today's standard of living, but imagine the same amount can do when the Water Agreements was signed long ago in 1927. The same amount invested with compounded interest could probably allow the Johor Sultan to buy back parts of Singapore everyday, until he becomes the biggest real estate owner of Singapore.<br><br>5) Here is the big picture:<br>a) Assuming Singapore buys raw water at full capacity stated in the Water Agreements for one full year, Johor gets only a meagre MYR$3.8 million per year.<br>b) Johor buys Singapore treated water at MYR$6.7 million per year.<br>c) Singapore subsidises the treated water at (i.e. at a huge loss) of MYR$25.7 million per year.<br>c) However, Johor earns from "Johoreans" at MYR$46.6 million per year, without spending a "single cent", after deducting the cost of buying treated water from Singapore.<br>d) The reason for the Malaysian government wanting to quickly revise the Water Agreements is due to the fact that Johor has built its own water treatment plant at a cost of MYR$650 million, and will be operational in 2003.<br>e) Being a Singaporean (whom my Malaysian relatives defined as calculative and opportunistic), I took out my calculator out for a quick financial analysis. At MYR$650 million building cost, Johor could actually purchase treated water from Singapore for the next 100 years without spending that money.<br>f) In fact, Johor stands to gain by not building the treatment plant, because Johor would "earn" MYR$4.66 billion from Johoreans for the next 100 years just by selling the treated water supplied by Singapore (i.e. without building its own treatment plant), assuming it buys 37 million gallons of treated water per day for the next 100 years (which is unlikely, meaning Johor will buy even more as population grows and industries expand).<br>g) Now applying the calculation in reverse, let\\'s see how much Johor will "lose" in terms of opportunity cost in building its own treatment plant. Assuming the treatment plant cost nothing to maintain per year and Johor needs to treat 37 million gallons of treated water per day at the same price as Singapore (i.e. MYR$2.40 per gallon assuming no inflation) for the next 100 years. It will cost Johor MYR$3.24 billion. If we assume Johor sells the treated water to Johoreans at MYR$3.95 per thousand gallon, Johor will "earn" only MYR$1.4 billion over 100 years after deducting the cost of building its own treatment plant. Take a breather to think how much is Singapore subsidising Johoreans for treated water if the Water Agreements last for another 100 years to the tune of MYR$2.57 billion!<br>h) Now everyone knows the true reason for wanting to revise the price Johor sells the raw water to Singapore, because Johor treatment plant will be ready for operation in 2003.<br>i) It should also be clear that why Johor did not revise the price of the raw water sold and in 1986 and 1987 as stipulated in the Water Agreements, because in doing so Singapore could also raise the price of treated water sold to Johor. This inter-dependence on each other results in Johor building its own treatment plant.<br>j) However, as shown in (5f &amp; 5g) it seems a financial mis-calculation to build the treatment plant just to revise the Water Agreements. Of course, one could argue for Johor water security and needs for treated water independence from Singapore. Similarly, Singapore could also argue for water security and needs for raw water independence from Johor to revise and extend the Water Agreements.<br>k) Take a step back and view the big picture, Johor and Singapore are dependent on each other for many things including water (yes, Johor has the edge since raw water is on their side). But so what? If Singapore needs more raw water, just buy more from Johor. If Johor needs more treated water, just buy more from Singapore. A "win-win" situation even without revising the current raw water and treated water price.<br><br>6) Conclusion:<br>a) Other than water security, inter-dependence and politics, ask yourself who has the most to gain from building and operating the treatment plants?<br>b) With the Johor treatment plants in operation, do you think the Johor government will sell treated water to Johoreans for MYR$3.95 per thousand gallons? If the Johor government wants to "reap" the same profit (i.e. MYR$4.66 billion over 100 years), the price of water sold to Johoreans will have to increase by 3 times to MYR$12 per thousand gallons.<br>c) Therefore can anyone tell me how is Johor or Malaysia losing "millions" or "billions" by selling raw water to Singapore at MYR$0.03 per thousand gallons?<br><br>Think about what I wrote and shoot sensibly.<br><br>If there is a topic on replacing the Causeway with a new Bridge, I will also give my 2 cents worth on why it MAY be bad for the Johor economy.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Adios <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></strong><br><br>Disclaimer: I shall not be liable or anything abover in bold cos that's not my opinion, it's a cut &amp; paste.<br><br>BTW: I remember the reporters asking about the treated water pricing and stuff and Dr.M decline to comment.......</div>
