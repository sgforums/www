Instead it subpass them in most aspect. Now, like Dr M advise to the world muslim to control the oil, thus, it can control the world reported in the paper early, it want to press the same tactic against this small dot that is brighter then them.<br><br>I think since there is a treaty signed till 2061, why not sit and wait till Malaysia propose to breach the treaty and get a hufty sum as compensation.

Why is that stretch of railway belongs to them? It is on our land and if they say they build that, then we shall take out the rail and give it back to them...cos must drug traffiking happened there.... and where is their police to maintenance peace and order along the rail way?</div>
