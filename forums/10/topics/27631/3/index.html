            <div class='col-md body'>I must admit that I had previously had admired Dr Mahatair of Malaysia for his leadership of his country. However, recent events (raised by Malaysia) have rather marred my previously good impression of him. However, this erroding of my confidence in this leader is not without precedent. A few years back, he ordered his own deputy, Mr Anwar to be jailed and charged with sodomy.<br><br>Although this might be to show his impartiality in dealing with things, I disagree with how that case was handled.<br><br>With Singapore, it is not dealing with an individual, but Dr Mahatair is dealing with 4 million people unified with one stand (Malaysia has no rights to review the price of the sale of raw, untreated water). It is evident in that even the opposition parties in Singapore support this stand unanimously. Mr Chiam See Tong once mentioned to the effect of "If Malaysia were to, breach the Seperation Agreement by turning the water off, it is an act of provocation, and Singapore will have the choice of retatliating to maintain the <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span>. However, as I do not remember his actual words, these were, at the very least, what the opposition MP meant.<br><br>I sincerely hope that the Malaysians will know that, Singapore is already paying for everything, including the infrastructure and treatment plants, we are currently subsidising the treated water we supply to Johor, and that the Malaysian government does not need to even fork out any capital to provide raw water.<br><br>I hope this ridiculous war of words will cease soon, and let us live as INDEPENDANT, SOVERIGN, and PEACEFUL neighbours.</div>

IT is also effectively nullifying the separation agreement??
