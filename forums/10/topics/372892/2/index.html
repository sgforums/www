              <p>Haha, all these talks about <span>SAF</span> commandos versus Gurkhas really crack me up. Gurkhas troops are known to be one of the bravest group of warriors in the world. They have very strong undying loyalty to their employers (and who ever pays them in the service of course). As such they are willingly to die in battles. Stories of their near fanatical actions in battles and wars can be found on the internet. During the malayan battle Skihs and Gurkhas soldiers are the only groups in British army Japs fear and respect. That is why many countries in the world like to employ them as mercenaries, British and American for example. Haha I would imagine how these Gurkhas would have slice off heads of these commando boys’s with their sharp Kukri and these boys fleeing behind. Btw don’t flame me I’m only a MT line <span>ORD</span> personnel.</p>

              <p>....so too was the pakistani  terrorists said to be fierce hill tribe warriors, fought with each other for centuries, later with Brits and India, and much feared. They came to Singapore on a hijacked plane in 1991, thinking Singaporeans were easy meat.</p>
              <p>But within 30secs upon entering, when most singaporeans were still asleep, it was the pakistani terrorists whom ended up on meat hooks, with courtesy by the Singaporean Commandos. All passengers on board the hijacked plane in Changi Airpot were saved, safe and sound.</p>
              <p>And this is a published fact, but then, how much more would an MT line ORD personnel be expected to know?</p>

              <p>(BTW, wasnt it the gurkhas whom were supposed to be guarding Mas Selamat when he escaped? So much for the 'sheathed kukri'. Not much use, was it? A bunch of them and couldnt even guard a lame terrorist.)</p>

              <p>knives? Remember, pal...the plane was fully loaded with highly inflammable jet fuel, the pakis had a full store of liquour and were ready to blow everyone to kingdom come, and yet those son of a bitches never had a chance to even light up a ciggie. They never even knew what hit them.</p>
              <p>All terrorists dead and every single passenger ( mostly fellow singaporeans) saved is no mean feat. In fact, no other CT team in the world had ever achieve such a record.</p>
              <p>But its ok if you dont take pride in what our men had done. They came unannounced, and disappeared unnoticed, asked for no recognition, but a job done for our people. And will do so again when the need arises, with no fanfare or accolade.</p>
              <p>These are the Singaporean Commandos, of the past, the present and the future, under an even more efficient and effective 3G military command made up of our responsible fellow citizens, male and female, NSF and NSmen combined to protect our country from harm.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Does an opportunist like LKY understand what 'Idealism' is about or can be ?</p>
              <p>It is no wonder that LKY prefer to see the Pledge as "Aspirations" and not "Idealism" as was seen by his own late colleague - S Rajaratnam.</p>

              <p>It is impressive to write in whimsical prose expressing your lofty and fluffy statement -  <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"I do honour my vow to the constitution and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">my oath to our pledge</span></span>"</em> </span>- but can we believe your honesty to keep your vow to a Constitution bastardised by the PAP, when you had also expressed your ability <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"to comprehend cold harsh realities from pure idealism in our human world"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we believe that you will give up your life to defend pure idealism ?</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten your position in agreeing with LKY that the Pledge was a mere "Aspiration" ?</p>
              <p>Would you honor your vow to a bastardised Singapore Constitution and to uphold a Pledge that you have agreed with MM LKY position that it is a mere "Aspiration" ?</p>
              <p>Or should we expect your pragmatism to come into play to modify your "aspiration" in response to new found realities as you had so eloquently stated ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> Is it not ironical that you will abandon your failed positions taken in the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/372615?page=5">‘Singapore Pledge is only an aspiration’ </a>- and will continue with your fraudulent efforts at being a bard with little to show from your own other than to imitate and plagiarise the ancient style of someone from the past ?</p>

              <p>Your continued story telling effort that is filled with all the fluff, make it sound quite impossible to believe that within 30 seconds of entering the hijacked SQ117 these Pakistanis had ended up on <strong>meat hooks</strong> (??? - where did you get this imaginative thought from ???).</p>
              <p>After an entire night of failed negotiations, in which the hijackers demanded to speak to then Pakistani Prime Minister Mdm Benazir Buhtto - who refused to take the calls - the hijackers issued a final ultimatum at <strong>06.45Hrs</strong> to kill one of the passengers.</p>
              <p>The SAF Commandos swung into action in a 30 seconds sweep and by <strong>06.50hrs</strong> they declared the plane secured.</p>
              <p>The SAF Commandos was a convenient unit to conceal the actual unit that took out the hijackers, and it was eventually revealed that the unit was a classified newly set up SAF Special Operations Force trained as an elite counter-terrorism, special reconnaissance and operations unit.</p>

              <p>All through the centuries of British military relationship with the Gurkhas, have they used the Gurkhas as "War Dogs" or as "Watch Dogs" ?</p>
              <p>As much as it was the mistakes made by a low IQ guard, who was outwitted by a more desperate, determined and cunning Mas Selamat Kastari, the mistake also lay with the chain of command that applied the services of the Gurkha poorly and wrongly.</p>

They were about 10 yards away when the Indonesian sentry opened fire, wounding one of the Gurkhas and alerting the rest of the platoon. Seeing the danger that they were in, Rambahadur Limbu rushed the machine gun and destroyed it with a grenade. Alerted, the rest of the Indonesian platoon began to fire on the forward pit, thus making it an untenable position from which to provide support for the company attack. In order to report this fact to his platoon commander, Limbu exposed himself to enemy fire before returning to pull two of his wounded comrades to safety. An hour long fire-fight followed which has since become known as the <a title="Battle of Bau" href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bau"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Battle of Bau</span></span></a>, during which the Gurkha company launched an assault on the Indonesian position.

              <p>With the alcohol readily evaporating within minutes of settling in glass or carpet, it is unlikely that the poured alochol will remain un-evaporated within minutes after pouring.</p>

              <p>For heaven sake, the amateur Pakistani hijackers had armed themselves with the steel cutlery that were commonly issued with the inflight meals - (after this incident, all meals were served with plastic cutlery).</p>
              <p>Their explosives consist of the liquor and alcohol that were taken from the First Class section, and the liquor and alcohol were poured all around the passenger cabin. </p>
              <p>Was it effective in any way ? </p>
              <p>With the alcohol readily evaporating within minutes of settling in glass or carpet, it is unlikely that the poured alochol will remain un-evaporated within minutes after pouring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The success was due as much to the hijackers of SQ117 who were all amateurs at hijacking, with none of them being muscular, agile, or tough - in fact all were chubby.</p>
              <p>Armed with only the inflight service cutlery knives, and without any explosives or automatic rifles or even pistols - the four hijackers were doomed from the start.</p>
              <p>None of the hijacked planes in the world had the good fortune of the SIA pilot being able to speak in dialect and getting accurate information of the situation in the plane  to the security team negotiating with the hijackers.</p>
              <p>With good intelligence received from the pilot of the hijacked plane, it gave new hopes for the entire operation to be a success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, these are not the Singapore SAF Commandos but an elite SAF Special Operation Force unit that is speciallised in counter terrorism activities.</p>
              <p>This Special Operation Force was "submersed" into the SAF Commando orbat for the sake of concealment, and are manned by Regular Career personnels - unlike the SAF Commando unit that is now largely manned by NSF enlistees, and regular contract Officers providing the leadership.</p>
