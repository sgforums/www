              <p><strong>The Star Online, 22 Aug 2009, Seah Chiang Nee</strong><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>PAP pondering how best to fight to stay in power<br> </strong></span></span> <br> <em><span style="color: red;">The Government appears to be
              telling young Singaporeans that if they want debate, the government
              will give it to them and if the youngsters want parliamentary
              democracy, they can have it too – but not necessarily through elections
              or a two-party system.<br> </span></em> <br> POLITICS is one of the things that have changed least in Singapore.
              Over a quarter of a century, the economy has been restructured, the
              demography has changed; new people have come and old trends have gone –
              pretty much of everything else, except perhaps politics.<br> <br> It seems to have remained relatively as it had been. For many elderly
              conservatives, that may not be a bad thing, since it also means
              stability and continuity.<br> <br> But faced with an uncertain world and a demanding new generation, the
              People’s Action Party (PAP) could be heading for a tougher time winning
              elections in future.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>As its founding leader, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan
              Yew once painted it: The next two elections should be no problem, but
              after that, anything goes.<br> </strong></span> <br> Now with the economic crisis affecting more families, the PAP has
              obviously been pondering how best to fight in order to stay in power.<br> <br> It’s a tough act as it strives to achieve a balance between rising –
              and contrasting – demands from various segments of society, from
              educated youths and disgruntled workers to poorer Singaporeans.<br> <br> For 50 years, the PAP has been winning elections to stand as one of the
              world’s few undefeated political parties, but with the help that power
              and incumbency has bestowed upon it.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>So what is its strategy to stay
              relevant? Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong apparently wants to change the
              Constitution to have a Parliament with two components.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The first is the normal 84 elected
              legislators who debate and pass laws and the second, a less
              significant, non-elected segment with watered-down rights to improve
              debate. This second force of 18 will comprise nine nominated MPs,
              chosen from a cross-section of non-partisan Singaporeans and up to nine
              non-constituency MPs (NCMPs) from the opposition camp. </strong></span>As
              an example, if the next election were to throw up only two opposition
              winners, then the best seven losers will qualify as NCMPs.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In recent weeks, the pro-government press has been
              playing up the role of nominated MPs as well as the desirability of
              appointed Cabinet ministers.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>All these have one thing in
              common. They downplay the importance of opposition parties in
              Parliament or in Singapore’s political system.</strong></span><br> <br> PAP party member Xu Kaixian wrote in Petir, the PAP organ, that democracy does not necessarily need the presence of opposition.<br> <br> “Currently, any deviation from Western-style democracy is denounced as
              authoritarian. But should that be the case?” the writer asked.<br> <br> “Wouldn’t it be better if each country practised a democracy which best
              suits its situation? Is there really a need for democracy in Singapore
              to mirror the West’s?”<br> <br> Adding to this is a suggestion by PAP backbencher Hri Kumar Nair that
              Singapore consider appointing Cabinet ministers who are not MPs or may
              not even be members of the ruling party.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Government appears to be
              telling young Singaporeans: You want debate, we’ll give it to you; you
              want Parliamentary democracy, you can have it too – but not necessarily
              through elections or a two-party system.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>It apparently thinks it can
              satisfy their aspirations for greater debate and opposition in
              Parliament – without the PAP losing any seats.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lee Kuan Yew has always been wary about the potential dangers of one-man-one-vote system. </strong></span>Last
              year he warned that “a freak election” could wipe out Singapore’s
              success. This could happen if voters became bored and decided to give
              the vociferous opposition a chance out of ‘light-heartedness,
              fickleness or sheer madness’.<br> <br> “In five years, you can ruin this place and it’s very difficult to pick up the pieces,” he said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Last November, his PM son said that a “two-party
              model cannot work” in Singapore, and it is “much better off with one
              dominant party”.<br> </strong></span> <br> Since then he has stepped back a little by saying that “Singaporeans
              want national issues to be fully debated.. (so we should) improve our
              political system to encourage a wider range of views in Parliament,
              including opposition and non-government views”.<br> <br> Lee’s measures have generally been well received as a positive development.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Critics, however, call it a sham reform that tries
              to manufacture a fake opposition, instead of freeing the environment to
              allow it to grow.<br> <br> “It is an attempt to tell Singaporeans that they could safely vote for
              the government without being deprived of an opposition voice,” an
              opposition member said.</strong></span> <br> <br> “The nature of Parliament should not be changed. It is after all a
              legislative body of representatives that should be freely elected by
              the people, not appointed, nor nominated,” he added.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>PM Lee is facing an increasing call from young Singaporeans for freer politics and lesser government controls.</strong></span> This was reflected in a speech by newly nominated MP Viswa Sadasivan,
              appealing for the government to “let us take a chance on our people, on
              ourselves.”<br> <br> He said: “In my view, it is the duty of a responsible government to
              help evolve a political climate that encourages greater interest and
              participation from the people.<br> <br> “If not, people are likely to feel increasingly alienated and
              disenfranchised resulting in apathy and, worse, cynicism. I fear this
              is already happening.”<br> <br> Balanced against this is the other point of view expressed by<strong><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Lee Kuan Yew in 2006:</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: large;">“Please don’t assume that you can change governments. Young people don’t understand this.”</span></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br> </span></span> <br> On another occasion, <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee
              said: “Without the elected President and if there is a freak (election)
              result, within two or three years, the army would have to come in and
              stop it.”</strong></span></span> So far none of the younger political leaders has repeated this warning.<br> <br> ---------------------------------<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Latest @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong></span><br> <br> 1.

              <p>i work at Joo Seng Road, just along Aljunied Road. i was from Maris Stella High, just behind Bartley and Mt. Vernon Road... where the past cemetry is...</p>
              <p>if you ask me how many Gurkhas are there in Singapore, i am not trying to scare you but i believe (based on the number of blocks and how big the size of their camp is, plus i have a colleague who used to hang around Gurkhas) there are around 10,000 of them here in Singapore. whether include family members or not, i'm not sure.</p>
              <p>when you talk about fitness, boy... ask around... i was part of Singapore 2006 when we have the World Bank having their meeting here in Suntec City. as usual, security was super tight. so of course the Army and Police were involved. coffee chat was common and i was told during those "joint" marathons annually among the uniform group, the top 3 were never Singaporeans, they were Gurkhas.</p>
              <p>if you give me the ratio of 1 commando = 100 Gurkha, *shake head* look; i know you are proud to be a commando but put a commando and a Gurkha inside a locked room, you will roughly guess which one will walk out alive. one was trained since young to literally kill... the other, hmm... spelling. i'm not putting down Singaporeans, i'm a Singaporean myself but we have to be realistic.</p>
              <p>hey, just look at that big "knife" they carry around... it was said that once that knife is drawn, it has to taste blood... be it their victim or their own.</p>

              <p>Singapore commandos are the best when they are against local army boys... okay, maybe when it comes to jungle warfare, commandos are better, afterall they are trained in the jungle and the Gurkhas are "police" at best. but when it comes to fitness, pure fitness. i dare to say, no fight. literally no fight at all.</p>
              <p>next, as police, they are trained in urban warfare... fighting in enclosed space. they are in other words, prolific in short range fighting... i mean if you want to lead a force of army personnels to fight in urban singapore, we are in a huge disadvantage. that's where U.S soldiers are struggling in Iraq. i'm not saying we won't win... we will definitely but at what cost? death ratio 50,000 against 10,000?</p>
              <p>sister, go to Joo Seng Road, PM industrial building food court during lunch time. they have young, handsome looking Gurkhas and they like Prawn Mee... don't know why...</p>

              <p>Take it easy boy. REAL Singapore commandos dont brag or advertise themselves. No need to. They are real men. The steel lies within.</p>
              <p>Heck!, you wont even know who they are in a civilian crowd. Swift, silent, efficient and deadly, they only appear when called upon in a national crisis. Other than that, you wont get to see them. Real actions speaker louder than words and more effective, as proven by them throughout our national history and into the future.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, all these talks about SAF commandos versus Gurkhas really crack me up. Gurkhas troops are known to be one of the bravest group of warriors in the world. They have very strong undying loyalty to their employers (and who ever pays them in the service of course). As such they are willingly to die in battles. Stories of their near fanatical actions in battles and wars can be found on the internet.  During the malayan battle Skihs and Gurkhas soldiers are the only groups in British army Japs fear and respect. That is why many countries in the world like to employ them as mercenaries, British and American for example. Haha I would imagine how these Gurkhas would have slice off heads of these commando boys's with their sharp Kukri and these boys fleeing behind.
