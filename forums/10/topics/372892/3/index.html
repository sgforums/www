              <p>Give the Elected President some powers in case of a "freak" election ?</p>
              <p>The Elected President was given some powers by MM LKY, but later LKY regretted that move and implemented new legislations to remove those presidential powers - as the first Elected President - the late Ong Teng Cheong - used the powers to ask for a full accounting of all the Singapore Assets that the President was supposed to look after with his 'Second Key'.</p>
              <p>Do you think that MM LKY will trust anyone with any powers that will check on the activities of HIS Government ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, what do you mean by "Freak Election" ?</p>
              <p>If the PAP is not elected and a new Government is formed by another Political Party that is elected legitimately by Singaporean citizens - should this be considered a freak election ?</p>
              <p>Why should this be considered a freak election result when the same electorate has been listed in the Election Role and the same election process had seen the PAP elected to form the government since 1957 ?</p>
              <p>Must it be that the electorate must ALWAYS elect the PAP so that the election is not considered a freak result - even when the PAP is no longer popular with Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>LKY a realist ?</p>
              <p>What does a whimsical person know about a complex personality such as LKY - when a lesser and simpler task of explaining what  "IDEALISM" is about cannot even be accomplished ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does an opportunist like LKY understand what 'Idealism' is about or can be ?</p>
              <p>It is no wonder that LKY prefer to see the Pledge as "Aspirations" and not "Idealism" as was seen by his own late colleague - S Rajaratnam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we believe the solid statements that are covered in fluff ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is impressive to write in whimsical prose expressing your lofty and fluffy statement -  <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"I do honour my vow to the constitution and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">my oath to our pledge</span></span>"</em></span> - but can we believe your honesty to keep your vow to a Constitution bastardised by the PAP, when you had also expressed your ability <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"to comprehend cold harsh realities from pure idealism in our human world"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we believe that you will give up your life to defend pure idealism ?</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten your position in agreeing with LKY that the Pledge was a mere "Aspiration" ?</p>
              <p>Would you honor your vow to a bastardised Singapore Constitution and to uphold a Pledge that you have agreed with MM LKY position that it is a mere "Aspiration" ?</p>
              <p>Or should we expect your pragmatism to come into play to modify your "aspiration" in response to new found realities as you had so eloquently stated ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is your understanding between <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aspiration">“an Aspiration(*1)” </a>and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ideals">“an Ideal(*2)” </a>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Is it not ironical that you will abandon your failed positions taken in the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/372615?page=5">‘Singapore Pledge is only an aspiration’ </a>- and will continue with your fraudulent efforts at being a bard with little to show from your own other than to imitate and plagiarise the ancient style of someone from the past ?</p>

              <p>Why the personal attacks?  Why vent your rhetorical frustrations with me? Are you aware that you are losing even more credibility with personal attacks on a person, for it only shows that you had lost logic and reason, so personal attack is the only way left.</p>
              <p>But thanks to you, you made me, a nobody, look even better than I wish to be with your incredilous petty personal attacks, proving me right in my socia - political insights.</p>
              <p>With all those petty personal attacking rhetorical questions, dun you have a terribly empty feeling..in your skull? Do tell me how one thing, how on earth did you find the front door this morning? Dun let your mind wander..it's too little to be let out alone.</p>
              <p>If I had a dollar for every brain you DUN have,I would have one dollar. Besides, if brains were money, you would be a charity case.</p>
              <p>Do you know, I am an open minded person, and believes that there is no such thing as a dumb question or questions, but you sure are an inquisitive idiot. I know everyone is entitled to be stupid, but you are abusing that priviledge consistantly.</p>
              <p>I had always prided myself that my fellow citizens are intelligent people, but there are still some stupid people here. Thanks to you, you just helped me realize it. YOu, being one of them for sure.</p>
              <p>Instead of commenting who should manage the country, why dont you yourself run for village idiot? You can't lose!</p>
              <p>See what I mean. You and I can go on forever, post after post, thread after all, personal attack after attack. And for what? Dont you and I have a common ground, and that is to share our insights on issues for discussions? So why the personal attacks instead of using your time to provide a better view of what you strongly believed in, than to lengthily insult others?</p>
              <p>Is there a pin stuck in your feet that you need to vent your pain onto others? Or are you suffering from extreme PMS? You sound like an old person. But most children grow up. You just seem to grow old.</p>

              <p>i work at Joo Seng Road, just along Aljunied Road. i was from Maris Stella High, just behind Bartley and Mt. Vernon Road... where the past cemetry is...</p>
              <p>if you ask me how many Gurkhas are there in Singapore, i am not trying to scare you but i believe (based on the number of blocks and how big the size of their camp is, plus i have a colleague who used to hang around Gurkhas) there are around 10,000 of them here in Singapore. whether include family members or not, i'm not sure.</p>
              <p>when you talk about fitness, boy... ask around... i was part of Singapore 2006 when we have the World Bank having their meeting here in Suntec City. as usual, security was super tight. so of course the Army and Police were involved. coffee chat was common and i was told during those "joint" marathons annually among the uniform group, the top 3 were never Singaporeans, they were Gurkhas.</p>
              <p>if you give me the ratio of 1 commando = 100 Gurkha, *shake head* look; i know you are proud to be a commando but put a commando and a Gurkha inside a locked room, you will roughly guess which one will walk out alive. one was trained since young to literally kill... the other, hmm... spelling. i'm not putting down Singaporeans, i'm a Singaporean myself but we have to be realistic.</p>
              <p>hey, just look at that big "knife" they carry around... it was said that once that knife is drawn, it has to taste blood... be it their victim or their own.</p>

              <p>Any highly trained trooper has the ability to be a skilled warrior moreover not all Ghurkas recieve the same special training.The ones in Singapore are part of a well trained security force their role is to guard sensitive areas and key Installations so dont compare them with troopers who are in the special forces it wouldnt be fair for the Gurkhas either.At the Falkland War Argentinian soldiers were seen throwing  down their weapons and deserting their positions when they heard the Ghurkhas were coming......must be because of the Kukri ( your big Knife) or just like you, they simply got no balls to fight any battle</p>

              <p>Then again, even if you had a brain transplanted at the wrong end, the brain would still have rejected you.</p>
              <p>Should anyone be surprised at reading the insecurity in your claims that my responses to what you have posted consist of personal attacks ?</p>
              <p>Were you not vaccinated against stupidity ?</p>
              <p>From the intelligence that you have displayed thus far, you seem to have confirmed that there is no vaccine against stupidity - as evidenced in your inability to even read accurately when you prefer to indulge in the high sounding prose that are filled with all the fluffy exaggerated inaccuracies and pass it off as some incredulous facts. </p>
              <p>We can certainly warm up to your efforts to polish up your image that need serious repair, unfortunately the most irritating TV commercials seems more credible.</p>
              <p>Is it any fault of anyone if you feel insecure and will take robust comments so personally ?</p>
              <p>If you have the money that you claim to have, CSJ will provide some professional consultancy for your insecurity, and you will surely be advised that Insecurity plays alot of tricks to your brain.</p>
              <p>Did you aks anyone standing near you if they can hear the sound of the ocean ?</p>
              <p>You could do with some help by tapping the power of the ocean to help you read my responses to your posts printed on Page 2 of this thread.</p>
              <p>As much as anyone would like to see from YOUR POINT OF VIEW - it is doubtful if anyone can get one's head so far up one's ass.</p>

              <p>C'mon girl, havent you anything new? Running out of steam, when
              we just barely begun and now repeating your dinosaur relic insults
              over and over again?</p>
              <p>Get on with it and come out with something new for a one on one,
              will ya? I am beginning to get bored, guess I thought too highly of
              you that i may prove wronged that you dun have anything but filth
              in between your ears. Seems like I am right again...sigh...</p>

              <p>Are you talking big like a transvertite - pretending to be a fighter - still dreaming about defending the Pledge that you made, when it is nothing more then an Aspiration ?</p>
              <p>Surely, we can expect you to face realities and modify your spirit defending your aspirations, and in the same manner we can expect you to take me on One-On-One with knuckle dusters on - and all occurring in the cul'de sac of your mind.</p>
              <p>You must think that everyone is stupid to believe you, perhaps this is a special occassion in the calender of a transvertite.</p>

              <p><br>Gurkhas got how many people only?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What they want to do? Rebellion ah? Arrest all the opposition party ah?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they dare to do that, I will get the entire SAF, SPF who consists of forced conscripts to lead a coup to kill the Gurkhas and all the PAP politicians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am from commando. 1 commando can kill 100 Gurkhas. Let them see the power of the commandos.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> lol joke of the month.. I think thats exactly what the government wanted us singaporean to become.. so that we will be too ignorant to know where we stand and what rights we entitled to.. despite all the education...</p>
              <p>I talked to gurkhas and seen them in action and guess what? to be more realistic if 10 commandos can take down 1 gurkhas in a real fight its very commendable already so wake up ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes I think some singaporean are worst than a frog in a well..</p>

              <p>Lol! Transvertite now. Had your mask of civility cracked, revealing what a low life you actually are that you would attempt to smear another to lose his credibility?</p>
              <p>You certainly arent in the league of your beloved Idol Dr.Chee. At least he only claims the opposition are thieves, but you belong more to our neighbour. Your style resemble the tyrant Mahattiar.</p>
              <p>Sad day for those who revered you. Your mask had finally dropped, and it sure didnt take much effort.</p>

              <p>This reply coming from you is an irony.</p>
              <p>Slipping up on your arguments and resorting to calling others a female simply reflect the ways of the transvertite in a cat fight with a male.</p>
              <p>Does a gentleman fight a transvee in the same manner as fighting another man ?</p>
              <p>Seriously, if anyone had told you to be yourself, it would have been the worst advice possible.</p>
