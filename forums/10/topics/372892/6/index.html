              <p><br>First of all, nothing last forever, MM believe it, he is a buddhist trained, he understand that nothing last forever, change is inevitable, but the most important is that when a day come, and PAP is set to diminish all their power, MM hopes that the one who take over are much better and smarter than PAP (leaving the shrewd and cunning aside).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the present, PAP believes that they will continue and would continue even an election is call for at the end of this year. That is way, he wants to tell those suckers and troublemakers out there, dun over dream, PAP still has control over many thing. If you want to mess around, you are on the wrong turf.</p>

              <p><br>Let's all not get too harsh on our MM Lee. He hasn't really done anything that warrant such a "curse". Don't get so emotional. After all, we didn't really suffer under his rule.</p>
              <p>I think the main grouse is that the ruling party does not believe in alternate views. This could be stemmed from the past, whereby people are lesser educated and dictatorship was the best way to rule.</p>
              <p>However, this is not the past. People are getting more educated. People would like to see more democracy. People don't like to be taken for a ride. People just want their government to admit it when they are wrong and not give some cock and bull story or excuses.</p>

              <p>But the PAP govt shouldnt just stop providing welfare to the left out people. The real chalenge is not giving them money thru donations, as later they will also increase taxes and prices, but rather to make them really keep up with changes in our society, esp globalisation.</p>

              <p>hey dare82,</p>
              <p>spore prospered because of the chinese mindset.just like the japanese,koreans,china chinese,taiwanese,hong kongs etc.all have thrived and fluorished despite going thru civil wars.world wars and several leadership changes in a country.</p>
              <p>spore would probably end up like the above countries even without lky ,pap etc.its natural for the chinese race to go forward and prosper ever since time and ancient chinese history began.fat chance the pap or some old geezer would take credit for that.</p>
              <p>most chinese of any intellect level will tell you straight that chinese civilisation,progress and thoughts are not a manifestation of the pap and some strange  mortal.</p>
              <p>what the pap is rather destroyng that very essencer and possibly tearing a fabric that would ultimately wipe them  out together all by themselves without external influence.</p>
              <p>you did it folks!you screwed yourselves deep all by yourselves.no batteries or help ever needed.</p>

              <p>If we're unhappy with the state of affairs of the government, then why dont the People, such as those dissatisfied, rally together to make their cause known?</p>
              <p>While its true that Singaporeans are mostly wage slaves, uninformed, living an extremely shielded life, I believe that there will be a point where the ordinary person will no longer be able to tolerate the corruption and the tyranny of the government.</p>
              <p>No one is assuming that he or she can change the government. Once the masses are pissed, even the SAF, if it decides to oppress fellow Singaporeans, will have a hard time handling the chaos.</p>
              <p>But as things are at the moment, the majority of people living comfortably, sedated with our affluent life, its hard to envision any concrete changes.</p>
