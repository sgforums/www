              <p>you are right on the real core issue. Many parents in 2 room flats can find the time to have babies because they don't have the money that require time to spend. So the incentives will help them to reduce their financial burden in having kids.</p>
              <p>those who have lots of money, they take more time to make more money and actually many don't have time to spend, they leave their kids to the maids. no bonus will work for them.</p>
              <p>but of course there are those who are even not married, some because nobody want them, so give them bonus also no use. there are also some couples, can't give birth no matter how they try, may be take too much contraceptives in the beginning.</p>
              <p>and finally, many babies in this forum, they need to grow up first, find a girlfriend, then hope their wife can give birth, oh...they need also to find job to feed the wife first, otherwise there will only talk about baby bonus from what they hear from their friends. </p>

              <p>The report by UN shows that Singapore will have one of the oldest median age by 2050. Our median age (average age) of Singapore is ~50, which is pretty old. With India, China, Bangladesh strong economical growth, lesser foreigners will come to work in Singapore, which results in a loss of growth for our population. It will drop to ~3.5million by 2100.</p>

              <p>I think u're right. U've covered most if not all of the bases on our segments. My take on this is even when u give the baby bonus &amp; extended maternity leave, for the lower income, its doesn't really much of a difference. And for the higher income, taxes &amp; money are not the issue. So while the intentions may be good, i think the benefits may not click.</p>
              <p>I think today,before anyone has a family, 1st thing they'll ask is, Can i afford it? Next, will i hv time for my kids? Sure u can take 2 -3 jobs, bt pretty soon the child is gonna call another person daddy or mommy, &amp; as it is, our divorce rate sare on the rise.</p>
              <p>I feel a more long term solutuon to this wld be, Entreprenership. Natrually, the devil is in the details,,,etc,,, currently all the schemes they hv under Spring, Seeds, etc...does not really cater for the mom &amp; pop business. So if there're really serious abt this, they shld make credit more easily accessible for the Sporeans to be self-reliant, &amp; hv more  time for their families after the initial start-up period.       </p>
