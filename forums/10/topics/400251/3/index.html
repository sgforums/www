              <p>You young meh?? many here also young lor..</p>
              <p>anyway, kor kor,</p>
              <p>other countries have a big land mass, a big market, a big space,
              they dun mind people coming to work and contribute to their nation,
              mostly they want talented Singaporeans, maybe a 100 thousands in
              USA, a few thousand in Aust, Canada, and a few hundreds in middle
              east and china, not much changes to what is happening since 1970s,
              singaporeans have been migrating out to work and make their living
              there.</p>
              <p>But the migrants coming to singapore is different, they are
              welcomed with open arms, be it indians, mynamars, chinese, etc etc,
              half talented or talent with fake cert or simply ill mannered or
              different culture are coming here, and we are talking about a few
              hundreds, it is going to be at least 2 millions, more than the 1.8
              total singaporean workforce here. And our land mass is just a red
              or black dot on the map.</p>
              <p>Singapore moving oversea to work is out of own willingness after
              considering all the pros and cons, but the foreigners coming here
              are being lure in thru promotion and connection. People in other
              countries excepted singaporeans because we are graceful peoples,
              educated and knows the manner well, but foreigner coming here are
              not well mannered, spit here and there, talk so loud, never respect
              our old peoples, do thing as tho this land belong to theirs, mark
              up our cost of living,...etc etc...so do you think Singaporeans is
              going to shut up and let this go on???</p>
              <p>Kor, i am not an advocate of going against foreigners, but if
              you look at our land and our demographic conditions, do we need or
              really need so much foreigners by which i would say 30% out of the
              100% are good only. There is simply no filtering here, because
              singapore govt have a different objective beside helping the
              economy, and that is birthrate which the other countries have no
              problem with it</p>

              <p>I dont understand why there are people can accept Singaporeans went to overseas so as to work / study whatever for long term basis (Which is like a foreginer in other land) but not when others come into Singapore to work as foreginer, and calling nasty names such as aliens / they invaded us etc when some Singaporeans invaded US, Australia, Middle East, China etc land as well.</p>

              <p>first of all you must consider this: the size of the  land here..how much space can it hold??</p>
              <p>secondly you have to factor in the population here and understand why this is not happening in other countries becoz the number of  people migrating to other places that are singaporeans are small in the recieving country standards .</p>
              <p>how you ask..then you gotta consider the land/population ratio</p>
              <p>thats where you start to see WHY this things which you said happen ONLY HERE.</p>
              <p>i'll share with you another experiance:</p>
              <p>when i was job hunting last year, i went for a walk in interview, which ended up as my job today but it was a tideous and nerve biting process, why?? if you ask</p>
              <p>firstly, at my age of  late 30s, i have to compete with my younger counterparts who may have just grad from poly or ITE</p>
              <p>secondly- at that time, there was an economic crunch around, to make matters more worst, i have to compete with fellow workers around my age or younger who were retrenched,(i was retrenched too from my previous job)</p>
              <p>lastly-unkown to me but this was later revealed by my interviewer, i had to compete with  (abt 100++ interviewees total) some  pinoy / PRC engineers who were willing to fight for a the lowest tech post just to get a job in singapore, however luckly for me resentment was quite high then so as a singaporean i kinda got luckly to get the job.</p>
              <p>it did however cost me a few sleepless nights before i was told i got the job.</p>
              <p>you are 19 now, age maybe your advantage, but not as big as before since there are more and more foriegn workers/FT coming in, with that the competition of the jobs get more and more fierece, should the  job growth  get lesser and lesser.</p>
              <p>i hope you understand this well, since it also will have an effect on your siblings (if you have any younger ones) and in the future your kids should things continue this way.</p>

              <p>thats where you start to see WHY this things which you said
              happen ONLY HERE.</p>
              <p>i'll share with you another experiance:</p>
              <p>when i was job hunting last year, i went for a walk in
              interview, which ended up as my job today but it was a tideous and
              nerve biting process, why?? if you ask</p>
              <p>firstly, at my age of  late 30s, i have to compete
              with my younger counterparts who may have just grad from poly
              or ITE</p>
              <p>secondly- at that time, there was an economic crunch around, to
              make matters more worst, i have to compete with fellow workers
              around my age or younger who were retrenched,(i was retrenched too
              from my previous job)</p>
              <p>lastly-unkown to me but this was later revealed by my
              interviewer, i had to compete with  (abt 100++ interviewees
              total) some  pinoy / PRC engineers who were willing
              to fight for a the lowest tech post just to get a job in singapore,
              however luckly for me resentment was quite high then so as a
              singaporean i kinda got luckly to get the job.</p>
              <p>it did however cost me a few sleepless nights before i was told
              i got the job.</p>
              <p>you are 19 now, age maybe your advantage, but not as big as
              before since there are more and more foriegn workers/FT coming in,
              with that the competition of the jobs get more and more fierece,
              should the  job growth  get lesser and lesser.</p>
              <p>i hope you understand this well, since it also will have an
              effect on your siblings (if you have any younger ones) and in the
              future your kids should things continue this way.</p>

              <p>We must be impartial to things and policies, some of PAP policies are good, and some are bad, to be frank, kor, there is never going to be a perfect good govt, in fact, all govt are consider bad, but as long as there is a 30% good in them, most people will survive and live quite normally. Therefore, we need to be objectives, good is good, bad is bad, pro and support without impartial judgement will only blind your senses.</p>
              <p>I have no doubt that if PAP was overthrown, the new party will still maintain some of the good stuffs that PAP had nurtured here, policies like education, learning and training is something they should follow up.</p>

              <p>all well, sporeans are indeed culled by PAP fm the time they are 
              born.  the culling is so successful that now PAP thinks sporeans are 
              stupid so they rather bring in foreigners who without culling and are 
              hungry, snap up jobs in this little red dot for a lower pay which 
              employers accept happily.  PAP believe it's more worth while giving 
              foreigners scholarship n investing in them. </p>
              <p>where are the 
              sporeans ?  leaving them to snap up crumbs in their home country, whilst

              <p>yes, this is the spore that we are looking at today.

              <p>Are younger Singaporeans still able to trust the PAP anymore? NO</p>
              <p>They are stealing our jobs away. Imagine 5 years down the road.</p>
              <p>There are 6 million people in Singapore. 80% of the population are foreigners meaning 4.8 million. Imagine a small bunch of 500 thousand males protecting 4.8 million foreigners. Everyone wont even have a sense of home, there will be a high cost, PAP is destroying Singapore. At the rate we are going, Singaporeans will go extinct within 50 years.</p>
