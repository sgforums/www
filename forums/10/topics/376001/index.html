              <p><strong>University World News, 18 Sep 2009<br> <br> </strong> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>SINGAPORE: Open University aids migrant workers</strong></span><br> <br> An imaginative and heartening move by Singapore's Open University is
              opening educational windows of opportunity for some of the country's
              migrant labour force. <span style="font-size: medium;">In
              collaboration with the Indonesian Embassy, the OU is offering
              pre-degree tuition and four bachelor degree courses to Indonesian
              domestic workers </span>- a female cohort that often makes the headlines in the city-state for all the wrong reasons.<br> <br> Recent years have seen a number of high profile cases of serious abuse
              of Indonesian servants in Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia as well
              as the Gulf countries. So frequent were the deaths of Indonesian maids
              falling from windows of high-rise apartment blocks in Singapore while
              carrying out domestic duties that the English-language daily The
              Jakarta Post headlined a report on the issue 'Singapore's killing
              fields'.<br> <br> Many of the young Indonesian women arrive in Singapore with little or
              no English and almost none have any Chinese language proficiency. The
              OU offers affordable English-language tuition to help the women cross
              that gap, English being more or less a lingua franca on the island.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;">The OU also offers English pre-degree
              computer training, a field likely to be entirely new for young women
              drawn from small provincial towns or rural communities, as well as four
              degrees covering accounting, business administration and government
              studies.<br> </span> <br> Students take the courses on campus where they mix freely with
              Singaporean students and others. Already some graduates have reported
              that the way has been opened to them for better and more fulfilling
              employment back home. <span style="font-size: medium;">One ex-servant now holds down a job on a local newspaper.</span><br> <br> A number of Indonesian women workers wanting to take up the courses
              have been held back by employers not allowing them to fit education
              with their work schedules.<br> <br> The OU and the Indonesian Embassy, however, are buoyed by the success
              of the scheme and have announced plans to expand it to Hong Kong and
              the Gulf, where there are large Indonesian female labour forces.<br> <br> ----------------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Latest updates @ Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com<br> <br> 1.

              <p><br>i think she dun has a open heart, the british and america educated the world to make themselve more prosperous and gracious, they can alway shut down their universities to all foreigners, but they understand that by educating the world, the whole world benefits from it, but that does not mean anyone can be educated, you need to qualify for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In SE Asia, no doubt we are the best land for education, and if we will to bring the whole SE asia and even the world up, we should do our part to help all which in turn help us to more prosperity and gracious.</p>
