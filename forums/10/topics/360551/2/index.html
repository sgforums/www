              <p>Over exaggeration, this will not happen. We are 1st world country. No matter what happens, we will always not go another country to become maid or brick layers. Analyze this-</p>
              <p>We have economy, infrastructure, business, tourism input all the time. Though things may not be rosy at times, it still goes on constantly.  We also have a large world class, transport system,  strategic airport and port,  major strengths.</p>

              <p>Fair points all, I must say I am astounded by your logic today. You have overdone yourself :) But to take each in turn:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The PRC vs SG housewife situation. Ultimately it takes two to clap. Also, I agree there have been cases of pei du mamas coming to Singapore on the pretext of their children's education but ultimately wanting to land a Singaporean man, but I do not want to mar all pei du mamas just by some black sheep. Firstly, if pei du mammas or PRC woman hit off with single local man - it is absolutely ok. I have seen many hardworking PRCs who come here for a better life and they wait on tables and do all the menial chores that locals wouldn't touch ever - and they get tgr with local single man. That is fine and dandy. What is not so fine, is breaking up families. But this I blame as much the local married straying man as much as the PRC. If not the PRCs, the local straying man will take his infidelity abroad to say Batam, if his intent is to get a mistress. So having a PRC in Singapore is inconsequential. One might argue that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presence </span>of PRC exacerbates the potential of local man to stray. But that is neglecting the fact that the choice lies in the local man whether to stray. The root of the problem is therefore the man's propensity to stray and not just the PRC. Because if it is not the PRC, it is the Batam mistress. If it is not the Batam mistress, it will be someone else. The solution to this stealing husband syndrome is to get the husband to cut it out. Which of course leads to whole other arguments about female empowerment (so that they can leave their husbands) which again leads on to other arguments about assumed gender roles in the whole "family is the building block of Singapore society" philosophy. But that is another topic altogether.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Foreigners taking bread and butter away. Only for the higher skilled occupations because the lower skilled foreign immigrants do work that we shun. And for the higer skilled occupations, I daresay Singaporeans have a skillset comparable to foreign talent. We just need more confidence and creativity and boldness in the workplace. That shouldn't be a problem within the next 10 years. We are in a globalised world, our competition is not just with the next NUS grad but with the graduate from another country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Crimes from the lower-skilled foreign immigrants? I don't deny the situation. But that is a opp cost our society takes in order to get our skyscrapers, our roads, our HDBs. That is a solution of course - provide adequate housing and decent living standards and maybe foreign immigrants may carry themselves with more decorum.</p>

              <p>As what some people have mentioned, there are too many foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The correct policy should have been to let in new citizens in small batches so that integration can occur in a smoother and less disruptive pace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, the foreign population is almost double the local population. (I think the stats are 2 out of every 5 people in sg are foreigners)  With so many of their own countrymen already here in singapore, there is little incentive for say, PRCs (who have become new citizens) to integrate into singapore society as they could easily spend their time with their own countrymen and practice their own local traditions.  That is why you always see groups of people of the same nationalities sticking with their own cliques.  5 years back, you would see groups of 2-3 PRCs hanging out together.  Right now, you can see probably see bigger groups of 5 or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why bother to integrate and adapt to singapore culture and norms like what sg ministers are telling them when they are more comfortable with their own home customs/language/culture ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

                  that locals wouldn't touch ever - and they get tgr with local
                  single man. That is fine and dandy. What is not so fine, is
                  breaking up families. But this I blame as much the local married
                  straying man as much as the PRC. If not the PRCs, the local
                  straying man will take his infidelity abroad to say Batam, if his
                  intent is to get a mistress. So having a PRC in Singapore is
                  inconsequential. One might argue that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presence</span> of PRC exacerbates
                  the potential of local man to stray. But that is neglecting the
                  fact that the choice lies in the local man whether to stray. The
                  root of the problem is therefore the man's propensity to stray and
                  not just the PRC. Because if it is not the PRC, it is the Batam
                  mistress. If it is not the Batam mistress, it will be someone else.
                  The solution to this stealing husband syndrome is to get the
                  husband to cut it out. Which of course leads to whole other
                  arguments about female empowerment (so that they can leave their
                  husbands) which again leads on to other arguments about assumed
                  gender roles in the whole "family is the building block of
                  Singapore society" philosophy. But that is another topic
                  altogether.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Foreigners taking bread and butter away. Only for the higher
                  skilled occupations because the lower skilled foreign immigrants do
                  work that we shun. And for the higer skilled occupations, I daresay
                  Singaporeans have a skillset comparable to foreign talent. We just
                  need more confidence and creativity and boldness in the workplace.
                  That shouldn't be a problem within the next 10 years. We are in a
                  globalised world, our competition is not just with the next NUS
                  grad but with the graduate from another country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Crimes from the lower-skilled foreign immigrants? I don't
                  deny the situation. But that is a opp cost our society takes in
                  order to get our skyscrapers, our roads, our HDBs. That is a
                  solution of course - provide adequate housing and decent living
                  standards and maybe foreign immigrants may carry themselves with
                  more decorum.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The correct policy should have been to let in new citizens in
              small batches so that integration can occur in a smoother and less
              disruptive pace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, the foreign population is almost double the local
              population. (I think the stats are 2 out of every 5 people in sg
              are foreigners)  With so many of their own countrymen already
              here in singapore, there is little incentive for say, PRCs (who
              have become new citizens) to integrate into singapore society as
              they could easily spend their time with their own countrymen and
              practice their own local traditions.  That is why you always
              see groups of people of the same nationalities sticking with their
              own cliques.  5 years back, you would see groups of 2-3 PRCs
              hanging out together.  Right now, you can see probably see
              bigger groups of 5 or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why bother to integrate and adapt to singapore culture and norms
              like what sg ministers are telling them when they are more
              comfortable with their own home customs/language/culture ?

                  Chin Siong is an elusive figure in Singapore’s history. He was a
                  charismatic catalyst to the mass movements of the 1950s and early
                  1960s, and his political personality helped define an era. To Lee Kuan
                  Yew, Lim Chin Siong was probably his greatest adversary that he
                  respected. Lim did what LKY could not do in the 1950s: mobilize tens of
                  thousands ethnic Chinese just by his words. Lim Chin Siong, was not
                  recognized but is one the founding members of the PAP. His very
                  presence in our history shaped not only our independence but also how
                  the concept of detention without trail (by ISD) and the affiliation of
                  the labour union (eg: NTUC) to the PAP.<br><br></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/LCS001.jpg"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/LCS001.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><span style="font-size: 130%;">Time
                  and time again, I’ve mentioned that history is often written by
                  victors, victors of a political dogfight and victors of unfair
                  competition. The winners will get titles that remain across time
                  encapsulating their distinguished successes but not their failures. The
                  losers sometime suffer a fate worse than death, which is that their
                  name being erased of annals. Simply, their lives and their
                  accomplishments never existed. If one mentioned about Dr Goh Keng Swee,
                  the title of “the architect of Singapore’s economic success” comes to
                  mind. Similar, Lee Kuan Yew, the “founder of Modern Singapore”. But if
                  one mentioned about Lim Chin Siong, it might be a slate of blank. At
                  most, he is remembered as the “Communist” or the “vanquished”
                  (mentioned in Lee’s Lieutenants). Personally, I would favour the title
                  “the Man Who Almost Became Prime Minister” for Lim. For this article,
                  I’ll be drawing information from “Comet in our Sky – Lim Chin Siong n
                  History” by Tan Jing Quee (published by INSAN press Kuala Lumpur) and
                  Melanie Chew’s interview with Lim Chin Siong himself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Making of the Hokkien Hero</strong></span><br>Lim
                  Chin Siong was born in Telok Ayer in the Hokkien heartland of
                  Singapore’s Chinatown in 28 February 1933. Life was harsh in his early
                  years, and had to stop school during the Japanese Occupation when he
                  was around 9 years old. It was during this hardship that shaped his
                  political inclinations and to be supportive to radical anti-colonial
                  causes mashed with Chinese Nationalism.<br><br></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/LCS002.jpg"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/LCS002.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><span style="font-size: 130%;">When
                  the war ended, Chin Siong returned to school at Pei Chun and completed
                  his primary school education; he had lost three years and was
                  considerably older than he would have been if not for the war. The
                  Malayan Communist Party (MCP) had emerged from the war as an ally of
                  the British in the prosecution of the anti-Japanese was and was
                  accorded honours and lawful status in the political life of the
                  country. However, in 1948, MCP’s relations deteriorated to breaking
                  point; widespread labour demonstrations and strikes, arrested and
                  political organization bans led to retaliation, murders and open
                  declaration of war. The MCP was outlawed and took to the jungle to wage
                  an armed guerilla struggle.<br><br>In 1949, Chin Siong enrolled into
                  Catholic High School. He soon found school life there restrictive and
                  transferred himself to Chinese High School. He was now sixteen years
                  old and began to show interest in Chinese patriotism, national
                  salvation and social justice, leading him to read writers like Lu Xun
                  and Lao She. He would soon make his mark as an active student leader,
                  espouse radical causes, and become firm friends with Fong Swee Suan,
                  his classmate in Chinese High School.<br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: times new roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 130%;">Baptism of Politics<br></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/img0691.0.jpg"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/img0691.0.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a></span></strong><span style="font-size: 130%;">In
                  1951, they were in Junior Middle III and required to sit for an
                  external examination, before graduating or advancing to Senior Middle
                  School. This common external examination was a throwback to the
                  pre-1949 Kuomintang era and precondition for access to further
                  education in China. With the China Revolution in 1949, admission to
                  higher education was closed in Mainland China. Hence, the retention and
                  continuance of such common examination was an attempt by the British to
                  limit further education to the Chinese left-wing students.<br><br>Chin
                  Siong and Fong organized a body called, “Students Opposing The Junior
                  Middle III Examinations, galvanizing support for boycotting the
                  examinations. They wrote pamplets, made speeches condemning colonialism
                  and advocated fair and equal treatment for Chinese schools and
                  students. It was in these years, Chin Siong joined the Anti-British
                  League (ABL). These activities eventually caught the attention of the
                  Special Branch (British version of ISD). Chin Siong was detained for a
                  week in August 1951 and again in October 1951 over the examination
                  boycott. He was released, but was expelled from school, together with
                  more than eighty students in the class of 1951.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union</strong></span><br></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/img090.jpg"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/img090.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><span style="font-size: 130%;">In
                  1954, an innocuous event would transform and catapult Chin Siong into
                  greater prominence. He was elected Secretary of a small union bearing
                  the grandiose name of Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union (SFSWU)
                  with a membership of barely 300 members. Within a brief period of just
                  a year, the membership of SFSWU had expanded rapidly to more than
                  30,000, making it one of the most powerful trade unions in Singapore at
                  that time.<br><br>Chin Siong would be prominent enough to attract the
                  attention of Lee Kuan Yew and colleagues when they were looking around
                  for grassroots leaders to form a new political Party. Chin Siong was
                  inducted into the fortnightly discussion group in the basement of LKY’s
                  house at Oxley Road to work out an agreement to launch the People’s

                  newly established PAP decided to contest the elections on 2 April 1955
                  in four constituencies. The four were, Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar),
                  Goh Chew Chua (Punggol-Tampines), C.V. Devan Nair (Farrer Park) and Lim
                  Chin Siong (Bukit Timah). It was then when the beacon of Lim Chin Siong
                  shined brighter than Lee Kuan Yew’s. James Puthucheary, who was in
                  charge of PAP publicity for the elections recalled the first rally held

                  man emerged from this election as a powerful public speaker. He was
                  young, slim, of medium height, with a soft face but a ringing voice
                  that flowed beautifully in his native Hokkien. The girls adored him,
                  especially those in the trade union. Apart from Chinese culture, his
                  themes were the downtrodden workers, the wicked imperialists, the
                  Emergency Regulations that suppressed the rights of the masses, free
                  speech and free association. Once he got going after a cold start at
                  the first two meetings, there was tremendous applause every time he
                  spoke. By the end of the campaign, Lim Chin Siong was seen as a

                  At the time, the Legislative Assembly only permitted the use of English
                  in debates. Chin Siong’s hesitant English became a safe target for
                  red-baiting, which he handled as well as he could, but without damage
                  to his standing among the non-Chinese speaking population. During that
                  time, he has his colleague, Devan Nair to draft his parliamentary
                  speeches. Having won 10 of the 25 elected seats in the 1955 Elections,

                  constitutional talks. Lee Kuan Yew and Lim Chin Siong represented the
                  PAP in the delegation. Despite the rhetoric of “Independence talks”,
                  this underlying premise on the urgency to curb the left wing in

                  next phase of constitutional advance by all members of the delegation,
                  except Lim Chin Siong. The talks eventually collapse when the British

                  Defence and Security Council to oversee internal security. The British

                  continued to rise with each successive debate. Lee Kuan yew’s
                  identification with the detained left wing leaders strengthened his own

                  Lim Yew Hock. LKY had added confidence knowing that he would be the
                  more natural and obvious choice for the British for the mantle of power

                  new constitution as a “fraud” and nineteen trade unions lobbied the PAP

                  substantial power to initiate or influence polices. More significantly,
                  none of them were made cadre members, which meant that they would never
                  be in any position to challenge the leadership in future party

                  LKY played his political cards to perfection. Being the solicitor of
                  the detainees, he was seen as the freer of the oppressed. Putting Chin
                  Siong and the rest in political office, he could ride their popularity
                  amongst the Chinese population without giving Chin Siong and the rest

                  after assuming power, the PAP government formed a ten-men secretariat
                  of the Trade Union Congress to reorganize the labour movement. Lim Chin

                  and the party, Chin Siong’s faction was dominant in the trade union and

                  mid-1961, following two humiliating defeats for the PAP at Hong Lim and
                  Anson by-elections, it was clear that a decisive break was inevitable.
                  LKY’s government sought a vote-of-confidence at the Legislative
                  Assembly meeting on 20 July 1961. 13 PAP Assemblymen abstained from the
                  vote and were promptly expelled from the party. The expelled men joined
                  forces with the left wing trade unions to form the Barisan Socialis. In
                  August 1961, they formed a rival party, the Barisan Sosialis, led by Dr
                  Lee Siew Choh and Lim Chin Siong. They took 35 branch committees, 19 of
                  the 23 organizing secretaries and an estimated 80 percent of the
                  membership. PAP under LKY was a mere shell, according to Dr Lee.<br><br>The
                  PAP government was on the verged of being toppled. Every session, the
                  opposition would motion of no confidence. But across the shores, the
                  Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tengku Abdul Rahman,
                  watched the events and feared that Singapore was about to become a
                  Communist State, a “second Cuba” and a danger to Malaya. Thus, this was
                  the start of the intense and frantic, Battle for Merger.<br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: times new roman;"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tunku: LKY’s Last Dice<br></strong></span>Barisan Sosialis held sway in Singapore but it knew that in a wider </span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/lcs0006.jpg"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/lcs0006.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><span style="font-size: 130%;">Malaysia

                  the Barisan’s hold on the Singapore Electorate. Thus, they enlisted
                  Malayan Tengku and the British as allies, playing on their long
                  standing fear of Communism.<br><br>On July 1962, the Barisan Sosialis,
                  led by David Marshall and Dr Lee Siew Choh, appealed against the merger
                  in the United Nations in New York. The Merger Referendum, issued in
                  1962, was testimony to the murkiness of the Battle. It was deliberately
                  ambiguous. It asked voters to choose what kind of merger they wanted,
                  not whether indeed they wished for a merger. The referendum was not to
                  be a simple YES or NO response to the merger, but included three
                  choices:<br><br><strong><em>Option A</em></strong> endorse merger on terms suggested by the White Paper.<br><strong><em>Option B</em></strong> distorted the Barisan Sosialis formula and threatened to disenfranchise 250,000 Singapore citizens<br><strong><em>Option C</em></strong> purportedly represent the position of the Singapore Peoples Alliance,
                  which neither it not any other political party advocated or adopted.<br><br>25%
                  rallied to the call of Barisan and cast blank votes, objecting to the
                  manner in which the exercise had been carried out. 71% chose Option A.
                  With this controversial tactic, the PAP won the Battle for Merger.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Operation Coldstore: Wiping out Lim Chin Siong</strong></span><br></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/img031.jpg"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/img031.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><span style="font-size: 130%;">Tengku

                  Hundreds of arrest was made and effectively decapitated the Left Wing
                  Barisan Sosialis. Nearly the entire central executive committee of the
                  Barisan Sosialis, including Chin Siong, was arrested. Chin Siong was
                  just shy of thirty years old at the time of his third detention. In the
                  decade spanning his entry into the political fray in 1954 and 1963, he

                  leaders in prison, garnered only 13 out of 51 seats. On September 1963,
                  the PAP government had won its battle against the Left. By 1965,
                  Singapore was kick out of the Federation after a mere 1071 days in
                  Malaysia. As foreseen by Chin Siong, the merger was never what it was
                  meant to be but could be just an excuse to eliminate political
