                      obsolete. That is what a multipolar world means, after all.</strong></span></span></span></p>

                      starters, in 2005 the SCO asked Washington to set a timeline to
                      withdraw from its military bases in Central Asia. Two years later the
                      SCO countries formally aligned themselves with the former CIS republics
                      belonging to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO),
                      established in 2002 as a counterweight to NATO.</span><span lang="EN-US">  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Yet
                      the meeting has elicited only a collective yawn from the US and even
                      European press despite its agenda is to replace the global dollar
                      standard with a new financial and military defense system. </span></span></p>

                      used so deftly for many centuries in fragmenting foreign opposition to
                      its own empire. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US">But George W. Bush (“I’m a uniter, not a divider”)
                      built on the Clinton administration’s legacy in driving Russia, China
                      and their neighbors to find a common ground when it comes to finding an
                      alternative to the dollar and hence to the US ability to run
                      balance-of-payments deficits <em>ad infinitum</em>.</span><span lang="EN-US">            </span></span></p>

                      April at the G-20 conference, and became even more explicit at the St.
                      Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 5, when Mr. Medvedev
                      called for China, Russia and India to “build an increasingly multipolar
                      world order.” </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US">What this means in plain English is: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We have reached our
                      limit in subsidizing the United States’ military encirclement of
                      Eurasia while also allowing the US to appropriate our exports,
                      companies, stocks and real estate in exchange for paper money of
                      questionable worth.</strong></span><br><br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"The
                      artificially maintained unipolar system,” Mr. Medvedev spelled out, is
                      based on “one big centre of consumption, financed by a growing deficit,
                      and thus growing debts, one formerly strong reserve currency, and one
                      dominant system of assessing assets and risks.”2 </span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> At the root of the global financial crisis, he concluded, is that the
                      United States makes too little and spends too much. </strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US">Especially
                      upsetting is its military spending, such as the stepped-up US military
                      aid to Georgia announced just last week, the NATO missile shield in
                      Eastern Europe and the US buildup in the oil-rich Middle East and
                      Central Asia.</span><span lang="EN-US">            </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                      sticking point with all these countries is the US ability to print
                      unlimited amounts of dollars. </strong></span>Overspending by US consumers on imports
                      in excess of exports, US buy-outs of foreign companies and real estate,
                      and the dollars that the Pentagon spends abroad all end up in foreign
                      central banks. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US">These agencies then face a hard choice: either to
                      recycle these dollars back to the United States by purchasing US
                      Treasury bills, or to let the “free market” force up their currency
                      relative to the dollar – thereby pricing their exports out of world
                      markets and hence creating domestic unemployment and business
                      insolvency.</span><span lang="EN-US">           </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When China and other countries recycle their dollar inflows by buying US Treasury bills to “invest” in the United States, this </strong></span><span style="color: black;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>buildup is not really voluntary.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;"> It </span>does not reflect faith <span style="color: black;">in the U.S. economy enriching foreign central banks for their savings</span>,

                      alternatives. “Free markets” US-style hook countries into a system that

                      means creating a new alternative. Rather than making merely “cosmetic
                      changes as some countries and perhaps the international financial
                      organisations themselves might want,” Mr. Medvedev ended his St.
                      Petersburg speech, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“what we need are financial institutions of a
                      completely new type, where particular political issues and motives, and
                      particular countries will not dominate.”</span></span></strong></span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">      </span></span>    </strong>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US">When
                      foreign military spending forced the US balance of payments into
                      deficit and drove the United States off gold in 1971, central banks
                      were left without the traditional asset used to settle payments
                      imbalances. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US">The alternative by default was to invest their subsequent
                      payments inflows in US Treasury bonds, as if these still were “as good
                      as gold.” Central banks now hold $4 trillion of these bonds in their
                      international reserves – land these loans have financed most of the US
                      Government’s domestic budget deficits for over three decades now! </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US">Given
                      the fact that about half of US Government discretionary spending is for
                      military operations – including more than 750 foreign military bases
                      and increasingly expensive operations in the oil-producing and
                      transporting countries – the international financial system is
                      organized in a way that finances the Pentagon, along with US buyouts of
                      foreign assets expected to yield much more than the Treasury bonds that
                      foreign central banks hold.</span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US">            </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US">The
                      main political issue confronting the world’s central banks is therefore
                      how to avoid adding yet more dollars to their reserves and thereby
                      financing yet further US deficit spending – including military spending
                      on their borders? </span><span lang="EN-US">            </span></span></p>

              <p>There is no other way.</p>
              <p>You cannot keep on attacking, invading, bombing, killing and torturing.</p>
              <p>How can there be peace under heaven by using your methods, USA?</p>
              <p>How?</p>

              <p>Andrew says it all and well. China and Russia can dream on all they want.</p>
              <p>When americans buy their products, they sure were happy enough to use such earnings to build and invest in armaments instead of building up their only true valuable and renewable resource - its people.</p>
              <p>I once believed foolishly in de-coupling ability of the world from US economic domination, but the financial crisis showed me it is impossible. It is the human potential of the free American people that made all other great despotic nations go down on their knees.</p>
              <p>Thus the only way to decouple from US is to build the human potential of individual nations. A simple example is the domination of Microsoft's Windows software worldwide. Till today, had anyone in the world built any other software capable of being internationally used? None.</p>
              <p>And the only way to build the human potential of the world is not just education alone. It is the freedom to use and maximise what had been learnt, freely and experimentally, without causing hurt and harm to others. But i doubt if anyone can do so in China or Russia, even India. They have the habit of cutting poppies that grew too tall or using whatever that had been invented and turning it into secret military applications.</p>
              <p>Dream on. US domination will continue till leaders of the world start to wake up on human potential instead of military and authoritarian might. </p>

              <div>The Yekaterinburg Turning Point</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>by Prof. Michael Hudson</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>June 13, 2009</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <p><em><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The city of Yakaterinburg, Russia’s largest east of the Urals, may become known not only as the death place of the tsars but of American hegemony too – and not only where US U-2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down in 1960, but where the US-centered international financial order was brought to ground.</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>Challenging America will be the prime focus of extended meetings in Yekaterinburg, Russia (formerly Sverdlovsk) today and tomorrow (June 15-16) for Chinese President Hu Jintao, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and other top officials of the six-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The alliance is comprised of</span> <span style="color: black;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrghyzstan and Uzbekistan</span>, with</span> observer status for Iran, India, Pakistan and Mongolia<span style="color: black;">.</span> It will be joined on Tuesday by Brazil for trade discussions among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China).</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>     </span></span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>The attendees have assured American diplomats that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>dismantling the US financial and military empire is not their aim.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>They simply want to discuss mutual aid – but in a way that has no role for the United States, NATO or the US dollar as a vehicle for trade. US diplomats may well ask what this really means, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>i</strong><strong>f not a move to make US hegemony obsolete. That is what a multipolar world means, after all.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>For starters, in 2005 the SCO asked Washington to set a timeline to withdraw from its military bases in Central Asia. Two years later the SCO countries formally aligned themselves with the former CIS republics belonging to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), established in 2002 as a counterweight to NATO.</span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Yet the meeting has elicited only a collective yawn from the US and even European press despite its agenda is to replace the global dollar standard with a new financial and military defense system.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A Council on Foreign Relations spokesman has said he hardly can imagine that Russia and China can overcome their geopolitical rivalry,1</span></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>suggesting that America can use the divide-and-conquer that Britain used so deftly for many centuries in fragmenting foreign opposition to its own empire.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>But George W. Bush (“I’m a uniter, not a divider”) built on the Clinton administration’s legacy in driving Russia, China and their neighbors to find a common ground when it comes to finding an alternative to the dollar and hence to the US ability to run balance-of-payments deficits <em>ad infinitum</em>.</span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>What may prove to be the last rites of American hegemony began already in April at the G-20 conference, and became even more explicit at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 5, when Mr. Medvedev called for China, Russia and India to “build an increasingly multipolar world order.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>What this means in plain English is: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We have reached our limit in subsidizing the United States’ military encirclement of Eurasia while also allowing the US to appropriate our exports, companies, stocks and real estate in exchange for paper money of questionable worth.</strong></span><br><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"The artificially maintained unipolar system,” Mr. Medvedev spelled out, is based on “one big centre of consumption, financed by a growing deficit, and thus growing debts, one formerly strong reserve currency, and one dominant system of assessing assets and risks.”2 </span></span></strong></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At the root of the global financial crisis, he concluded, is that the United States makes too little and spends too much.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>Especially upsetting is its military spending, such as the stepped-up US military aid to Georgia announced just last week, the NATO missile shield in Eastern Europe and the US buildup in the oil-rich Middle East and Central Asia.</span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The sticking point with all these countries is the US ability to print unlimited amounts of dollars.</strong></span> Overspending by US consumers on imports in excess of exports, US buy-outs of foreign companies and real estate, and the dollars that the Pentagon spends abroad all end up in foreign central banks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>These agencies then face a hard choice: either to recycle these dollars back to the United States by purchasing US Treasury bills, or to let the “free market” force up their currency relative to the dollar – thereby pricing their exports out of world markets and hence creating domestic unemployment and business insolvency.</span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When China and other countries recycle their dollar inflows by buying US Treasury bills to “invest” in the United States, this</strong></span> <span style="color: black;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>buildup is not really voluntary.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">It</span> does not reflect faith <span style="color: black;">in the U.S. economy enriching foreign central banks for their savings</span>, or any calculated investment preference, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but simply a lack of alternatives. “Free markets” US-style hook countries into a system that forces them to accept dollars without limit. Now they want out. </strong></span></span><br></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>           <br>This means creating a new alternative. Rather than making merely “cosmetic changes as some countries and perhaps the international financial organisations themselves might want,” Mr. Medvedev ended his St. Petersburg speech, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“what we need are financial institutions of a completely new type, where particular political issues and motives, and particular countries will not dominate.”</span></span></strong></span><span style="color: black;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">      </span></span>    </strong> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">When foreign military spending forced the US balance of payments into deficit and drove the United States off gold in 1971, central banks were left without the traditional asset used to settle payments imbalances.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">The alternative by default was to invest their subsequent payments inflows in US Treasury bonds, as if these still were “as good as gold.” Central banks now hold $4 trillion of these bonds in their international reserves – land these loans have financed most of the US Government’s domestic budget deficits for over three decades now!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">Given the fact that about half of US Government discretionary spending is for military operations – including more than 750 foreign military bases and increasingly expensive operations in the oil-producing and transporting countries – the international financial system is organized in a way that finances the Pentagon, along with US buyouts of foreign assets expected to yield much more than the Treasury bonds that foreign central banks hold.</span><span style="color: black;">           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">The main political issue confronting the world’s central banks is therefore how to avoid adding yet more dollars to their reserves and thereby financing yet further US deficit spending – including military spending on their borders? </span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For starters, the six SCO countries and BRIC countries intend to trade in their own currencies so as to get the benefit of mutual credit that the United States until now has monopolized for itself.</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">Toward this end,</span> China has struck bilateral deals with Argentina and Brazil to denominate their trade in renminbi rather than the dollar, sterling or euros,3 </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">and <span style="color: black;">two weeks ago China reached an agreement with Malaysia to denominate trade between the two countries in renminbi.</span></span></span><a rel="nofollow" name="_ftnref4" href="http://globalresearch.ca/admin/rte/richedit.html#_ftn4"><span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">[4]</span></span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">Former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad explained to me in January that as a Muslim country, Malaysia wants to avoid doing anything that would facilitate US military action against Islamic countries, including Palestine.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">The nation has too many dollar assets as it is, his colleagues explained.</span> <span>Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan of the People's Bank of China wrote an official statement on its website that the goal is now to create a reserve currency “that is disconnected from individual nations.”5 </span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is the aim of the discussions in Yekaterinburg.</span></span><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">           <br></span></span><span style="color: black;"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In addition to avoiding financing the US buyout of their own industry and the US military encirclement of the globe, China, Russia and other countries no doubt would like to get the same kind of free ride that America has been getting.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">As matters stand, they</span></span></strong></span></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>see the United States as a lawless nation, financially as well as militarily. How else to characterize a nation that holds out a set of laws for others – on war, debt repayment and treatment of prisoners – but ignores them itself?</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>The United States is now the world’s largest debtor yet has avoided the pain of “structural adjustments” imposed on other debtor economies. US interest-rate and tax reductions in the face of exploding trade and budget deficits are seen as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>height of hypocrisy in view of the austerity programs that Washington forces on other countries via the IMF and other Washington vehicles.</strong></span></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>      </strong></span>     </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>United States tells debtor economies to sell off their public utilities and natural resources, raise their interest rates and increase taxes while gutting their social safety nets to squeeze out money to pay creditors.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>And at home, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Congress blocked China’s CNOOK from buying Unocal on grounds of national security, much as it blocked Dubai from buying US ports and other sovereign wealth funds from buying into key infrastructure.</strong></span> Foreigners are invited to emulate the Japanese purchase of white elephant trophies such as Rockefeller Center, on which <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>investors quickly lost a billion dollars and ended up walking away. </strong></span></span><span>   </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>In this respect the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>US has not really given China and other payments-surplus nations much alternative but to find a way to avoid further dollar buildups.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>To date, China’s attempts to diversify its dollar holdings beyond Treasury bonds have not proved very successful. For starters, Hank Paulson of Goldman Sachs steered its central bank into higher-yielding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, explaining that these were <em>de facto</em> public obligations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>They collapsed in 2008, but at least the US Government took these two mortgage-lending agencies over, formally adding their $5.2 trillion in obligations onto the national debt. In fact, it was largely foreign official investment that prompted the bailout.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>Imposing a loss for foreign official agencies would have broken the Treasury-bill standard then and there, not only by utterly destroying US credibility but because there simply are too few Government bonds to absorb the dollars being flooded into the world economy by the soaring US balance-of-payments deficits.</span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Seeking more of an equity position to protect the value of their dollar holdings as the Federal Reserve’s credit bubble drove interest rates down China’s sovereign wealth funds sought to diversify in late 2007.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">China bought stakes in the well-connected Blackstone equity fund and Morgan Stanley on Wall Street, Barclays in Britain South Africa’s Standard Bank (once affiliated with Chase Manhattan back in the apartheid 1960s) and in the soon-to-collapse Belgian financial conglomerate Fortis.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">But the US financial sector was collapsing under the weight of its debt pyramiding, and prices for shares plunged for banks and investment firms across the globe.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Foreigners see the IMF, World Bank and World Trade Organization as Washington surrogates in a financial system backed by American military bases and aircraft carriers encircling the globe.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>But this military domination is a vestige of an American empire no longer able to rule by economic strength. US military power is muscle-bound, based more on atomic weaponry and long-distance air strikes than on ground operations, which have become too politically unpopular to mount on any large scale. </span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">On the economic front there is no foreseeable way in which the United States can work off the $4 trillion it owes foreign governments, their central banks and the sovereign wealth funds set up to dispose of the global dollar glut. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>America has become a deadbeat – and indeed, a militarily aggressive one as it seeks to hold onto the unique power it once earned by economic means.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The problem is how to constrain its behavior. Yu Yongding, a former Chinese central bank advisor now with China’s Academy of Sciences, suggested that US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner be advised that the United States should “save” first and foremost by cutting back its military budget. “U.S. tax revenue is not likely to increase in the short term because of low economic growth, inflexible expenditures and the cost of ‘fighting two wars.’”6</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span> </span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>At present it is foreign savings, not those of Americans that are financing the US budget deficit by buying most Treasury bonds. The effect is taxation without representation for foreign voters as to how the US Government uses their forced savings.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>It therefore <span style="color: black;">is necessary for financial diplomats to broaden the scope of their policy-making beyond the private-sector marketplace. Exchange rates are determined by many factors besides “consumers wielding credit cards,” the usual euphemism that the US media cite for America’s balance-of-payments deficit.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span><span style="color: black;">Since the 13<sup>th</sup> century, war has been a dominating factor in the balance of payments of leading nations – and of their national debts. Government bond financing consists mainly of war debts, as normal peacetime budgets tend to be balanced. This links the war budget directly to the balance of payments and exchange rates.</span></span><span>             </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Foreign nations see themselves stuck with unpayable IOUs – under conditions where, if they move to stop the US free lunch, the dollar will plunge and their dollar holdings will fall in value relative to their own domestic currencies and other currencies. If <span style="color: black;">China’s currency rises by 10% against the dollar, its central bank will show the equivalent of a $200 million loss on its $2 trillion of dollar holdings as denominated in yuan.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">This explains why, w</span>hen bond ratings agencies talk of the US Treasury securities losing their AAA rating, they don’t mean that the government cannot simply print the paper dollars to “make good” on these bonds. They mean that dollars will depreciate in international value. And that is just what is now occurring.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">When Mr. Geithner put on his serious face and told an audience at Peking University in early June that he believed in a “strong dollar” and China’s US investments therefore were safe and sound, he was greeted with derisive laughter.7 </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span> </span><span style="color: black;">           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">Anticipation of a rise in China’s exchange rate provides an incentive for speculators to seek to borrow in dollars to buy renminbi and benefit from the appreciation. For China, the problem is that this speculative inflow would become a self-fulfilling prophecy by forcing up its currency.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">So the problem of international reserves is inherently linked to that of capital controls. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why should China see its</strong></span></span></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>profitable companies sold for yet more freely-created US dollars, which the central bank must use to buy low-yielding US Treasury bills or lose yet further money on Wall Street?</span><span> </span></strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">To a<span style="color: black;">void this quandary it is necessary to reverse the philosophy of open capital markets that the world has held ever since Bretton Woods in 1944. On the occasion of Mr. Geithner’s visit to China</span>, “Zhou Xiaochuan, minister of the Peoples Bank of China, the country’s central bank, said pointedly that this was the first time since the semiannual talks began in 2006 that China needed to learn from American mistakes as well as its successes” when it came to deregulating capital markets and dismantling controls.8 </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span> </span><span>          <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> </strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black;">An era therefore is coming to an end. In the face of continued US overspending, de-dollarization threatens to force countries to return to the kind of dual exchange rates common between World Wars I and II: one exchange rate for commodity trade, another for capital movements and investments, at least from dollar-area economies.</span></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>          </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>Even without capital controls, the nations meeting at Yekaterinburg are taking steps to avoid being the unwilling recipients of yet more dollars.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>Seeing that US global hegemony cannot continue without spending power that they themselves supply, governments are attempting to hasten what Chalmers Johnson has called “the sorrows of empire” in his book by that name – <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the bankruptcy of the US financial-military world order.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>If China, Russia and their non-aligned allies have their way, the United States will no longer live off the savings of others (in the form of its own recycled dollars) nor have the money for unlimited military expenditures and adventures. </span><span>           </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>US officials wanted to attend the Yekaterinburg meeting as observers. They were told No. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is a word that Americans will hear much more in the future.</strong></span></span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>      </span></strong></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">The American Empire Is Bankrupt</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> <strong>By Chris Hedges</strong></span></p>
              <p>June 15, 2009 "Truthdig" --- This week marks the end of the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. It marks the start of a terrible period of economic and political decline in the United States. And it signals the last gasp of the American imperium. That’s over. It is not coming back. And what is to come will be very, very painful.<br><br>Barack Obama, and the criminal class on Wall Street, aided by a corporate media that continues to peddle fatuous gossip and trash talk as news while we endure the greatest economic crisis in our history, may have fooled us, but the rest of the world knows we are bankrupt. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And these nations are damned if they are going to continue to prop up an inflated dollar and sustain the massive federal budget deficits, swollen to over $2 trillion, which fund America’s imperial expansion in Eurasia and our system of casino capitalism. They have us by the throat. They are about to squeeze.</strong></span><br><br>There are meetings being held Monday and Tuesday in Yekaterinburg, Russia, (formerly Sverdlovsk) among Chinese President Hu Jintao, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and other top officials of the six-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The United States, which asked to attend, was denied admittance<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>. Watch what happens there carefully. The gathering is, in the words of economist Michael Hudson, “the most important meeting of the 21st century so far.” ...</strong></span></p>
              <p>...China, as Hudson points out, has already struck bilateral trade deals with Brazil and Malaysia to denominate their trade in China’s yuan rather than the dollar, pound or euro. Russia promises to begin trading in the ruble and local currencies. The governor of China’s central bank has openly called for the abandonment of the dollar as reserve currency, suggesting in its place the use of the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What the new system will be remains unclear, but the flight from the dollar has clearly begun. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The goal, in the words of the Russian president, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is to build a “multipolar world order” which will break the economic and, by extension, military domination by the United States. </strong></span></p>
              <p>China is frantically spending its dollar reserves to buy factories and property around the globe so it can unload its U.S. currency. This is why Aluminum Corp. of China made so many major concessions in the failed attempt to salvage its $19.5 billion alliance with the Rio Tinto mining concern in Australia.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It desperately needs to shed its dollars...</strong></span></p>
              <p>...<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“China is trying to get rid of all the dollars they can in a trash-for-resource deal,</strong></span>” Hudson said. “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They will give the dollars to countries willing to sell off their resources since America refuses to sell any of its high-tech industries, even Unocal, to the yellow peril. It realizes these dollars are going to be worthless pretty quickly</strong></span>.”...</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">The American Empire Is Bankrupt</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>By Chris Hedges</strong></span></p>
              <p>June 15, 2009 "Truthdig" --- This week marks the end of the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. It marks the start of a terrible period of economic and political decline in the United States. And it signals the last gasp of the American imperium. That’s over. It is not coming back. And what is to come will be very, very painful.<br><br>Barack Obama, and the criminal class on Wall Street, aided by a corporate media that continues to peddle fatuous gossip and trash talk as news while we endure the greatest economic crisis in our history, may have fooled us, but the rest of the world knows we are bankrupt. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And these nations are damned if they are going to continue to prop up an inflated dollar and sustain the massive federal budget deficits, swollen to over $2 trillion, which fund America’s imperial expansion in Eurasia and our system of casino capitalism. They have us by the throat. They are about to squeeze.</strong></span><br><br>There are meetings being held Monday and Tuesday in Yekaterinburg, Russia, (formerly Sverdlovsk) among Chinese President Hu Jintao, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and other top officials of the six-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The United States, which asked to attend, was denied admittance<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>. Watch what happens there carefully. The gathering is, in the words of economist Michael Hudson, “the most important meeting of the 21st century so far.” ...</strong></span></p>
              <p>...China, as Hudson points out, has already struck bilateral trade deals with Brazil and Malaysia to denominate their trade in China’s yuan rather than the dollar, pound or euro. Russia promises to begin trading in the ruble and local currencies. The governor of China’s central bank has openly called for the abandonment of the dollar as reserve currency, suggesting in its place the use of the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What the new system will be remains unclear, but the flight from the dollar has clearly begun.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The goal, in the words of the Russian president, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is to build a “multipolar world order” which will break the economic and, by extension, military domination by the United States.</strong></span></p>
              <p>China is frantically spending its dollar reserves to buy factories and property around the globe so it can unload its U.S. currency. This is why Aluminum Corp. of China made so many major concessions in the failed attempt to salvage its $19.5 billion alliance with the Rio Tinto mining concern in Australia.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It desperately needs to shed its dollars...</strong></span></p>
              <p>...<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“China is trying to get rid of all the dollars they can in a trash-for-resource deal,</strong></span>” Hudson said. “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They will give the dollars to countries willing to sell off their resources since America refuses to sell any of its high-tech industries, even Unocal, to the yellow peril. It realizes these dollars are going to be worthless pretty quickly</strong></span>.”...</p>

              <p>The slide was more the 30 years in the making from Jack Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, and after Reagan it was George H Bush Sr that could not get his act together to fix the US economy - when he had to settle the Kuwaiti Crisis caused by Saddam Hussein's invasion..</p>

              <p>You did say that - "<em>Bill Clinton did not even came close to clearing the trillon dollar debts left behind  by Reagan, he only balanced the budget and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">paid back some of it.</span></span></em> " - to a point, you are correct but perhaps way out in terms of the quantum reduced.</p>
              <p>Try digesting the following abstract from an assessment of the achievement about the Clinton-Gore Administration:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://clinton4.nara.gov/New/00BudgetFramework/budget_appendixA1.html">The debt held by the public is on track to be $2.4 trillion lower in 2000 than was projected when the President took office. In 1993, the debt held by the public was projected by the Office of Management and Budget to balloon to $5.85 trillion by 2000. Instead, shrinking deficits and growing surpluses in the last three years are projected to bring the debt down to $3.45 trillion in 2000 -- $2.4 trillion less than expected.  </a></p>
              <p>Perhaps you could notice the drifts and the flows in the relationship between the "debt and the deficits" ? </p>

              <p>So we can see that Bush's eight years in power and his aggressive pursuit to secure U.S hegemony and encirclement of Russia, China in eurasia has caused a reaction and forced the other powers to combine against the common threat.</p>
              <p>It is sad that these things are not covered in our state media as Lee Kuan Yew is pro west and an anglo dog, so most Singaporeans don't know what is going on in international affairs. He doesn't want to offend the USA.</p>
              <p>This is to be expected from Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>He is regarded as a british colonial stooge after all by other countries.</p>
