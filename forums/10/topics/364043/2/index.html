              <p>So we can see that Bush's eight years in power and his aggressive pursuit to secure U.S hegemony and encirclement of Russia, China in eurasia has caused a reaction and forced the other powers to combine against the common threat.</p>

              <p>Your continued shrill anti-USA statements can deflate the credibility mileage you have made with your other more sensible posts.</p>
              <p>Seriously, the BRIC is formed by a few disparate countries made up of Brazil, Russia, India and China; while India is not exactly an enthusiastic player but is happily present in response to the invitation by those recognised as the "<em>noveau riche</em>".</p>
              <p>Without the support from the other international bodies that combined bigger national groupings of regional countries, and international financial institutions - can any country or group of countries actually "de-dollarize" themselves from a global economy that has used the US Dollar as the International Currency of choice ?</p>
              <p>At best that BRIC can do for a start - is to conduct bilateral trade in their respective national currencies, with valuation of individual currencies being made by a weighted common basket of other currencies.</p>
              <p>The problem will still remain as to what will happen to the inheritor of the US Dollars dumped by BRIC or any other countries planning to move away from the Dollar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the US is planning domination and hegemony on the World Economy - it is odd that it should attempt to do so by puncturing its own economy through fiscal means.</p>

              <p>Important thing is to create multiple poles of power in the world so that USA can never establish their global hegemony again and to bring the neo-con dream of global hegemony to an end.</p>
              <p>Some elites and strategists in the USA are already coming to their senses, that is good sign for a peaceful world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The United States is a superpower in search of a strategy. Following the end of the Cold War, no new grand strategy has won the bipartisan support that underpinned America’s strategy of containment from President Truman to President Reagan. Enthusiastic promoters of globalization occasionally argue that international trade will be a panacea for conflict, at least among developed nations.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The neoconservative vision of unilateral US global hegemony always lacked adequate military forces and funding to realize its ambitious goals. </strong></span>Now, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, the hegemony strategy also lacks public support. Most critics of the hegemony strategy, however, have failed to propose a credible alternative capable of guiding US national security.<br><br>A new grand strategy for the United States should be compatible with the nation’s fundamental values and capable of achieving American goals in the world order that will emerge in the decades ahead.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Neither the strategy of US hegemony nor two proposed alternatives, neoisolationism and offshore balancing, meet these tests. </strong></span>The United States needs to prepare itself for a multipolar world in which it is not a solitary hegemon but rather one of several great powers, even if it is the most powerful for decades to come.</p>
              <p>And the United States has to prepare itself to cooperate in the interest of security with other major powers either as a member of a great-power concert or as a participant in an alliance against one or more powerful aggressors. Because similar military capabilities would be required in either a concert of power or a balance of power strategy, this approach can be defined as a concert-balance strategy for a multipolar world...</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Here is a summary of the USA neo-con strategy of worldwide global hegemony under the dominance of the USA, this was pursued by Bush:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A SHORT ANALYSIS OF THE US GLOBAL STRATEGY</strong></p>
              <p>By Ding Yuanhong<br><br>In the early 1990s, having won the Gulf War and achieved victory over the Cold War, the U.S. Administration proposed to establish “a new international order under the leadership of the United States”.</p>
              <p>The elements and essence of such a U.S. global strategy as enshrined in the proposal have been increasingly clear in the conduct of the administrations’ foreign policies in the past decade.</p>
              <p>To put it simply, the strategy aims at maintaining a lasting unique position of the United States as the world’s sole superpower by relying on its overall national strength, and in particular, the three-pronged superiority of enormous financial resources, advanced level of science and technology and overwhelming military power; it also aims at preventing the emergence of any nation or group of nations which might pose a threat to its “leadership role”, expanding its spheres of influence worldwide, and bringing many developing countries under its control through armed subversion or “democratic reform” in a world Pax Americanna. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For more than a decade the successive U.S. Administrations have not changed this strategy in implementation, though with changed tactics.</strong></span></span><br><br>An important element of the U.S. global strategy is to prevent the emergence of any new competitive opponent. The emphasis was initially on preventing the resurgence of Russia.</p>
              <p>It was explicitly noted in the Guideline of Defense Program formulated by the U.S. Administration in 1992: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Our primary goal is to prevent the emergence of the threat similar to that in scale posed by the Soviet Union on the soil of former Soviet Union or any other part of the world. … Our strategy must be focused on preventing the emergence of any potential global competitor.</strong></span></span>”</p>
              <p>Since the mid-1990s, especially after George W. Bush assumed office as President, the targets of prevention have increased as a result of the growth of the European Union and the sustained development of China.</p>
              <p>It was explicitly stated in the New American Century Agenda formulated by the powerful hawks in the Bush Administration before they went into the government: “The U.S. role of political leadership is higher than the United Nations … and the United States should persuade all developed countries not to reject our leading role and not to hope to play bigger regional roles.” The targets of prevention in reference here are self-evident. No wonder, pressed by the same powerful hawks, the Administration was to categorize China as a “strategic competitor” rather than a “strategic partner”.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To prevent the emergence of any competitive opponent which might pose a threat to its “leadership role”, the United States has adopted different policies towards different countries.</strong></span></span><br><br>1. To Russia:</p>
              <p>(1) Using NATO as the major tool to expand its sphere of influence eastward through establishing partnerships and increasing NATO membership, fostering opposition forces in the CIS countries, instigating “street revolutions” to overthrow their regimes, nibbling at the “buffer areas” surrounding Russia step by step, and further weakening Russia’s influence in those countries.</p>
              <p>(2) Withdrawing from the ABM treaty and signing a new, unequal nuclear strategic reduction treaty with Moscow, while beginning to build up its missile defense systems, preparing to resume nuclear tests, and further weakening Russia’s military capabilities while building up U.S. military superiority, and its nuclear monopoly in particular.</p>
              <p>(3)Taking advantage of Russia’s institutional reform with a view to imposing upon Russia the American-style development model that features democracy, freedom and privatization and has led to a drastic economic downturn, social disorder and continued political turbulence in Russia. As a result, Russia’s national strength has been greatly weakened.</p>
              <p>(4) Taking advantage of Russia’s complicated ethnic problems to connive and shield the secessionist forces in Chechnya who have been carrying out terrorist activities, undermining Russia’s domestic stability and national unity, and even seeking to dismember Russia.<br><br>2. To the European Union:</p>
              <p>(1) Taking advantage of its superior position in international finance to keep the Euro in an unstable status from the very beginning and making it difficult for the Euro to play its due role in promoting economic growth and weakening its challenge to the Dollar.</p>
              <p>(2) Making use of NATO to strengthen the US control over European countries, trying every possible means to prevent the EU from building up its independent defense capabilities, so that the EU would continue to be subordinated to the United States in the security area.</p>
              <p>(3) Retarding the pace of European integration process by adopting a policy of dividing the European Union, producing the concept of “Old Europe and New Europe”, trying to win over new EU members while pressuring old ones in order to “divide and rule” and impede European integration.</p>
              <p>(4) countering the EU “southward strategy” by proposing and implementing the Greater Middle East Plan across the entire Middle East region and North Africa in order to compete with EU for greater influence in all Arab countries peripheral to Europe.<br><br>3. To Japan:</p>
              <p>(1) Taking advantage of the superior position of the Dollar to force Japan to accede to the Square Agreement, causing a long-term recession of Japan’s economy and weakening its competitive edge over the United States.</p>
              <p>(2) Strengthening the U.S.-Japan security alliance in order both to control the buildup of Japan’s SDF and to keep the SDF under the tight control of the United States.</p>
              <p>(3) Taking advantage of Japan’s eagerness to become a “normal country” that would evolve from a mere economic giant into a political or even a military power, reducing Japan to a pawn or a junior partner in pursuit of the U.S. global strategy and, in particular, in maintaining the U.S. dominant position in Asia and the Pacific region and perpetually keeping Japan in a position subordinate to the United States.<br><br>4. To China:</p>
              <p>(1) Strengthening its military deployment in areas surrounding China, playing up the “China threat” to drive wedges in relations between China and its neighbors and trying hard to forge a strategic “encirclement” against China.</p>
              <p>(2) Taking Taiwan as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” to contain China, reinterpreting the “one China” principle by distorting the connotation of “Taiwan’s status quo”, and continuing to implement the Taiwan Relations Act and more arms sales to Taiwan in order to obstruct China’s peaceful reunification. To encourage the “democracy forces” in Hong Kong to disrupt social order and incite popular sentiments against the central government, re-precipitating the Korean nuclear crisis, linking Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea together to tighten its check on China.</p>
              <p>(3) Stepping up the infiltration activities in China in the name of “economic globalization” with a view to reaping more benefits and enhancing its influence, and trying to restrict energy supplies to China, destabilizing the RMB exchange rates, and jeopardizing China’s economic security in the energy and financial sectors which are critical to China’s modernization.</p>
              <p>(4) Interfering with and imperiling China’s domestic stability by playing up such issues as human rights, activities of the secessionist forces that seek independence of Tibet and Xinjiang, the “democracy movement” and the Falun Gong, etc.<br><br>II<br><br>Another major element of the U.S. global strategy is to expand its sphere of influence, seize strategic vantage points and get more access to energy and other important resources. This is mainly targeted at vast numbers of developing countries. The way to implement the strategy is to combine military means with non-military means.<br><br>1. Relying on its overwhelming military power and in the name of addressing ethnic and religious issues, human rights issues and counter-terrorism, the US interferes in the internal affairs of developing countries, encroaches upon their independence and sovereignty and even tries to overthrow legal governments by force so as to control these countries. In the past decades, the United States has launched one war after another in higher frequency than in any other period of history. The victims have all been developing countries.</p>
              <p>The Gulf War enabled the United States to control the Gulf region; the Kosovo War enabled the U.S. forces to get extended access to Eastern Europe; the Afghan War enabled the US to have military presence in Central Asia, on which the United States had set its eyes long before. It has also taken advantage to strengthen its military presence in Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The real aim of the US in launching the Iraqi War is to control areas of strategic importance and rich oil resources in the Middle East. In addition, the United States has military presence in the Red Sea and Africa, among other areas, in the name of countering terrorism.</p>
              <p>Recently, it has been aggressively seeking rights to deploy forces in the Malacca Strait – an area vital to the world economy. As for the political unrest in a good number of countries in recent years, it is attributable to US interference in internal affairs of those countries in greater or lesser degrees.<br><br>2. In the name of “economic globalization”, the United States has tried hard to persuade developing countries to adopt the American neo-liberal development model, which has given rise to economic crises, social unrest and political turmoil in many countries, thereby making them subordinate to the United States.</p>
              <p>The domestic turmoil in many African countries, the Southeast Asian financial crisis, unstable economic situation in some Latin American countries, and the severe setbacks suffered by the Central and Eastern European countries during the process of “economic transformation” in recent years are all attributable to the neo-liberalism sold by the United States. Even today, the Untied States is continuing to press developing countries to stick to this model, which will create more serious  economic difficulties and political unrest for those countries and further encroach upon their economic sovereignty and political security. As the Algerian President said, “Globalization is a hegemonic monster which will swallow the developing countries anyway.”<br><br>III<br><br>The 9/11 incident caused a huge shock to the United States. However, the United States has not changed its global strategy thereafter. The terror attacks provided a “reasonable” ready pretext for the United States to implement its global strategy. At present, the emphasis of the U.S. strategy is on the control and “reform” of the Middle East. This is the reason why the United States had targeted the Arab world from the very beginning as the focus of its “global counter-terror war”.</p>
              <p>The US assertion of “either with us or against us” was designed to intimidate other countries into accepting the U.S. strategic deployment. The argument that “terrorism in combination with proliferation of WMD” is a major threat to global security is a prescribed exaggeration. It can be used as a pretext to punish any country it chooses to free from the restraint of international law or norms governing international relations.</p>
              <p>It bypassed the United Nations in launching the Iraq war, threatened Syria and Iran militarily, and rekindled the Korean nuclear crisis. All this was based on the above-mentioned pretext. It also took the advantage to establish the kind of “non-proliferation regime” manipulated by itself outside the United Nations for the purpose of controlling global nuclear energy and its peaceful use outside the NPT framework.</p>
              <p>It is quite clear that the United States intends to press with its global strategy under the pretext of counter-terror and non-proliferation. When the US feels the need for cooperation from other major powers in countering terrorism, the United States seems to behave in a slightly more friendly way in bilateral relations with them. However, there has been no substantial change in the implementation of its policies. In a speech delivered at the World Economic Forum last year, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan criticized the United States for overemphasizing counter-terrorism.</p>
              <p>He pointed out that the danger to global security “comes not only from terrorism, but also from the methods of counter-terror wars”, “both international terrorism and counter-terror wars have the potential possibility to overturn the norms of conduct and the standards of human rights and would widen the cultural, religious and ethnic barriers.” He reiterated that global security should never be placed under the law of the jungle.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The U.S. global strategy directly impinges upon the independence, sovereignty and security of other countries. It is also the biggest threat to peace, stability and development of the world. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The implementation of such a strategy pits the United States against the people of the world and will surely arouse resistance in various forms from other countries. The evolution of the Iraq war and the resulting international reaction prove that “a just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support”.</p>
              <p>In the implementation of this strategy, the United States will become more and more isolated in the international community. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The United States, with its self-assumed overwhelming power, is extremely arrogant, trying to do whatever it wishes to. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>But it would only last a brief period of time, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>final outcome would be none other than “lifting the rock only to drop it on one’s own feet”. </strong></span></span>This is the iron law of history independent of human will.<br><br><br>Ding Yuanhong is former Ambassador of China to EU, Council Member of the CPIFA.</p>

              <p>Here is a summary of the USA neo-con strategy of worldwide global hegemony under the dominance of the USA, this was pursued by Bush:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A SHORT ANALYSIS OF THE US GLOBAL STRATEGY</strong></p>
              <p>By Ding Yuanhong<br><br>In the early 1990s, having won the Gulf War and achieved victory over the Cold War, the U.S. Administration proposed to establish “a new international order under the leadership of the United States”. The elements and essence of such a U.S. global strategy as enshrined in the proposal have been increasingly clear in the conduct of the administrations’ foreign policies in the past decade. To put it simply, the strategy aims at maintaining a lasting unique position of the United States as the world’s sole superpower by relying on its overall national strength, and in particular, the three-pronged superiority of enormous financial resources, advanced level of science and technology and overwhelming military power; it also aims at preventing the emergence of any nation or group of nations which might pose a threat to its “leadership role”, expanding its spheres of influence worldwide, and bringing many developing countries under its control through armed subversion or “democratic reform” in a world Pax Americanna. For more than a decade the successive U.S. Administrations have not changed this strategy in implementation, though with changed tactics.<br><br>I<br><br>An important element of the U.S. global strategy is to prevent the emergence of any new competitive opponent. The emphasis was initially on preventing the resurgence of Russia. It was explicitly noted in the Guideline of Defense Program formulated by the U.S. Administration in 1992: “Our primary goal is to prevent the emergence of the threat similar to that in scale posed by the Soviet Union on the soil of former Soviet Union or any other part of the world. … Our strategy must be focused on preventing the emergence of any potential global competitor.” Since the mid-1990s, especially after George W. Bush assumed office as President, the targets of prevention have increased as a result of the growth of the European Union and the sustained development of China. It was explicitly stated in the New American Century Agenda formulated by the powerful hawks in the Bush Administration before they went into the government: “The U.S. role of political leadership is higher than the United Nations … and the United States should persuade all developed countries not to reject our leading role and not to hope to play bigger regional roles.” The targets of prevention in reference here are self-evident. No wonder, pressed by the same powerful hawks, the Administration was to categorize China as a “strategic competitor” rather than a “strategic partner”.<br><br>To prevent the emergence of any competitive opponent which might pose a threat to its “leadership role”, the United States has adopted different policies towards different countries.<br><br>1. To Russia: (1) Using NATO as the major tool to expand its sphere of influence eastward through establishing partnerships and increasing NATO membership, fostering opposition forces in the CIS countries, instigating “street revolutions” to overthrow their regimes, nibbling at the “buffer areas” surrounding Russia step by step, and further weakening Russia’s influence in those countries. (2) Withdrawing from the ABM treaty and signing a new, unequal nuclear strategic reduction treaty with Moscow, while beginning to build up its missile defense systems, preparing to resume nuclear tests, and further weakening Russia’s military capabilities while building up U.S. military superiority, and its nuclear monopoly in particular. (3)Taking advantage of Russia’s institutional reform with a view to imposing upon Russia the American-style development model that features democracy, freedom and privatization and has led to a drastic economic downturn, social disorder and continued political turbulence in Russia. As a result, Russia’s national strength has been greatly weakened. (4) Taking advantage of Russia’s complicated ethnic problems to connive and shield the secessionist forces in Chechnya who have been carrying out terrorist activities, undermining Russia’s domestic stability and national unity, and even seeking to dismember Russia.<br><br>2. To the European Union: (1) Taking advantage of its superior position in international finance to keep the Euro in an unstable status from the very beginning and making it difficult for the Euro to play its due role in promoting economic growth and weakening its challenge to the Dollar. (2) Making use of NATO to strengthen the US control over European countries, trying every possible means to prevent the EU from building up its independent defense capabilities, so that the EU would continue to be subordinated to the United States in the security area. (3) Retarding the pace of European integration process by adopting a policy of dividing the European Union, producing the concept of “Old Europe and New Europe”, trying to win over new EU members while pressuring old ones in order to “divide and rule” and impede European integration. (4) countering the EU “southward strategy” by proposing and implementing the Greater Middle East Plan across the entire Middle East region and North Africa in order to compete with EU for greater influence in all Arab countries peripheral to Europe.<br><br>3. To Japan: (1) Taking advantage of the superior position of the Dollar to force Japan to accede to the Square Agreement, causing a long-term recession of Japan’s economy and weakening its competitive edge over the United States. (2) Strengthening the U.S.-Japan security alliance in order both to control the buildup of Japan’s SDF and to keep the SDF under the tight control of the United States. (3) Taking advantage of Japan’s eagerness to become a “normal country” that would evolve from a mere economic giant into a political or even a military power, reducing Japan to a pawn or a junior partner in pursuit of the U.S. global strategy and, in particular, in maintaining the U.S. dominant position in Asia and the Pacific region and perpetually keeping Japan in a position subordinate to the United States.<br><br>4. To China: (1) Strengthening its military deployment in areas surrounding China, playing up the “China threat” to drive wedges in relations between China and its neighbors and trying hard to forge a strategic “encirclement” against China. (2) Taking Taiwan as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” to contain China, reinterpreting the “one China” principle by distorting the connotation of “Taiwan’s status quo”, and continuing to implement the Taiwan Relations Act and more arms sales to Taiwan in order to obstruct China’s peaceful reunification. To encourage the “democracy forces” in Hong Kong to disrupt social order and incite popular sentiments against the central government, re-precipitating the Korean nuclear crisis, linking Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea together to tighten its check on China. (3) Stepping up the infiltration activities in China in the name of “economic globalization” with a view to reaping more benefits and enhancing its influence, and trying to restrict energy supplies to China, destabilizing the RMB exchange rates, and jeopardizing China’s economic security in the energy and financial sectors which are critical to China’s modernization. (4) Interfering with and imperiling China’s domestic stability by playing up such issues as human rights, activities of the secessionist forces that seek independence of Tibet and Xinjiang, the “democracy movement” and the Falun Gong, etc.<br><br>II<br><br>Another major element of the U.S. global strategy is to expand its sphere of influence, seize strategic vantage points and get more access to energy and other important resources. This is mainly targeted at vast numbers of developing countries. The way to implement the strategy is to combine military means with non-military means.<br><br>1. Relying on its overwhelming military power and in the name of addressing ethnic and religious issues, human rights issues and counter-terrorism, the US interferes in the internal affairs of developing countries, encroaches upon their independence and sovereignty and even tries to overthrow legal governments by force so as to control these countries. In the past decades, the United States has launched one war after another in higher frequency than in any other period of history. The victims have all been developing countries. The Gulf War enabled the United States to control the Gulf region; the Kosovo War enabled the U.S. forces to get extended access to Eastern Europe; the Afghan War enabled the US to have military presence in Central Asia, on which the United States had set its eyes long before. It has also taken advantage to strengthen its military presence in Southeast Asia. The real aim of the US in launching the Iraqi War is to control areas of strategic importance and rich oil resources in the Middle East. In addition, the United States has military presence in the Red Sea and Africa, among other areas, in the name of countering terrorism. Recently, it has been aggressively seeking rights to deploy forces in the Malacca Strait – an area vital to the world economy. As for the political unrest in a good number of countries in recent years, it is attributable to US interference in internal affairs of those countries in greater or lesser degrees.<br><br>2. In the name of “economic globalization”, the United States has tried hard to persuade developing countries to adopt the American neo-liberal development model, which has given rise to economic crises, social unrest and political turmoil in many countries, thereby making them subordinate to the United States. The domestic turmoil in many African countries, the Southeast Asian financial crisis, unstable economic situation in some Latin American countries, and the severe setbacks suffered by the Central and Eastern European countries during the process of “economic transformation” in recent years are all attributable to the neo-liberalism sold by the United States. Even today, the Untied States is continuing to press developing countries to stick to this model, which will create more serious  economic difficulties and political unrest for those countries and further encroach upon their economic sovereignty and political security. As the Algerian President said, “Globalization is a hegemonic monster which will swallow the developing countries anyway.”<br><br>III<br><br>The 9/11 incident caused a huge shock to the United States. However, the United States has not changed its global strategy thereafter. The terror attacks provided a “reasonable” ready pretext for the United States to implement its global strategy. At present, the emphasis of the U.S. strategy is on the control and “reform” of the Middle East. This is the reason why the United States had targeted the Arab world from the very beginning as the focus of its “global counter-terror war”. The US assertion of “either with us or against us” was designed to intimidate other countries into accepting the U.S. strategic deployment. The argument that “terrorism in combination with proliferation of WMD” is a major threat to global security is a prescribed exaggeration. It can be used as a pretext to punish any country it chooses to free from the restraint of international law or norms governing international relations. It bypassed the United Nations in launching the Iraq war, threatened Syria and Iran militarily, and rekindled the Korean nuclear crisis. All this was based on the above-mentioned pretext. It also took the advantage to establish the kind of “non-proliferation regime” manipulated by itself outside the United Nations for the purpose of controlling global nuclear energy and its peaceful use outside the NPT framework. It is quite clear that the United States intends to press with its global strategy under the pretext of counter-terror and non-proliferation. When the US feels the need for cooperation from other major powers in countering terrorism, the United States seems to behave in a slightly more friendly way in bilateral relations with them. However, there has been no substantial change in the implementation of its policies. In a speech delivered at the World Economic Forum last year, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan criticized the United States for overemphasizing counter-terrorism. He pointed out that the danger to global security “comes not only from terrorism, but also from the methods of counter-terror wars”, “both international terrorism and counter-terror wars have the potential possibility to overturn the norms of conduct and the standards of human rights and would widen the cultural, religious and ethnic barriers.” He reiterated that global security should never be placed under the law of the jungle.<br><br>The U.S. global strategy directly impinges upon the independence, sovereignty and security of other countries. It is also the biggest threat to peace, stability and development of the world. The implementation of such a strategy pits the United States against the people of the world and will surely arouse resistance in various forms from other countries. The evolution of the Iraq war and the resulting international reaction prove that “a just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support”. In the implementation of this strategy, the United States will become more and more isolated in the international community. The United States, with its self-assumed overwhelming power, is extremely arrogant, trying to do whatever it wishes to. But it would only last a brief period of time, and the final outcome would be none other than “lifting the rock only to drop it on one’s own feet”. This is the iron law of history independent of human will.<br><br><br>Ding Yuanhong is former Ambassador of China to EU, Council Member of the CPIFA.</p>

              <p>Great to see your due diligence in finding the sites to back-up your views, which unfortunately remains distorted by the skewed assumptions of cynics of the USA who are themselves the targets of the US policies.</p>
              <p>To begin with, these are not official US policies - but private agendas of George Bush, Dick Cheney and the Right Wing politicians in the Republican Party - all during the presidential term of the Republican Party since Ronald Reagan.</p>
              <p>If you note that since WW2 - the USA has always been the country called to bail out the weaker countries that had refused to prepare themselves against aggression, even when they lived amongst an aggressive gangster neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Since WW2 - the USA has been called repeatedly to involve themselves in wars that did not directly affect the USA - as in the Korea War, Vietnam War, Balkan Wars, Kuwait War, in Afghanistan, Iraq, and also minor skirmishes to liberate neighboring countries in the Carribean and Latin Americas that were held to ransom by gangsters - who refused to submit to democratic processes.</p>
              <p>In all, the USA had sacrificed more then a million young Americans since WW2.</p>
              <p>Should we fault the USA for their leaders dreaming up their private agenda in using their supreme power - after the fall of the Soviet Union - to prevent another political competitor to rival the USA on a global scale, who will dominate their neighbors and bring matters to a boil that require more US intervention, and the loss of more young American lives ?</p>

              <p>After repeatedly playing the "role of savior" since WW2 - and with the collapse of Communist Russia - the USA see itself in a unique position, which allow the USA with no other challenging power in the World - willing to stand up against tyranny and despotic syncopathic rulers - it had to rest on the USA again to take on the role of a "Super Hero".</p>
              <p>If the USA is made out to be no more then an untrustworthy nation with its own deliquent agenda to dominate the World - why will the US give themselves a dateline to withdraw from Iraq by 2012 ?</p>
              <p>If the USA had an agenda to dominate the World - why will it not go ahead and station more troops permanently in the hot desert of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Panama ?</p>
              <p>In fact, over the last 40 years - in all the areas of conflict that had involved US Military Power, we have instead seen US military withdrawing from the theatre after normalcy has been restored.</p>
              <p>Unless treaties have been signed with willing governments, there are no instances that resulted in the USA forcing its presence on any host countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this how a super power dominate the World and impose hegemony ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it better to have a super power that encourages "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the spread of democracy and the establishment of open economic systems</span></strong>" or allow dictatorial and autocratic Communist ideologies to dominate weak and hapless countries ?</p>
              <p>Do you believe yourself that the USA under Barack Obama-Joe Biden Government - will continue the policies espoused during the George Bush-Dick Cheney term ?</p>

              <p>Is Iraq any better during Saddam Hussein's rule with his sons playing havoc with Iraqi lives ? </p>
              <p>Democracy in Iraq today is still very much "works in progress" - and it will take Iraqi's own nationalism to develop the new Iraq without a domineering Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party to make democracy succeed.</p>
              <p>If it fails, the Iraqis have themselves to blame for not being able to take advantage of a window of opportunity to advance their nation to a higher political level.</p>
              <p>If the Sunnis and the Shiites prefer to kill each other - is it any fault of the USA - when the minority Sunnis have dominated the politics over a ruthlessly suppressed Shiite majority ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you forgotten Afghanistan ?</p>
              <p>Is Afghanistan much better under the rule of the Talibans, or are they better off today - after US Special Forces and the Air Force wiped them out of their stranglehold on helpless villages and cities ?</p>

              <p>...America's emergence as the sole global superpower <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>now makes an integrated and comprehensive strategy for Eurasia imperative.</strong></span></span>...<br><br>With Eurasia now serving as the decisive geopolitical chessboard, it no longer suffices to fashion one policy for Europe and another for Asia. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What happens with the distribution of power on the Eurasian landmass will be of decisive importance to America's global primacy and historical legacy.</strong></span></span>...<br><br>In a volatile Eurasia,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the immediate task is to ensure that no state or combination of states gains the ability to expel the United States </strong></span></span>or even diminish its decisive role...<br><br>A wider Europe and an enlarged NATO will serve the short-term and longer-term interests of U.S. policy. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A larger Europe will expand the range of American influence without simultaneously creating a Europe so politically integrated</strong></span></span> that it could challenge the United States on matters of geopolitical importance, particularly in the Middle East...<br><br>Accordingly, NATO and EU enlargement should move forward in deliberate stages. Assuming a sustained American and Western European commitment, here is a speculative but realistic timetable for these stages:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> By 1999, the first three Central European members will have been admitted into NATO, although their inclusion in the EU will probably not take place before 2002 or 2003; by 2003, the EU is likely to have initiated accession talks with all three Baltic republics,</strong></span></span> and NATO will likewise have moved forward on their membership as well as that of Romania and Bulgaria, with their accession likely to be completed before 2005; between 2005 and 2010, Ukraine, provided it has made significant domestic reforms and has become identified as a Central European country, should also be ready for initial negotiations with the EU and NATO...<br><br>Russia is more likely to make a break with its imperial past if the newly independent post-Soviet states are vital and stable. Their vitality will temper any residual Russian imperial temptations. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Political and economic support for the new states must be an integral part of a broader strategy for integrating Russia into a cooperative transcontinental system</strong></span></span>. A sovereign Ukraine is a critically important component of such a policy, as is support for such strategically pivotal states as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan...</p>

              <p>It is all part of a grand strategy to divide and control Eurasia, encircle Russia and China.</p>
              <p>War on terror, invasion of Afghanistan, kosovo, invasion of Iraq, colour revolutions to overthrow regimes, nuclear issue with Iran, expansion of NATO, military bases across eurasia, building of oil pipelines etc.</p>
              <p>It is all part of one big geopolitical strategy of USA to secure their status as sole global hegemonic superpower.</p>
              <p>This is what Russia, China and others are fighting against.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Your reference site was a late development from Obama's early effort in March 2009 - which already showed his intent at addressing the missile shield that had bothered the Russian so much:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4068869,00.html">Russian President Dimitry Medvedev's comments came in response to a New York Times report that US President Barack Obama had written a secret letter to his Russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield, which would be located mainly in Poland and the Czech Republic, in return for Moscow's help in stopping Iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons.  </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As matters stand, Russia and China has backed a US proposal to the UN Security Council to tighten sanctions against North Korea for her nuclear and missile tests - in May and June 2009 - made in total defiance to previous agreements during the Six Party Talks. </p>
              <p>The fact that such an outcome can happen is due to the changed policies that Obama had shown since he took over the presidency from George W Bush.</p>
              <p>This development already has put your narrow options on the skid, and based on Obama's track record at persistence and ability to win others over to his cause - the bet will be on him winning over the Russian and Chinese leadership to work with him in a spirit of co-operation and not along your line of a balance in mutual destruction.</p>

                  pipeline geopolitics between Turkey Washington and Moscow today has
                  elements of both. It is highly derivative in that the major actors
                  across Central Asia from China, Russia to Turkey are very much engaged
                  in a derived power game which has less to do with any specific state
                  and more to do with maintaining Superpower hegemony for Washington. </em></span></p>

                  the time of the Crimean War of 1853, Turkey has played a strategic role
                  in modern Eurasian and European developments. In the 1850’s Ottoman
                  Turkey became a target of Great Power imperial ambitions as Britain and
                  France sought to take advantage of tensions between Russia and the
                  Ottoman Empire in order to weaken and ultimately take vital parts of
                  that weakened empire. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Great
                  Powers of that time, the empires of Britain, France, Russia and Austria
                  began plotting the dismemberment of the vast Ottoman Empire. Debt was
                  their preferred instrument. The foreign debt situation in Ottoman
                  Turkey had become so extreme that Sultan Abdul Hamid II was forced by
                  his French and British creditors to put the entire finances of the
                  realm under the control of a banker-run agency in 1881, the Ottoman
                  Public Debt Administration (OPDA), controlled by the two largest
                  creditors—France and Britain. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By the late 1880’s a new player on the
                  Continent who was not part of this debt control, the German Reich,
                  engaged the Ottoman Empire economically. That strategically challenged
                  the vital imperial design of the most powerful empire of the day,
                  Britain. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> <span lang="EN-GB">After Britain
                  sank into a Great Depression after 1873, Germany’s industrial colossus
                  emerged as the fastest-developing economic power on earth with the
                  possible exception of then fledgling United States. The political and
                  economic fate of Germany and Ottoman Turkey were linked after 1899 with
                  the decision by German industry, Deutsche Bank to build a railway
                  connecting Berlin to the Ottoman Empire as far away as Baghdad in
                  then-Mesopotamia. It was a land bridge for trade between Ottoman Turkey
                  and Germany independent of British control of the seas.   </span></p>

                  had begun to look overseas for sources of raw materials as well as
                  potential markets for German goods. In 1894 German Chancellor, von
                  Caprivi, told the Reichstag, “Asia Minor is important to us as a market
                  for German industry, a place for the investment of German capital and a
                  source of supply, capable of considerable expansion, of such essential
                  goods as we now buy from countries of which it may well sooner or later
                  be in our interests to make ourselves independent.”  Caprivi was
                  supported by German industry, especially the steel barons, and by the
                  great banks such as Deutsche Bank. </span></p>

                  Berlin-Baghdad Railway linking the fate of Ottoman Turkey to that of

                  Britain to the First World War in a failed bid to preserve her global
                  hegemony. Turkey then as today was regarded by powerful Great Powers as
                  a “pivot” state. The danger in being a pivot state is, of course, the
                  question of who has their hands on it, who moves the pivot for their
                  own geopolitical purposes.</span></p>

                  which was to shape a history of two world wars and subsequent wars and
                  power relations. Mackinder, the father of geopolitics—the relation of
                  geography and political economy and power—developed the systematic
                  axiom of British imperial power. It was simple as it was fateful:</span></p>

                  Energy Minister and Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, discussions are
                  underway about a Blue Stream-2 project. It would be a new gas pipeline
                  parallel to Blue Stream, in addition to the construction of a gas
                  transportation system in Turkey by expanding Blue Stream to interlink
                  with the proposed Samsun-Ceyhan line, with a spur line under the
                  Mediterranean to Ashkelon in Israel. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Russia’s Prime
                  Minister Putin has also said he was counting on the support of Israel
                  in the construction of a new oil pipeline via Turkey and Israel. The
                  pipeline would link to the Samsun-Ceyhan oil pipeline, to be
                  constructed across the Red and Mediterranean seas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For Turkey,
                  which currently imports 90 % of its energy, the projects would provide
                  increased energy security and, in the case of the
                  Samsun-Ceyhan-Ashkelon pipeline, generate significant transit revenues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Discussions are
                  also underway on possible extending Turkey's gas lines across its
                  Thracian territory to supply neighbouring Balkan nations Bulgaria,
                  Serbia, Croatia and Hungary. In such an event, Moscow would have gained
                  a prime goal of lessening its dependency on the Ukrainian pipeline
                  network for transit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Russia also won
                  a tender for the construction of Turkey's first nuclear plant recently,
                  though final resolution is unclear at this time. Russia’s market also
                  plays a major role for Turkish overseas investments and exports. Russia
                  is one of the main customers for Turkish construction firms and a major
                  destination for Turkish exports. Similarly, millions of Russian
                  tourists bring significant revenues to Turkey every year. Importantly,
                  Turkey and Russia may start to use the Turkish lira and the Russian
                  ruble in foreign trade, which could increase Turkish exports to Russia.</span></p>

                  revived ‘Great Games’ in Eurasia during the 1990’s it seemed Turkey was
                  becoming once more Russia’s geopolitical rival as in the 19th Century.
                  Turkey’s quasi-alliance with Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Georgia led
                  Moscow until recently to view Turkey as a formidable rival. That is
                  changing significantly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Russian
                  President Dmitry Medvedev recently commended Turkey's actions during
                  the Russian-Georgian war of last summer, and Turkey's subsequent
                  proposal for the establishment of a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation
                  Platform (CSCP). The Russian President said the Georgia crisis had
                  shown their ability to deal with such problems on their own without the
                  involvement of outside powers. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Russian’s aim
                  is clearly to use its economic resources to counter what it sees as a
                  growing NATO encirclement, made dramatic by the Washington decision to
                  place missile and radar bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, as they
                  see it, aimed at Moscow. </strong></span></span>To date the Obama Administration has indicated
                  it will continue the Bush ‘missile defense’ policy. Washington also
                  just agreed to place US Patriot missiles in Poland, clearly not aimed
                  at Germany. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If Ankara moves
                  towards closer collaboration with Russia, Georgia's position is
                  precarious and Azerbaijan's natural gas pipeline route to Europe, the
                  Nabucco Pipeline, is blocked. If it cooperates with the United States
                  and manages to reach a stable treaty with Armenia under US auspices,
                  the Russian position in the Caucasus is weakened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The strategy
                  for Washington to bring Germany into closer cooperation with the US is
                  to weaken German dependence on Russian energy flows. With the recent
                  Obama visit to Ankara, Washington is evidently attempting to win
                  Turkish support for its troubled Nabucco alternative gas pipeline
                  through Turkey from Azerbaijan which would potentially lessen EU
                  dependence on Russian gas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Turkey is one
                  of the only routes energy from new sources can cross to Europe from the
                  Middle East, Central Asia or the Caucasus. If Turkey decides to
                  cooperate with Russia, Russia retains the initiative. Since it became
                  clear in Moscow that US strategy was to extend NATO to Russia’s front
                  door via Ukraine and Georgia, Russia has moved to use its economic
                  “carrot” its vast natural gas resources, to at the very least
                  neutralize Western Europe, especially Germany, towards Russia.</span></p>

                  question of Turkish-EU relations is linked with the issue of Turkish
                  membership into the EU, a move vehemently opposed by France and also
                  less openly so by Germany, and strongly backed by Washington. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Washington is
                  clearly playing what some call ‘a deeper game.’ Obama’s backing for
                  Turkey’s application for EU membership comes with a heavy price. As the
                  US is no member of the EU it was an attempt to try to curry favor with
                  the Erdogan government. Since the April Obama visit, Ankara has begun
                  to discuss an agreement with Armenia including diplomatic relations. </span></p>

                  strategically vital area has been unstable. Russian troops remain in
                  South Ossetia. Russia also has troops in Armenia meaning Russia has

                  and an alternative route for natural gas to Europe becomes available,
                  reducing Russian leverage with Western Europe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This past March
                  a memorandum was signed between the Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR

                  Russia by January 2010. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Azerbaijan is
                  the only state outside Iran that would likely supply gas to the planned
                  EU Nabucco pipeline from Azerbaijan through Turkey to south-eastern
                  Europe. Russia has proposed South Stream as an alternative to the
                  Nabucco project, also in need of Azerbaijan gas, so in effect Russia
                  weakens the chances of realization of Nabucco.</span></p>

              <p><strong>China's embrace of multilateral institutions: from a have-to to an active diplomacy</strong></p>
              <p>June 23, 2009</p>
              <p><span>The just-concluded two grand performances
              with multilateral diplomacy on a full-scale display in Russia's
              Yekaterinburg—9th summit of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and
              the first ever BRICs formal meeting, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>are both intended to
              counterbalance the Western hegemony, and particularly the superpower
              clout of the U.S</strong></span>., despite the fact that the two could be summoned with
              different viewpoints and pointing to different objectives. And in the
              backdrop of the economic downtrend, the effects ensuing the two
              meetings could ripple all the way through the whole globe. The summits
              may again focus the world attention upon the emerging economies with
              China in the spotlight.<br><br>Admittedly, some achievements are still
              beyond attainment for SCO summit and BRICs meeting. But they did
              contribute a lot to expanding the regional political and security
              cooperation and catalyzing the maturity of the nascent economic blocs.
              ‘The organization has already played an essential part in building up
              the security and cooperation framework in Asia-Pacific region,' as
              manifested in the SCO's statement. In comparison, BRICs are less
              significant and more symbolic as a multilateral institution, yet its
              coming into being will provide an alternative power distribution to
              challenge today's notoriously unjust and unfair world power structures.<br><br>Likewise,
              China's interest in multilateral diplomacy and multilateral
              institutions has correspondingly grown with its elevation of national
              strength and confidence. In 1950s through to 1960s, China mainly
              adopted bilateral diplomacy as the core of its foreign policies, for
              the new republic then was economically backward, remained skeptical to
              multilateral institutions and therefore stayed away from them for the
              sake of its national security. The policy of reform and opening up
              adopted in late 1970s not only brought about a major change to the
              country's political skyline, but to its diplomatic facets as well.
              Little by little, China has since embraced multilateral diplomacy. And
              in recent years, with the globalization and market
              internationalization, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>China is getting more active than ever in
              participating in the multilateral system, which it deems a decisive
              step to go global, and has thus far been admitted to more and more
              international or regional economic institutions. </strong></span><br><br>That said,
              China is still seen reluctant to join in the multilateral security and
              political institutions, considering its domestic pressure for economic
              growth and a desirable need for a peaceful outside environment to
              ensure the fulfillment of its development goals. That explains why for
              years China has invariably remain neutral in dealing with international
              affairs, as a high-profile appearance would possibly perch it at the
              heart of confrontations, and China at the time could not afford to
              derail off the track endeavoring to regain its status as a world power.
              <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unfortunately, the deteriorating international political and
              economic conditions have repeatedly compel China to decide whether it
              would remain silent on the world stage or make a distinct utterance
              letting its voice be heard. Henceforth, China had to apply itself to
              the international game dominated by others.</strong></span> In 2001, China was dragged
              in SCO, and in 2003, it was pushed to the front to stage the Six Party
              Talks, both in response to the international pressure and also for the
              consideration of its own security. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The U.S-born credit
              crisis paralyzed financial market and triggered a globe-sized
              recession. And further more, the weakening dollar, as well as the
              irresponsible steps taken by Washington to shift its own troubles to
              others, has already dealt a harsh blow to the Chinese capital pegged to
              dollar. In order to get rid of the destructive effects, China has to
              again join in the chorus combating the dollar hegemony along with other
              emerging economies. </strong></span><br><br>The increasing popularity of multilateral
              institutions, and the fact that Beijing is growing up to be a visible
              player in multilateral cooperation on various occasions, might have
              prompted China to reset its diplomatic strategies, as a new phenomenon
              seen currently in many of the international events indicates China is
              now prepared to play a more active and substantial role and, in a
              departure from its stereotyped international image, seeking to voice
              its opinions. <br><br>Multilateral mechanism is likely to be a
              double-edged weapon, bringing more opportunities as well as more
              challenges. But it turns out to be an irreversible tendency now, and in
              a long run, multilateral participation will benefit China in its
              strategies gearing up to a peaceful rise. Additionally, only through
              partaking in the multilateral institutions, can emerging economies
              possess the likelihood to alter the existing international power
              structures and operating rules. The transfer and redistribution of the
              global power will be the only access to globalization. The multilateral
              mechanism will help express this common aspiration of the emerging
              economies. </span></p>
