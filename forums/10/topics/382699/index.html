              <p>In countries like Australia, where globalisation has been firmly established, integration has not been known to work, even among the migrant population, Enclaves of like minded community people have formed. The locals have refused to integrate even though locals get more welfare and subsidies, But in SG, why would it work when integration has failed in welfare countries where migrants pay tax to support locals?</p>
              <p>its not that the foreigners here are paying taxes to support locals.  In fact its the other way round, the locals are getting disadvantaged compared to the migrants. In this situation, why is a 10 million dollar fund set up to integrate foreigners with locals?</p>
              <p>as one may argue that it may be done in good faith to preserve racial harmony, but one overlooked factor is the foreigners have not grown up in racial harmony, wheres Singaporeans since young have integrated well with  communities  other than their own, so long as it was local. With tensions running high in the social scene, due to inflation in housing prices, price hikes and job stability, will locals ever will depend on foreigners from 3rd world countries? For one, locals are very much attracted to western nations to work and study and integrate in those countries rather than in singapore where majority of foreigners are from the surrounding 3rd world nations.</p>
              <p>Is there any strong feasibility studies done on the viability and merits of such a integration plan?</p>
              <p>Announcing a tax payer funded integration fund adds fuel to fire. Thats the result it has achieved so far.</p>
