            <div class='col-md body'>It is with great surprise that with the planned opening of Singapore's new budget terminal at Changi Airport, only Tiger airways has plans to move into the facility.<br><br>Valueair, Jetstar etc have opted not to transfer operations as yet.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Said Minister of State for Transport Ms Lim Hwee Hua, "The business model of low-cost carriers is also still evolving. As such, some of these carriers may prefer to continue to use Changi's main terminals as it fits in better with their business model, despite the fact that they will have to incur higher operating costs. For example, some carriers currently have arrangements to transfer passengers to other airlines at the main terminals, unlike the typical low-cost carrier, which focuses on end-to-end traffic." </span></strong><br><br>No marketing plan or failed plan to entice budget carriers to use the budget terminal? And if Tiger Airways thumbs down the terminal, will it become another white elephant? It seems unusual that so much is riding on a 'guinea pig' review to ascertain ratings rather than aggressive marketing to attract clients, especially for a multi-million dollar expenditure.<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/192969/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/192969/1/.html</a><br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/95763.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/95763.asp</a><br><br><a href="http://www.bizbuzzmedia.com/blogs/airline/archive/2006/01/09/1019.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.bizbuzzmedia.com/blogs/airline/archive/2006/01/09/1019.aspx</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Singapore is dragging its feet over the Budget terminal because it poses the same problem as the Causeway. We are expanding our Orchard shopping belt and building IRs, then you develop a budget terminal.<br><br>Who will want to pay for trips to IRs or even shopping when you can just hop on a plane and fly to somewhere where you can get better bang for your buck?<br><br></div>
