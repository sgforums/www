              <h1>Evolution of the Singaporean: From lesser mortals to sheep and donkeys</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 29, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Once upon a time, Singaporeans are proud citizens of their own country under the leadership of the capable and charismatic Lim Chin Siong who spoke up fearlessly for the common folks in the streets.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Everything were to change on a fateful day in 1962 where Lim and his colleagues from the opposition Barisan Sosialist were hauled up and detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) without trial.</p>
              <p>With the opposition crippled, the PAP went on the win the election in 1963 and subsequent elections from then on and with each single electoral victory, they consolidated their power and extended its influence to almost every institution in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Today, there is not a single institution in Singapore, be it the media, police, trade unions, grassroots organizations, or civil society which is left untouched by the PAP.</p>
              <p>Hitler, Lenin, Stalin and Mao would have been proud of their erstwhile successor Lee Kuan Yew in their graves – for he had surpassed of their accomplishments of establishing complete authority and control over a nation under the guise of democracy.</p>
              <p>Over the years, Singaporeans had their civil and political rights curtailed and robbed from them one by one.</p>
              <p>In the past, a gathering of more than 5 people is illegal; today even a solo protest is outlawed. Singapore used to have a vibrant media landscape with a few major papers; they are all owned by one single news agency SPH now which is controlled indirectly by the PAP.</p>
              <p>All the grassroots organizations are de facto PAP’s branches in the community as admitted by Lee himself recently when he boasted ashamedly to a delegation of officials from China that “all CCs, CCCs and RCs are part of the PAP.”</p>
              <p>The police has become the security apparatus of the ruling party to clamp down on political dissent. While Singaporeans were arrested and jailed for legitimate political activities such as distributing flyers in public, police stood idly by and allowed foreigners to protest on our own soil.</p>
              <p>With no opposition in parliament and no credible alternative in sight, Singaporeans have little choice but to lend their support to the PAP year after year.</p>
              <p>After the 2006 general elections, the PAP leaders gave themselves an astronomical pay rise and threatened to leave for the private sector if Singaporeans do not accede to their demands. (not that they can anyway).</p>
              <p>Lee claimed that without paying him and his subordinates millions of dollars a year, the country will lose billions of dollars under an “incompetent” government.</p>
              <p>A year later, Singapore’s sovereign wealth funds GIC and Temasek lost a few billion dollars in failed overseas investment, but both Lee and his daughter-in-law remain in charge of our nation’s coffers to this very day.</p>
              <p>Only then did we realize that we are no longer citizens of Singapore, but “lesser mortals” as pointed out rightly by a PAP MP Charles Chong.</p>
              <p>There are two classes of people in Singapore – the ruling elites and the rich who benefit the most from the nation’s economic growth during the last decade and the “lesser mortals” who have to slog hard like dogs day in and out just to feed themselves.</p>
              <p>It is hardly surprising that Singapore’s income gap between the rich and poor has widened over the past few years while the standard of living has dropped for ordinary Singaporeans – the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</p>
              <p>Again, Singaporeans have little choice but to stick to the PAP because Lee warned that if we do not so do, our wives and daughters will become maids in other countries.</p>
              <p>We have been turned into a flock of sheep following our leaders blindly wherever they lead us to, be it heaven or hell. One Senior Minister described himself and his colleagues as “lions” leading us, but the reality is – they are no more than sheep themselves being led through their noses by the only “lion” permitted to exist in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans trust the PAP to give them another overwhelming “mandate” in the 2006 elections after which Prime Minister Lee opened the floodgates to immigrants and the sheep found themselves being swarmed by jackals, rats and vultures.</p>
              <p>Being pushed to the brink with nowhere to go, even sheep will protest. To their dismay, the PAP will hear no more of their whining and they are now relegated to being “donkeys” according to the words of one PAP member.</p>
              <p>That’s all Singaporeans have evolved from citizens to lesser mortals to sheep and donkeys in less than one generation.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew said in a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine that if Singaporeans do not have the “spurs stuck in their hide”, it is our problem.</p>
              <p>Which animal has the thickest hide in the world?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans must have the thickest “hide” in the world for after all the ruling party has done to trample on their rights, dignity and egos, they will still return it to power in the next election.</p>
              <p>As Lee himself said lately, Singaporeans must be “daft” if they have the temerity to cast a protest vote against him and his party in the next election. He cannot have put it more succinctly.</p>
              <p>After all, the grand  “forecaster extraordinarie” has predicted that the PAP will win the next two elections hands down.</p>
              <p>When happens next?</p>
              <p>The PAP will no longer exist by then for their name will be changed to FAP or “Foreigner Action Party” which will finally complete the evolutionary journey of the hapless, pathetic and daft Singaporean.</p>

              <p>the Barisan guys were arrested in 1962, before S'pore got independent.............did the British order their arrests.........if so then the Brits did what they did worldwide when they allowed their former colonies to go independent..............they made sure the new people in power were still under British control.............</p>
