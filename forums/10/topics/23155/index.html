And the government doesnt even care if people has strong objections to certain changes (eg fare hike, CPF, parking fees, night ERP, GST, etc etc) They are just too high and mighty to reverse these changes, perhaps afraid to leave the impression that they are not decisive enuff or afraid to lose authority.

Nothing in this world is garunetted.... where got such thing? Even if u buy a product seldom got life time garunette.. got to work for it man. Well personally would u rather have some other countries rule us.. Malaysia, Indon or china? Look where the country are now? Or maybe u guys like to be ruled by UK or USA.. got pension scheme so got free money good rite.but u guys never look at the bad side of things .lolz I'm not really Pro-PAP they got some good things going and there are bad things too but no one's perfect.  But look at some of the opposition candidates.. Dr Chee Soon Juan geeezsh what a character !! Think he will make a good PM? Beside Mr Chaim and Mr Low don't see any other good ones around. Coming back to NSF hey NDP who do u think besides Mindef got the capaibility to organise it?don't think any private company go the power to pull so many strings. Must be a govt one... and the biggest of them all??&gt;&gt;&gt;Mindef. Hey NDP wasn't that bad although burnt many suns but still got off and free food(always got extra) plus the occasion babe. Get to get out of camp too it beats any shit job i got Beside me rather go do NDP then spent 4 days 3 nites seeing stars in Choa Chu Kang or Mandai or doing PT. Don't think I remember any civilian guy got called back to prepare for NDP as a NS man. Well the Problem now is that spore is too small and is now too saturated in almost every industry don't u think? Govt planning wasn't really good should have saw the recession years coming, But at least NS wasn't that bad.. less worries then don't u think? mon-sat in camp, book out chiong.. or work part-time then book in again. kiannia not like now must worry abt so many bills and savings.. But ain't complain and there is no use complaining.. Chin up.. always think of a better tomorrow.<br><br>Cheers guys <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway <strong>User Name</strong>, I have no objections about a female being my superior but I do beilieve the govt can control the whole private sector pay scale. Don't u see that there are so many govt agencies undergoing "re-structuring" now esp in these dark times? What they do is that they re-trench workers and re-employing them at a different pay scale. Besides u can't blame employers the Singaporean mentality esp the chinese always wants to go for cheap labours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I used to come from a combat unit and was involved one of the NDP parades although my friends and I always bitch about the reharsals but to me personally it beats outfield excercises anytime. I do beileve that I will always be welcome back into the army if u enquire the pay in the combat forces these days are now quite comparable to maket rates. But I'm getting a better rate outside and there is no need for me to be on call 24-7 why should I go back . lolz Everyone wants to turn back time don't u think...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

[/b]</blockquote>I am not talking about a female being my superior. Please dont mis-understand this to be a sexist comment. I am talking about the time we lost while serving NS, and when we are out starting a career, people from your same batch (be it the girls or foreigners who doesnt need to serve NS) would have had 2~3 years experience already. They would probably be your superior by the time u start work. 2~3 years is too much time wasted for a young man.<br><br>Another common misconception is that ORD-ed guys will get slightly higher pay. You have to realise that this is not true all the time (should I say MOST of the time, it isnt true).<br><br>As for NDP 'cheap labour', I've said it - it's ok if you are in NSF, what if you're not?<br><br>Also, alot of NSF/Men I know get some kindof injury- some more serious than others. Alot of people have backaches, hearing problems, leg injuries, etc etc...<br><br>To be fair, it is true that NSMen get some rebates for INCOME TAX, and also abit more of that New Singapore Share, but this is just a small amount of money. Remember the days when you get $200 for a full month of 'cheap labour' during NSF? Ok lar...
