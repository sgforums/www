U seem to mean that it comes naturally that NS means doing cheap labour? Shouldnt we be training in NS? We serve in NS not to work as cheap labourers. Get it clear.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Singaporeans not doing NS? Nan, they're too choosy, look at the times now when the economy is bad, sporeans are still picking and choosing jobs. </strong></blockquote>Yup, as the Govt mentioned, there are so many open positions in the shipyard - the Govt have done their part in creating job oppotunities, its just that the people are choosy. Yeah, RIGHT. Wait a minute - shipbuilding? Now... How many people knows about shipbuilding? Would a qualified/ experienced  professional, who is NOT trained in this field, want to work in shipbuilding as a <strong>Junior</strong> shipbuilding mechanic? Most people would want to have a career relevant to what they study/ their experience. Who prefers to work in a job where u totally know nuts about?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Foreign workers, since they offered the cheapest rate? I would agree if all of the "NS cheap labour" thinkers here dun mind putting their money i.e. taxpayers money into foreign economy. </strong></blockquote>Nahh.... Why should we pay foreigners for cheap labour? No lar. <strong>WE</strong> should be the ones doing the cheap labour. How about letting the foreigners take up professional positions in our own country? Come to think of it... they already did. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><strong>Is 2.5 years of NS too long?

Well, the Govt decides on everything here, and it's final. When did the people's views matter anyway? (eg. price hike).<br><br>BTW, if u have not yet noticed, this is a message board where we share our views. I believe everyone has the right to give their comments. Nobody claimed they have the authority to decide. Some people commented that NS should be shorter, u have a problem with that?<br><br><blockquote><strong>In spore, you can be an officer in a short 10.5 months in OCS. Do u know how long it takes to to make an officer in the US? Do u know how long it takes for a Thai solder to be made a 2LT?</strong></blockquote>And the point is???<br><br>Remember most of us are NOT REGULARS! If NS is really ONLY a short duration, shouldnt we be making the most of our time training instead of doing cheap labours? <strong>THAT</strong> is why I feel that NS can be shortened.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The best defender of the state is a citizen with a physically and mentally fit body.

We can always expect a loyal citizen to fight hard for his country.  If the people keep feeling that they are being taken for granted, that their views make no difference in any decision made, how long do u think they will remain loyal?<br><br><blockquote><strong>To quote from a Chinese "Wan4 shi4 nan2 chio2 wan2 mei3" translated into "Hard to wish for perfection in everything" there is no perfection in everything. Even the best diamond has its faws. NS may be youth robbing, time wasting, but can singaporeans do without it? You dare to try?</strong></blockquote>That's why we are saying that NS <strong>CAN</strong> be shorter - there shouldnt be any time wasting isnt it? Youth is precious, some people have better things to do than setting up NDP seats.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,not every youth are sent to set up ndp seats.<br>And what makes you think that 1.5 years is enough to complete training?Aside from your basic skills,which you learn in the first 1.5 years, there is also the vocational skills, where you learn to apply those skills.Of course there are festivals like NDP ,but doesn't it beats bashing through the jungle in brunei?<br><br>In many countries such as Korea and Isreal, where conscription is a norm, 2.5 years is a standard.Tell me any countries that trains for a shorter period of time.<br><br>The world of a soldier does not totally revolve around combat. Many adminstrative staff have to be done too.And stop complaining that you are being a slave to the government, setting up seats for NDP etc .In countries such as Thailand, soldiers are expected to do farming too.Arn't we better off then them in some ways?<br><br>Well, just my two cents worth.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, its good to see that we have very passionate and vocal pple.<br><br>First thing on length of service: It is gonna be increased. I have a reliable source and yeah. they are gonna increase it. I have reasons to support such a statement. It was during the Parliament that it was announced that there was gonna be a pay increase for all NSFs, a big one too. Yeah! finally, after so long. But wait... something's not rite! All the things which were announced in Parliament, came in pairs meaning, one good, one bad. Its a natural thing with the government, give and take. Eg: Car costs go down, COE down but car Maintenance goes up. Next, GST hike but corporate taxes go down etc... BUT NSFs pay increase.. hey whats the catch? there is a catch, juz that the reaction would be too great and vocal if they said that the length of service was gonna increase too! Nothing is free one way, being a singaporean u should know! So the increase in pay had to be given first, then slowly later, slowly, we will be psychoed that 3 yrs is good for us. Ha! I am in the Army, NSF, a finance clerk and the finance system had some modifications which would say the same too juz that it would be too difficult to explain.<br>The 2nd reason why i say the length of service will increase: get this! IT HAS ALREADY BEEN AFFECTED ON A SMALL GRP OF NSFs. I can't reveal much, but my fren has been affected, of course with a much higher pay. So sooner or later, it will affect the whole country.<br>3rd Reason: Increasing the pay during a time of recession and re-structuring of government policies? Have u any idea how much MORE the government has to fork out to pay us? its really really a lot more. we are not juz gonna get something for free.. Do your own thinking and reason out!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2nd thing on why we need to serve: remember this: one soldier protectin his land is stronger than 10 hired merceneries! Not to sound grand or anything but we are here we are cause our predecessors suffered in NS and maybe our fighting force sux and can nvr stand up against the enemy but at least there is a deterent act. They gave up their time and effort for the singapore then, why not us now and our future generations ahead? I have benifitted much from NS, i have matured alot and though i sometimes can't stand it and some of the stupidity which i see in the system, i can't hide the fact that i have learnt alot from being here. my frens who have completed NS and went to uni, they say that the lectures prefer to teach and converse with males as we are more mature,<br>not only cause of our age but what we have been through in NS. Think of this lah: We have to do NS, no matter what u do unless u leave singapore, So why not make the best out of it? learn from it. There are many things to learn. From a clerk's point of view, the lowest and treated the worse, we clerks are looked down but hey, am i going to fret over this and feel demoralised and put on the cant-be-bothered attitude? NO! i am going to learn as much as possible, and u guys in NS should too, no matter what vocation u are. Not only learn from what u do in the vocation but also those important values like treasuring the good times u had as a civilian, better appreciation of your family memebers, gf? NS will make u grow into a real man only if u wish it to, or u can waste away and make the worse out of it! The choice is yours, you can choose!<br><br>Job security: There is no such thing as that. Only simple minded pple think that the government owes them a living. u gonna remember this hard: ' NO ONE OWES U A LIVING' remember that, so stop whining about not guranteed a job cause there is no such thing. The real smart singaporeans know that the fundamental law of nature is in effect :' The strong shall live, the weak will die: Survival of the FIttest' u wanna get good jobs? work for it, show that u can do it! those whining are the weak, alwaz opening their mouth, hoping that someone can drop food into it. I use metaphors to help better relate. In conclusion: u better work hard and smart to get better jobs. No one owes u a living. If i am a boss, why should i bother about whether someone is local or foreign? i only care to choose the better one. The government is trying to drive such a point into pple, but it does it in such a nice and innocuous way that pple dun get its point. They still think that the government owes them a living, esp males, cause u did NS? so? big f**k? A layman is constrained by his environment. A great man works his way around his environment. U choose waht u wanna be: Survive or die!<br><br>i have said alot and bottom line is:<br>1. Alwaz be positive<br>2. Learn from any situation<br>3. No one owes u a living<br>4. Survival of the fittest<br>5. Good luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very well-said, metalgear. Those people who whine about NS are usually selfish people. In their mind, they only know something as "me, and only me". They do not know that to achieve great things, there is a need for self-sacrifice.<br><br>To those who think that 2.5 yrs of NS is too long, tell me then what do you intend to do for those time if NS was indeed reduce? Get drunk and get laid in pubs? Don't tell me any crap about looking for a better job or studying. This is because look around you, most people at that age don't even need to worry about their family. All they know is that at that age, they want to have as much fun as possible. Do you think a male yuppie at that age give a shit about his family? More likely, he is thinking of using that money to buy some new gadgets for himself. If he is thinking of getting a good job and help the less fortunate, that's a different story.<br><br>In my opinion, 2.5 yrs of my overall lifespan in serving my country at one time is nothing at all. At that time, I am at my best physically and mentally so all the more I should go and serve. Yes, NDP is not a nice job, but why can't you look at it in a more optismistic way? Can you imagine the manpower, logistics planning? Don't look upon yourself as another small fry following orders. Look upon it as your chance to contribute to the making of celebrating Singapore Independence. So ask yourself, is contributing your 2.5 yrs in NS less important than having fun enjoying your "youth"? For those who answer yes, you are just another bunch of people who view Singapore Independence as less important than yourself and your own enjoyment.<br><br>As for job security, I concurred with Metalgear. In this world, no one owes you a living. So what if someone has a few more years of working experience than you? If you have the ability, then likewise promotion and pay increment will come your way. Don't be a green eyed monster whinning about foreigners taking your job. Prove to them that you can do it.</div>

Mark out the position of the NDP or setting up seat in NDP?<br><br><strong>To those who think that 2.5 yrs of NS is too long, tell me then what do you intend to do for those time if NS was indeed reduce? Get drunk and get laid in pubs? Don't tell me any crap about looking for a better job or studying. This is because look around you, most people at that age don't even need to worry about their family. All they know is that at that age, they want to have as much fun as possible. Do you think a male yuppie at that age give a shit about his family? More likely, he is thinking of using that money to buy some new gadgets for himself. If he is thinking of getting a good job and help the less fortunate, that's a different story.</strong><br><br>This sort of thinking only applies to you. You really think that everybody aren't matured enough at that age like you? NS is extremely good for immature people like you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>In my opinion, 2.5 yrs of my overall lifespan in serving my country at one time is nothing at all. At that time, I am at my best physically and mentally so all the more I should go and serve. Yes, NDP is not a nice job, but why can't you look at it in a more optismistic way? Can you imagine the manpower, logistics planning? Don't look upon yourself as another small fry following orders. Look upon it as your chance to contribute to the making of celebrating Singapore Independence. So ask yourself, is contributing your 2.5 yrs in NS less important than having fun enjoying your "youth"? For those who answer yes, you are just another bunch of people who view Singapore Independence as less important than yourself and your own enjoyment.</strong><br><br>wat fun is there in 'youth'? Once you've step out of school and enter the working life. All the fun ceases and the problems start coming in... we have more realistic things to worry about then setting up NDP seats.<br><br><strong>As for job security, I concurred with Metalgear. In this world, no one owes you a living. So what if someone has a few more years of working experience than you? If you have the ability, then likewise promotion and pay increment will come your way. Don't be a green eyed monster whinning about foreigners taking your job. Prove to them that you can do it.</strong><br></blockquote>easy said that done. if you're the boss of DEF company. You have 2 interviewees for you to choose. Candidate A has 2 years of experience, extensive portfolio of his past works with previous company but with average academic grades. Candidate B has 0 years experience(industrial attachment not valid as experience), only few portfolio with attachment companies and some temporary assignments but with higher than average academic grades. Tell me honestly who will you choose and WHY??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Centaur<br><br>When I mentioned great things, I mean the great things which a person is able to achieve for himself (it can be career or even doing something great and noble for a country). How often and how long is each NDP preparations carried out? At most 3 months per year. And for your info, it is not the whole SAF which is doing the preparations. The units are rotated each year so, in actual fact, a unit may undertake NDP preparations at most 2 times in each 2.5 yrs of NSF. In a Stephen Ambrose book "Band of Brothers", the soldiers did not participate in war all year round. During "lull" period, they have to build houses and facilities. So does that mean their service to their country should be shorten so that they only need to concentrate on fighting?<br><br>Just think, continuous training for 1.5 years, any soldier will break down both physically and mentally. The idea of performing some other logistical or adminstrative work is firstly to reduce training fatigue. Next, to reduce dependence of external agencies to handle the work. If SAF have to employ external agencies to deal with every administrative and logistical work, then SAF might as well scrap G1 and G4 branches. Not to mention the increase in expenditure for  these external agencies. Should this happen, who do you think will be paying for that? It is the taxpayers and your tax will probably skyrocket.<br><br>Next, my point of thinking that most young people nowadays just wanna have fun still stands. Go to any pubs and discos, you will see young people there just drinking and dancing. It is not a matter of immature thinking nor does it applies to me when the facts speak clearly for themselves. BTW, if you want to start insulting and flame war, you are welcome to it. I will no doubt retaliate and make sure it is a good show for everyone to see. Either that or we can stick to a sensible discussion like what mature people does. Your posting certainly tells a lot of your maturity level, doesn't it kiddo?<br><br>The problems you mentioned? What are they? Cars loan to pay? Handphone bill to pay? Credit card bill to pay?? Realistic things to worry about? Maybe you will care to share. There are no doubt some of us with a heavier finanacial burden that could have occurred due to study loan and maybe something else? But all these can be solved by paying your loans through an affordable installaments.<br><br>In your eg of someone with experience, have it occurred to you that he/she was in the same situation as a fresh grad? It is because of his/her hardwork that he/she was able to earn that valuble experience. Don't assume that armed with a good degree, you will automatically get that job. A degree does not allow you to jump the gun. Learn to walk before you run. In any career you carved out for yourself, you should start at the very bottom and advance from there. So naturally that means lower expected salary for a start and plenty of hardwork.<br><br>Finally, your two points of rebuttal (out of four) is directed to NDP preparations. A bit of a pale showing, isn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah NDP is short. Other sai kang are unit-specific things. You want me to mention? e.g..... shift metal bed frames, clear rubbish from condemn room, shift flower pots from pt A to pt B, clear soil from monsoon and small drains, sweep and clear the rooftop. And when the rain comes, all the rooms in the top room will be flooded with water, then have to clear the water from all the rooms and clean the staircase dirtied by the water.... I can swear with my heart that I hold the broom and dustpan so much more than M16. Are these all the things you want to learn from NS? Since we're just NSF, isn't it more meaningful to learn and practice more on combat and free us earlier to contribute to the economy than to do this wu eh boh eh?<br><br>of course we not asking the soldiers to train streunously every day every hour. 3 - 4 days training + 1 day break for sports and games good enough right?<br><br>yes.. a lot of the youngsters chiong pubs but doesn't apply to all!! I agreed I'm not mature enough. You're the most mature, lao eh! (based on your posting to informer)<br><br>affordable installments will depend on your earning power which will link back to job and experiences topic.<br><br>yes. the person starts up as a fresh grad too but his 2 and a half years of headstart is an advantage. dun u tink so? so wat if u r prepared to do a lot of OT and learn a lot of new things? does it matter much to the employer? if you're biz student and apply a job in a pharmaceutical industry. do u think your employer will want to train you? why do you think he would want to invest in you? what happens if you learn the ropes and hop away? does he get the investment time back?<br><br>I join this forum not long ago.

            <div class='col-md body'>Centaur<br><br>As to what you mentioned in unit specific mudane task of manual labour, let me ask you a question. If the unit don't get the men to do it? Who is going to do it? If every soldier starts questioning orders, then in times of war, do you think they will obey an order and charge at a MG position without regards of their own safety? You might look at the tasks as a waste of time but if looking from another perspective, it is a great way to build up espirt de corps. You are not the only one who has gone through this shit, your platoon mates are experiencing the same thing. One of the consolation I can draw from such manual duties during my NSF days was that if my mates and I worked together, we can get it done and rest earlier. Likewise, if nobody does these chores, who are you going to delegate the tasks to? Outsiders? It would be a laughing stock that outsiders civilians have to shift your bed just because the soldiers refuse to do it as they think of it as irrelevant to their NS training. So in this case, where is the discipline demand by the superior of his subordinates? And will the taxpayers be willing to pay for the "external" helpers? Ok, disregarding the "external" helpers, will you then continue live there if all these tasks are not done. At the end of the day, you will have leaking bunks, drains clogged up with leaves and result in mosquitoes etc. So do you want that? All these tasks are in a way necessary to promote a better living environment, don't you agree. Besides, in a number of camps, some area cleaning tasks have been tendered out over the last few years. And that in a sense do leave extra time for training. A note on that, during my time, area cleaning and cookhouse fatigue was the norm.<br><br>As for the remark on the maturity, I will let it pass. But when a push becomes a shove, don't expect me just to sit there.<br><br>Affordable installments, you just answered your own questions. Based on your job and income, you worked out how long it takes to repay any loans.<br><br>I do agree that a person with 2.5 years as a headstart does have certain advantage. But why are you comparing yourself with someone who has more experience than you? The logical comparison will be to compare with someone who is a fresh grad and have no experience. It is like comparing an egg and a stone. What you major in uni will no doubt influence the way you go for you first job. Surely you don't expect an engineer to look for a job that only a medical doctor can do, don't you? With a biz ad degree, your best bet will be dealing with biz related field such as marketing in pharmaceutical company. When an employer invests in training a new staff, naturally he expects the staff to be able to contribute in the growth of the company. And hiring of staff will depend solely on the interviews which he conducted. It is at these interviews, that the employer will be able to gauge if the candidate is worth hiring and that's where the risk is. No one besides the prospective employee will know if he will job hop.<br><br>It is not a matter of how long you joined this forum. Rather it is how you want to see it. If your mind is set in thinking 2.5 years of NS is too long, there is no way I can force you to change. My OC once said to my coy "Do or die, you lan lan also have to serve. So instead of making your life miserable in these 2.5 years, why not make the full use of it and learn and enjoy the sweet and bitter of NS life." It was his saying that, I can now said that my 2.5 years in NS was the best time I had. I make a lot of friends from the suffering and joy and learned a lot of things.</div>

Yes I do agree that its too long but I think that the main thing was the lack of regulars in the army?Maybe that's why the pay increase? Yes it does take a longer time for a person in the states or thailand to be an officer but maybe that's because he's a regular and our population is small? Women in service? Yeah maybe but definitely not in frontline ops! My advice is just "do it" go in serve get to know a couple of good buddies, try to enjoy yourself there with a positive attitude(although it's hard) lolz and try to learn as much as u can while in there.<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
