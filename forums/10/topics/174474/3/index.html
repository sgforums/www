The guy who died in the accident during training is no different from the guy who died fighting in war. Both are doing their duty to serve the country. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">An <strong>ACCIDENT</strong> during training is a result of human error, of human negligence due to some stupidity or laziness in the execution of Operational Procedures that has been thought out and made clear for all training.<br><br>All deaths are unnecessary whether in times of training or war.<br><br>Accidents during Training is SENSELESS and CAN BE AVOIDABLE if all who are responsible WILL BE MORE DILIGENT in PERFORMING THEIR TASKS.<br><br>Death during a fight in a War Zone, or on ACTIVE OPERATIONAL DUTY is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from death caused by NEGLIGENCE.<br><br>The soldiers who died during TRAINING while learning to perform rappelling from a hovering helicopter died a USELESS DEATH as a result of human negligence.<br><br>The four female sailors of our RSN also died a USELESS and NEEDLESS DEATH - as a result of error in Human Judgment in sea lane navigation, but their death occurred during active operational patrol.<br><br>If a SAF soldier is killed in East Timor or Iraq, his death may not be necessary if operational procedures were diligently followed. However, the death is an Honorable Death in sacrifice to a Nation's call to Duty - although not in defense of Singapore<br><br>All the deaths in these different scenarios are needless, with only the Life of the soldier in a HOT ZONE being most at risk, as the situation is not within his control.

Mr Loh referred to his experience on enlistment day for his late son at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) in Tekong in 1999.<br><br>As a matter of principle, Mindef deploys and treats all enlistees in the same way in national service. This applies also to the way we conduct our processes on enlistment day - all newly enlisted personnel are treated in the same way regardless of their background.<br><br>However, BMTC does normally facilitate the entry and exit from Tekong of persons holding national office to ensure their security and also as a basic courtesy and respect for their appointment.<br><br>We apologise for any inconvenience that may have been caused to Mr Loh and any other parents that day.<br><br>Col Benedict Lim<br>Director, Public Affairs<br>Ministry of Defence<br></div>
