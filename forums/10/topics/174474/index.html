Death should be the ultimate benchmark.<br><br>Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan<br><br>Not bad lah...at least the life of a slave a.k.a sg male is worth 111000 dollars.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most appropriate compensation is a pension linked to inflation rates.  (are these called index linked pensions?!?!)<br><br>Base level about 1500/month, rising as the parents grow older.<br><br>Reason for this is the in Singapore we do not have a state welfare system. The welfare  system is place is financed by the family IE when i get a job, i'll give my mum some money every month, help out my siblings etc.<br><br>else you provide a lump sum (which i dun like). Dunno how much but 100000is too little, bearing in mind that the deceaed is not a volunteer. He is there solely by accident of birth. How much payout can a $50/month insurance get? not sure... but i think at lest 200K +?</div>

Afterall, Benjamin Franklin once said "People who give up liberty for the sake of security deserve neither liberty NOR security"<br><br>but my friend. now HE is power hungry and altho he is not a scholar, he is doing very well in his course in an affluent UK Uni. Came in top 8 for his course and is now doing a specialised major where only the top 10 of the entire cohort gets to do it. I have no doubt in time to come he will be someone very reputable. And powerful. And we all know, power pays in politics. And then, we will see which hole PAP throws itself into when they implode internally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
