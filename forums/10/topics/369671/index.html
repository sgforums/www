              <h2>Ho Piao: A Personal Recollection and Appreciation</h2>
              <p><strong>Tan Jing Quee</strong></p>
              <p>Ho Piao’s life can be neatly segmented into three phases, all
              interconnected and evolving. He was born in 1937, the year the Pacific
              War began, with the Japanese incursion into North-east China, which
              eventually led to the Japanese invasion of Malaya in December 1941.
              Britain resumed its colonial control over Malaya following Japanese
              surrender in 1945, and a brief period of peace prevailed, until this
              was interrupted by the onset of the Malayan Emergency from June 1948.</p>
              <p>Ho
              Piao’s infant years were therefore intimately connected with the
              Japanese invasion of Malaya and the Malayan Emergency, initiated by the
              British against the Malayan Communist Party in what the latter termed
              the ‘National War of Liberation’.</p>
              <p>He entered Kong Yong Primary School, which was located at Upper
              Serangoon Road, immediately after the end of the Second World War.
              During this time, he obtained his subsequent facility in the Chinese
              language, reinforced by constant usage and further studies. It was in
              his primary school years that he first became conscious of what he
              deemed to be the degrading effect of inequality and class status.</p>
              <p>Ho
              Piao came from a poor, though not impoverished family in the economic
              circumstances of the time. His father was a sailor, and his mother a
              housewife who also sold eggs in the market to supplement the family
              income. Ho Piao was always extremely close to his mother, and this bond
              was to last throughout his life. His mother stood by him through thick
              and thin through all the years of his long detention and struggles.</p>
              <p>In his address at Ho Piao’s memorial recently, Lee Tee Tong, a
              former long-term political detainee and trade union leader, narrated an
              incident in Ho Piao’s boyhood, when Ho Piao and a few of his classmates
              took a bus home. Along the way, a couple of women boarded the bus
              carrying baskets of eggs. One of them was Ho Piao’s mother; the other
              was a mother of one of Ho Piao’s classmates. Ho Piao immediately ran to
              her. He noticed, however, that his friend tried to avoid looking at his
              own mother because he was ashamed to let his classmates know that his
              mother was a hawker. This incident was etched in Ho Piao’s mind.</p>
              <p>After spending four years in Kong Yong Primary School, his family
              transferred him to Serangoon English School, where he remained until he
              completed the Cambridge School Certificate Examinations, which was the
              equivalent of the ‘O’ Levels now. He did not take to physical contact
              sports like football and hockey, but joined the Scouts movement and
              took to swimming and boating. Under the active motivation and guidance
              of his scoutmaster and teacher, Lloyd Fernando,<a title="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/ho-piao/#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></span></a> he attained the level of Queen’s Scout.</p>
              <p>His physical and mental
              development was impressive and in his final year at Serangoon, he
              circled around the waters of Singapore island in a rowing boat alone,
              an early indication of the grit and tenacity which was to be a
              character trait.</p>
              <p>When Ho Piao finished his school certificate examination, his
              results were outstanding enough for him to obtain admission into the
              pre-medical higher school certificate class in Raffles Institution. At
              the end of 1956, he sat for the matriculation examination for entry
              into the University of Malaya, and obtained admission into the Science
              Faculty in 1957.</p>
              <p>The mid-1950s were years of student and trade union agitation
              against colonial rule, and this could not fail to fire the imagination
              of a student like Ho Piao. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Widespread repressions and arrests occurred
              towards the end of 1956, including the arrest of his cousin, Ho Boon,
              who was then a trade union leader in the Singapore Motor Workshops
              trade union. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The arrest of Ho Piao’s cousin would have made an impact
              on the youthful Ho Piao and propelled him into the reality of colonial
              rule in Singapore at the time. It was at this period that he began his
              initial association with the trade union movement, where his command of
              the English language became an asset to hard-pressed trade unions who
              were already short-handed after the arrests.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, in 1957, he
              cut classes for his science course in the university to attend to the
              pressing demands of trade union work, to such an extent that he
              eventually withdrew from his university education altogether.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He went
              on to work full-time in the trade union movement. In subsequent years,
              Ho Piao never regretted this decision, and always believed that it was
              a choice he had to make under the circumstances. In the context of the
              anti-colonial struggle, it was the only choice.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The People’s Action Party (PAP) came into power in 1959, and in its
              early months, it articulated, if not pursued, an active pro-labour
              policy, and tried to work with the trade union movement. During this
              initial phase of cordiality between the two bodies, the government sent
              three young trade unionists for a trade union course conducted in the
              United Kingdom. Ho Piao was one of the three, the other two being S.T.
              Bani and Salauddin Ghouse, all members of what was then perceived to be
              the left-wing trade union movement.</p>
              <p>Three months into the course, Ho
              Piao abruptly terminated the scholarship and returned home, despite the
              earnest persuasions of his two friends who went on to complete it.
              Years later, when he was asked as to why he did not complete the course
              to obtain the diploma which might have proved useful for his later
              trade union career, Ho Piao would invariably reply that by the time he
              quit, he was convinced that the lectures and courses they were given
              were of ‘bureaucratic trade unionism’ and had no connection whatsoever
              with the type of work he was trying to do in the Singapore trade
              unions. Quite characteristically, Ho Piao never regretted this decision
              either.</p>
              <p>Not long after his return to Singapore, Ho Piao joined as a paid
              secretary of the Singapore National Seamen’s Union. He would later
              recall that his involvement with the seamen’s union represented the
              happiest and most meaningful part of his life, of which he had
              particularly fond memories. He interacted well with the seamen on board
              the ships and they in turn took to him with warmth and affection. Ho
              Piao had a particular way and manner in dealing with ordinary folks, to
              whom he never felt any distance. In fact, if anything, his defences
              always went up when he was confronted or faced with bureaucracy or with
              people in authority, to whom he would be polite but always firm and
              obstinate from the viewpoint of his adversaries.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This phase of his life terminated with his arrest on 2 Feburary
              1963, together with more than 135 political detainees from all walks of
              life.</strong></span></span> At the time of his arrest, he was just 26 years old, full of
              idealism and vitality, and with a clear vision of what he intended to
              do with his life. He has always said that he had found his true
              vocation in those years, of service to the poor and downtrodden,
              against the intimidation and bullying ways of those in authority. Ho
              Piao was always a fighter in his own quiet and unassuming ways.</p>
              <p>The second phase of his life began from the day of his arrest, until
              his release some 18-and-a-half years later, in 1981, when he was well
              into middle age. He had therefore spent the best part of his youth in
              the network of detention centres and cells throughout the island,
              ranging from the central police station, Outram road prison, R.B. block
              in Changi Prison, the medium security detention camp in Changi, and
              eventually in the newly constructed isolation blocks known
              euphemistically as Moon Crescent Centre, which was completed in the
              early 1970s to replace the various detention camps in different
              locations within Changi Prison. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ho Piao’s long detention under the
              infamous Internal Security Act (ISA) was cruel, inhuman and a powerful
              statement of the condition of unfreedom in the country.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Like all the other political detainees, he was never charged and
              convicted for the violation of any specific law. Ho Piao’s life and
              political activities was an open book, from the time he left school as
              a Queen’s Scout and abandoned a university course to work in the trade
              union movement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There was never any suggestion of his involvement in
              any illegal organization or any violent act to support such a long
              duration of political detention.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More likely, Ho Piao, like all the other detainees, was detained not
              because of his potential for violence, but because of fear of the
              visions and ideas he represented. </strong></span></span>Ho Piao probably suffered more than
              most political prisoners in the cruel treatment he received during his
              long years of detention. He was involved in a long hunger strike in the
              early 1970s, when the prison authorities sought to impose new rules and
              conditions, which forced further restrictions on the terms of political
              detention.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There has been a virtual censorship and news embargo regarding the
              hunger strikes, including the treatment meted out to the political
              prisoners during the strikes and the duration of the strikes, which
              have yet to surface. </strong></span></span>The physical assault of Ho Piao and other
              political detainees had been partly documented by a report of Amnesty
              International in 1978.<a title="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/ho-piao/#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
              <p>Ho Piao was released in 1981. He remained in Singapore for a period
              of five years, during which time he married and started a family,
              before he took his new wife and two infant children to London to seek
              out a new direction in his life. The beginning of his exile in London
              from 1986 heralded the third and final phase of his life, which ended
              quite suddenly with his demise on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2007 in London. This period of exile in London lasted 21 years.</p>
              <p>During this period, he came back to Singapore on four or five
              occasions, according to family members, the most recent one being on
              the occasion of the death of his beloved mother on 11<sup>th</sup> January 2001. Many of his friends from his university and trade union
              days did not see much of him during these two decades or so, when he
              was in exile in London. Only those friends who made occasional visits
              to London met up with him at all, and they invariably reported not only
              his continued concern with the political developments at home but also
              his continuing commitment to the struggle for social justice and
              equality internationally.</p>
              <p>He was deeply concerned and knowledgeable about the areas of
              conflict in the Middle East and Asia, and he continued expressing
              optimism on the durability of his socialist vision despite the current
              international confusion and division. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He was extremely critical of
              current political developments in the People’s Republic of China, as
              representing a sharp departure from the egalitarian vision of the early
              years of the Chinese Revolution. He remained a Chinese Singaporean and
              not a Singaporean Chinese, as he laboured to explain to his children.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>During much of his years in the United Kingdom, he had spent much of
              his years at Sudbury Avenue, in Middlesex, north of London, a few
              minutes away from the underground of the same name. He lived in a
              modest house, almost identical to the houses in the neighborhood, from
              the exterior. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, on entering the house, one would have a sense of
              entering a home in Singapore. There was a large sitting room with a set
              of Chinese rosewood furniture and the walls were draped with Chinese
              paintings. </strong></span></span>The living room opened to the lawn at the back of the house,
              which he used for entertainment. The dining room consisted of a
              rosewood round table and chairs. A marble-topped table lay in the
              kitchen for breakfast and informal dining.</p>
              <p>His office was located a short drive away. He spent long hours at
              the office and was known to return late at night or in the early hours
              of the next morning. He had built up strong links with his close
              friends and relatives and some friends from Singapore, in particular
              Francis Khoo and his wife, Dr. Ang Swee Chai, and several others.</p>
              <p>Besides this, he had built up some business contacts and links with
              some colleagues, and many friends from the Middle East, where he also
              had some commercial ventures. His wife and their daughter, He Xin, were
              surprised by the large number of Middle Eastern friends who came to the
              ICU when they heard news of the massive stroke he suffered while dining
              with some friends. He Xin mentions that her father spent a lot of time
              at home writing and that he had written numerous English and Chinese
              poems which have not been sorted out and assembled. She learnt that
              several of these poems had in fact been published in some Middle
              Eastern countries.</p>
              <p>Ho Piao was survived by his wife and three children – his daughter He Xin, and two sons, He Hao and He Jie.</p>
              <p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
              <p>I first met Ho Piao when I was detained in October 1963, and was
              sent to R.B. block. Ho Piao, S.T. Bani and myself were the only
              English-speaking political detainees in the block which then consisted
              of about two dozen political prisoners.</p>
              <p>I have several enduring images of Ho Piao during that time. He was
              of medium height and build, spoke softly, precisely and with a sense of
              gentle humor. He wore a gentle smile most of the time and liked to
              greet his friends with a formal prefix, like ‘Mr Tan’, or just their
              surnames, but never by their personal names.</p>
              <p>This was an eccentricity
              his friends had come to accept and ignore, as no amount of protest
              would change his mode of address. The political prisoners at R.B. block
              were confined in ten separate cells within a block, which had a further
              set of locks which opened to a yard used for exercise and recreation.</p>
              <p>There would be a ‘muster’ every morning, in which the superintendent of
              the prison or other senior officers would walk through the block to
              verify the numbers of political prisoners. Following the morning
              muster, the padlock to the block would be opened for access to the
              field. A similar ‘muster’ walkthrough would take place in the evenings,
              after which the access to the field would be locked, and the political
              prisoners confined to their cells.</p>
              <p>Ho Piao had obtained permission from the prison authorities to rear
              a couple of rabbits, which he kept in carton boxes. Ho Piao would
              usually be among the first to proceed to the yard to tend to his
              rabbits, clad in his cream-coloured pyjama trousers with a white
              round-neck t-shirt and wearing his Japanese slippers.</p>
              <p>A binding image I
              had was Ho Piao holding a rabbit in his arms, sweat streaming down his
              brow and with a smile on his face. As the rabbits multiplied, a problem
              arose. I remember an occasion when one of his friends playfully
              suggested to him that perhaps he should surrender one of the excess
              rabbits to be roasted and eaten. Ho Piao glared at him and turned away
              with his rabbits.</p>
              <p>No one dared to raise the suggestion again. Ho Piao
              eventually found a way out of this problem by arranging to send some of
              his rabbits to political prisoners in the other detention centres in
              Chang Prison, through the prison warders, and also to friends and
              family outside the prison. Ho Piao and his rabbits have become part of
              the legend of the political detentions in the 1960s and 1970s. It is
              also a fitting symbol of contrasting images to the stark reality of the
              long detention experienced by those like Ho Piao.</p>
              <p>Ho Piao was fluent in the three languages of English, Chinese and
              Malay. His reading, however, was quite selective rather than
              wide-ranging. He was acquainted with four Chinese classical novels,
              although his clear favorite was Sui Hu Zhuan. He read Gorky, but was
              less impressed by Dostovsky. Of the Malay poets, his favorite was Usman
              Awang, although he had also read most of the Malay classics in the
              course of his learning of the language and literature. I remember
              vividly Ho Piao reciting Malay <em>pantuns</em> and speaking in Malay formal sentences to the bemused warder who by chance came to the block on some duty.</p>
              <p>‘Courage’ is one of those words that comes readily to the mind when
              one thinks of Ho Piao. It is not however the courage of the aggressor
              who seeks to bully and to exercise power over a weaker victim, but the
              quiet, unobtrusive courage of a man prepared to stand his ground in the
              view that he is in the right. Ho Piao was unyielding and principled to
              those with him, but obstinate and stubborn to those who opposed him.</p>
              <p>Dr Poh Soo Kai, in his account at Ho Piao’s memorial in Singapore on 10<sup>th</sup> March 2007, recounted an incident involving Chan Fook Hwa, another
              political prisoner, who had been diagnosed with cancer of the liver
              during detention. One morning, the prison warder came to the cell block
              with an order to remove Chan Fook Hwa to Changi prison hospital, from
              the cell block which he was occupying together with Ho Piao and Dr Poh.</p>
              <p>The political detainees knew that the conditions in the prison hospital
              were worse than that in the cell block because the detainee would be
              held in total isolation within a cage to which only the doctor and
              authorized medical personnel would be granted access at their
              convenience. It is akin to being held in solitary confinement. Ho Piao
              asked Chan Fook Hwa politely whether he preferred to stay with his
              other colleagues in the detention block or to allow himself to be
              removed to the prison hospital.</p>
              <p>Chan Fook Hwa replied that he would
              prefer to remain where he was. Ho Piao then proceeded to inform the
              warder that they would not allow Fook Hwa to be removed from the cell,
              and the prison warder had no alternative but to leave after failing to
              carry out his instructions. Ho Piao was prepared to stand firm on his
              ground, clearly knowing that disobedience of an order from the prison
              authorities might land them in a confrontation with the prison
              authorities.</p>
              <p>Three days later, however, the prison warder returned with
              a new order to remove Chan Fook Hwa to the general hospital. After some
              discussion, Fook Hwa said he would be prepared to be so removed as he
              would possibly be in a better position to have medical treatment in a
              hospital.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, Chan was removed and when his condition
              deteriorated, he was released and died within a week following this.
              This incident indicated clearly the extent to which Ho Piao was
              prepared to go to defend the rights of his friends when he felt that
              such a defence was the correct and proper thing to do.</p>
              <p>Ho Piao belongs to that select group of political prisoners in
              Singapore who spent long spells of imprisonment without trial. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They
              include Chia Thye Poh, Dr. Lim Hock Siew, Dr. Poh Soo Kai, Said Zahari
              and Lee Tee Tong. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Their long incarceration and travails is a sad and
              tragic commentary on the state of political unfreedom in a nascent
              state emerging from colonial rule. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In most countries, these men of
              conscience would be a national asset and powerful spokesmen for the
              community rather than continuously demonized, vilified and
              marginalized.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A nation and a state which is intolerant and oppresses
              dissident views of honest men and women can hardly aspire to evolve and
              develop into a humane society and civilization. Vibrant political,
              intellectual and artistic life cannot ever hope to grow and flourish
              under conditions of political repressions.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>The scheme was already hatched back in 1956, before he had even tasted power.</p>
              <p>How many lives have been destroyed since he took office in 1957, and then over the last 52 years ?</p>
              <p>Karma and retributions will have its own way to have justice served, and no amount of ginseng, nor life preserving vitamins, nor nuclear powered pace makers can delay the final day of judgment.</p>
              <p>At the very worst, life will end in a state of limbo - as suspended form unable to move on to the next world.</p>
