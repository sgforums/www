              <p>Just heard from someone in the radio industry that govt scholars are planted in CNA. Top newscasters down the years have gone on to other news stations like Al-jazeera, CNBC etc.</p>
              <p>I have seen CNA news as far as China, Indo and Pakistan, tks to satellite technology. And they all seem to make Singapore look good from the outside-in view.</p>

              <p><br>The CNA report showed WP MP criticising the government decision to raise foreign workers levy, and so did some PAP MPs also being as critical or mildly concerned.</p>
              <p>Yet, in the typical PAP arrogance of refusing to accept any critiical statements from the Opposition - an unknown PAP MP will be shown to ridicule the criticism from the WP MP, and will not show if WP MP had given a rejoinder, leaving the image of the PAP criticism being more valid.</p>
              <p>Was that balance reporting ?</p>

              <h2><a title="Permalink" href="http://chiatilik.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/what-political-candidates-should-have/">What political candidates should have</a></h2>
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p>A very learned friend was a participant in an IRC discussion.</p>
              <p>The IRC discussion was about the local political scene purportedly mandating paper qualifications for credible candidature. I was told that a lot of good arguments were thrown up and they are in short summarized hereinbelow.</p>
              <p>I have reproduced these with the kind permission of the author, which until he tells me that he does not mind being named, i shall not name him <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>
              <p>1. Having paper qualifications has little to do with integrity.</p>
              <p>2. Political education and savviness is not usually formally taught.</p>
              <p>3. Not having paper qualifications does not mean a person does not have an education i.e. he can be self taught</p>
              <p><br>4. There is also the question of who should decide what the formal criteria for the eligibility of candidates ought to be.</p>
              <p>5. The requirement of paper qualifcations for candidates reserves the right to rule to the upper classes, which will entrench themselves and therefore undemocratic.</p>
              <p><br>6. Politicians, even ministers, always have a team of specialists which they can consult. It’s more important to look at the qualifications of that team.</p>
              <p><br>7. In a system where money has incredible corrupting influence, politicians must above all have backbone, not simply paper qualifications.</p>
              <p><br>8. The quality of candidates should be judged by the people, not by some institution (schools).</p>
              <p><br>9. Candidates with paper qualifications is a bonus, if they are one with the citizenry, they will be elected anyway and hence no requirements for paper qualifications are necessary</p>
              <p><br>10. Having an educated electorate is the priority, not highly educated candidates per se. This leads to a more sustainable political system.</p>
              <p><br>11. Putting point 4 and 9 together, mandating paper qualifications creates an aristocracy/dictatorship that will dumb down the public to maintain their grip on power. This is unsustainable.</p>
