            <div class='col-md body'>INdeed, it is a city of possibilities.  Possibility to increase whatever high pay as they like, . . . . .. .  anything is possible to them, so indeed it is really, truely a city of possibility.<br><br>Saw a very big banner outside Revenue House, Lui Tuck _____ (can't remember his full name), lee kuan yew, and other members of the Tg pagar GRC in the picture.    So national day is pay and pay day.  It is a day for all to remember all the contributions of the pay and pay, and what about the contributions of the people of Singapore?   Hey, the govt will not exist if not for the people, don't they know this?<br><br>I never like National DAy.  Probably if there is a change of ruling party, I may like it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
