              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p>Over the course of my stay in London, I had the opportunity to meet up with some fellow Singaporeans who have decided to relocate to the UK. I realized, after speaking at length with them, that there are a couple of common reasons why Singaporeans leave Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Space</strong></p>
              <p>This is the most common reason given by Singaporeans below their 30s. Singapore, an island state of merely 700 square kilometers, is home to over 5 million souls. That’s over 6,800 people crammed in a single square kilometer. In comparison, New Zealand has got 4.2 million people spread over 268,680 square kilometer (15 people per square kilometer).</p>
              <p>Even though Singapore has got a reputation to be a ‘garden city’, the greenery is simply not enough go around when all you see are crowds of people everywhere you go. Thinking of bringing your Porsche out for a spin? You wouldn’t even hit 100 km/hr before hitting another traffic light. Likewise, those longing for open spaces will have to get their fix elsewhere.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Stress</strong></p>
              <p>The typical work day in Singapore is extremely fast paced. Overtime is almost mandatory and 9am – 6pm work is non existence unless you are working in certain service sector but even then, its getting increasing rare. As a result, Singaporeans tend to speak and walk faster, which contributes to the stress.</p>
              <p>There is also this chase for material wealth, which is common in most metropolitan society. A while back, there was this talk about <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 Cs</span> – Car, Credit cards, Condominium, Country club membership and Cash. Most families are ‘double income’ – both parents are working. A typical young couple is expected to have a kid (or two), own a flat, a car and employs a maid – all before they hit their 30s. In short, Singapore is not for those who prefer to ‘take it easy’.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Education system</strong></p>
              <p>As Singapore is branding herself as an educational hub, many Singaporeans, having gone through what they consider to be a rigid system would prefer not to subject their children to the same ordeal and move abroad before their children hits school going age.</p>
              <p>Although the primary and secondary education has gone through a much needed revamp and has seek to move away from rote learning, creativity is still generally not fostered. As a result, the Singaporean educational system is able to produce generally high averages but comparatively lesser peaks.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Relentless influx of foreign ‘talent’</strong></p>
              <p>Of late, Singapore has been welcoming skilled foreigners with open arms. These foreign ‘talent’ are viewed as essential to maintain the relatively healthy economy growth that the city state has enjoyed for the past couple of years. As a result of which, the local populace see an influx of Chinese, Indians and to a much lesser extent, Europeans. Many of whom were subsequently granted permanent residencies.</p>
              <p>Generally, Singaporeans view these foreign talents as responsible for squeezing them out of the job market and driving up property prices. A familiar story even to London, I supposed. But to a small island state such as Singapore, the effect is much more profound.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Quality family time</strong></p>
              <p>As mentioned in an earlier point, the increase in standard of leaving means that most young families see both parents working – just one generation earlier, it was common to have a parent (most probably the mother) to tend to the household.</p>
              <p>Although there was a recent effort to increase paid maternity leave to beyond three months, it is still frowned upon in the private sector (not so much in the public sector though) if an employee were to exercise that right. Crèches in workplace is almost unheard of and if there is, is only found in foreign firms that set up branches in Singapore.</p>
              <p>With the long working hours, families would have to employ a maid or rely on the grandparents to look after their children during the work hours. Even though a bill was passed to provide a one time financial relief to families for every newborn child, parents would still prefer to spend more quality time with their kids if given a choice.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Mainstream society</strong></p>
              <p>Like many Asian societies, Singapore’s is still very much conformed to the mainstream. This manifested itself more prominently in <span style="font-weight: bold;">education </span>and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">choice of lifestyle</span> of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In school, mathematics and science subjects are immensely more popular compared to those belonging to arts and humanities. In many junior colleges, where the students are first streamed into these two disciplines, the number of students taking the former subjects outnumbers the latter five to one, sometimes more.</p>
              <p>This phenomenon can be attributed an entire generation who has grown up during the sixties and seventies when Singapore is still a fledging young nation and thus required people with technical skills. Even as Singapore celebrated her 43rd year of independence earlier this year, there are still much more opportunities for a physicist than a historian.</p>
              <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hpQ2iU7yiHA/SPG5CcBvQNI/AAAAAAAABjw/F-SVj7fjdQQ/s1600-h/Gay+Singapore.jpg"></a>Although Singapore Tourism Board has been busy chasing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">pink dollar</span> for the past decade, alternative lifestyles still belong very much as a sideshow in the daily life.</p>
              <p>Homosexuality is still outlawed in the penal code and a recent effort to overturn that was unsuccessful. However, even so, there hasn’t been an instance where person is persecuted by the law for being a lesbian or a gay.</p>

              <p>This article is very relevant to my reasons for being in the USA.</p>
              <p>Life is much better here. For example, a typical home here is &gt; 3000 sqft and a small backyard is bigger than a 4 room flat. All types of food - crab, crab cakes, lobster, fish, beef, pork, chicken, ice cream, beverages can be enjoyed at a fraction of the prices in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The stress level is lesser. The amount of things one can do after work is HUGE. Overtime is frowned upon (if you OT too much, your boss will start to get concerned that you are not productive), and weekends are spent exploring other parts of the country. The pay is better, and I GET to enjoy the seeds I sow.</p>
              <p>I am unlike the previous generation, where they think that one must work HARD until they are old before they can enjoy life. Enjoying life when they are young is almost like a sin. I have no qualms being called a quitter and a lazy bum, coz I get to enjoy as I work, unlike in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For those who are still ignorant of what's going on in Singapore, be prepared for another influx of foreign labor. I just read in another website that EDB has been secretly going to China to do a mass recruitment of software engineers. Jobs that can easily be performed by locals... The stress level will go nowhere but up, while the salaries will go nowhere but down.</p>

              <p>You should be glad. Have you ever be transferred to a Malaysian branch? See how they work? I think you will kill yourself after seeing how lazy they are. I am proud of how efficient Singaporeans are. This is the asset that Singaporeans have.</p>
              <p>I hear a lot of Malaysian chinese send their children to private western and private chinese schools because they have no faith in the local government schools filled with lazy young trainee teachers. Be glad.</p>

              <p><br>I believe so too. Recruiting foreigners from impoverished cities is meant to enhance the appreciation levels of such foreigners, so that at least in the few years after they are converted to citizens, they would gladly vote for the PAP in appreciation of giving them a better life.</p>
              <p>It is a strategy that I would use as well, if I belong to the MIW - Recruiting foreigners whose living standards are similar to the 70's standards of Singapore (that's when Singaporeans gladly voted for the PAP then)</p>
              <p>Innovation, as I have agreed with you, is destroyed when companies choose the easiest way out (getting cheap labor). By blatantly allowing cheap foreign labor to come into Singapore, the govt is silently encouraging companies to hire cheap labor, so as to keep the costs of doing business in Singapore down in the easiest way possible.</p>
              <p>Innovation, which is meant to improve productivity and efficiency of businesses, then gets thrown out of the door, coz it's just so much easier to hire cheap people. But then, that also translates to Singapore businesses not being able to compete well in the global market. That's why most SMEs are doomed to remain small for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p>As I have written before, Adam Khoo lamented that Singaporeans should mature and accept cheap labor. I have also mentioned that businesses should mature (and stop blaming the locals about costs) and understand that hiring cheap labor only dooms them to remain insignificant for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, at this moment in time, there's another pro to living outside of Singapore :). I get to watch World Cup without paying an extra cent, unlike in Singapore, where they are charging $90 now :p</p>

              <p><br>I believe so too. Recruiting foreigners from impoverished cities is meant to enhance the appreciation levels of such foreigners, so that at least in the few years after they are converted to citizens, they would gladly vote for the PAP in appreciation of giving them a better life.</p>
              <p>It is a strategy that I would use as well, if I belong to the MIW - Recruiting foreigners whose living standards are similar to the 70's standards of Singapore (that's when Singaporeans gladly voted for the PAP then)</p>
              <p>Innovation, as I have agreed with you, is destroyed when companies choose the easiest way out (getting cheap labor). By blatantly allowing cheap foreign labor to come into Singapore, the govt is silently encouraging companies to hire cheap labor, so as to keep the costs of doing business in Singapore down in the easiest way possible.</p>
              <p>Innovation, which is meant to improve productivity and efficiency of businesses, then gets thrown out of the door, coz it's just so much easier to hire cheap people. But then, that also translates to Singapore businesses not being able to compete well in the global market. That's why most SMEs are doomed to remain small for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p>As I have written before, Adam Khoo lamented that Singaporeans should mature and accept cheap labor. I have also mentioned that businesses should mature (and stop blaming the locals about costs) and understand that hiring cheap labor only dooms them to remain insignificant for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, at this moment in time, there's another pro to living outside of Singapore :). I get to watch World Cup without paying an extra cent, unlike in Singapore, where they are charging $90 now :p</p>

              <p>TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p><strong>By Lawrence Pek</strong></p>
              <p>Clearly, there has been a lot of unhappiness on the grounds with the huge influx of foreigners into Singapore in the last 18 to 24 months, even though PM Lee has addressed this issue (well, sort of), I would like to dwell further with a deeper analysis of certain repercussions of these misguided policies.</p>
              <p>Value Added – Currently, clearly we have many foreigners in the service sectors, from 7-11 to waitresses to masseurs. The quality of Foreigners is both unclear and not scrutinized. Are they doing work that Singaporeans cannot do (special skills, experience or relationships) – or just competition with locals for local jobs (hawker centre, petrol kiosks and 7-11).</p>
              <p>Cheap vs. Cheaper – Even though it is true that foreigners are willing to accept cheaper salaries, please consider 2 things in the long run:</p>
              <p>1.     Will they continue to accept the same low wages in 3 to 5 years? They will not, for 2 simple reasons – if they 30% cheaper than the local Singaporeans now, they will want to price themselves 5 to 10% cheaper than a local Singaporeans, these foreigners are not stupid, they want to be “cheaper” and not simply just “cheap”</p>
              <p>2.     What will the government do about the high unemployment rate for the local that was displaced? e.g. If you bring in a cheaper 25 years old PRC girl to work in 7-11 to replace a 35 year old Singaporean woman (or man) – then what will he or she do, once she or he is replaced? Can that local find a higher valued job (higher salary with higher function) – Isn’t it clear that MOM just created a problem by doing this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Structural Unemployment:</strong></p>
              <p>Please allow me to use this to clarify pt 2, this comes about rarely, but it is a bitch to handle for any Minister of Manpower. Simply, there is a job mismatch – there are plenty of job vacancies to go about, but the quality of the people simply cannot perform what these jobs require…the market has changed and companies now require skills and knowledge workers in very specific or niche or high (high is not niche) areas. Then there is a clear and definite for that company to import foreign talent in order to perform the tasks at hand. But locally, MOM and MOE need to look at re-training and re-educating the local manpower to perform these task.</p>
              <p>Why? The reason is one of valued added and sustainability. If MOM and MOE can realize that there are no short cuts to structural unemployment, then they need to bite the bullet to retrain locals, because the locals stays and with a higher skilled workforce, Singapore as an economy will be more cutting edge and more competitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What happens when the Music Stops?</strong></p>
              <p>With 36% foreigners now in Singapore, regardless of whether they are PRs or even New Citizens – will they be there when the going gets tough in Singapore or will they leave for their homeland (China, India, Vietnam…). Singapore is NOT HOME, they WILL LEAVE and then WHAT DO WE DO?</p>
              <p>Who will fill the void and what will happen to our economy? There is a further perspective, if you have a small group of 100 and 10 leave, the 90 people should be able to cover and manage, but if you have a group of 10,000 and 1,000 leaves (same 10%), the balance 9,000 cannot and will not want to cover and manage the gap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Brain Drain issue</strong></p>
              <p>This is not a new phenomenon; there are many Singaporeans (even though they keep their passports) who will never come back here. Artists, Musicians, Scientists and lastly, people like myself, self-made business men. I have so many friends now in US, Europe and China now, they simply will not come back anymore; their reply is very simple, Singapore no longer provides the environment for their (or their kids) development. Their value in these foreign countries is higher than in Singapore. They already feel there is no more reason, no more space for them to come back anymore. Given the new demographics in their homeland now, I doubt if any of them are inclined to ever come back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>In summary, the key message that I would like to convey is that of Sustainability – Yes, it is true that the local bred and born has 2 main issues, which is driving the influx of foreigners. We are not willing to breed, and we are no longer as hardworking or have higher expectations in terms of our employment benefits.</p>
              <p>However, we cannot take the short cut route and look at the short terms benefits in terms of GDP growth. Rather than bringing the foreigners and creating a unstable society (trust me, there are many pissed off people), why is it that we cannot bite the bullet and try to brain storm ideas to increase birth rates, to control wages for locals.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it is true that I am not a full time labor officer at MOM, so I am not privy to lots of internal discussions or data, which I am sure, has led our urban planners to decide on the current course of actions. However, I do not think that I am wrong in my assessment above and I do would like an opportunity to be proven wrong.</p>
              <p>As a last word, to these scholars and ministers, I would like to implore your better judgments on 2 fronts. Please trust us to understand your predicament and we will do our best to understand the issues, which we understand is our issues, anyway. Please do not be so insecure in your policy making, talk to us and make us understand, we are your people and responsibility.</p>

By one estimate, the number who put the Lion City behind them is as high as 15 percent of annual births.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: red;"> In 2006, the Transport Minister, Raymond Lim, expressed concern that 53 percent of Singaporean teens would consider emigration. One website survey put Singapore's average outflow at 26.11 migrants per 1,000 citizens, the second highest in the world - next only to East Timor (51.07). </span></span>)<br></strong></span><br>Canada, the refuge of choice for noteworthy politically fed up Singaporeans such as pioneering writer Goh Poh Seng, who left the city-state in 1986, seems to have a more sympathetic ear for those fleeing the Lion City or, at least, a more deserving slate of applicants. Twelve of the 29 who fled the Island Republic for Canada between January 2005 and September 2009 were given political refugee status, a success rate of 44 percent. Four applied in Canada in the first nine months of 2009 and three of them accepted. It isn't known who they were or why they were seeking asylum.<br><br>Another 26 have been granted asylum in the United States, according to the US Department of Homeland Security. At least some are believed to have sought asylum because they were being persecuted for being gay.<br><br>But these are the lucky ones. With genuine refugees from strife-ridden nations such as Afghanistan, Burma and Sudan often denied asylum status by the stringent immigration authorities in the Western world, most asylum seekers from Singapore are turned back.<br><br>Of the 50 or so Singaporean refugee applications identified by Asia Sentinel in Australia, New Zealand and Canada over the last decade, the vast majority were rejected.<br><br>Ten have applied for refugee status in New Zealand since 1997, according to spokesman for the country's Department of Labour, and all were rejected. Another 15 applied for refugee status in Australia between 2004 and 2009. All were denied.<br><br>The fact that there are so few successful asylum applicants from Singaporeans is testament to how perceptions of Singapore's approach to human rights have improved over the last 20 years. In that period, the government has made some small but significant steps toward meeting globally-accepted democratic norms, abandoning the detention without trial of political opponents and trying to combat institutional and societal discrimination against women, ethnic minorities and gays.<br><br>Singapore's 21st- Century refuges are driven by a variety of motives including political oppression, racism, persecution and the desire to avoid military service. Some, no doubt, are economic migrants who hope for a better standard of living in New Zealand or Canada, far away from the rat race of the Lion City. A few are clearly mentally unstable, with others fleeing debt or using political repression as an excuse.<br><br>Looking into their cases provides a rare insight into the tiny minority of Singaporeans who have rejected the ruling People's Action Party's de facto social contract that promises economic development in exchange for the surrender of political freedoms.<br><br>Take the Singaporean of Tamil heritage who fled to New Zealand in August 2008 because, even after selling his apartment and all his possessions, he was unable to pay off debts to loan sharks and feared that the Singapore police would not protect him from violent reprisals. His sorry tale of loan-shark debt spiraling out of control is a common one in the humble public housing estates of Singapore, where many people are unable to get access to mainstream bank credit.<br><br>Not many in his position would resort to fleeing the country and with good reason. To fall within the remit of the UN's Refugee Convention, applicants must have a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of "a person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion."<br><br>Fear of persecution from criminal gangs on the basis of your inability to repay illicit loans is not a valid justification for asylum under international law. Unsurprisingly, in August last year, New Zealand's Refugee Status Appeals Authority rejected his final plea for asylum.<br><br>The New Zealand refugee appeals tribunal also rejected appeals from two Singaporean men in 2003 and 2001 who claimed that they were discriminated against during their military service.<br><br>One repeated the often-aired grievance that the Singapore army is biased toward those of ethnic Chinese origin, insisting that he had been passed over for promotions because he was of Indian extraction. He also claimed that there was mounting discrimination against Indians in Singapore, which had led to the suicide of his brother.<br><br>The other appellant said he was a conscientious objector and that he feared being jailed if he refused to complete his obligatory military service. Both appeals were rejected on the grounds that the unpleasant circumstances faced by both men did not amount to persecution.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Singapore government continues to stick to its long-standing policy of refusing to accept refugees. It is one of the few countries that have chosen not to sign up to the UN Refugee Convention and has a long history of turning away even those in desperate need, whether they be Vietnamese boat people or stateless Rohingya fleeing Burma.<br><br>As Balaji Sadasivan, minister of state for foreign affairs, put it earlier this year: "Given our limited land and natural resources, Singapore is not in a position to accept persons seeking political asylum or refugee status."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: red;">Recently-declassified British government papers reveal that founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was so unforgiving that he vetoed a 1979 proposal by Margaret Thatcher to buy a vacant Indonesian or Philippine island to house Vietnamese boat people.<br><br>His concern was that this would create a "rival entrepreneurial city".</span></span><br><br></strong></span>Fortunately for some Singaporeans in dire straits, other countries take a more compassionate view. As recently as 1996, Australia, which is evidently no soft touch on immigration, granted asylum to a Singaporean woman of Indian background who married against her family's wishes and ended up getting divorced.<br><br>The immigration tribunal upheld her claim that she faced possible sexual harassment and physical abuse by men within her community and that the Singaporean authorities "may be unwilling to offer her protection" because of "the view that they take of her moral background".<br><br>Such dark days appear to be behind Singapore now. But the realities of political repression and the climate of fear stoked up by the government continue to drive some Singaporeans to flight.</div>

              <p>it is only good for 5 years in spore when you first go there, after 5 years you get very inconsiderate neighbours who make plenty noise daily  from 5am to midnight.i have actually thought of killing my neighbours upstairs with their entire family really.</p>
              <p>the dream only lasts as long as you are asleep but once you wake up from that sleep you will see plenty of nightmares that u wished u could go back to sleep.</p>
              <p>if you are a sporean the army have every law given to them to take your time and life until you are unable to do your own business or even to work properly withput them harrasing you every week or go to jail or get fined heavily.the spore gov uses the spore army to take away whatever valuable time for all spore citizens.</p>
              <p>it is alright if u are a foreigner livin n werkin in spore.</p>

              <p>sgcommoner,</p>
              <p>many who left for overseas in 70s or 80s couldnt bring their old folks to live with them as a family.even today there are south africans,sporeans,malaysians etc who were able to immigrate but unable to bring their folks to live with them.i knew a south african doctor who had his folks not granted a visa due to age and they were not a priority with ox immigration....so he left oz and went back to look after his folks in south africa.he is an european south african.</p>
              <p>even if u had a million dollar business , u would still not even be granted a P.R. let alone old folks.so currently u may immigrate but yer folks would be stuck back home.</p>
              <p>well...if u cant immigrate be like me befor that...stand outside angrily at istana.....not saying a word.....deal with the thugs in spore....deal with the inconsiderate spore knuckle headed army laws......deal with the thoughtless foreigners from malaysia ,india,phillippines etc in werkplace.,,,then goto parliament house and look angrily at the gates thinking how to get into parliament one fine day.........deal wirh extremely high cost of living as well.....i assssure u spore would be different if i was around.maybe i could be some warlord even.</p>
