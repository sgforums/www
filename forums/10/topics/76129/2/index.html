            <div class='col-md body'>One of my former colleagues in Singapore sent her child to an international school. Her husband has a HK passport. I think virtually all international schools around the world has this rule with the local government. Over at SSIS, we do have Chinese nationals studying here - their mother has a foreign passport.<br><br>One thing I believe an international school is good with is the broader outlook, the contacts you gain and also the more relaxed atmosphere. Now, you must also realise that international schools have different hours - they end at about 3-4pm in the afternoon. This affords more time to finish their assignments, instead of doing them at home.<br><br>Now if only I can afford to send my child to a school that asks for USD8000 a year (plus USD1000 for school bus)...maybe once I made principal?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay guys i think lets put it in perspective with some of the following Qns:<br><br>Mr Lee Hsian Yang is he a member of the Govt?<br><br>If his kid as stated by someone so physically unable to cope with a local school condition?<br><br>What cased the topic in the first place?<br><br>firstly i do not know if Mr Lee Hsien  Yang is indeed a member of parliament. the last i check on his brother Loong is involvd in politics.<br><br>Why then is he put under the spotlight?<br><br>Cause well there are those who have mentioned that in doing so, it shows that the member of the Lee family doesnt have faith in the local education system.<br><br>I would like to throw another point. I paraphrase Raj Vasil's "Parties and Politics" chapter 4.<br><br>" Then PM Lee Kuan yew questioned JBJ's loyalty to the country as both JBJ and his Aide's children were in International schools"<br><br>But sidenote that was sometime ago. i think 20 yrs ago. Even then, is this considered hyprocrisy?<br><br>Surprisingly, Mr Lee Hsien Loong's son, EE peng, while an Albino with sight problems,  was in normal schools i.e. Zhong hua Sec, NYJC.<br><br><strong>In conclusion, i can only say that it is individual preference.</strong> Though what he has done may contradict what his father had said. But his father had said alot of thing.</div>
