Not that there's anything wrong with these occupations, but for kids to limit their career options to these occupations at such a prematurely early age...geez.<br><br>Nevertheless, many of these international school graduates do turn out quite well, so maybe...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Western education is more superior for reasons above as said by someone. Adding on, you have more beautiful people in international schools who are more accepting and nicer than in local schools. I remember what it felt like to be accepted when i went to chatsworth and sas, alas i dont get much of that in local jcs. While knocking the local system, maybe God has a part to play, God did not give Singapore resources, thus SIngapore is forced to DRILL its children to become tomorrows SKILLED labour, thus you get stressful schools full of rude/stressed/selfish/narrow students who are overly competitive.<br><br>Overall, western schools = best.<br>But local schools = Ranger School, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere, + point for people like me. WHen i go back to Europe, i will take it as a breeze since i have studied in your local system for 2 years.</div>

As a Singapore citizen, you DO NOT have the choice of choosing between an international school and a local school for your children's educational future.  The MOE has always made it a point to force all of its citizens through the Singapore system.  This is in line with the government's long-stated view of nationalizing and equalizing all citizens and races.<br><br>It is generally recognized that many parents in Singapore do not wish to subject their children to the stress and limited scope of the local educational system.  While the system is fantastic in producing graduates with stellar "employable" skills like mathematical and scientific ability, the system is less capable in generating thinkers and creative minds.  Many parents recognize this shortcoming of the local education system and would prefer to enroll their children in more well-rounded and open systems as practice by the local international schools like United World College and the Singapore American School.<br><br>What we are seeing here with LHY's kids is a hypocritical bending of the rules for more highly placed members of our society.  This is a clear indicator of a breakdown in the more "socialist" aspect of government in Singapore.  THAT is my main beef with this revelation.</div>

Try sending your kids to an international school, even if you can afford to pay the S$20,000 annual school fees - the MOE will just laugh in your face and tell you to go back to being a heartlander.<br><br>The hypocrisy of it all...</div></blockquote>I dont have anything particular good things to say about the guy but C'mon la, give him a break la. It is a free decision. They are parents as well. If he send them to a local school, then someone else may make an issue out of it, saying that Old Lee is running his son's life.<br><br>Cant win situation.<br><br>So guys, dont have to be critical for the sake of being critical.</div>

As a Singapore citizen, you DO NOT have the choice of choosing between an international school and a local school for your children's educational future.  The MOE has always made it a point to force all of its citizens through the Singapore system.  This is in line with the government's long-stated view of nationalizing and equalizing all citizens and races.<br><br>It is generally recognized that many parents in Singapore do not wish to subject their children to the stress and limited scope of the local educational system.  While the system is fantastic in producing graduates with stellar "employable" skills like mathematical and scientific ability, the system is less capable in generating thinkers and creative minds.  Many parents recognize this shortcoming of the local education system and would prefer to enroll their children in more well-rounded and open systems as practice by the local international schools like United World College and the Singapore American School.<br><br>What we are seeing here with LHY's kids is a hypocritical bending of the rules for more highly placed members of our society.  This is a clear indicator of a breakdown in the more "socialist" aspect of government in Singapore.  THAT is my main beef with this revelation.</div></blockquote>no wad....you have a choice if you want international school anot...the law simply states that you all have to go to school for at least 6 years and complete your pri sch education...doesnt matter where you get it...thus religous schools are around</div>
