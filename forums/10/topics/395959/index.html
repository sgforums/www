              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">OPEN statement to all participant in this Forum</span> - to resist and ignore the idiocy of this 'angel7030' and not to indulge this 'hum' from Taiwan in useless exchanges that stretch into multiple pages to drive the thread off-track.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The persistence of the Taiwanese 'hum' to post its irrelevant and irreverent idiocy is to drive the thread off-track.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Its declared agenda is to draw the attention of any participant to engage with its idiocy - so as to pile up the pages in the thread with nonsensical exchange with itself - and the thread being ignored.</span></strong></p>
