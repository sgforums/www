Isn't it because things become old and breakdown so to avoid that, upgrading works actually extend the servicable life of the things you use everyday.<br><br>The same with the causeway which everybody use everyday, it is old and needs upgrading, why did we build one out of the blue? As far as I know it was already planned for long ago, we couldn't upgrade or a build a new one upon the existing before because there was only 1 bridge and knowing abt the water pipes that run along the causeway that singapore treats as a sacred unbilical cord so we came out with the second link, since that is now up we should focus on having a new causeway.<br><br>As to waste of time or waste of money, the old current causeway is the cause of it, with a new bridge the traffic flow bringing tourism as well as higher and faster movement of goods on both sides of the causeway will grow and yes it's an economic reason but one that is mutually beneficial.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>MY's reason is that the causeway block water flow in the Johor strait and cause alot of pollution, affecting the fishing nearby. Then a bridge can allow ships to pass through the Johor strait, better for the PDP port in Johor.<br><br>However, the negative effects of the causeway affect mostly MY only, SG don't see the need to spend 500 million on an entire new bridge, so they want a fair compromise. But they can't work out the compromise, so MY wants to go ahead with construction to pile pressure on SG. Thats about it.</div>
