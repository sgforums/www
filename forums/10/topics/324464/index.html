              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Some non—profit organisations in Singapore have advised the public not to let the latest alleged fraud case, involving Ren Ci charity, to detract them from the bigger issue of helping needy Singaporeans.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              
              </div>
              <p>Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre is one of the largest charities in Singapore that provides medical and step—down care for the needy.</p>
              <p>Ren Ci’s former CEO, Venerable Shi Ming Yi, was charged in court on Tuesday with forgery, conspiracy and misappropriating charity funds.</p>
              <p>The monk, whose actual name is Goh Kah Heng, is out on a S$200,000 bail. He is due to be back in court on August 4.</p>
              <p>Venerable Ming Yi was the face of Ren Ci before this latest incident, and those involved in the charity sector in Singapore said a distinction has to be drawn between the individual and a charity’s role.</p>
              <p>Gerard Ee, chairman of the National Kidney Foundation, said: "I hope the public will see it clearly and continue to support Ren Ci Hospital because the beneficiaries are in need of their support, in need of continuing service.</p>
              <p>"So don’t abandon the support for the hospital. As for the individual, like I say, let it take its course, let it have a fair hearing and don’t prejudge."</p>
              <p>Other non—profit organisations in Singapore are optimistic that donor confidence will not waver from this recent setback. However, it doesn’t help that this comes shortly after the former chief of National Kidney Foundation, TT Durai, was jailed for misappropriating funds.</p>
              <p>Adrian Choo, an associate lecturer, said: "I thought that other people would have learnt from him (Durai), but apparently not. It would cause me to question the integrity of the heads of the charities and the charities themselves. I used to donate without thinking, but now I would think much more."</p>
              <p>Susan Lee, an entrepreneur, said: "It sort of saddened me... I feel that it’s the people who mismanaged it, not the organisation. So I will continue to donate because I wholeheartedly want to give to the charity and how they manage (the money) is up to them to answer for it."</p>
              <p>Being answerable to donors is precisely what charities have to do today with the newly introduced Code of Governance, prescribing guidelines on how charities should be run.</p>
              <p>Tan Chee Koon, CEO of National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre, said: "If indeed there has been wrongdoing, then justice must, of course, take its natural course.</p>
              <p>"It’s not about the amount. I think for charities, we have to be purer than pure, and whiter than white. There’s no shortcut to it because we are operating on public trust. And public trust has to be earned."</p>
              <p>This latest incident involving Ren Ci has certainly disappointed many Singaporeans, but the consensus is to learn from any mistakes made, strengthen the safeguards within the charities and move on with the primary objective of helping the disadvantaged.</p>

              <p>the long and the short of it now is that charity is much more than just throwing money at some organisation to salve your rotten soul.. if you want to do real charity, go get a bunch of people together and go clean up an orphanage... get your act together and go give tuition to the children who need the extra coaching.. go keep the residents at an old folks' home company regularly and listen to them... clean out the kennels at the SPCA...</p>
              <p>charities were used as a place for people to pay for a moment of "feelgood" so it was easy for those who took the money for themselves...</p>

              <p>I beg to differ.  If I donate $10, what can I buy for the poor? The purpose of charity is to consolidate all these small amounts into a substantial amount so that more can be done for the needy. </p>

              <p><em>"I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens.

              <p>What PM Lee did not say in his advice is that being the first-world country as claimed by the father, there should be no such problem like having so many citizens still begging for a living or being unable to make ends meet due to government taking away more than 60% of their average income through taxing and keeping back taxes and collecting more and more profits and fees to impoverish the people.</p>
              <p>So who created the situation? If government is so concerned with such a situation and is now calling on the richer citizens to do charity to help the over-taxed underclass, he could easily reverse the past wrongful policies of taxing and recovering all possible costs and all citizens will be able to live normal economic life once again.</p>
              <p>Will PM Lee do it?</p>
