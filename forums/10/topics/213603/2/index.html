Of course, if foreigners with the same education and skills are prepared to accept a lower salary, you have to lower your expectations to compete. If you have trained yourself in a sunset industry or one where many already hold similar qualifications, of course you will expect fewer jobs and lower salaries. That's why the disk drive factory operator may have to undergo re-training to work in a high tech clean room in a wafer fab factory.<br><br>Nobody owes you a living.

As said, locals cannot live with the kind of salaries an FW can, much to due to ever increasing costs of living. Those who have the necessary skills and qualifications who are young, are facing issues such as lack of experience, expected salaries too high, racial preferences of some employers, language preferences by some employers. While the older ones who have the experience and skills/qualifications are facing age discrimination even though they are willing to accept lower salaries. I don't think I'm the one who's blind / blnded here....<br><br>I doubt that NOBODY owes the people of Singapore a living, because I still could not find good causes for the people to owe our government the votings every 5 years. Haven't you noted the gradual drop in votes?<br><br>Sure of course the PRC FWs and other FWs as well as FTs will face costs of living issues here. And the fact that they are paying private rates in government clinics and hospitals are indicative signs that our gov are gleefully making money from all these influx of job-robbing FWs from PRC and elswhere! Of course they are willing to live under cramp conditions for the<br>money they can convert back in their country, it's temporary to them. Once they've made enough they will return to homeland - and our 'wise' gov thinks they'd stay and contribute in terms of Tax and babies??? Balls...<br><br>The less educated and illiterates will just have to upgrade.. sounds so simple doesn't it? You think cheap to upgrade? If education in Singapore is such a golden key of an opportunity to a career, why the HELL is our government now valuing FTs and FWs more than the locals whom they have "brought up" with their education system?? Lower inflation you say? I say it's<br>more like runneth over their coffers!! Look at the slew of changes in the current education system now!! All the friggin U-turns that many fedback to them years ago and was ignored!!!<br><br>The IRs are just another money making machine for the gov., and when it opens, lets see who the jobs go to...<br><br></div>
