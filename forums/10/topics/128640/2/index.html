            <div class='col-md body'>I am not against FT policy or competition.

Many cleaners are foreign labours and there is no way Singaporeans can fight with them as they are on very low salariesÂ…it need an uplift to redesign jobs for Singaporeans at a competitive salary to reach a S$1,000 a month.<br>Secondly, in many sectors, manufacturing, IT, engineering, banking etc, u have tons of applicants from all over the world ie. Cambodian, Vietnamese, Mainland Chinese, Indians, Philippinos etc all applying for these jobs. All these pple have local addresses, so they are in Singapore already.<br>2 years ago, I have more than 300 applicants for a engineer position. More than half are foreigners.

Do we still have a place for our new graduates to be trained, a opportunity for them to learn new skillsets if all these jobs are taken by Â“mediocre talentsÂ”.<br>For example, if u r a programmer, u will lose your skillsets within a year or two, without practice. An Indian or Chinese programmer is willing to take home S$800 Â– S$1000 while u r a new graduate, u will demand at least S$1500 Â– S$1,800.

So yes, one can raise productivity by lowering the cost of wages.... if one was to talk in pure economic terms without looking at the social impact of mass importing foreign nationals to take over a portion of local jobs.<br><br>For the 'victim' part, I think that there are very few jobs held by Singaporeans that cannot be easily replaced by a cheaper foreign labourer. Civil servants are protected for one. Professions like Law, Medicine etc are another. If your immediate work place is completely populated by Singaporeans, good for you - but there are plenty of companies that are hiring foreign labour cheaply. Even when they do not do so, they can outsource to third parties who can then lower their cost through cheaper foreign labour. Just because you are not a victim now does not mean that you are forever safe.<br><br>I work in the financial sector, and in my company there is only a small handful of Singaporean programmers, roughly double that in Malaysians, and the rest is either from India or China. Some of my friends reports a similar picture, though slightly less drastic. Our backroom operations, support staff etc are mixed with foreign workers too. My department were looking for a new guy, and my boss actually went and ask me if I mind working with an Indian/China guy as they were priced much lower than the locals.<br><br>How much are Singaporeans worth? I think the more appropriate question to ask is : how low can a Singaporean accept for his wages given the cost of living here? I would imagine that one can accept significantly lower wages if one have the option to double it when one crosses the causeway, or triple or more by flying back to China or India.<br><br>Ultimately, there are many skill sets that are in high demand. There are skill sets which have great international mobility too. But it is a fact that not everyone can get such, and not everyone is at an age where mobility still exists.<br><br>I think it is insensitive to laugh of the fate of older/lesser skilled Singaporean workers, and blame them when the government is opening the gates to workers from lower cost of living countries. The option for retraining is limited by the alternative employment opportunities available, and these are strongly affected by the volume of foreign investments coming in.<br></div></blockquote>the more education u get, the more competition from foreign elites u get. hence, the mroe education u get, the less salary u can ask for due to extreme competition. end up u sign SAF, SPF....dats y got so many people wanna sign now....they can lower the pay by 10% and people will still sign, y ? cos outside hard to find job even if u have a decent degree. y is dat so ? cos foreign elites ask for less salary cos their family not based here, cost of living lower. our family all based here, the 4-5 rm flat alone can make u slog for a decade....let alone car, kids and parents.</div>

If retail is not dying, why do the retail associations lobby to postpone the 1% increase in GST. Basically, our tourism sector have been caught napping, ie why the IR is needed, but Casino is another issue which I do not want to debate over here.<br>Our service sucks if u have been to HK or even Shanghai or Dubai. I traveled a lot, almost half a year, n Singapore is not really a place to get good service, let alone their bochap attitude.<br><br>Remember, the union pple did visited China and then they realised how highly skilled these Chinese workers are, how much they are paid etc. and came back realising that Singapore is slipping..our cost structure is too high to compete against them.</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CX:<br>there is no argument here... some are really not that sharp... and it reflects the mindset of the employers who hire them as well...<br><br>but i see you poking holes at situations who are inherent in the work cycle of an employee. they are not problems caused by FTs per se.<br><br>programmers lose their relevence within 6 mths, not 2 yrs. that is the pace of IT nowadays. at its height in the 90s, a chip that intel rolls onto the production line is obsolete the moment it leaves it.<br><br>is the pace faster without FTs? no... so what's the point?<br><br>and we blame FTs for our own mediocrity? how does that work? are we world class if we only race within our own small pond?  </blockquote><span style="color: red;">Why should Singapore be so opaque about these things on FTs. Australia, NZ for eg. Has very clear policy about foreign employees. Why not have let the private association, assess their foreign peers, for two years before allowing them to continue to be employed in Singapore. By and large, you see a lot of MNC, or even our gahment-related companies CEO, MD, etc bring their own pple to fill in positions rather than getting Singaporeans. For eg. DBS Bank, during Phillipe tenure, 3 MDs, all Singaporeans, having more than 10 years banker experience from HK, China and Taiwan resigned. These experienced and talented Singaporeans are being displaced by these so-called FTs. Is this a shame.<br><br>If these FTs are really talented, would Singapore be what it is today. We tok BIG abt ourselves, we are number 1 in this and that. Is this sickening. Many Singaporeans do not realize their own weakness, simplicity till they have started to work in more Â“complexÂ” country like China, or India. Remember, LTA highlighted that they are world-class transportation, where you experienced regular breakdowns in LRT. Is this just some chest-beating slogan thought up by some Â“fancy scholarsÂ”. Look at SIP, what a failure. Look at some of the private Singapore businessman, like Ron Sim, OSIM, how they overcame the odds to succeed in China.<br><br>What am I saying is that, why do we always have this Â“starry-airyÂ” naiviety that such academic talents are the measure of these exclusive mandarins and not these streetsmart and experienced businessman, who knows how to wheel and deal, SIP would be different today.<br><br>Remember what the ex-ambassador tell Singapore, cut out your arrogance when dealing with China, what do you think who is she referring to.<br><br>I am not clamouring for protectionism, but why shld we be treated as second-class citizens in our own country. And these FTs are mostly mediocre talents, like Indian and Chinese engineers, mostly third-rated and they would jump on to go to USA or Europe, as simple as that. Singapore is just a bus-stop.<br><br>Yes, we shld not race within a small pond, by why shld we let other mediocre pple into our small pond, we are small rit, we have a rit to make a living rit, Our shepherd is supposed to take care of its own sheep, rit and not other pple sheeps rit.</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CX:<br>what about Neil Montefiore of M1?<br><br>what about Terry Clontz? CEO of Starhub?<br><br>what about David Philbrick Conner? CEO of OCBC?<br><br>what about Paul Lawrence? CEO of HSBC Singapore? </blockquote><span style="color: red;">I believe Neil Montefiore is the only FT.<br>Starhub is still losing monies. Any clown still be able to manage it as it is ST-related, part of Temasek Holdings<br>David Conner is still new, need time to tell whether he is a FT or not<br>Cannot comment on Paul Lawrence, do not know much abt him<br>Most of the FTs fall along the wayside, unable to deliver the goods.</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CX:<br>i think any sensible adult can see that there are good ones and there are crappy ones... </blockquote><span style="color: red;">But it is taxpayers monies, my goodness that we get 80% craps and maybe 20% good. What does that speak abt our incumbent gahment. Any sucker would be grateful to walk away with US$ 5 million, even though nothing much is achieved. Look at the way they handle the POSB fiasco. Or its the same argument again, its a honest mistake, we have not enough talents.</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CX:<br>i would fight for what i feel i deserve rather than blame the gov't for everything.  </blockquote><span style="color: red;">I am not blaming the gahment for everything. Singapore is still a safe and good place to do business, and our gahment has a good hand in putting things in place. Along the way, we opened a door too BIG for mediocre talents to be in Singapore, no transparency at all. Rememeber when 2 x NTU professor highlighted that 4 out of 5 jobs goes to foreigners, Manpower Minister Ng EH goes ballistic. Somewhere in between is the truth, statistics do not lie, human do. Even if it is 3 out of 5 jobs goes to foreigners, it is too much. Gahment-elect has a duty to take care of Singaporeans, not just lips service or politicking mascot.<br><br>We spend only 4% of our GDP on health care and we call it subsidy. We spend 25 years to pay off our HDB flat and we call it market subsidy. Lets not be naive, Singaporeans deserved better.</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CX:<br>if we can tap the growth and benefit, of course we should be doing that. but is it the only choice? being a cleaner OR being a millionaire? </blockquote><span style="color: red;">What choice do we have left in Singapore, you said you do not mind being a cleaner in Singapore, I ask you, would you prefer to be a millionaire in China, you did not answer my question. Here in China, there are plenty of opportunities, big or small, nobody to blame, if you cannot make it. In Singapore, control is the key. GLC is into everything. Things are marginally getting better. What kind of business can you do in Singapore, ask yourself frankly. Manufacturing, you are not competitive. Retail rentals are too high. Many banking professionals already left the bank, construction is in bankcrupty, what elseÂ….u name a few and see where we are going.</span><br>[b]<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CX:<br>frankly, are our graduates losing out? are there lots of them out there not getting their dues? if they're not, why? are they absolutely brilliant but not given a chance? plain unlucky perhaps? or are they simply mediocre and unemployable? ]</blockquote><span style="color: red;">If you check out other forums, you can find that there are still quite a lot of new graduates unable to find a job. I do not know why, but it is relative to the economy. So much, for the gahment statistics that we are doing well in this or that but look, is not the casino decision very telling that Singapore will not be able to substain economic growth in the near future. </span></div>
