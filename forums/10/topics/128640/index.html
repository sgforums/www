            <div class='col-md body'>I do feel the same way as the guy who initially posted this topic. The government asks you to be an entrepreneur, starts your own business, venture overseas, etc, etc, ...<br>In a way you could help the economy by you creating more jobs for fellow Singaporeans, more rental places getting fill up, transport and service industries getting more business, etc... And they collect more taxes.<br>And mind you, the minute you succeed, they will support your ventures and later claimed that they played a part in your success. But the minute you failed, you are left all alone to face your creditors.<br>I agreed that we will have to face the creditors as we owe them the money and we have to pay them back, and that is their rights to demand what is owed to them.<br>But the point is that when you are being declared a bankrupt, the people at the Official Assignee office treats you like as though youÂ’ve cheated the whole world. Not a single dignity is given to you.<br>Failing is part and parcel of running a business. Who wants to start their own business if they are treated like pariahs should they fail?<br>Under PM Goh I do notice a change in the attitude of the people in the OA office.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the point the original poster was making, was the concept of the Â‘Foreign TalentÂ’ as presented by our government is mostly bollocks.<br><br>What the government sold us was that the Foreign Talents offer abilities that Singaporeans lack, hence they are contributing to our economy - and not just taking up jobs that locals need. The examples given by the government are curious. CEOs, bankers, top chefs Â– all at the top of the pyramidÂ… but Singaporeans who can compete at this level are already mobile and affluent.<br><br>In reality, the above is a minority. The key issue here is jobs that range from middle management to technical, support and clerical appointments - accountants, programmers, hotel staff, etc. The key issue here is jobs that Singaporeans can perform, jobs that are taken up by foreigners - simply because they are much cheaper.<br><br>Why are these foreign labour cheaper? Because they come from a country with a much lower cost of living. Because their families are in a country with a much lower cost of living. Because they will be returning to retire in a country with a much lower cost of living.<br><br>The dilemma we face is that while national productivity gains seems stagnant, much of our progress have been tied to a constant influx of cheaper foreign labor - not just laborers but trained professionals as well: all contributing to lowering the wage costs of the service, financial, manufacturing sectors. How bad will be the impact on businesses if they are forced to replace their existing cheap labor with higher priced Singaporeans?<br><br>It is a delicate balance to keep, and the government must balance the needs of the economy with the needs of the people or risk alienating them.

The context needs to be right. For the higher income jobs, it is not just about paper qualification. The network u bring along is vital... such as getting MNCs to invest in Singapore which could create more jobs.<br><br>For the middle mgt jobs, well, it should be open competition. To make a general statement like all being equal BUT the foreigner gets "more" equal is flawed. perhaps that got to do with being able to "market" ourselves better? or to articulate better?<br><br>For the lower income type of jobs, of course it would be reasonable to offer locals if all being equal. The problem is we have this "social" status mentality that constrains us to not taking up. Not to mention that we "demand" higher pay to support our expenses...<br><br></div>

So yes, one can raise productivity by lowering the cost of wages.... if one was to talk in pure economic terms without looking at the social impact of mass importing foreign nationals to take over a portion of local jobs.<br><br>For the 'victim' part, I think that there are very few jobs held by Singaporeans that cannot be easily replaced by a cheaper foreign labourer. Civil servants are protected for one. Professions like Law, Medicine etc are another. If your immediate work place is completely populated by Singaporeans, good for you - but there are plenty of companies that are hiring foreign labour cheaply. Even when they do not do so, they can outsource to third parties who can then lower their cost through cheaper foreign labour. Just because you are not a victim now does not mean that you are forever safe.<br><br>I work in the financial sector, and in my company there is only a small handful of Singaporean programmers, roughly double that in Malaysians, and the rest is either from India or China. Some of my friends reports a similar picture, though slightly less drastic. Our backroom operations, support staff etc are mixed with foreign workers too. My department were looking for a new guy, and my boss actually went and ask me if I mind working with an Indian/China guy as they were priced much lower than the locals.<br><br>How much are Singaporeans worth? I think the more appropriate question to ask is : how low can a Singaporean accept for his wages given the cost of living here? I would imagine that one can accept significantly lower wages if one have the option to double it when one crosses the causeway, or triple or more by flying back to China or India.<br><br>Ultimately, there are many skill sets that are in high demand. There are skill sets which have great international mobility too. But it is a fact that not everyone can get such, and not everyone is at an age where mobility still exists.<br><br>I think it is insensitive to laugh of the fate of older/lesser skilled Singaporean workers, and blame them when the government is opening the gates to workers from lower cost of living countries. The option for retraining is limited by the alternative employment opportunities available, and these are strongly affected by the volume of foreign investments coming in.<br></div>
