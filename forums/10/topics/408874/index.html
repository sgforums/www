              I think that it partisan politics isn't healthy for the future of 
                  Singapore and it is thus wrong for CHAPTER 218- 'Parliamentary Elections
                   Act' to be so biased towards partisan politics (pls see follows- re: 
                  recent Australian Labour vs Liberal party elections- hung parliament 
                  problem).<br> <br> The strict ruling of  either <span style="color: red;"> 'same political party'</span> or <span style="color: red;">'independent candidates standing as a group'</span>, for instance precludes viable options of either<br> i) &gt;1 political parties forming a GRC or <br> ii) independents being co-opted up with a some political party to compete;<br> <br> - therefore puts secondary after partisan politics- the interest of the 
                  electorate- as smaller political parties and independents have little if
                   not no chance to compete as GRCs- but are forced into the catch-22 of 
                  going for the same SMC- into the election trap of the ruling PAP's SMC 
                  candidate who'd then benefit in a 'first past the post' method of 
                  elections (FPTP-voting: Party 'Opp1'= 24%, 'Opp2'= 25%, 'Opp3'= 25%, 
                  'Ruling'= 26%; 'Ruling' wins with most votes amongst the 4 candidates).<br> <br> As seen the case of the current Aust elections-2010, the electorate has 
                  now become divided amongst 2 overbearing political parties, whose right 
                  to govern it seems, would be eventually determined by pandering to 
                  "three independents, a Green Party candidate, and an  independent whose 
                  seat is not yet confirmed. " [<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11050525">BBC, 22Aug2010</a>]- partisan elections and politics have become a crying shame.<br> Seeing the divided US electorate, the hung UK parliament, the 
                  floundering US and European economies,what do I now think about MPs who 
                  are members of political parties, they- sorry for the derogatory 
                  language-  are just spineless 'drones' out for a ritual blast. Why, 
                  because these 'partying' MPs have sold their souls to 'partisan 
                  brotherhood'-  where membership requisites obedience to the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_%28politics%29">party whip</a>'
                   in exchange for plentiful rewards- political donations et. al. Aren't 
                  they just perpetuating the curse that big brother party ('too big to 
                  fail') is all we need/ want? Why can't we elect 'independents' to 
                  represent us in parliament- persons who can discuss eloquently and 
                  effectively what's collectively a better and wiser deal for all, who can
                   amongst peers form a government of consensus and not for  reasons of 
                  partisan politics?- and yes, the PAP has sadly precluded from us this

As in previous elections, 
                  PAP had tied the scheduling of housing  upgrades to the number of votes 
                  the party received in the election. The  PAP argued that government was 
                  successful in raising the standard of  living in the country, and those 
                  who supported its various policies,  including the upgrading, should be 
                  given priority. In the hotly  contested Aljunied GRC, George Yeo (PAP) 
                  placed lift upgrading the "top  of [his] priority list" so that the lift
                   would stop on every floor in as  many blocks as possible.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_general_election,_2006#cite_note-58">[59]</a> Sylvia Lim (WP) accused the PAP of being selective in its upgrading programmes, arguing that this was a divisive policy.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_general_election,_2006#cite_note-59">[60]</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_general_election,_2006">wiki:Singaporean general election, 2006</a>]<br> - <strong>'Lift upgrading: Why Chiam and Low are not fronting it'</strong>: "This
