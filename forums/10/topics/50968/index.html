            <div class='col-md body'>This overpriced retrenchment exercise to compensate the 1315 (apprently only half of those involved will be placed in the new subsidiary) already overpaid employees "retrenched" by the HDB and then simply transferred to the subsidiary is a slap in the face for all unemployed and retrenched Singaporeans who know what it means to be really unemployed at home twiddling their thumbs looking for jobs that aren't there.<br><br>So they'll be taking an up-to-15% paycut. Welcome to the real world fat cats, the private sector has been cutting wages for years for more work. Why do these overpaid bureaucrats need to be fattened up to accept the same?<br><br>The cost recovered in 6 years? If any private sector CEO came up with this cost-cutting plan in his company the shareholders would shoot him and string him up on the nearest lampost. What sort of cost cutting exercise bears fruits after 6 years?<br><br>Shame on you HDB!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>may have something to do if upon retirement, their retirement benefits go to huge amounts, cos of longer service, one advantage of this is that the civil servants are considered as starting as new employees, so their benefits can't escalate from their previous job.<br><br>And this is a common practice by Western companies i think, one division retires a worker and the other hires him/her overnight. . .<br><br>though in such bad times, and with the govt still making appeals to us all lowly Singaporeans out here to spend money, i agree that the sum is just too  much. . . even if it results in some minor savings later<br><br>(i know companies sometimes do that cos my mum told me abt it,at least Smith International did that before. . ., though on a smaller scale)<br><br>there was also some law involved cos the two divisions of Smith Int'l were listed as seperately although they come under the same umbrella, in the US, such a transfer can't be done, perhaps there is a similar law in Singapore i dunno. . .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having read thru much of the above posts as contributed by the rest, I would also like to add in my opinion with regards to the issue from both the immediate micro perspective, as well as the macro implications of the event in the domestic business environment.<br><br>In refreshing back our memories pertaining to the events, we see that the course of events unfolding:<br><br>1)HDB Management requesting senior staff to volunteer for the SRS (Special Resignation Scheme). The objective of this SRS program is aimed primarily at trimming staff strength to a minimum, while at the same time, Â‘retainingÂ’ the younger staff of the statutory board.<br><br>2)Having identified upon the Â‘volunteeredÂ’ candidates for the SRS program, HDB then proceeded to calculate out the repayment packages for each individuals.<br><br>3)Meanwhile, the new HDB Corp is also actively carrying out its own recruitment exercise.<br><br>4)Having received their SRS package, the freshly discharged former HDB staff would hence be looking for a new job.<br><br>5)Naturally, having done what they have been doing for the past decades, the first company that the majority of the crowd would have in mind, would naturally be the new HDB Corp.<br><br>6)Of those whom had then applied for vacancies in the new company, 700 got the job.<br><br>And simultaneously, the rest is history as we would all have been very clear about.<br><br>Now in reviewing thru the entire logic flow process of the events unfolding, we see that there were certainly no issues of legislative breaches with regards in particular to the Singapore Employment Act.<br><br>Be the entire scenario analyzed from its legality perspective, much of the critical elements involved can be said to be done in place with accordance to the legal structure.<br><br>And in view of certain remarks by the public crying foul at Â‘abuseÂ’ of the SRS system where critics have been questioning on why the 700 former HDB employees whom had been the recipients of the SRS package are once again rehired by HDB Corp, the official spokesman for HDB has clarified that the rationale for the Â‘retrench first then hire againÂ’ move was to ensure that the newly established corporation to have Â‘a fresh startÂ’ without the carrying forward of previous burdens.<br><br>Going strictly by the book, we cannot deny that truth in the statement, nor question on its legality, since as with the previous above, there were no breach.<br><br>Under the logic based form of analysis, every event and every action that has taken placed were systematic and well in place in accordance with the default protocol practices.<br><br>In other words, there were no fault with HDB ManagementÂ’s decision.<br><br>But then again, what we have seen in the above represented only the logic and rational aspect of the case.<br><br>If we were to involve the factor of human emotions into the picture as well, we would suddenly come to realize that unlike the previous conclusion, we have forgotten to take into consideration, the sense of guilt in the hearts of the HDB management.<br><br>The decision to retrench is never an easy one to make. All the more, when the organization that is currently facing the need to do so, is a governmentally affiliated statutory board.<br><br>And to add in onto the stress, the case would also be its first in the history of Singapore, where a statutory board would be retrenching it staff for the first time.<br><br>Compounded by the reluctance to play the role of the Â‘bad guysÂ’ and at the same time, to minimized upon the shock of the public from the shaken confidence that even the security of jobs in the statutory boards are now no different from that of those in the private sectors, my personal belief is that in its formulating and execution of the entire re-trimming and SRS program, the HDB Management had been the victims of their subconscious pressure to compensate their retrenched staff to the best of their abilities.<br><br>In doing so, we cannot deny that the intention of the HDB management has been well intended.<br><br>However due to the nature of its statutory board nature and the origin of its source of funding to have come from the Singapore Government and the tax payers, one cannot help but to frown on the appropriateness of the eventsÂ’ sequential happening.<br><br>Going back to previous event sequence as seen above, consider the routing of an alternate possibility:<br><br>1)HDB Corp is actively recruiting.<br><br>2)HDB wants to trim down on staff strength.<br><br>3)Both HDB and HDB Corp work together to identify on the cluster of existing HDB staff who are interested in a transfer to the new establishment.<br><br>4)Interviewing takes place, and the selected 700 staff are transferred to the new HDB Corp.<br><br>5)The remainant pool of HDB staff would then be offered the SRS scheme.<br><br>6)Those who opted for the scheme would thus be discharged from service.<br><br>As suggested by the above, it would have taken only the small reversal of a few actions under the same situation to complete the necessary.<br><br>Had the HDB management used a similar sequence to that of above, there would have not been no need for HDB to wait Â‘6 yearsÂ’ to recover back a portion of the sums as lost to the SRS package.<br><br>Under the conditions of such trying times, think of the alternatives in which the monies could have been spent on more wisely.<br><br>For example, think about those lesser privileged few whom may be from the lower or middle-low income clusters.<br><br>These fellow countrymen who may be having problems paying for their sundries,  loans or rentals for their tiny 3 or 2 room flats.<br><br>In comparison with the opportunity cost of the monies spent between the choices of the monies being spent on a retrenchment package and a year of rebates for some thousands families, it is hence regrettable to say that thought the manner of handing had not in breach of any legalistic framework, but under the challenge of opportunity cost and appropriateness, the managementÂ’s decision certainly does not appear to fall into the best practice and fitting category.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continuing on onto a more macro perspective of evaluation, the case of the HDB SRS has no doubt distinguished itself out as an important precedent and case study for subsequent management study and discussions to be made upon.<br><br>The importance of the HDB SRS Case lies primarily in its highlighting of a crucial balancing order by the management, to address on the varying concerns between the clash of two very important stakeholders in the organizationÂ’s environment, namely, members of the public, and the HDB staff themselves.<br><br>Incidentally as pointed in the earlier post above, it is suspected that the involvement of human emotions have also played some significant but invisible influence on the decisional outcomes of the entire event unfold chain.<br><br>While the presence of emotional interferences is an area which no humans would be able to filter out completely from any one given decision making process, the least that could be used as an alternative to counter on its inherent biasness, would probably be to engage in the assistance of an independent HR committee for the arising of subsequent and similar future events.<br><br>Working on properties that are similar to the function of an independent audit committee of a registered company, perhaps it is time to consider the inclusion of such special HR committees to be formed under a greater umbrella of Corporate Governance.<br><br>While the private sectors companies and organization have full fledged says in their internal affairs, public sector and afflicted cannot be said so.<br><br>Hence, it could be feasible to have an external taskforce body that may be set up temporary to oversee the process and progress of a ( touch wood ) similar statutory board retrenchment exercise.<br><br>Ideally, the proposed supervising committee could have representatives from both the Accountant-General and Auditor-GeneralÂ’s Offices, representatives from the HR professionals and selected top management individuals with good performance, moral and ethical track records.<br><br>The introduction of such a protocol would not only serve to prevent on similar gray occurrences, but also, signify as a further maturity of the local corporate governing awareness.<br><br>Incidentally, without association to any previous examples, the existence of the body would also serve to ensure on the transparency and legitimacy of future retrenchment practices.<br><br>Thought there will be the complains of added bureaucracy, the positive benefits would include the discouraging to organizations to use retrenchment as Â‘readily available textbook solutions to a bad timeÂ’ as depicted from the current business environmental trend, or as a means of bully to instill fear and unfair compliances to an unjust set of requirements.<br><br>With every major retrenchment that would thus be placed under open public scrutiny, it is generally believed that such openness would serve to elevate upon the curbing of managements to use staff re-trimming as a popular manner of corrective action, and to help promote on more creative problem-solving and bona fide courses of actions.<br><br>And keeping in mind that that majority if private sectors employers are still largely foreign-based MNCs, it is all the more important that a stable sense of business confidence is conveyed to them.<br><br>Continuous reports on retrenchment matters and conflicts would certainly help to do little but to complicate on ensuring such critical confidence for more heavy weight foreign investors to forth.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's just a way to make a public announcement that the new construction company is a completely separate entity and has nothing to do with HDB.  If you ask me it is just plain stupidity  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
