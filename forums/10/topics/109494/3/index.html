            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, I am a newbie to the forum.<br><br>Just come across this interesting topic about the core business of NTUC.<br><br>My uncle is an agent of NTUC Income and I used to hear him say that NTUC Income is a company that provides more than insurance. Although insurance is the core business of Income, it also  provides a wide range of special benefits including, competitive loans, 24-hour repair services, domestic cleaning services, house moving service, tuition service and health screenings.<br><br>He also told me that Income being a cooperative is different from other insurance companies like AIA, Great Eastern. Unlike these companies who place the interests of the shareholders as the priority, Income has always placed the interests of its policyholders foremost.<br><br>That's basically what I know.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>im surprise so many complain about NTUC. to be frank. i think it good because we start to question the role and function NTUC will play into this decades. i dont mind about NTUC being in the supermarket business or insurance business as long as the objective is the keep cost of living down.

NTUC need to send a clear signal to the public whether they are parrots of the PAP or independant organisation that fight for the worker of singapore and not a ground for NTUC executive to advance their poltical career at the expenses of union member welfare.<br><br>what do you guys think?</div>
