            <div class='col-md body'>You guys dun get it .. most times yes they are stealing peoples business, but not this one. This round they are trying to get NTUC to help boost peoples spending. By competiting against the local businesses and offering better rates it will force prices down.<br><br>You must look at economy as a whole, currently now things are picking up after a slump since 2000 but there is a danger of it falling back again into deflation so garmen trying to boost it.<br><br>Many ppl say "oh this year or next year economy dun look so good" all nonsense &amp; not true at all. You must understand what move the economy.<br><br>what are the main drivers of a booming economy ... very low interest rates, easy credit, continous spending like construction, and spending on big ticket items like housing, cars etc ... traditionally when sales of these things move up tremendously other things will move also, other things move means business bottom lines across the landscape improve that means more hirings, pay increases and bonuses etc etc etc ....<br><br>but with a booming economy comes inflation but choose between that and deflation any government in the world will rather work with inflation any day because deflation means people jobless and that leads to a whole lot social problems and in the end creating potential terrorists. And the garmen if you noticed have been trying for several years now to stimulate the economy by constantly paving and re-paving all the blady roads creating mini traffic jams everywhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , building new or improve infrastructure etc ... all these are small drivers which keeps the economy humming.<br><br>Can't remember exactly the figures but I think previously if you bought a home you required a down payment was 20% that was reviewed and changed to current 10% to make it easier for people to afford a home.<br><br>Previously you couldn't buy a car with a credit card but now you could.<br><br>With bank home loan wars going on it only means easy credit, easy credit means more spending which leads to more profits, more hires again etc etc etc ...<br><br>so you ppl must understand lar.. this is good thing for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Clarification from NTUC Income as reported in 27 Dec ST Forum Page<br><br>----------------<br>Dec 27, 2004<br>We're not selling cars, says NTUC Income chief<br>I REFER to the report, 'NTUC Income to sell cars' (ST, Dec 25).<br><br>The article is misleading. We are not selling cars. We are not promising discounts.<br><br>Here is the correct situation:<br><br>Last month, we asked our policyholders if they are interested in participating in collective purchase of vehicles and properties. About 1,000 of them expressed interest.<br><br>Two weeks ago, we held a briefing for the interested policyholders to discuss several issues, including collective purchase, parallel import, warranty, certificate of entitlement, loan and insurance. Two hundred policyholders attended this seminar.<br><br>At the briefing, we invited a few dealers to present their offer of a discount for certain car models.<br><br>A few days later, your senior correspondent Christopher Tan wrote and asked me to comment about our proposed car cooperative. I did not know what he was talking about. I replied that we were not forming a new car cooperative.<br><br>Later, he clarified that he was interested about our collective purchase briefing. I referred him to my colleagues who were responsible for this project.<br><br>In the ST report, he said that 'the usually chatty Mr Tan was evasive about the bulk car purchase plan'. I find this remark to be unjustified and mischievous. In any case, we do not consider our activity to be worth reporting. This is why we did not invite your journalist to cover our event.<br><br>If your paper wishes to report this event, you should at least ensure that your report is reasonably accurate. Your headline was particularly misleading.<br><br>You have caused a lot of unnecessary trouble for us. I ask you to have my reply displayed prominently in your paper.<br><br>Tan Kin Lian<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>NTUC Income<br><br>CHRISTOPHER TAN REPLIES:<br><br>We reported factually what happened at the presentation NTUC Income made to prospective car buyers. Getting them to buy cars through Income is, in our view, getting into the car-selling business. That was the gist of our report.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.

This round they are trying to get NTUC to help boost peoples spending. By competiting against the local businesses and offering better rates it will force prices down.<br><br>You must look at economy as a whole, currently now things are picking up after a slump since 2000 but there is a danger of it falling back again into deflation so garmen trying to boost it.<br><br>Many ppl say "oh this year or next year economy dun look so good" all nonsense &amp; not true at all. You must understand what move the economy.<br><br>what are the main drivers of a booming economy ... very low interest rates, easy credit, continous spending like construction, and spending on big ticket items like housing, cars etc ... traditionally when sales of these things move up tremendously other things will move also, other things move means business bottom lines across the landscape improve that means more hirings, pay increases and bonuses etc etc etc ....<br><br>but with a booming economy comes inflation but choose between that and deflation any government in the world will rather work with inflation any day because deflation means people jobless and that leads to a whole lot social problems and in the end creating potential terrorists. And the garmen if you noticed have been trying for several years now to stimulate the economy by constantly paving and re-paving all the blady roads creating mini traffic jams everywhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , building new or improve infrastructure etc ... all these are small drivers which keeps the economy humming.<br><br>Can't remember exactly the figures but I think previously if you bought a home you required a down payment was 20% that was reviewed and changed to current 10% to make it easier for people to afford a home.<br><br>Previously you couldn't buy a car with a credit card but now you could.<br><br>With bank home loan wars going on it only means easy credit, easy credit means more spending which leads to more profits, more hires again etc etc etc ...<br><br>so you ppl must understand lar.. this is good thing for us.</div></blockquote>NTUC is not government right?

            <div class='col-md body'>NTUC's groceries prices may not be the cheapest, but they are nearly the cheapest. Places such as Sheng Siong may be marginally cheaper, but the ambience is totally different.<br><br>A casual price comparison with places such as Cold Storage Supermart will easily reveal that NTUC prices are value for money.<br><br>If it were not for the NTUC, you can be sure that the prices of most goods would be more expensive than they are. In that sense, NTUC benefits everyone, members as well as non-members.<br><br>The presence of NTUC prevents shops from profiterring. It was first set up in the 70s during rice shortages and grocery shops took advantage of the situation to jack up their prices unreasonably. Recently, during the egss crisis, NTUC sourced for alternative suppliers until prices returned to normal.<br><br>NTUC is a cooperative and all Singaporeans should be grateful that it is one of the most successful cooperatives here.<br><br></div>
