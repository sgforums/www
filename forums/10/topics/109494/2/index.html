            <div class='col-md body'>NTUC= National trade union congress.<br><br>alot of ppl has misconception about NTUC as part of govt organisation. well i am not at all surprise consider many member of the NTUC are part of the PAP regime.<br>NTUC is a union of blue collar workers mainly. sorry i left my textbook in the shelf for a long time. it is the unbrella for many other smaller union in singapore. such as taxi driver union, bus driver and etc. function is for collective agreement (CA) negotiation with employer. White collar staff or with salary higher than $1600 are not allow to join union as it deem they can negotiate their salary and benefits. but things change, nowadays white collar member are allow to join member but without CA representation. meaning member for benefits like points for NTUC supermarket, chalets and other discounts.<br><br>some ppl believe NTUC are actually pressing the price of normal goods down so everyone can buy cheaper goods from supermarket. but without NTUC do you think we will have more carrefour, Giant, on the HDB area? do you find price from these outlets more expensive then NTUC?<br><br>I think NTUC best stick to their main role and core business that is " fight for the blue collar of Singapore workers" and not be a parrot for the PAP.<br>* Lim SS (secretary general) have to speak out for the workers and not speak what the PAP want you to speak.<br><br></div>

By competiting against the local businesses and offering better rates it will force prices down.<br><br>You must look at economy as a whole, currently now things are picking up after a slump since 2000 but there is a danger of it falling back again into deflation so garmen trying to boost it.<br><br>Many ppl say "oh this year or next year economy dun look so good" all nonsense &amp; not true at all. You must understand what move the economy.<br><br>what are the main drivers of a booming economy ... very low interest rates, easy credit, continous spending like construction, and spending on big ticket items like housing, cars etc ... traditionally when sales of these things move up tremendously other things will move also, other things move means business bottom lines across the landscape improve that means more hirings, pay increases and bonuses etc etc etc ....<br><br>but with a booming economy comes inflation but choose between that and deflation any government in the world will rather work with inflation any day because deflation means people jobless and that leads to a whole lot social problems and in the end creating potential terrorists. And the garmen if you noticed have been trying for several years now to stimulate the economy by constantly paving and re-paving all the blady roads creating mini traffic jams everywhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , building new or improve infrastructure etc ... all these are small drivers which keeps the economy humming.<br><br>Can't remember exactly the figures but I think previously if you bought a home you required a down payment was 20% that was reviewed and changed to current 10% to make it easier for people to afford a home.<br><br>Previously you couldn't buy a car with a credit card but now you could.<br><br>With bank home loan wars going on it only means easy credit, easy credit means more spending which leads to more profits, more hires again etc etc etc ...<br><br>so you ppl must understand lar.. this is good thing for us.</div></blockquote>Yeah.yeah... more bankruptcy also...<br><br>Eventually NTUC will takeover Geylang prostitution as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NTUC cooperatives were full of goodness at one time. They can help people to check on inflations. Scholars are good to have as well. Many government policies and actions also are full of good intentions.<br><br>But every goodness in life comes with certain badness. Every action of the government too has its positive and negative effects. While scholars are beneficial, to public administration, over-emphasising talents in education and jobs marginalise EM2 and EM2 leading to brain drains by the thousands. Practical passions in larger aspects of economic and social life need the fullest support and participation by all to produce entrepreneurship, competitiveness and vibrancy.<br><br>Our talented civil servants and ministers should be people who can distinguish good from bas and when they implement anything, they should always strive to increase the goodness but avoid causing badness.<br><br>So NTUC should go back to basic and assess whether the NTUC today has exceeded its original role of checking on inflation.<br><br>NTUC cannot replace the domestic businesses or take over the economy. If it can then it may be alright for it to go free reign on all domestic businesses and compete as much as it can. If it cannot replace the growth engine of the domestic sector, then it should work not only to reduce inflation and stop short in stifling the growth and vibrancy of the domestic businesses.<br><br>Therefore, our leaders should have clear vision and not be shortsighted on NTUC allowing it to become a monster which may one day totally decimate the domestic sector until they are marginalised or extinct.<br><br>It is wrong to have HDB increasing the rentals and NTUC cutting into their business territory.<br><br>Government should always work towards increasing goodness to its people and not to cause job losses due to failing of its domestic sector or stifling the growth and economic wellbeing of its citizens.<br><br>If government wants entrepreneurship, it should straightaway reassess the NTUC role so as to support businesses while discharging its anti-inflation check.<br><br>All government businesses should be assessed so as to produce goodness and not badness. Otherwise, no matter how successful Singapore may be in term of GDP growths or international acclaims, it cannot be a successful government in the people's hearts. People will need it only for benefits and may not have truly heart-felt good opinion of leaders or government.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, all forumers,<br><br>NTUC chief is on record as saying that people must retrain themselves in order to be employable as if they don't already know about values of education. Talk is cheap!!!<br><br>Does it understand that enough about what is relevant and not relevant for the purpose of training or re-training. Even after re-training, there is no assurance of jobs. Using existing knowledge innovatively might lead to job creation but NTUC missed this point all the time.<br><br>The root cause of unemployment is loss of economic competitiveness by the neglected domestic sector of the economy due to high costs attributable to a system of double charging on land and vehicles and government tax-and-recover non-welfarism policy.<br><br>Citizens paid certain taxes towards provisions of basis services like utilities, transportation, security and medical.<br><br>If all departments keep recovering costs of operations to break even their department account, taxes will be extras and surpluses which stifle the growth of the economy.<br><br>Current government practices of tax-and-recover need to be scrutinised first not all the justifications to show government cannot do this or that to excuse themselves from job creation.<br><br>There have been too many training and re-training programmes but how many jobs have been created to help the trainees to get employment.<br><br>A few workers will be appearing on TV to show that they are very happy. A few small enterprise bosses will be reporting on their success but ask all the businessmen and bosses outside the defined 1,000 SMEs, all will be telling a different story. Read the news on re-trained workers not finding jobs as posted in "Retraining - think again" to find out more about relevance of training and whether the certificates of training were recognized by employers.<br><br>NTUC is only operating in the unreal world. The world is not going through structural unemployment situation so don't keep preaching that the government is not able to do anything to save jobs.<br><br>NTUC must identify itself with causes of workers and job creation instead of giving excuses or setting up more businesses to compete with local small businessmen who are trying to earn a living to feed their families and creating jobs for locals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
