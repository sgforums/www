                  If still cannot pay, can see MP to address the problem.  
                  If cannot see MP or no time to queue in Meet The People Session, please call 1800 xxxxxxx, then they arrange a house visiting at your conveient time from Town Council.

              Hey, it is not fair just because u are sick then everyone has to pay for your living expense, right?  Remeber the upgrading is beneicial to u leh.  now my auntie has a lift right to her doorstep.  She has a bigger ktichen blah blah also.
              
              Furthermore, the MP knows that 10% is still within the mean of my aunt coz he help her with the insurance payout that are tens of thousands of dollars.  The original upgrading cost is abt $8K so 10% is abt $800 only.  If MP help u to claim ~$40k (DPS) insurance payout then u only need to deduct $800 for upgrading, is not unreasonable, right?
