              <p>Actually Singapore was a trading post and a thriving city given
              its good geographic location and colonial rule. However, there was
              less welfare for the average people of Singapore, thus
              necessitating independent non-British government for the people.
              But we must not give the new government credit for British
              institutions and a level of development and self-government which
              was far superior to those granted by other colonies. We must give
              credit where it is due, and credit belongs to British institutions
              as well as the PAP government, and foreign advisers as well as
              foreign workers. Credit must be fair.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>The leaders of Singapore were depressed when Singapore was
              ejected out of Malaysia, there is much debate whether or not it was
              Mr Lee's own view of transforming Singapore into an independent
              trading metropolis that can survive on its own, or whether or not
              he took that view because his Dutch advisers had a much more
              positive view of being seperate from Malaysia.</p>
              <p><br> Why do we have the view of fishing village? Our chief export has
              never been fish haha. It's really interesting how history books
              here manipulate the imagery of how backward we were until we had a
              shining new government. Very interesting.,</p>

              <p>whether it is a fishing village, chicken farm or buaya farm, let enjoy what we hv today. And if you are argueing who ever should get the credit, let face the truth, PAP is the ruling party. FULL STOP</p>
