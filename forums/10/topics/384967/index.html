              <p>Monday, 14 December 2009</p>
              <p><em><br><img style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 1px 5px; float: left;" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/activists/jufrie.jpg" alt="" width="50"><br><br></em><em></em></p>
              <p><em>Jufrie Mahmood<br></em><br>I
              was sad and somewhat amused - but certainly not surprised - over a
              recent report that Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister in Charge of Muslim
              Affairs, does not know what to do to solve some of the more serious
              problems that ail the community under his charge.<br><br>And I am not
              at all surprised if he is not even aware of some other problems that
              have already beset the community and their root causes.</p>
              <p><img style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 1px 5px; float: left;" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/PAP1/yacobibrahim.jpg" alt="" width="180"></p>
              <p><br>But how can he not know when he seems to be in close touch with
              every single institution within the Malay/Muslim community? Can it be
              that he has also surrounded himself with the proverbial inner circle of
              the emperor that dares not tell him that he has no clothes on?<br><br>Every
              single Malay/Muslim organization, every mosque committee and the whose
              who in the community falls within his ambit. Leadership forums are
              supposed to be held regularly to highlight, keep track of and explore
              solutions to problems faced by the community.<br><br>Have these
              “leaders” not told him that a large section, especially those in the
              lower rungs, of the community is of late facing the greatest ever
              challenge in their lives trying to make ends meet? Have they not told
              him that the perennial drug problem is still haunting the community? He
              surely cannot be unaware that the high rate of teen marriages and
              divorces do not only beset young couples but are also increasingly
              afflicting elderly couples partly because money is never enough?<br><br>Is
              he not aware that there are more people begging for alms outside the
              gates of mosques and the Geylang food outlets? Is he not told that more
              and more people are losing their homes due to their inability to
              service their mortgages to commercial banks?<br><br>What is more
              important is to identify the causes. Only then can we begin to look for
              solutions. The Malay/Muslim community has the resources to tackle these
              problems. What with the assets under the charge of the Islamic
              Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS)? Warees, the property arm of the
              council, once bragged that it was managing assets worth half-a-billion
              dollars. With modest annual returns of just 5%, for example, the
              community will have a war chest of $25 million every year to battle the
              community’s many ills.<br><br>This year it gave the community less than
              $2 million, which represents less than half per cent of the half
              billion dollars worth of assets. How did the rest of the returns spend?
              We should not splurge only on constructing beautiful mosques and other
              buildings. Some of the money should be put aside to build on the
              software, the spiritual foundation and tenacity of the community. This
              matter can be further elaborated in a future write-up.<br><br>And it is
              no exaggeration to say that some of the problems that beset the
              community got to do with the climate of fear which haunts the so-called
              community leaders. When people fear you they don’t normally tell you
              the truth. They don’t lie but they just don’t tell the truth.<br><br>Perhaps
              they dare not tell you that the influx of foreign ‘talent’ is adversely
              affecting the livelihood of not only the lower income Malays but also
              those in the middle rung as well. When people lose their jobs they add
              to the problems of the community and to the nation. When wages are
              depressed people lose heart and productivity falls.<br><br>When they
              work long hours or even take up an additional job to supplement their
              low income their family life suffers. When the wives go out to work to
              help their husbands cope with the ever-increasing cost of living, the
              children get neglected. The children’s performance in school gets a
              knock and inevitably their grades fall. The cycle goes on.<br><br>When
              they work under a constant threat of being retrenched and substituted
              with foreign ‘talent’ they become so stressed up that their health
              suffers. When they fall sick they worry that they would not be able to
              afford the medical bill.<br><br>In the meantime leaders hold forums
              after forums without ever identifying the real problems, let alone find
              solutions that can work. They are afraid of being chastised for going
              against government policy even though the policy is slowly but surely
              bringing more misery to members of their own community.<br><br>Like
              their so-called leaders in the governing party, these community leaders
              too are reluctant to tell their political masters that certain policies
              which discriminate against the community are not good for the country’s
              long-term interest. They dare not say that the policy on casinos is
              against their religious principles. They dare not debunk their
              political leader’s argument that the wearing of the tudung
              (headscarf) in schools will cause disunity among the different races
              even though such ruling goes against the Constitution which guarantees
              religious freedom. They don’t dare to continue saying that SAP schools
              are not fair to the community, will breed potential leaders who may not
              know how to interact with other communities and press for their
              abolition.<br><br>They dare not ……. they dare not ….. they dare not …….. that is what is ailing society!<br><br><em>Jufrie Mahmood</em> <em>is SDP's CEC member and a veteran opposition politician.</em></p>
