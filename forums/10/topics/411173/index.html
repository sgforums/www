              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p><em>“Ever since I first mentioned that we are planning for a population of 6.5 million people, many Singaporeans have reacted with concern, some with alarm, at the thought of more people living and working in Singapore…..Do we need a larger population? Most definitely. To grow and create more and better jobs, Singapore must remain open, competitive and relevant to the global market place,”</em> Mr Mah wrote.</p>
              <p>The statistics from the Government’s own Department of Statistics don’t lie – unless Minister Mah is claiming that his own government statisticians were wrong and slip shod in their work ?</p>
              <p>The statistics clearly show that despite the increasing inflow of new Citizens and PRs since 1999 to 2009 – which resulted in more then ONE MILLION New Citizens and PRs – the Total Fertility Rate has worsened from 1.48 in 1999 to 1.22 in 2009. As of June 2010, there was an increase of over 20,000 unemployed for the same period in 2009; and housing shortages exacerbated from 2006 to 2010; property prices went berserk through the decades.</p>
              <p><em>“In such an economy, we need sufficient people with the right skills and experience. If we cannot get enough from our own people, we must supplement with skilled immigrants. A larger population and greater economic activity will bring about greater buzz, vibrancy and energy, which in turn will attract more people â€¨and new opportunities.”</em></p>
              <p>During the mid-1990s, the Government had called for Singapore’s economy to move up the technological and higher value added sectors, by going into the scientific research, bio-engineering and pharceutical sectors, and encouraged many young Singaporeans to pursue these courses when some of these courses were not available in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s own talents who have returned from overseas – some from ‘Blue Ribbon’ universities, with degrees funded by family support – remained jobless in 2003 to 2005, and some for more then two years, while foreigners flood the employment market during the same period.</p>
              <p>Those MNCs that enjoyed tax-free status and government grants prefer to employ their own foreign talents, then to have Singapore’s own talent to be taught the high value added science and technologies of these new frontier businesses.</p>
              <p><em>“A recent review of our long-term land use and transportation plan concluded that we have enough land to cater to a population of 6.5 million, if we are creative and careful in using our limited land, if we plan for such growth now and if we invest in the necessary infrastructure.”</em></p>
              <p>After more then 45 years of propaganda from the Pro Alien Party, can Singaporeans now take it that the “recent review suddenly made available” to “our long-term land use and transportation plan” – has punctured the myopic arguments of Minister Mah’s long held position that “Singapore is land-locked” and “severe lack of space to continue expanding roadways and build more roads” ?</p>
              <p><em>“But plans are only as good as the paper they are written on – unless they can be made to happen. So long as we have a leadership that has the foresight to anticipate challenges, the determination and the political will to address them, and the ability to bring our people along to tackle these challenges together; and so long as we have a people that is willing to work hard, and work with one another, and with their leaders, we can together create a truly global city, which we can call home.”<br></em><br>Yes, “plans are only as good as the paper they are written on – unless they can be made to happen”.</p>
              <p>BEFORE plans are made to happen, there must have been vigorous due diligence applied to ensure that all issues are given consideration and parallel plans are also considered to be effected to ensure that such “PLANS MADE TO HAPPEN” will be implemented successfully without disrupting the social status quo.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Minister Mah’s claim that “So long as we have a leadership that has the foresight to anticipate challenges, the determination and the political will to address them….” – has also been proven wrong with the extreme shortage of public housing that led to a upward spiral of run-away pricing, which clearly indicate that the leadership from the Pro Alien Party DID NOT HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO ANTICIPATE CHALLENGES.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there was the LACK OF DETERMINATION and POLITICAL WILL TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS when the PLAN TO INCREASE THE POPULATION SIZE WAS PUT INTO ACTION. This was was seen in Minister Mah’s denial that there was a housing shortage, and his denial that a housing bubble was in the making with the upward spiral in the runaway price.</p>
              <p>Minister Mah’s lack of political will to address these challenges even went to the extreme when he will accuse young Singaporeans to be fussy when they were unable to get their first home after being in the waiting list for years.</p>
              <p>Clearly, this Government of the Pro Alien Party – with Minister Mah being a member of the Cabinet – DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY “to bring our people along to tackle these challenges together”.</p>
              <p>It is disingenuous to throw the ball back on Singaporeans by claiming that – “so long as we have a people that is willing to work hard, and work with one another, and with their leaders, we can together create a truly global city, which we can call home”.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been pushed to the limits working longer hours for less pay than the over paid Ministers, who spent less time per week at real work, and with half of their waking hours talking uselessly based on “gut feel” then from diligent research or data, and the other half of their waking hours at leisure in golf courses, or tennis courts, or at the pools.</p>
              <p>If Minister Mah thinks that he is running an Animal Farm, he had better remember the end story of those Pigs that slowly abandon their own “four legged values” – and began to learn and talk like those who “walk on two legs”.<br>*<br>The “Animal Farm” by George Orwell – <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZldlyeR8DU&amp;feature=fvw"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZldlyeR8DU&amp;feature=fvw</span></a></p>

              <div class="art-PostMetadataHeader">
              <div class="art-PostHeaderIcons art-metadata-icons">After living in a state of denial for the last few months, PAP National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan finally admits that immigrants do contribute to the rising housing demand, though they are “not solely to blame”.<br><br>Speaking in Parliament yesterday, Mr Mah said that “while the influx of new immigrants has been higher than usual, and has contributed to housing demand, it is only one of many demand-determining factors.”<br><br>Earliar in March this year, Mr Mah had said that PRs made up only one in five resale flat buyers and therefore they have “minimal” impact on resale flat prices.<br><br>Last month, Mr Mah claimed that the property market boomed “unexpectedly” in 2007, leading to sky-rocketing flat prices:<br><br><strong>“Unexpectedly in 2007, the property market boomed leading to HDB prices to climb which resulted in the BTO scheme adapted by HDB today to build flats according to housing needs,”</strong> <br><br>he was quoted as saying in Lianhe Zaobao.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>Back in 2007, Mr Mah indicated clearly that the PAP regime plans to grow Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people:<br><br><strong>“Ever since I first mentioned that we are planning for a population of 6.5 million people, many Singaporeans have reacted with concern, some with alarm, at the thought of more people living and working in Singapore…..Do we need a larger population? Most definitely. To grow and create more and better jobs, Singapore must remain open, competitive and relevant to the global market place,”</strong> Mr Mah wrote in the April issue of PETIR.<br><br>He also stated clearly that he has no doubts that we will have enough land to meet the needs of a 6.5 million population if we start planning now (back then in 2007):<br><br><strong>“A recent review of our long-term land use and transportation plan concluded that we have enough land to cater to a population of 6.5 million, if we are creative and careful in using our limited land, if we plan for such growth now and if we invest in the necessary infrastructure.”<br><br></strong>Unfortunately, Mr Mah did not build more HDB flats to meet the expected increase in population with the number of flats built between 2006 – 2008 being the lowest in the history of Singapore.<br><br>Only 3,183 flats were built in 2008 when Singapore accepted 20,000 new citizens and 90,000 PRs who were allowed to purchase resale flats in the open market by the PAP regime.<br><img title="hdbfy01" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/hdbfy01.jpg" alt="hdbfy01" width="550" height="287"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: HDB Financial Report 2008/2009]</strong></p>
              <p>As there are insufficient new flats being built to meet the demands of both Singaporeans and the new citizens, many have to purchase flats in the resale market, thereby jacking up prices in the process.</p>
              <p>Below is a graph illustrating how the rise in the prices of resale flats coincides with the rise in the number of foreigners in Singapore between the years 2000 and 2008, courtesy of Kojakbt, the moderator of 3in1kopitiam:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/prhdb585.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="350"></p>
              <p>While Mr Mah has admitted he had been “caught off-guard” by the astronomical prices of HDB flats, he is adamant that they are affordable to Singaporeans and chided home-buyers for being “fussy” and having “unrealistic” expectations.</p>
              <p>Though there is still a lack of public housing to meet the demands of Singaporeans, Mr Mah said it would have been ‘foolhardy’ to continue pushing out flats or land for housing at an increased rate when there was talk of the world entering a depression or a prolonged recession in the first half of last year.</p>
              <p><strong>“We take a long-term view, but we also need to be cognizant of the short term… We have to be very flexible and view our housing supply in a very pragmatic manner,”</strong> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Had Mr Mah taken a “long-term” view in 2007 and built more flats then instead of now, we would not be in such dire straits today.</p>

              <p>The point I want to highlight is the part about moving the economy up in terms of "value add" skills.  Recall a few years back, they were trying to get people to "upgrade" their skills so that they can achieve a higher salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you noticed that these days they have stopped talking about adding value and such anymore?</p>

              <p>It's now "cheaper, better, faster", a regression towards low paying, low level service jobs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You claimed to be bo tak chay, but I think you are wise enough with your post.  I share your concern and unlike some poster who claimed to be rich and highly educated but with a mine of a trash.</p>
              <p>Not about against any party but is against the facts</p>

              <p>very good thread but me bo tak chay... can only decipher half of
              wat is being written but i am sick of this gahment. very sick.</p>
              <p>The ball is with you young people . how u all going to start a
              family? how u going to able to even afford a basic flat? how your
              children or your children's children going to survive ??</p>
              <p>Not only the young has to compete with fellow sporeans , u all
              have to compete with outsiders . outsiders who do not belong here
              at all what with their alien sounding dialects, they come here and
              form their own clan and dun blend in with our surroundings.</p>
              <p>Spread the word to your folks esp the older ones who know
              nothing but only that particular logo.</p>
              <p>This round depends a lot on you the young generation to speak
              your minds. dun think , just do it.</p>
