(See Note 1 Below).<br><br>This time around, with the stupendous loss from the S$3 BILLION thrown into SHIN CORP, <strong>PLUS</strong> the unreported fine of US$1.99 BILLION in penalty - it is too obvious for Temasek to cover a large bleeding wound by absorbing some other cash-rich GLC that it does not presently control.<br><br>With a string of losses that began with Suzhou, surely the Singapore Reserves must be affected, and need new cash injection by the Singaporean Slaves ?<br><br>The string of well known disasters over the recent five years will include:<br><br>SingTel losses with the <a href="http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/02Pf/aus090202.html" rel="nofollow">Australian OPTUS venture</a> after taking it over for a sum of US$8.4 BILLION;<br><br><a href="http://singaporeelection.blogspot.com/2006/03/when-temasek-stumbles-singapore.html" rel="nofollow">DBS had to take a $700Million writedown</a> on its Hong Kong Dao Heng Bank bought for US$5.4 BILLION in 2001;<br><br>Temasek loss of $336 Million in 2004 and another $278 Million in 2005 in its investment in its 62% stake in Global Crossing, and the continued loss of S$1BILLION over 10 years from the semi-conductor operation at Chartered Industry;<br><br>Temasek's acquisition of the Bank of China for US$2.5 BILLION and the Korean Exchange Bank for US$9 BILLION have all been made without any accounting to any Singaporean Oversight Committee, and the performance of these investments remains questionable;<br><br>Can there be any other better reason to increase 2% to the current 5% GST ?<br><br>In all the 45 over years of independence, has this Ruling Party ever considered the down-trodden and provide free meals - except for the sharks fin soup to entice the voters, which is now abandoned ?<br><br>Even with the GST at 7%, the poor will still have to pay-back for the attention given; as this Government is well know to give with one hand and take back with two hands.<br><br>If the Government is serious about helping the poorer sections of Singapore, the amount that Temasek and all GLCs have lost in their overseas ventures would have fed the poorer Singaporeans over the next 100 YEARS.<br><br><a href="http://www.research.commarts.chula.ac.th/CD/fullpaper/11.1_Ukrist_Pathmanand.pdf" rel="nofollow">Note 1<br>Transnational Capital : a Political economy study on the Shin - Temasek Deal<br>- Institute of Asian Studies, Chulalongkorn University<br></a><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Our politicians want to act smart n become businessman,thats why they keep losing money in foreign investment.If they do know so much about investment n doing business,then why the hell do they still need to work as a politicians,might as well become a businessman.<br><br>Above all the losses that GLC incurred on foreign investment,there is also Goh Chok Tong lent billions of dollars to Indonesia government during the economic crisis.And the Indonesian government havent pay back us the money yet.<br><br>P.S.I know Lou Goh dont like ppl to talk about it,but........Who give a damn about that dog!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

All the pretences and hypocrisy about the virtue of Asian societies due to practice of Asian or Family values were merely shams cooked up to assume leaders' legitimacy or outward success.<br><br>Again no matter how talented is an individual, he was put to the test during the recent last two recession when they were seen to be denying problems and responsibilities for unemployments or loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>So history has proven that at the end it will be self-centredness which eventually cause downfalls of empires.<br><br>Now the same helpless people who could not solve problems suddenly try to ride on a wave of world recovery and claim credit for every thing and try to squeeze more taxes for self-centredness and hypocrisy. There is no sign that surpluses or taxes if collected will be put to good use but everything is up to them like the estate upgrading decisions. Judging from past experiences of surpluses being splashed on Souzhou or seven wonders how to trust leaders that increased GST this time will really go towards helping the people to tie over people in crisis.<br><br>If the leaders do not keep increasing rentals through creative accounting next year citizens will be more than grateful already. So forget about more promises like helping the people to overcome problems.<br><br>Citizens will be wise in expecting more fee increases and salary increases for ministers after this round of GST increases. Look at their promises, and the way various schemes are actually implemented one has practically be obliged to vote the MPs before one can get any assistance. Otherwise Mr. Tan would not have jumped the MRT track on being told that "sorry your family income exceeds the limit so we could not help you".<br><br>Many people jumped the MRT tracks not because of the lack of efforts or choosiness about jobs but because of uncaring government who keeps taxing and recovering all costs against them until they have to jump.<br><br>Today, bus fares and utilities in a lower income family can take up 40-60% of the take home pay. How can the leaders keep one eye closed on such fee increases which only resulted in more million-dollar pays and 6-month bonuses and share options to directors of public transport companies who are actually doing nothing much except in sitting pretty to collect fees.<br><br>By all these real-life experienes all can see that leaders cannot be trusted to be free from corruption and self-centredness. They should be checked by a more objective and powerful Ombudsman and be continuously subjected to accountability or due process.<br><br>After 41 years, sad to say one thing is proven - leadership and talent is a make-belief concept or theory. Singapore today has witnessed leadership as consisting of only showmanship, hypocrisy, greed and self-interest.<br></div></blockquote>clos their "gaps" perhaps? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
