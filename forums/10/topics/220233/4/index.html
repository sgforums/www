In simple term progressive tax increases proportionally to income, e.g income tax, the ppl will be able to feel the pinch. Regressive tax is the opposite, the pinch cant be felt, the proportion to income is small, e.g GST.<br><br>The reason for an increase in GST instead of normal income tax is due to it being significantly lesser. If u dont wish to pay just dont consume the goods or reduce yr consumption. A increase in GST will garner less objection as ppl do not directly feel it. An increase in GST will only result in a few cent increase in necessity while a percentage increase in income tax can mean a few hundred dollars.<br><br>The usefullness in GST helping to reduce income gap is questionable. Most books recognise that using indirect taxes to reduce the gap is insignificant. It is widely recognise that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of the rich is much lower than the poor. Which means the rich save much more than they consume. The poor is the opposite. Poor spends bulk of their income. There are only a few rich ppl in a country no matter how much they spend it will not exceed that of commoners. Looking at such scenario GST is mainly taxing the commoners. Income of the rich is not much affected.<br><br>However whether the income gap widen or not depends on how the government uses the revenue collected. Many charity organisation exists in Singapore however their details are hard to obtain also they follows a strict guideline. If the charity is link to the government, it follows its guideline delligently. When yr income is above their level they will not help you. This result in many famlilies considered as the relative deprive or overburden being negelected. These families seriously need help too. PM asserts that the increase in GST is to build a safety net.

After all none of them are honest enough to settle for less than a million dollars a year plus lifetime pension etc. They'll probably mobilise their Gurkhas and empty everything from the state coffers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
