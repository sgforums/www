Plus the PM mentioned measures to offset this GST increase for the poor. The exact implementation will be explained soon.<br><br>To me, it's not a matter of whether I trust the government to use this to help the poor. I wanna see the exact full implementation and then I'll analyse and decide whether the plan sucks or not. Shouting "Guilty!" relying purely on gut instinct, emotional feelings such as trust, without examining the full facts of the case is lame.</div></blockquote>Given the way the gov has acted in the past, l predict the following implementation:<br><br>1) First, they tell you the increase is 2%. They expect everyone to make noise and feel unhappy for some time.<br><br>2) After sometime when the initial unhappiness dies down a little, they'll increase to 6% first and announce packages to help the poor cope to soften the impact of the news. Most people would not have any more objections by then.<br><br>3) Next, they'll increase from 6% to 7% after some time when people have got themselves used to the increase GST. This way there will not be so much hooha.<br><br>By the time the next election approaches, they'll collect enough dough to throw out some goodies to sweeten the ground.<br><br>There's only 1 way that the GST is going and that's up, up up!<br><br>Please remember this terrible experience when the time comes again to cast your votes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Close the gap between rich n poor by increase GST?Hoho,this is the most ridiculous bullsh!t i have heard.If a politician want to close gap between rich n poor,they should tax more heavily on the rich,not increase GST.<br><br>Becoz GST apply on all the goods n services that you pay for,no matter whether u are rich or poor,you still need to buy nesscessity items in your daily life.Thus,increase GST has totally no affect on the rich,but the poor will have to pay even more for it.So the gap between rich n poor will even widened,not closer.<br><br>There are 2 reasons why those PAP leaders say increase GST can close gap,one is they are liar,another reason is they are still a liar.They will leave a very bad name even after they die,if that is what they want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
