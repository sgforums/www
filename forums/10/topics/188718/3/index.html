I say flats cannot be built with that kind of price because basic things like steel and cement cost is high. So same as you say, cannot be done. Edmund talking as if no need to pay money one.<br><br>I also agree with you that without HDB, many of us got no good place to stay. When I was young, I stayed in rented room, my family first flat was a one-and-half room, not sure now still have or not. Only after many years we finally got a four room flat. Still remember that chinese new year, celebrate until siao. Really thankful to government. Nowadays new generation never sleep on the floor, wake up see rat staring at you one, cannot understand the feeling of having own roof.<br><br>People think land belongs to them and build flat takes less time than cook magie mee. No need go too far, just go nearby countries, see how flats are built. No infra structure, like roads, market, public transport, toilet system. Generation of instant gratification cannot wait. Think like SIM CITY, pit pit plat plat. Not so simple. Lots of visualisation, planning and co-ordination. Where got all raw material arrive on time one, project management is sometime crisis management every other day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I suppose the build quality of private house is more demanding but the cost of material is the same, and each HBD flat will require toilet, bomb shelter and water pipes, consequently making it more costly.<br><br>Note this is only construction cost, have not included water &amp; electricity testing and connection, cable TV, telephone, clerk of work, architect, clerk of work and other cost. So another 10-15K per unit, I suppose, is reasonable?<br><br>Also, there are amenities around, like roads, bus stop, schools, lamp posts, sports facilities, which will add to the cost of building a small town.<br><br>Not sure if this calculation is fair.

The per square foot cost for HDB has been well known. All it takes is for such costs to be provided by Minister Mah to Edmund Ng and the whole argument or controversy surrounding the issue whether HDB is over-charging for its HDB flat prices would be resolved. There is no need to practise witholding of information and at the end when people speculated on any issue of costs like in the disputes over the medical costs that there would be law suits or commission of inquiries which could all be avoided.<br><br>Many problems we encounter today could be solved without such witholding of information - it is just a matter of following First-world practices of providing information for accountability and transparency to citizens period.<br><br>If NKF released information in the beginning about ratio of donation to patient subsidy throughout the whole period the whistle blowers were being sued there would have been proper and accountable good corporate governance and the whole NKF would not have happened at all.<br><br>So HDB should practise good corporate governance so that this matter need not become an election issue at all? Is Minister Mah going to practise first-world management practice for HDB to release cost information then?</div>
