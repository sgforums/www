He's got absolutely no clue what is going on. He just makes this allegation, just shooting from the hip. I've asked HDB not to entertain him."<br><br>He says HDB flats are heavily subsidised and that its prices are based on market value.<br><br>Mr Mah says: "The market value of the flat includes construction cost, land cost, infrastructure cost, providing lifts on every floor, and it varies from place to place."<br><br>So what is Mr Ng's next move?<br><br>Mr Ng "We have better things to do. We are currently very busy with the unemployment job portal. We don't run the HDB. It's up to them to disclose. It's up to them to be transparent."<br><br>As for the SDA employment website, Mr Ng says it has so far received 50 applications from Tampines residents since it was launched on Labour Day.<br><br>Mr Ng says it will kick start phase two of its employment initiative by linking up with companies situated in Tampines, Changi, Bedok and Loyang to help residents find jobs nearer to their homes. - CNA/de<br><br></div></blockquote>remember that the sore losers will make things difficult 4 u so by increasing cost and infalting land price<br><br>i really wonder how they can be goverment 4 50+ years  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
