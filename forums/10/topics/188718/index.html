            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore Democratic Alliance's candidate for Tampines GRC, Edmund Ng says he is taking up the challenge by National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan to build HDB flats at lower cost.<br><br>Mr Ng says he has written to the Housing and Development Board requesting for costing information.<br><br>But Mr Mah, who is leading the PAP team in Tampines GRC, says the SDA candidate is just 'fishing' for figures and he has asked the HDB not to entertain him.<br><br>At a recent rally, Mr Ng had said it costs just $70,000 to $80,000 to build an HDB flat priced at $250,000.<br><br>In response, Mr Mah issued him a challenge, asking the HDB to subcontract building projects to Mr Ng.<br><br>When asked about Mr Ng's letter to HDB asking for cost details, Mr Mah says the onus is on the SDA candidate to back up his estimates.<br><br>Mr Mah says: "He is fishing for figures. He's got absolutely no clue what is going on. He just makes this allegation, just shooting from the hip. I've asked HDB not to entertain him."<br><br>He says HDB flats are heavily subsidised and that its prices are based on market value.<br><br>Mr Mah says: "The market value of the flat includes construction cost, land cost, infrastructure cost, providing lifts on every floor, and it varies from place to place."<br><br>So what is Mr Ng's next move?<br><br>Mr Ng "We have better things to do. We are currently very busy with the unemployment job portal. We don't run the HDB. It's up to them to disclose. It's up to them to be transparent."<br><br>As for the SDA employment website, Mr Ng says it has so far received 50 applications from Tampines residents since it was launched on Labour Day.<br><br>Mr Ng says it will kick start phase two of its employment initiative by linking up with companies situated in Tampines, Changi, Bedok and Loyang to help residents find jobs nearer to their homes. - CNA/de<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HDB is not a private developer in the first place so when Minister Mah said that HDB is selling the HDB flat as private developer at market value including land, construction and all other costs, it is already a shock to citizens.<br><br>Citizens can ask him a question: was the HDB wrong in its pricing formula in selling the first batch of HDB flats built in the early 1970s in Toa Payon or Bendemeer.<br><br>If HDB had made a mistake in charging the earlier buyers the wrong price or under-valued price, should he not try to recover the losses from those earlier buyers.<br><br>Minister Mah and the new MP who was previously CEO of HDB could verify honestly whether the above-stated HDB selling prices for Toa Payoh e.g. Block 33 Lorong 6 Toa Payon were sold at market prices?<br><br>He could with the help of Mr. Lui verify whether HDB relied on the Land Acquisition Act to acquire land cheaply below market price and when HDB compulsorily acquire those land, what did HDB tell the private land owners whose land were taken away about the purpose of the lands being acquired - was it to build HDB flats.<br><br>What did Housing and Development Act say was the role of HDB? Did it not say that HDB was constituted as a statutory board to provide low-cost housing or "Homeownership" flat for the people?<br><br>So if HDB uses the Land Acquisition Act to acquire lands with compulsory powers should not HDB use the acquired land provide low-cost housing. Should not HDB then charge the HDB flat at total development costs minus the land costs since such lands were acquired using the public funds belonging to the citizens.<br><br>Furthermore, once a piece of land was acquired compulsorily using the power under the Land Acquisition Act, is it legal for the HDB not to build the flat on it using the original acquisition land costs but instead hand over to the State Land Office and let the State Land Office sell it back to HDB at market price or near market price so as to entitle HDB to sell the flat at market price.<br><br>Then what happened to the acquired land which was supposed to be acquired using the compulsory power for citizens' low cost housing and paid for using the citizens' monies. So isn't it double-charging the citizens when HDB charged citizens the land cost again a second time when selling the flat at market value.</div>
