              <p>You call it a propaganda but yet you have failed to touch on the most expensive part of living, which is related to housing.</p>
              <p>Australians household saving rate, like UK and USA, are currently at record low while debt/income ratio are at record high. What this means is that most household are <strong>heavily</strong> in debt due to mortgage.</p>
              <p>Hence when you combine that with a 9.25% pa mortgage rate, you will see that whatever extra an Australian earn as compared to Singaporeans, actually goes back to the banks to pay off interest.</p>

              <p>I believe the debt to income ratio and interest rate is a more important factors to look at instead of the absolute property value when we want to assess the impact of mortgage crisis on home owners.</p>
              <p>Relative to Australia, Singapore property price might look more expensive, however when you factor in other housing related cost like mortgage interest and cost of maintaince, the overall picture might look very different.</p>
              <p>E.g. Assuming John Mosley bought a property in Australia for AUD300,000 and took up a 250,000 loan @ 9% over 30 years. By the end of 30 years, he would have already paid AUD474,000 of interest or AUD774,000 for his property.</p>
              <p>Over in Singapore KK Wong bought a property in Singapore for S$500,000 and took up a S$450,000 loan @ 3% over 30 years. By the end of 30 years, he would have paid S$233,000 of interest or S$733,000 for his property.</p>
              <p>From the few charts which I have posted, it should be quite accurate to say that the younger generation home owners in Australia are spreading themselves too thin and heavily in debt as compared to previous generation or even Singaporeans due to our CPF system. Hence in time of mortgage crisis, slowing economy and high interest rate, I think it shouldnt be wrong to say that most Australia home owners are in worst position to handle this crisis as compare to Singapore home owners.</p>
              <p>As far as wages goes, when you consider their after taxed salary, there is really not much to shout about. Some might argue that tax will provide free health care etc. but it is a known fact that most working class are buying the own health insurance and seek medical treatment from private hospital.</p>

              <p>The monthly fare for non citizens and PR for zone 2  (  is $70 and that relates to $2.25 per day, which u can use to take train and bus and trams - to and fro . Think about it a bus ride and swtich to a train - one in th emorning and return home in the evening costing just $2.25..Its not bad at all..and if u are a citizen or PR, its only around $40, i think</p>
              <p>but for zone 1 is significantly higher. Besides most people have cars and they somehow will only buy tickets for only one zone.</p>

              <p>I believe the debt to income ratio and interest rate is a more important factors to look at instead of the absolute property value when we want to assess the impact of mortgage crisis on home owners.</p>
              <p>Relative to Australia, Singapore property price might look more expensive, however when you factor in other housing related cost like mortgage interest and cost of maintaince, the overall picture might look very different.</p>
              <p>E.g. Assuming John Mosley bought a property in Australia for AUD300,000 and took up a 250,000 loan @ 9% over 30 years. By the end of 30 years, he would have already paid AUD474,000 of interest or AUD774,000 for his property.</p>
              <p>Over in Singapore KK Wong bought a property in Singapore for S$500,000 and took up a S$450,000 loan @ 3% over 30 years. By the end of 30 years, he would have paid S$233,000 of interest or S$733,000 for his property.</p>
              <p>From the few charts which I have posted, it should be quite accurate to say that the younger generation home owners in Australia are spreading themselves too thin and heavily in debt as compared to previous generation or even Singaporeans due to our CPF system. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence in time of mortgage crisis, slowing economy and high interest rate, I think it shouldnt be wrong to say that most Australia home owners are in worst position to handle this crisis as compare to Singapore home owners.</span></p>
              <p>As far as wages goes, when you consider their after taxed salary, there is really not much to shout about. Some might argue that tax will provide free health care etc. but it is a known fact that most working class are buying the own health insurance and seek medical treatment from private hospital.</p>

              <p>again , short sighted people like u irritate me...that home in Aus belongs to u forever and after u it goes to your children who may be still paying for it...Besides when u are too old to pay, u get old age pension to pay for that too....</p>

              <p>Not forgetting that Australia's GST (VAT) is discriminatory, they exempt certain basic necessities like food, medication and textbooks.</p>
              <p>Whereas Singapore adopts a non-discriminatory stance, tax everything and anything. So that they can help the poor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The lame reasoning being, it's difficult to implement a discriminatory GST. Other countries like the UK and Australia have been doing it eons ago, they don't find it difficult, but Singapore finds it difficult. We must lag some administrative efficiency.</p>
              <p>Another lame reasoning, the rich also eats rice, by excluding it would mean the rich escape being tax. But the cost to the rich is pittance, whereas the cost to the poor is grave. e.g. Rich making $50,000 per month, a 5kg bag of rice $13.00 and a GST of $0.91. The GST of $0.91 only represents 0.001% of the rich folk's income. Whereas to a person making $1,500, this would represent 0.061% of a poor person's income or 61 times that of a rich man's income.</p>
              <p>Another lame reasoning behind implementing GST for basic necessities like food, these basic food products are used by restaurants which rich folks go to. The GST payable by a restaurant is the difference between it's input tax (what he incurred during purchase) and output tax (what he charges to his customers).</p>
              <p>Therefore, for a restaurant buying their raw ingredients at $100, incurs a GST of $7 (input tax). The restaurant sells their final food product at $1,000, the GST charged to customer is $70 (output tax). The net amount payable to IRAS would be $63 ($70 - $7). Not forgetting that the initial amount of GST $7 was charged by another supplier to this restaurant, so it is effectively in the pockets of the IRAS. The total GST tax pocketed by IRAS is $70.</p>
              <p>If basic food commodities was exempted GST, therefore the raw ingredients purchased by the restaurant would be $100 (no GST, no input tax). The final product that the restaurant charges is $1,000, so the GST charged to customer is $70. Since there was no input tax, then no deductions of input tax was made and the final GST of $70 is paid to IRAS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether IRAS charges GST for basic necessities or otherwise, the net effect to IRAS would still be the same, in both circumstances $70 of GST is collected by IRAS.</p>
              <p>By not charging GST for basic foodstuff sold in supermarkets would mean, that the poor would be better off by not having to another 7%, thereby stretching the value of their dollar.</p>
              <p>But their premise is, <strong>GST is to help the poor</strong>, to what effect is left to the thinking abilities of the audience.</p>

              <p>I believe the debt to income ratio and interest rate is a more important factors to look at instead of the absolute property value when we want to assess the impact of mortgage crisis on home owners.</p>
              <p>Relative to Australia, Singapore property price might look more expensive, however when you factor in other housing related cost like mortgage interest and cost of maintaince, the overall picture might look very different.</p>
              <p>E.g. Assuming John Mosley bought a property in Australia for AUD300,000 and took up a 250,000 loan @ 9% over 30 years. By the end of 30 years, he would have already paid AUD474,000 of interest or AUD774,000 for his property.</p>
              <p>Over in Singapore KK Wong bought a property in Singapore for S$500,000 and took up a S$450,000 loan @ 3% over 30 years. By the end of 30 years, he would have paid S$233,000 of interest or S$733,000 for his property.</p>
              <p>From the few charts which I have posted, it should be quite accurate to say that the younger generation home owners in Australia are spreading themselves too thin and heavily in debt as compared to previous generation or even Singaporeans due to our CPF system. Hence in time of mortgage crisis, slowing economy and high interest rate, I think it shouldnt be wrong to say that most Australia home owners are in worst position to handle this crisis as compare to Singapore home owners.</p>
              <p>As far as wages goes, when you consider their after taxed salary, there is really not much to shout about. Some might argue that tax will provide free health care etc. but it is a known fact that most working class are buying the own health insurance and seek medical treatment from private hospital.</p>
