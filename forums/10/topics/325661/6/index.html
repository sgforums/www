              <p>You call it a propaganda but yet you have failed to touch on the most expensive part of living, which is related to housing.</p>
              <p>Australians household saving rate, like UK and USA, are currently at record low while debt/income ratio are at record high. What this means is that most household are <strong>heavily</strong> in debt due to mortgage.</p>
              <p>Hence when you combine that with a 9.25% pa mortgage rate, you will see that whatever extra an Australian earn as compared to Singaporeans, actually goes back to the banks to pay off interest.</p>

Aussies don't have that in their culture.

              <p><br>Oh and to add to that..... if the govt fails to provide those welfare they feel "cheated" and vote the govt out <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png">. Hence why some peeps feel that Aussies are lazy. They on the other hand feel that since they pay taxes when they are working the govt has a duty of care to provide for them when they are old.</p>

              <p>Another interesting post and lion is stating a fact and I agree with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However bro there are reasons why its like that. Read my post above about the welfare system in Australia and you'll understand why it has deficits. The federal govt is working on a tightrope you see. It has to reduce deficits BUT if he cuts into welfare then the people get angry and vote them out lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But its still a lucky country cause of natural resources ... an eg. is uranium which I think is sold to China. And the mining Industry in Australia..... talking about that did you know that working as a miner in Australia netts you $100k AUD a year? I myself was shocked lol and you don't need a 3-5 year degree for that too. But i guess its dangerous work.</p>

              <p>read CIA above then u know.</p>
              <p>It is <span style="color: #ff0000;">108 % and 90 % o</span>f GDP at PPP and GDP at official exchange rate respectively.</p>
              <p>This is on par and worse than with few hard hit countries before the crisis:</p>

              <p>Another interesting post and lion is stating a fact and I agree with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However bro there are reasons why its like that. Read my post above about the welfare system in Australia and you'll understand why it has deficits. The federal govt is working on a tightrope you see. It has to reduce deficits BUT if he cuts into welfare then the people get angry and vote them out lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But its still a lucky country cause of natural resources ... an eg. is uranium which I think is sold to China. And the mining Industry in Australia..... talking about that did you know that working as a miner in Australia netts you $100k AUD a year? I myself was shocked lol and you don't need a 3-5 year degree for that too. But i guess its dangerous work.</p>

              <p>1) Despite the high debt level of Australia, their currency is still higher than Singapore. If Australia is like what you made it out to be, wouldn't the exchange rate tend to Indonesia or Malaysia?</p>
              <p>2) Australian's workers make more per hour compared to Singaporeans. They have higher spending power compared to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>3) As a result of a miner's job scope, they exposed themselves to risk of death / disability everyday. Therefore they are paid for the risk they take, the higher the level of risk, the higher paid they are. There is nothing to be shocked about, the shock is a result of your level of understanding.</p>

The trade-weighted exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate within an undisclosed policy band, rather than kept to a fixed value. The band provides flexibility for the system to accommodate short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets as well as some buffer in the estimation of the country's equilibrium exchange rate, which cannot be known precisely. MAS' intervention operations generally 'lean against the wind'. <strong>If the exchange rate moves outside the band, </strong><strong>MAS will usually step in, either buying or selling foreign exchange so as to steer </strong><strong>the exchange rate back within the band.</strong></p>

              <p><br>1) Let's face it, if Australia has a crisis, so does Singapore. Singapore's Foreign Direct Investments in Australia end 2003 was AUD 22.1 billion. If Singapore saw investment opportunities in Australia, why don't you. Have you change your stance by supporting CSJ and oppose P4P?</p>

              <p>However bro there are reasons why its like that. Read my post above about the welfare system in Australia and you'll understand why it has deficits. The federal govt is working on a tightrope you see. It has to reduce deficits BUT if he cuts into welfare then the people get angry and vote them out lol.</p>

              <p>But its still a lucky country cause of natural resources ... an eg. is uranium which I think is sold to China. And the mining Industry in Australia..... talking about that did you know that working as a miner in Australia netts you $100k AUD a year? I myself was shocked lol and you don't need a 3-5 year degree for that too. But i guess its dangerous work.</p>

              <p>One of the very few posts here that look at facts and know what is fact and call it fact. </p>
              <p>Australia is a big continent and Singapore is a small island. Australia has plenty of minerals and they only need to dig and sell. Can't really compare the economy of Australia with that of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The continent can still accommodate probable another 50 million people there so those who don't feel comfortable in Singapore should just move there.</p>
              <p>Singapore as a small island can only accommodate and feed that many of people, let those who want to stay, stay.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>THE total freeze in the securitised home loan market and the
                  consequent dangers to ordinary Australian home loan borrowers have been
                  recognised in an unusual Reserve Bank action to buy mortgagebacked
                  securities.</p>
              <p>On Friday the Reserve Bank bought <span style="color: #ff0000;">$320 million in mortgage-backed
                  securities,</span> providing much-needed liquidity to a bank or non-bank
                  lender that had packaged a series of home loans for on-selling.</p>
              <p>But in the current market, afflicted by the credit crisis, no
                  mortgage-backed securities have been sold this year after investor
                  confidence in these products dropped dramatically -<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> packaged home loans
                  worth $45 billion were sold in the first half of last year and in the
                  second half the figure was just $6 billion.</span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p>The packaging of home loans into securitised vehicles until now has
                  provided a valuable additional source of home loan financing to bank
                  and non-bank lenders alike.</p>
              <p>It moves the loan from an institution's balance sheet, giving it
                  extra liquidity for other loans or allowing it to meet its regulatory
                  capital requirements. The result for home loan borrowers is that more
                  loans have been available, meaning more competition and cheaper home
                  loans.</p>
              <p>Non-bank lenders have been leaving the market rapidly, with
                  Macquarie Group among those to cut back or exit altogether, because of
                  the difficulty of gaining the necessary financing for mortgages at a
                  favourable rate.</p>
              <p>The Reserve Bank action is seen as an acknowledgement of the
                  difficulties banks are facing in their ability to on-sell
                  mortgage-backed securities.</p>
              <p>But the terms of the Reserve Bank purchases are less than a year and
                  the money has been provided only on the basis that the securities are
                  repurchased by the original institution.</p>
              <p>"The positive thing is … it solves the short-term liquidity issue
                  which is obviously very pressing," says Greg Medcraft, the chief
                  executive of the industry lobby group, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Australian Securitisation Forum.</span></p>
              <p>"What it doesn't do is solve the long-term liquidity issue."</p>
              <p>Only last September and October, the Reserve Bank included
                  mortgage-backed securities among the securities it would buy from banks
                  and accredited non-bank lenders. Friday's purchase was one of the few
                  sizeable transactions to date.</p>
              <p>Mr Medcraft said this facility was not well known among most
                  lenders. Previously, he said, most banks and other lenders had not
                  attempted to use it.</p>
              <p>This was partly because of the stigma of being seen to need Reserve
                  Bank help to restore liquidity, a move that could be portrayed
                  negatively and frighten investors.</p>

              </strong><p></p>
              <p class="intro"><strong>THE residential property boom in Singapore has been characterised by a peculiarly Singaporean phenomenon known as en bloc or collective sales.</strong></p>
              <p>Last year, 109 such deals were done, totalling $S13.3 billion ($10.5 billion).</p>
              <p>An en bloc or collective sale occurs when owners in an apartment block agree to sell the entire block for redevelopment.</p>
              <p>In its wake, Singapore's en bloc fever has produced instant multi-millionaires, but has also spawned legal challenges and untold bitterness among minority owners forced to sell.</p>
              <p>A High Court hearing due next week will be closely watched - and could unravel the many pending en bloc sales.</p>
              <p>At least 10,000 apartments will be demolished for new developments, leading to even more expensive apartments, over the next two years or longer.</p>
              <p>Renters, particularly expatriates, are the pawns in the high-stakes game as their favourite suburbs, districts 9, 10 and 11, are where most of the en bloc sales are taking place.</p>
              <p>They face rising rents and uncertainty of tenure.</p>
              <p>An Australian who works with an investment bank in Singapore, said: "We knew in May that we would have to move out of our flat because it has been sold in a collective sale.</p>
              <p>"We have another year to go before the end of our lease. Then to add insult to injury, our landlord doubled our rent for the remaining months of our lease."</p>
              <p>Stories like this are common among expatriates, most of whom rent. It is not unusual for rentals to rise 150 per cent.</p>
              <p>Placed in an equally unpalatable predicament are owners who have been forced to accept the collective sale of their building, only to find that the market has streaked ahead.</p>
              <p>The settlement for their apartment will not be sufficient to buy into a comparable new flat in their own suburb, and they often have to downgrade to smaller accommodation.</p>
              <p>Collective sales take up to a year to settle. In the meantime, property prices continue to rise, creating a widening gap between the apartment sale price and the cost of a new one.</p>
              <p>Singapore's strata title laws allow an en bloc sale if 80 per cent of the owners agree to it.</p>
              <p>The remaining 20 per cent must accept the deal.</p>
              <p>CB Richard Ellis investment sales executive director Jeremy Lake said opposition by minority owners increased sharply in the second half of last year. The main reason was the substantial increase in land values since deals were concluded in the first half of 2007.</p>
              <p>Objectors take complaints to the Strata Titles Board, which had 68 objections for 60 collective sales applications in 2006.</p>
              <p>Last year, complaints to the board increased dramatically.</p>
              <p>In the past six months, the board had rejected "two or three" sales on technical grounds or for "lack of good faith", Mr Lake said.</p>
              <p>Owners have started to challenge the board's decisions.</p>
              <p>Next week minority owners in the controversial Horizon Tower en bloc sale expect Singapore's High Court to begin hearing their appeal against a decision in December by the board to approve the en bloc sale.</p>
              <p>These unhappy owners say the board erred in law by approving the sale and ordering minority owners to be bound by a sale and purchase agreement signed by the majority owners.</p>
              <p>They also say the then sales committee failed to do its duty to obtain the best price.</p>
              <p>Most of the owners agreed to sell the apartment block for $500million to a consortium led by Hotel Properties Ltd, which includes US investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
              <p>The buyers have threatened to sue the owners for $1 billion if they default on the sale.</p>
              <p>Credo Real Estate achieved the highest price for an en bloc sale, of $S1.33 billion or an average of $S2.1 million for each the 618 owners in an apartment block in Farrer Road.</p>
              <p>Credo executive director Tan Hong Boon said owners got a higher price for selling collectively to a developer.</p>
              <p>The block was sold to a CapitaLand consortium that included US-based Wachovia Bank, which plans to build 1500 units on the site.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said the break-even price for the new units was at least $S1.8 million. To make a reasonable profit the price would have to be between $2.2 and $2.8 million each.</p>
              <p>The en bloc phenomenon began in the 1994 property boom.</p>
              <p>In 1993, the Government published a master plan for development in Singapore, which outlined zoning and plot ratios for suburbs, Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p>"Property consultants saw the potential for redevelopment with higher density in areas where land was underused."</p>
              <p>The en bloc momentum would slow only if there is an economic down turn, Mr Lake said. The first en bloc cycle ended in 1997 with the Asian financial crisis.</p>
              <p>Collective sales picked up again in 1999 but petered out in 2001 when the dotcom bust put a dampener on residential sales.</p>
              <p>The current cycle began in 2006, setting records for en bloc sales, turning owners of once-humble apartments into multimillionaires. Since the second half of last year, with the unfolding of the US sub-prime crisis, price rises had eased and it would take longer to get transactions off the ground, Mr Lake said.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Housing Woes in Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>Over the last six months since the proposal, we’ve managed to obtain most of the wedding services we need like venue, wedding boutique, photographers and even secured the help of a well respected (and our favourite!) surgical professor to solemnize our matrimonial vows. Everything has been pleasantly smooth sailing but one stand-out problem remains unsettled and that is the most basic issue of housing.</p>
              <p>Property in $ingapore as we all know is broadly divided to cheaper public <a title="HDB" href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/"><span style="color: #52759a;">Housing Development Board (HDB)</span></a> flat apartments and expensive private properties in the form of condominums and landed housing. In the typical scenerio, private property is financially beyond reach of a young couple starting out (sans generous parents &amp; blank chequebooks), so the singular choice is only public housing. Now while our <a title="UN Public Service Award" href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10221p.nsf/Attachment/UN_Public_Service_Award_2008/%24file/SpeechByMinister.html"><span style="color: #52759a;">award-winning </span></a>public housing policy has managed to allow most $ingaporeans to at least own their own roof, it is a flawed system that is an omnipotent ulcer in every young salaried $ingaporean couple.</p>
              <p>There are two methods of obtaining a HDB flat - either a new flat from the HDB or 2nd hand resale from a previous owner. Paradoxically an old resale flat is more expensive than a new flat due to the standing policy to match resale market prices to private sector sales. On top of that, older flats are usually found in established mature towns and resulting high demand, thus causing the prices to shoot up to unrealistic values. Though there is a policy to subsidize new couples buying expensive resale flats, the subsidy comes with many stipulations and is usually insufficient to offset the high prices demanded from the previous owner.</p>
              <p>The more favourable path is to buy a new flat that is not only brand new but also cost efficient. The catch is that purchasing a new flat requires you to toss your name in a hat to ballot with the rest of the country and the odds of success is usually 1 in 5 (we’ve personnally tried more than 5 attempts over the past 1 year and the trend is recurrent disappointment). New flats also take about 3-5 years to build which means unless you start looking for a flat once you start dating, chances are you’ll be standing right in my homeless shoes now. There is another option of <a title="Boon Keng" href="http://www.hoihup.com/"><span style="color: #52759a;">privately</span></a>-<a title="Park Central" href="http://www.parkcentral.com.sg/"><span style="color: #52759a;">build</span></a> public flats which take an accelerated 2 years to finish building but again, they seem priced for profit of the construction companies rather than policy of cheap housing for the citizens.</p>
              <p>What this all means is that our options are: 1. Take up a high loan to buy a ready resale flat. 2. Take up a high loan to buy a private-contract flat 3. Keep waiting for a new cheap flat and bunk in with your parents in the meantime, inviting ridicule and over-crowding tensions of the family. 4. Keep waiting for a new flat and pay exorbitant rentals in another place temporarily 5. Don’t get married at all. Okay the last point is pretty irreverent.</p>
              <p>We are currently still exploring our options between a point 1 to point 4. Even though there is still more than year before our actual wedding, this problem is like a invisible mini-bomb constantly ticking at the back of our minds. Some days, <em>just some days</em>, you wish you had richer parents.</p>
