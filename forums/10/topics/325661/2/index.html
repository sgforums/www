              <p>someone mentioned the centrelink payments (social security) , u can easily pay off your home payments with it as u get at least $500 for AusStudy for 2 weeks. I think its also adjusted for inflation as well.</p>
              <p>One o fmy neighbours, a young guy studying in a AUS Uni gets $1000 for a month and he pays $440 for rent and he still has $560 left. He pays a $1000 per semester for fees for the Uni course. Upoun graduation if he cant find a job, he approaches the govt for help for job placement Compare this with singapore tertiary students who still depend on parents or loan to fianance their studies and still need to pay $5000 + every semester, and no guarantee of a job after graduation. Further more, they cant get into Uni easily in the first place. So many factors working against them already.</p>
              <p>And that aus guy has the option for working for cash in jobs as well which means he takes centrelink payments and earns an income himself without official records.</p>
              <p>Btw Australia has been giving pur social security for over two decades already. Did that make them bankrupt?</p>

              <p>1) Australians don't make the kind of salaries Singaporeans make, they make 3 to 4 times that Singaporeans. So, don't use Singapore pay to live in Australia, it's foolish. Likewise when we visit countries like US, Japan, Europe, etc; Why do we feel that everything is expensive there, whereas citizens living there feel it's priced affordably. They get more salary than you.</p>
              <p>2) There is some credibility issues with the author saying that rice and bread is double that of Singapore. In a free market economy (with no customs, taxes &amp; restrictions), the price of a commodity must only have one price, else arbitrage opportunities exisit to bring the price to a common price.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Take the 10 kg Housebrand Jasmine Rice in Australia's Woolworth, it's priced at AUD18.34 (SGD23.84 @ AUD1 = SGD1.3), it's around SGD11.92 for a 5kg bag of rice. The price of First Choice 5kg Thai Rice is going for SGD13.20 at Cold Storage.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But take meat and milk for example, meat &amp; milk is a whole lot cheaper than in Singapore. Australia has cattle farming, whereas Singapore has none, with the inclusion of shipping cost, the milk in Singapore has to be more expensive than Australia.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pura Whole Milk in Woolsworth sells for AUD2.15 per litre (SGD2.80 @ AUD1 = SGD1.3), whereas Pura Whole Milk in Cold Storage sells for SGD3.40.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Australian Beef Shin Steak in Woolsworth cost AUD4.08 per 400gm (SGD13.26 per kilogram @ AUD1 = SGD1.3), whereas in Cold Storage Australian Shin Beef cost SGD33.10 per kilogram.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I question the credibility of the author and the intelligence of the TS in posting such a thread with no understanding of the principles of "Law of One Price". TS should exercise the use of his brains once in a while. If I produce beef in my house, will the cost to you (if you live in Jurong and me in Pasir Ris) be cheaper or will it be cheaper if I sell it to my neighbour. Singapore produces maybe 1% of food products, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whereas Australia is a major producer of food products.</span></p>
              <p>I thought I trashed out all these issues about cost of products and law of one price with lionnoisy in an earlier thread regarding more disposable income in Australia (despite having higher tax rates) than Singapore. Apparently he hasn't learnt anything from it.</p>

              <p>Thats is because you were made to believe that Singapore CPF system is flawed and that our month CPF contribution is similar to the income tax you are paying in australia. However the main difference is that CPF monies are part of our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saving</span> which we can use to pay off our mortgages and that itself will put us ahead of the high spending low saving australians who are paying 9.25% of interest.</p>
              <p>Australians has got to thank their fore fathers for stealing the vast piece of land from the aborigine thats why they can now enjoy the wide open space in Australia. However as you have highlighted, when<span style="color: #ff0000;"> there is no proper control on the property and urband development such as public housing</span>, the poor will get shifted out to far away land (like you have mentioned in your last para) that is poorly connected by public transport, while the rich will get to live by the nice sydney habour.</p>
              <p>As for Singapore, we need proper planning to enjor racial harmony and better utilization of land. Plus we also ensure that Singaporeans living in 4 corners of the islands are well connected by clean, comfortable and affordable public transport system.</p>

              <p>check that figure carefully, the main purpose of unemployment benefit is to make sure your basic expenses are covered. if the payment doesnt cover them, then it defeats that purpose</p>
              <p>The idea of a low amount of benefit payment  is to make u go out and work so that u can earn more</p>

              <p><br>I believe serving NS is good but 2.5 years is too long plus the 13 years of reservist too long n I managed not to serve the reservist. As for the minister's salary, it seemed HK secretary salary is lower but their job scope is more important than Spore. CPF scheme started good but alas annuity make it look lousy.</p>

              <p>Well i got my PR in 2002. Studied in Melbourne and staying there, never regretted it. I amnot a unpatriotic singaporean but at the time i got a job offer and many advised me to take it and not return to singapore. But in fact i did return to singapore for a year after accepting the job offer.</p>
              <p>Btw i am an accountant. And right now accountants are a serious shortage in AUS. Salaries scales hitting above the roof..</p>
