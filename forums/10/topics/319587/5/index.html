              <p>I am more concerned about you and your obession with the panties sniffing thingy. If you feel shy about your personal disgusting habits and wish not others to know, its ok, i can stop and let you save your f.face.</p>
              <p>But yet you insist on going on and on about the pantie sniffing thingy, it is hard for others not to feel you might be yourself keen or already indulging in it.</p>
              <p>It really is a sickening habit, but hell, if that's what you enjoy, what can others really say?</p>
              <p>I personally do think you should stop such habits. The odour alone should be horrible to even contemplate, But you do enjoy such smell.</p>
              <p>Go on and smell more panties then, asswipe, guess it must be cause you had been wiping so many asses, you will miss it when there is no one to wipe, more so when your favourite two clowns are in jail now, so you need the replacement odour for your sickening habit.</p>
              <p>Just say the word, plead here, and i am sure your bunch of fellow idiots will gladly donate their underwear to you</p>

              <p>Hello Juvenile, the reply was directed at Mushroom from Oxford, was it meant for you to give a reply ?</p>
              <p>Have the references made any cutting remarks that are not honestly in character of your 'Point_blank' nature - which is similar to the Mushroom from Oxford ?</p>
              <p>Are you claiming 'Point_blank' as your trademark exclusive to you only ?</p>
              <p>You should be more careful in letting yourself become agitated into a Cloud 9 state - as your recommended Institute of Mental Health will soon open its door for you, even as it has a bed reserved in your name.</p>
              <p>Do you even know what a snide remarks is ?</p>
              <p>Are my remarks merely disparaging without any substance to make them 'snide remarks'; or have my statements on your position based on the facts that you have presented as 'Point_blank' points that I have consistently proven to be 'blanks' ?</p>
              <p>Juvenile vulgarities show the darker side of you as you sink into the bottomless hole that you have constantly dug for yourself with your clueless 'Point_blank' efforts to name other who disagree with you and your Grand Mentor as ''bastard opposition  supporters''.</p>
              <p>Now are we seeing your behaviour as a clueless 'Point_blank' juvenile being bastardised again with your own words ?</p>

              <p><br>So you confirm that Gazelle is Aelop but not 'Point_blank' - who is another clueless person that is attracted to 'Panty-sniffing' issues like a magnet ?</p>
              <p>Is it not beneficial for you that through these exchanges - you have discovered another 'panty-sniffing' enthusiast in 'Point_blank', who has dropped off crossing words with me but returned when the 'panty-sniffing' reminders came up in my exchange with you.</p>
              <p>You have surely found some good company, and may PM 'Point_blank' with your 'panty-sniffing' highlights, which I am certain you will not be disappointed.</p>
              <p>As for the sheep part of your argument, you know better than anyone in this SC -  who is your Great Mentor Shepherd, and like obedient sheep has been dutifully responding and imitating his every actions and calls.</p>
