              <p>Well speak for yourself, Mr. Myopic hypocrite.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I dont think PAP are bullies, they are just doing what any other politicians around the world are doing. The only difference is that PAP are run by very capable people with good intention for the future of the country.  As for CSJ and SDP, they have just given singapore opposition parties a bad name, and I am glad that other opposition parties have decided to away from him.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think you need to re-check with a dictionary the definitions for "bully", "capable" and "good".  Or you could go back to your PAP kindergarten and ask the teacher there what those words mean.  You failed to give solid facts to substantiate your point.   You call being able to degrade the moral integrity of opposition politicans, arrest, detain without trial, sue multiple times for defamation, counter-suit a defamation case NOT bullying?  You call being able to say this:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"We have to lock up people, without trial, whether they are communists, whether they are language chauvinists, whether they are religious extremists. If you don't do that, the country would be in ruins." - Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, 1986</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>NOT bullying?  I laugh in your sorry pathetic little face, you little man.</p>
              <p>CSJ was the voice of one Singaporean reflecting the sentiments of many who DARED NOT to speak up against the Lee man.  Just because YOU think that his actions were not honourable doesn't mean the rest doesn't.  Please.. go get an education first before blindly shooting your twisted views off here and hurling blatant accusations.</p>
              <p>You, sir, fail badly in life.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. Today’s generation has no culture and averse to taking political risk. Really, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">an interest in politics is very necessary for the future</span></strong>. But I cannot blame the present generations, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views</span></span></strong>, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.<br><br>So the result is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating</span>. They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less independent-thinking and lack in initiative</span>. <strong>It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business</strong>. Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Because it is soul that makes society</span></strong>.”</span></p>

              <p>Asswipe Atobe, you keep on mentioning panty-sniffing. Perhaps you have a secret desire yourself to smell panties? Espacially since you are dirty person, maybe you prefer more smelly ones?</p>
              <p>Ewww...are all your kind sick in the head?</p>
              <p>But what can one say if you enjoy sniffing panties in secret? afterall, what happens behind close doors no one knows. Yet you reveal your secret desire here?</p>
              <p>What is it about panty sniffing you like so much? This is something i don't understand NOR want to understand. It is just so sick to imagine you sniffing that soiled panty under your nose. But hey, that's your life. If you enjoy it, what can i say?</p>
              <p>How about briefs? Would you like to have my briefs? It's almost the same - a piece of cloth to cover up the private parts. I can donate some to you, after saving it from playing basketball games.</p>
              <p>Maybe you do get a high from it. Afterall, you like underwear, the dirtier, the better. Just don't steal them from your neighbour. Would be embarassing for you and family if you were found out. Maybe all here can chip in and help you out by donating our underwear to you. Yes! The more soiled the better. Then you will be a more happy person, though a mentally sick one.</p>
              <p>But in the meantime, happy panty sniffing.</p>

              <p>Asswipe Atobe, what the f.hell are you talking about? I am not interested in Gazelle or Deers or whatever whomever it is and what he or she has done.</p>
              <p>I am more concerned about you and your obession with the panties sniffing thingy. If you feel shy about your personal disgusting habits and wish not others to know, its ok, i can stop and let you save your f.face.</p>
              <p>But yet you insist on going on and on about the pantie sniffing thingy, it is hard for others not to feel you might be yourself keen or already indulging in it.</p>
              <p>It really is a sickening habit, but hell, if that's what you enjoy, what can others really say?</p>
              <p>I personally do think you should stop such habits. The odour alone should be horrible to even contemplate, But you do enjoy such smell.</p>
              <p>Go on and smell more panties then, asswipe, guess it must be cause you had been wiping so many asses, you will miss it when there is no one to wipe, more so when your favourite two clowns are in jail now, so you need the replacement odour for your sickening habit.</p>
              <p>Just say the word, plead here, and i am sure your bunch of fellow idiots will gladly donate their underwear to you</p>
