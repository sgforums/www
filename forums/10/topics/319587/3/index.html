              <p>singaporeans always like that. wait for things to happen then do something right. wait till mas selamat start bombing and killing people then singaporeans will wake up. right now some people still believe that James Gomez is a more serious case than a terrorist escape.</p>
              <p>hmm.. wonder why now media no report anything liao. he still in singapore?</p>

              <p>There is a report stating that 150000 local either studying or being employed in other countries n the govt is probabaly afraid that they might not come back to this country.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in a report in ST, 1000 locals migrated to other countries each year bring with them their CPF. I guess they might have given up their local citizenship.</p>

              <p><br>I am just curious why you have chosen to ask me that question when there are so many sheep here who actively participating on the LKY thread?</p>

              <p><br>firstly, i do not actively participate in the LKY thread. because i am wise enough to tell myself that i should not discuss anything about opposition parties or pap cos i dont know enough. i only came across the thread because it was titled "LKY when are you going to die" and i felt that was rather out of the ordinary. so i went in, read about it. then along came your posts and i was sickened at your attitude, when things dont go your way you curse others parents. so i pointed that out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>secondly, based on your older post where you said i think its fun to curse LKY, show me evidence. i know very well that i did not go there and type "oh i think this is such fun. you people are cursing mr lky." no i clearly did not do that. and neither do i have the intention do. unlike you, i conduct myself in a civilised manner. i do not flare up over tiny matters, let alone curse others and their parents.</p>
              <p>last but not least, to warn you, if in any case you are going to come out with some bullshit about me cursing lky or anyone, let me tell this to you. before you speak, show some evidence. gimme something to back it up before u talk. the simple rule here is NPNT</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and oh. stop referring to people as sheep. it is rude and it doesent help the fact that you are actually one of them too. anything bey song, pm me. im of course in no right to act like a mod and tell you what to do but stop using the pap dicussion threads as a place to curse people. u wanna continue this arguement here u pm. fullstop.</p>

              <p>Being separated gives PAP the edge to praise one and destroy the other. Unity is the key to opposition sucess, but sad to say that within the oppositions, power struggle and friction occurred often, this gives great advantage to PAP.</p>
