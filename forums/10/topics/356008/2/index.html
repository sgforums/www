              <p>No one is saying the piracy is justified, however you're

              it in the first place.</p>
              <p>It's kinda difficult to be a moral person when others are
              depriving you of your livehood.</p>
              <p>That's like asking why the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are
              shooting rockets into Israel even when their own people are

              retaliations.</p>

              <h3>A Summary of Zionist Terrorism in the Near East — 1944-1948</h3>
              <p>Prepared for Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, UN Mediator for Palestine</p>
              <p>Foreward: In view of the tragic assassination of Count Folke
              Bernadotte by identified Jewish terrorists on September 17 of this
              year, the following report has been prepared for the use of Dr. Bunche,
              Count Bernadotte’s immediate replacement.</p>
              <p>The report is a compilation of all identified terrorist attacks on
              British, American and Arab individuals and entities from the
              assassination of the British Resident Minister in the Middle East on
              November 6, 1944 by members of the terrorist Jewish Stern gang to the
              assassination of Count Bernadotte on September 17, 1948 by members of
              this same gang of fanatics.</p>
              <p>This information is compiled from reports of the US Department of
              State, the British Foreign Office and various American and British
              press services.</p>

              <p><em>Foreign ships accused of dumping toxic wastes and yet foreign fishing vessels still fishing in those  waters?</em></p>
              <p>Some commenters seem bemused by the fact that both toxic dumping and the theft of fish are happening in the same place - wouldn't this make the fish contaminated?</p>
              <p>In fact, Somalia's coastline is vast, stretching to 3300km. Imagine how easy it would be - without any coastguard or army - to steal fish from Florida and dump nuclear waste on California, and you get the idea.</p>
              <p>These events are happening in different places - but with the same horrible effect: death for the locals, and stirred-up piracy. There's no contradiction.</p>

              <p>Other than the hope and satisfaction of taking out or mauling a Israeli or 2 for what Israel has been doing to them. There's nothing logical about what they're doing, it's completely an emotional response. What more have they got to lose? They haven't exactly got much dignity left.</p>
              <p>If Malaysia were to cut off our water and we were forced to live for years on minimum water rations i don't think there would be people doing any less.</p>
              <p>What would constitute as a good enough reason for you then? Fishing is their main livihood, it's not like they have arable land and have the choice of being a farmer to support themselves and their families.</p>
              <p>They couldn't possibly compete with the far more advanced and bigger EU fishing fleets on fishing. And there's no decent government that could host a proper coast guard to deal with the illegal fishing. If your bare minimum livehood is threatened, what are you prepared to do ? That's something we as Singaporeans have not really faced yet. </p>
              <p>Go ahead and sink the pirates, wipe out every single one of them. But as long as the root causes are not dealt with the problem will keep coming back.</p>
              <p>I don't really regard the Gaza Palestinians or Somalis as somehow more important than my own existence i am at heart still a selfish person. But properly identifying the problem means there's a chance for a geninue solution.</p>

              Israeli or 2 for what Israel has been doing to them. There's
              nothing logical about what they're doing, it's completely an
              emotional response. What more have they got to lose? They haven't
              exactly got much dignity left.</p>
              <p>If Malaysia were to cut off our water and we were forced to live
              for years on minimum water rations i don't think there would be
              people doing any less.</p>
              <p>What would constitute as a good enough reason for you then?
              Fishing is their main livihood, it's not like they have arable land
              and have the choice of being a farmer to support themselves and
              their families.</p>
              <p>They couldn't possibly compete with the far more advanced and
              bigger EU fishing fleets on fishing. And there's no decent
              government that could host a proper coast guard to deal with the
              illegal fishing. If your bare minimum livehood is threatened, what
              are you prepared to do ? That's something we as Singaporeans have
              not really faced yet. </p>
              <p>Go ahead and sink the pirates, wipe out every single one of
              them. But as long as the root causes are not dealt with the problem
              will keep coming back.</p>
              <p>I don't really regard the Gaza Palestinians or Somalis as
              somehow more important than my own existence i am at heart still a
              selfish person. But properly identifying the problem means there's
              a chance for a geninue solution.</p>

              <p>That's not going to happen. I don't have a solution for somalia, but i think it will be prudent for the ships to solve the problem of getting raided, held hostage, killed and ransomed by pirates.</p>
              <p>If pirates are being killed at an insanely high rate, and has low success, than less problems for ship. Yes, somalia will still be a hell hole, but i can't solve that problem, i can't provide a solution for that. I'm not smart or capable enough for that.</p>

              <p>So many blind folks in this forum.....Let me present it this manner.</p>
              <p>1) IF it is an issue of illegal international toxic dumping there are United Nation to approached to bring up complaints and investigation.</p>
              <p>(Economically we call it externalities, Example if indonesia burn their forest and smoke cover SEA. The regions govt negociate with Indonesia govt to reduce the smoke) We don't send in Planes to bomb their villages.</p>
              <p>The reason why Somalia govt cannot do it is because they are busy fighting.</p>
              <p>2) Protecting their fishing stocks...Most Somalia fishing capabilities are offshore fishing they don;t have sophsicated fishing Thrawler to fish beyond the depth of their nets nor their boat can hold...</p>
              <p>The reason why Somalia cannot afford bigger fishing thrawler because they are busy fighting.</p>
              <p>After fighting they need more money to buy more weapons.</p>
              <p>The world try to help at different times but their are still busy fighting. Not even their african neighbours want to send in peace keeping force to helps.....Why because they still want to fight among themselve.</p>
              <p>you can only help them if they stop fighting among themselve. So it is not because of toxic and illegal fishing.....!!!</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Opposing the Public Order Bill</h3>
              <p>Yaw Shin Leong</p>
              <p>I refer to the article ‘Discretion in public order’ (TODAY, 14th April
              2009) and the parliamentary speech on ‘Public Order Bill’ by NCMP
              Sylvia Lim (WP, 13th April 2009).<br><br>Second
              Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam’s attempt to package the public
              order bill as a ‘substantial relaxation’ of regulations is done in a
              rather oxymoron manner. A reading of the Public Order Bill will
              certainly give any readers an immediate concern over the luxurious
              amount of discretion that the Public Order Bill grants law enforcers. <br><br>The
              police will now have even more pre-emptive powers to deal with
              cause-related activism, instead of just participant-numbered activism.
              Police will also have the powers to deem a person or a group of persons
              to be a threat to public order and hence the right to exercise a ‘move
              on’ discretion of the said person or groups of persons from any
              particular area.<br><br>What that also came to pass is that, now the
              police have the authority to direct any person or stop filming and
              spreading photos or recordings of police operations or investigations.
              This is such a direct contradiction to the spirit of the citizenry
              journalism.<br><br>The importance of citizenry journalism is best
              exemplified by the Ian Tomlinson incident, recounted by NCMP Sylvia,
              whereby London police’s account of his death on April 1, the eve of the
              G-20 meeting was contradicted by a citizenry journalist who captured on
              video the police’s action of violently pushing Tomlinson to the ground
              when he was merely doing nothing but walking away from the area
              peaceably. <br><br>NCMP Sylvia further questioned that ‘if the above
              case were to happen here, how does this government expect truth and
              justice to prevail without the presence of footage recorded by
              public-spirited citizens?’<br><br>Unfortunately, Minister Shanmugam’s
              response was far from satisfactory. He cited the Mumbai terrorist
              incident and reiterated that such powers were necessary in the light of
              new media technologies, where intelligence or counter-terrorism
              operations would have been compromised. Did he answer NCMP Sylvia’s
              questions? Apparently he chose not to. <br> <br>Furthermore Minister
              Shanmugam’s over-arching rationale that the Public Order Act ‘applies
              only to cause-based activities’ but ‘does not ban such activities per
              se; it only requires the getting of permits’ is PAP-regime-centric and
              politically motivated. His explained that ‘about 50% of the activities
              (sporting &amp; recreational activities organised by statutory &amp;
              charities) that now require permits will not longer require permits.’ <br><br>The
              operative variables above are ‘statutory &amp; charities’. Many will
              still remember the government’s explanations why WP didn’t get a permit
              for a sporting initiative - a proposed cycling activity to commemorate
              WP’s 50th Anniversary, amongst the justifications was the
              Machiavellian-like legal contrast that the PAP Community Foundation is
              a registered charity and not a political party. <br><br>The government
              has cleverly-postured the ‘move on’ orders under new Public Order Act
              as a ‘low key matter’, yet police now has the power to issue orders to
              persons or groups suspected of ‘undesirable’ behaviour, including being
              ‘disorderly, indecent, offensive, or threatening’ to passers-by. <br><br>My
              concern is that political development &amp; alternative political
              expressions in Singapore will potentially take a back seat, as police
              may now exercise high degree of discretion in issuing move-on orders to
              political groups reaching out to fellow Singaporeans on the ground. <br><br>If
              the above is to happen, the only recourse for political-alternative
              activists is to make a case to the Commissioner of Police, but prior to
              that, complying is a must, otherwise, a fine up to $20,000 or jail term
              of up to 12 months, or both could be possible. Such draconian laws
              &amp; punishments seem to be the signature handicrafts of hardcore
              soviet regimes. <br><br>Minister Shanmugam argued further that between
              enough space for political expression and society’s need for stability.
              He said that ‘stability has to be given greater weight’. From a
              political development and political defence point of view, his argument
              is nothing but myopic. This is because on the contrary, stability would
              have been enhanced, if a society’s propensity to accept diversity is
              widen &amp; deepened rather than curtailing it. <br><br>Lastly,
              regardless of international events or ‘special events’, I conjure with
              MP Sin Boon Ann’s views that government “had gone for the overkill” and
              “Surely, there are other security-related instruments under our
              legislative armoury that could have dealt with such issues?” Indeed.</p>

              <h3>Opposing the Public Order Bill</h3>
              <p>Yaw Shin Leong</p>
              <p>I refer to the article ‘Discretion in public order’ (TODAY, 14th April 2009) and the parliamentary speech on ‘Public Order Bill’ by NCMP Sylvia Lim (WP, 13th April 2009).<br><br>Second Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam’s attempt to package the public order bill as a ‘substantial relaxation’ of regulations is done in a rather oxymoron manner. A reading of the Public Order Bill will certainly give any readers an immediate concern over the luxurious amount of discretion that the Public Order Bill grants law enforcers.<br><br>The police will now have even more pre-emptive powers to deal with cause-related activism, instead of just participant-numbered activism. Police will also have the powers to deem a person or a group of persons to be a threat to public order and hence the right to exercise a ‘move on’ discretion of the said person or groups of persons from any particular area.<br><br>What that also came to pass is that, now the police have the authority to direct any person or stop filming and spreading photos or recordings of police operations or investigations. This is such a direct contradiction to the spirit of the citizenry journalism.<br><br>The importance of citizenry journalism is best exemplified by the Ian Tomlinson incident, recounted by NCMP Sylvia, whereby London police’s account of his death on April 1, the eve of the G-20 meeting was contradicted by a citizenry journalist who captured on video the police’s action of violently pushing Tomlinson to the ground when he was merely doing nothing but walking away from the area peaceably.<br><br>NCMP Sylvia further questioned that ‘if the above case were to happen here, how does this government expect truth and justice to prevail without the presence of footage recorded by public-spirited citizens?’<br><br>Unfortunately, Minister Shanmugam’s response was far from satisfactory. He cited the Mumbai terrorist incident and reiterated that such powers were necessary in the light of new media technologies, where intelligence or counter-terrorism operations would have been compromised. Did he answer NCMP Sylvia’s questions? Apparently he chose not to.<br><br>Furthermore Minister Shanmugam’s over-arching rationale that the Public Order Act ‘applies only to cause-based activities’ but ‘does not ban such activities per se; it only requires the getting of permits’ is PAP-regime-centric and politically motivated. His explained that ‘about 50% of the activities (sporting &amp; recreational activities organised by statutory &amp; charities) that now require permits will not longer require permits.’<br><br>The operative variables above are ‘statutory &amp; charities’. Many will still remember the government’s explanations why WP didn’t get a permit for a sporting initiative - a proposed cycling activity to commemorate WP’s 50th Anniversary, amongst the justifications was the Machiavellian-like legal contrast that the PAP Community Foundation is a registered charity and not a political party.<br><br>The government has cleverly-postured the ‘move on’ orders under new Public Order Act as a ‘low key matter’, yet police now has the power to issue orders to persons or groups suspected of ‘undesirable’ behaviour, including being ‘disorderly, indecent, offensive, or threatening’ to passers-by.<br><br>My concern is that political development &amp; alternative political expressions in Singapore will potentially take a back seat, as police may now exercise high degree of discretion in issuing move-on orders to political groups reaching out to fellow Singaporeans on the ground.<br><br>If the above is to happen, the only recourse for political-alternative activists is to make a case to the Commissioner of Police, but prior to that, complying is a must, otherwise, a fine up to $20,000 or jail term of up to 12 months, or both could be possible. Such draconian laws &amp; punishments seem to be the signature handicrafts of hardcore soviet regimes.<br><br>Minister Shanmugam argued further that between enough space for political expression and society’s need for stability. He said that ‘stability has to be given greater weight’. From a political development and political defence point of view, his argument is nothing but myopic. This is because on the contrary, stability would have been enhanced, if a society’s propensity to accept diversity is widen &amp; deepened rather than curtailing it.<br><br>Lastly, regardless of international events or ‘special events’, I conjure with MP Sin Boon Ann’s views that government “had gone for the overkill” and “Surely, there are other security-related instruments under our legislative armoury that could have dealt with such issues?” Indeed.</p>

              <div id="byline">By <a href="http://exiledonline.com/?s=Gary%20Brecher">Gary Brecher</a></div>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://exiledonline.com/war-nerd-update-yo-ho-ho-and-a-tanker-of-crude/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1880" title="Somali Pirates" src="http://exiledonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/060706-modern-pirates_big-450x397.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="397"></a></p>
              <p>Yo ho ho ho time in Somalia! What’s the bestest present kids dream
                  of in faraway Puntland, where piracy is more than a Disney marketing
                  gimmick? A supertanker, that’s what. A Saudi supertanker is the
                  ultimate in stuffed stockings: <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/081118/world/somalia_unrest_piracy">100 million gallons of pure crude.</a></p>
              <p><br> What an Xmas morning that had to be for some sleepy fishing village on
                  the Somali coast! Little Abdul Jihad goes to sleep dreaming of
                  sugarplums-dreaming of picking them off from a hundred meters with his
                  AK—and wakes to find the horizon blotted out by a ship that’s bigger
                  than the whole village.</p>
              <p>Every day I love these Somali pirates more. You know that Lefty
                  line, “this is what democracy looks like”? Well, this is what Robin
                  Hood looks like: a bunch of black skeletons swarming over the side with
                  RPGs. These guys used to be humble fishermen, till the Taiwanese and
                  Korean trawlers took advantage of the fact that Somalia has no
                  government to scoop every last sculpin out of the waters they used to
                  fish. No government means no coast guard, so who was going to stop them?</p>
              <p>Well, karma went out and traded in its fishing boats for a few fast
                  outboards and some Yemeni guns, and made a career move into the piracy
                  business. Now they are what the NT would call “fishers of men.” And
                  getting rich off it, bling and all the nomad girls you can buy.</p>
              <p>So a big hundred million ton shout out to my perps, showin’ your fat
                  Jack-Sparrow-worshipping kiddies what piracy is all about. Keep
                  thinking big, boys. Today that supertanker, tomorrow the cruise ships!
                  All those overfed retirees have relatives who’ll pay big to see their
                  crumbly old folks back in Arizona! Just a word to the wise, just a hint
                  for next time! You can’t miss’em, big white ships that smell like
                  buffet tables and used Depends!</p>

              <p>Well, now we know my pals the Somali pirates are loyal War Nerd readers. At the end of my column saluting <a href="http://exiledonline.com/war-nerd-update-yo-ho-ho-and-a-tanker-of-crude/#more-1875">them for taking on a supertanker</a>, I suggested they go for a cruise ship next:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“Today that supertanker, tomorrow the cruise ships! All
              those overfed retirees have relatives who’ll pay big to see their
              crumbly old folks back in Arizona! Just a word to the wise, just a hint
              for next time! You can’t miss’em, big white ships that smell like
              buffet tables and used Depends!”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, they gave it the old Somali college try, according to a story in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/3538744/Pirates-attack-cruise-ship-off-Somali-coast.html">today’s Telegraph</a>.</p>
              <p>A couple of Somali pirate boats, those fast open boats they use for
              boarding, zoomed toward the Oceana Nautica and fired a few shots at it
              by way of saying, “Hi! Why not take a break ashore in our new
              Hostage-Cave Hilton?”</p>
              <p>The liner outran them, apparently, so it didn’t even get a chance to
              use the wonderful hi-tech defense system the article mentions:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“When threatened, some liners possess long-range
              acoustic devices (LRAD), which emit high frequency noise, to deter
              potential attackers.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Oooo, scary! Loud noises! Got those pirates on the running, begging
              for mercy: “Please, don’t aim loud noises at me!” Come on, for God’s
              sake. Somali pirates probably don’t have that great hearing to begin
              with, not after a lifetime of firing heavy weapons from the backs of
              pickup trucks. And they’re not sensitive plants, either, because in a
              place like that the sensitive types get planted early. You think
              they’re going to be deterred by a Brit recording? Benny Hill
              screeching, “Ooo, you wicked poi-ruts, go stick yer fingers in yer ears
              and go ting-a-ling-a-loo!”</p>
              <p>I have a better defense system to suggest to the cruise lines. It’s
              called the LRHLD, or “long range hot lead dispenser,” also known as a
              heavy machine gun. I would love, totally love, the job of Secretary of
              Defense on one of these love boats, sunning on deck and drinking
              whatever those tropical drinks are called and every few days getting
              the call, “Oh Gary, pirates off the stern!” I’d sigh and moan and
              waddle over to the machine gun and turn the barrel a few degrees and
              watch the little splashes get closer and closer to the speedboat until
              I got full Halo 3 points for it, then go back to the serious work of
              tanning. I hereby volunteer for this hazardous duty. You think my pals
              the pirates would grudge me a little sun time on the deck, a little
              easy money? I don’t; they’re pros, just like me. They know what time it
              is.</p>
              <p>So you bring the machine gun, I’ll bring the sociopathy and the trigger finger, and we’ll meet up in the Gulf of Aden.</p>
              <p>Or if you don’t like the machine gun idea, I can also yell real loud and I do a mean Benny Hill.</p>

              <p>So many blind folks in this forum.....Let me present it this manner.</p>
              <p>1) IF it is an issue of illegal international toxic dumping there are United Nation to approached to bring up complaints and investigation.</p>
              <p>(Economically we call it externalities, Example if indonesia burn their forest and smoke cover SEA. The regions govt negociate with Indonesia govt to reduce the smoke) We don't send in Planes to bomb their villages.</p>
              <p>The reason why Somalia govt cannot do it is because they are busy fighting.</p>
              <p>2) Protecting their fishing stocks...Most Somalia fishing capabilities are offshore fishing they don;t have sophsicated fishing Thrawler to fish beyond the depth of their nets nor their boat can hold...</p>
              <p>The reason why Somalia cannot afford bigger fishing thrawler because they are busy fighting.</p>
              <p>After fighting they need more money to buy more weapons.</p>
              <p>The world try to help at different times but their are still busy fighting. Not even their african neighbours want to send in peace keeping force to helps.....Why because they still want to fight among themselve.</p>
              <p>you can only help them if they stop fighting among themselve. So it is not because of toxic and illegal fishing.....!!!</p>

              <p><br>I just bring out the information that i've been reading and presenting my assessment in my perspective. If that is considered blind then we're all blind because you can't exactly give a more accurate assessment unless you're living there.</p>
              <p>Somalia was already attempting to stablize under the Islamic Court Union but was overthrow by warlords backed by the Ethiopians (Your foreign "peacekeeper" force)  and some say tacit US support. Even during the conflict the US conducted air strikes against supposedly Al Qaeda links. That's what they claimed, it's not like we can get a Somali to share with us what really happened.</p>
              <p>They can't exactly stablize when foreign countries try to get their preferred government in power and it doesn't help that their best hope was an Islamic one.  </p>
              <p>The problem is that the foreign trawlers are not bound by quotas like in their own countries. They can fish all they like and bear no responsibilities. Potentially that could devastate the fish population because they're not allowed the time to reproduce and grow. In the end, it's still going to affect the average Somali fishermen.</p>
              <p>There's a lot more factors to be considered than the ones we see on the news. Reporters and Journalists are not trained to be all knowing, they can only report the truth from their limited perspectives. Basing our assessments because of the different medias we consume and thinking that it is the only Truth is laughable at best.</p>
