              <p>Saw the pirates featured in the news alot lately... Is it time for open war with them yet? Attack, instead of defend, should be the key to the problem.</p>

              <p>Problem is , if you want to attack the pirates you have to invade Somalia itself to get at their leaders. That requires a land invasion and probably not something that the US wants to get into considering their debacle in Iraq.</p>
              <p>And besides, how would you tell the difference between the fishermen's boat or the pirates' boat if they weren't already engaging in hijacking?</p>

              <h2 class="segment">Somalia Piracy Began in Response to Illegal Fishing and Toxic Dumping by Western Ships off Somali Coast</h2>
              <p>President Obama vowed an international crackdown to halt piracy off the
                      coast of Somalia Monday soon after the freeing of US cargo ship captain
                      Richard Phillips, who had been held hostage by Somali pirates since
                      last Wednesday.</p>
              <p>While the pirates story has dominated the corporate
                      media, there has been little to no discussion of the root causes
                      driving piracy. We speak with consultant and analyst Mohamed Abshir
                      Waldo. In January, he wrote a paper titled “The Two Piracies in
                      Somalia: Why the World Ignores the Other?”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>President Obama vowed an international crackdown
                      to halt piracy off the coast of Somalia Monday soon after the freeing
                      of US cargo ship captain Richard Phillips, who had been held hostage by
                      Somali pirates since last Wednesday. Three Somali pirates were killed
                      in the US operation.</p>
              <p>While some military analysts are considering attacks on pirate
                      bases inside Somalia in addition to expanding US Navy gunships along
                      the Somali coastline, others are strongly opposed to a land invasion.
                      US Congress member Donald Payne of New Jersey made a brief visit to the
                      Somali capital of Mogadishu Monday and said piracy was, quote, a
                      “symptom of the decades of instability.” His plane was targeted by
                      mortar fire as he was leaving Somalia, soon after a pirate vowed
                      revenge against the United States for killing his men.</p>
              <p>Former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told Fox
                      News over the weekend that the US should assemble a, quote, “coalition
                      of the willing” to invade Somalia.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, local fishing and business communities along the
                      Somali coast are suffering as a result of the increased American and
                      international naval presence in their waters.</p>
              <ul>
              <p><strong>SOMALI FISHERMAN: </strong>[translated] American Marine forces
                      always arrest us as we continue fishing. We meet their warships, and at
                      times they send helicopters to take photos of us, as they suspect we
                      are pirates. And we are not.</p>
              <p><strong>SOMALI BUSINESSMAN: </strong>[translated] People are worried about
                      the troops, as it is becoming more and more difficult to do business.
                      There’s a lot of warships patrolling the sea, and merchant ships are
                      getting more and more checked, thinking they are operated by pirates.</p>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>While the pirates story has dominated the
                      corporate media, there has been little to no discussion of the root
                      causes driving piracy.</p>
              <p>Mohamed Abshir Waldo is a consultant and analyst in Kenya. He is
                      Kenyan of Somali origin. In January, he wrote a paper called “The Two
                      Piracies in Somalia: Why the World Ignores the Other?” He joins us on
                      the phone right now from Mombasa.</p>
              <p>Welcome to <em>Democracy Now!</em></p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Hello. Thank you.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Good to have you with us. Can you talk about what you think the two piracies are?</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Well, the two piracies are the
                      original one, which was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>foreign fishing piracy by foreign trawlers and
                      vessels, who at the same time were dumping industrial waste, toxic
                      waste and, it also has been reported, nuclear waste</strong></span>. Most of the time,
                      we feel it’s the same fishing vessels, foreign fishing vessels, that
                      are doing both. That was the piracy that started all these problems.</p>
              <p>And the other piracy is the shipping piracy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When the marine
                      resources of Somalia was pillaged, when the waters were poisoned, when
                      the fish was stolen, and in a poverty situation in the whole country,
                      the fishermen felt that they had no other possibilities or other
                      recourse but to fight with</strong></span>, you know, the properties and the shipping
                      of the same countries that have been doing and carrying on the fishing
                      piracy and toxic dumping.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Can you explain what IUUs are?</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>IUUs are—I don’t remember now, but
                      it’s uninterrupted an unreported fishing, unlicensed, unreported,
                      uncontrolled, practically, fishing. Without [inaudible]—</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>In your article, you say—in your article,
                      you say it stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
                      fleets from Europe—</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Correct.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>—and Arabia and the Far East.</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Correct, correct. And this has been
                      known to both the countries in the West that had these fishing fleets,
                      which included Spain, Italy, Greece, and eventually UK and others who
                      joined later, as well as Russian. And, of course, there were many more
                      from the East. And this problem has been going on since 1991. And the
                      fishing communities and fishermen reported and complained and appealed
                      to the international community through the United Nations, through the
                      European Union, with no, actually, response in any form at all. They
                      were totally ignored.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Mohamed Abshir Waldo, explain how what you call “fishing piracy” began.</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Fishing piracy means fishing
                      without license, fishing by force, even though the community complains,
                      even though whatever authorities are there complain, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>even though they
                      ask these foreign fishing fleets and trawlers and vessels that have no
                      license, that have no permit whatsoever, when they tell them, “Stop
                      fishing and get out of the area,” they refuse, and instead, in fact,
                      they fight. </strong></span>They fought with the fishermen and coastal communities,
                      pouring boiling water on them and even shooting at them, running over
                      their canoes and fishing boats. These were the problems that had been
                      going on for so long, until the community organized themselves and
                      empowered, actually, what they call the National Volunteer Coast Guard,
                      what you would call and what others call today as “pirates.”</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>So you’re saying illegal fishing is happening off the coast of Somalia. What countries are engaged in it?</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> countries engaged include
                      practically all of southern Europe, France, Spain, Greece, UK. Nowadays
                      I hear even Norway.</strong></span> There were not many Scandinavians before, but
                      Norwegian fishing now is involved in this, you know, very profitable
                      fishing business. So, there are others, of course. There are Russian.
                      There are Taiwanese. There are Philippines. There are Koreans. There
                      are Chinese. You know, it’s a free-for-all coast.</p>
              <p>And to make things worse, we learned that now that the navies
                      and the warships are there; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>every country is protecting their own
                      illegal fishing piracies—vessels.</strong></span> They have come back. They ran away
                      from the Somali volunteer guards, coast guards, but now they are back.
                      And they are being protected by their navies. In fact, they are coming
                      close to the territorial waters to harass again the fishermen, who no
                      longer have opportunity or possibility to fish on the coast because of
                      the fear of being called pirates and apprehended by the navy, who are
                      at the same time protecting the other side.</p>
              <p>So the issue is really a matter of tremendous injustice,
                      international community only attending and talking and coming to the
                      rescue of the—of their interests and not at all considering or looking
                      from the Somalis’ side. This does not mean I am condoning or anyone is
                      condoning piracy or endangering the life of innocent sailors and crews
                      or damaging the property of others, but these people, these
                      fishermen-turned-pirates, had no alternative but to protect themselves,
                      to protect their turf, to—you know, an act of desperation, you might
                      call it.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>What do people in Somalia feel about the pirates, the issue of pirates off the coast?</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>A mixed reaction, I think, in
                      Somalia. The people do not want the innocent sailors to be harmed. They
                      don’t want any major environmental disasters to happen by blowing up
                      chemical- or oil-carrying vessels. And they urge the pirates, or
                      fishermen pirates, they urge them not to do any such things.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, since there’s no sympathy, there’s no
                      understanding, there is no readiness for dialogue with the coastal
                      community, with the community in general, with the Somali authorities
                      or the regional government or the national government on a joint action
                      for solving these problems, then it’s each for his own way of doing.
                      But the people are very concerned. On the one hand, they would like
                      this to be resolved peacefully; on the other, they feel very sad for
                      injustice being done by the international community.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>A little more on the issue of toxic dumping,
                      if you would, Mohamed Abshir Waldo. I don’t think people in the United
                      States understand exactly what it is you’re referring to and how it
                      affects people.</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Well, toxic dumping, industrial
                      waste dumping, nuclear dumping, as you are probably aware and have
                      heard and many people know, for quite some time, in the ’70s mainly, in
                      the ’80s, in the ’90s, there was a lot of waste of all these kinds that
                      companies wanted to get rid of, following very strict environmental
                      rules in their countries. So where else to take but in countries in
                      conflict or weak countries who could not prevent them or who could be
                      bought?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> So these wastes have been carried to Somalia. </strong></span>It’s been in the
                      papers. It has been reported by media organizations like Al Jazeera, I
                      think, like CNN. Many had reported about the Mafia, Italian Mafia, who
                      admitted it, dumping it in Somalia for quite some time, for quite a
                      long time.</p>
              <p>And as we speak now, I heard yesterday, in fact, another vessel
                      was captured in the Gulf of Aden by community—this time not pirates, by
                      the community, when the suspected it, and it was carrying two huge
                      containers, which it dumped into the sea when they saw these people
                      coming to them. They have been apprehended. The vessel had been
                      apprehended. Fortunately, the containers did not sink into the sea, but
                      they are being towed to the coast. And this community has invited the
                      international community to come and investigate this matter. So far, we
                      don’t have action. So this dumping, waste dumping, toxic dumping,
                      nuclear waste dumping has been ongoing in Somalia since 1992.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>When I read your article, Mohamed Abshir
                      Waldo, it reminded me of a controversial memo that was leaked from the
                      World Bank—this was when Lawrence Summers, now the chief economic
                      adviser, was the chief economist at the World Bank—in which it said, “I
                      think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the
                      lowest-wage country is impeccable, and we should face up to that. I’ve
                      always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly
                      under-polluted.” He said he was being sarcastic.</p>
              <p><strong>MOHAMED ABSHIR WALDO: </strong>Actually, the more formal official
                      concerned with this UN habitat has also confirmed in various reports
                      that this has been dumped in Somalia. The special representative of the
                      Secretary-General, Ould-Abdullah, who is now working with the Somali
                      authorities, has also, I think, made a statement to that effect. So it
                      is very well known. It’s not something hidden. It’s not something we
                      are making up. The world knows, but it doesn’t do anything about it.</p>

              <p>I just cannot agree with u 100%... Its a fact the pirates come from that place and its a fact too, that fishermen catch fish in the sea too. But fishermen should know better not to go near any big ships as this might be a danger to them, being said, its a better idea to stay a distance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for pirates, be it day or night, if the soldiers can spot a boat approaching them in a suspicious manner, they can fire warning shots into the air.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can then evaluate the boat's direction - u-turn or still going towards them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they choose to go towards the ship, I believe they are non other than pirates liao lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somemore, some ships are carrying food supplies to those poor countries, its the duty of the government to protect the ship crews too. Having a navy ship in the somali seas is just not fast enough to response to any emergency.</p>

              <h2>Somalis speak out: Why we don’t condemn our pirates</h2>
              <p><em><strong>by K’naan</strong></em></p>
              <p>Can anyone ever really be for piracy? Outside of sea bandits, and
                  young girls fantasizing about Johnny Depp, would anyone with an honest
                  regard for good human conduct really say that they are in support of
                  sea robbery?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Well, in Somalia, the answer is: It’s complicated.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The news media these days have been covering piracy on the Somali
                  coast with such lopsided journalism that it’s lucky they’re not on a
                  ship themselves. It’s true that the constant hijacking of vessels in
                  the Gulf of Aden is a major threat to the vibrant trade route between
                  Asia and Europe. It is also true that for most of the pirates operating
                  in this vast shoreline, money is the primary objective.</p>
              <p>But according to so many Somalis, the disruption of Europe’s darling of
                  a trade route is just Karma biting a perpetrator in the butt. And if
                  you don’t believe in Karma, maybe you believe in recent history. Here
                  is why we Somalis find ourselves slightly shy of condemning our
                  pirates.</p>
              <p>Somalia has been without any form of a functioning government since
                  1991. And although its failures, like many other toddler governments in
                  Africa, spring from the wells of post-colonial independence, bad
                  governance and development loan sharks, the specific problem of piracy
                  was put in motion in 1992.</p>
              <p>After the overthrow of Siyad Barre, our charmless dictator of
                  20-some-odd years, two major forces of the Hawiye Clan came to power.
                  At the time, Ali Mahdi and Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, the two leaders of
                  the Hawiye rebels, were largely considered liberators. But the unity of
                  the two men and their respective sub-clans was very short-lived. It’s
                  as if they were dumbstruck at the advent of ousting the dictator, or
                  that they just forgot to discuss who will be the leader of the country
                  once they defeated their common foe.</p>
              <p>A disagreement of who will upgrade from militia leader to Mr.
                  President broke up their honeymoon. It’s because of this disagreement
                  that we’ve seen one of the most decomposing wars in Somalia’s history,
                  leading to millions displaced and hundreds of thousands dead.</p>
              <p>But war is expensive and militias need food for their families and
                  Jaad (an amphetamine-based stimulant) to stay awake for the fighting.</p>
              <p>Therefore, a good clan-based warlord must look out for his own
                  fighters. Aidid’s men turned to robbing aid trucks carrying food to the
                  starving masses and re-selling it to continue their war. But Ali Mahdi
                  had his sights set on a larger and more unexploited resource, namely
                  the Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>Already by this time, local fishermen in the coastline of Somalia
                  had been complaining of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>illegal vessels coming to Somali waters and
                  stealing all the fish.</strong></span> And since there was no government to report it
                  to, and since the severity of the violence clumsily overshadowed every
                  other problem, the fishermen went completely unheard.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But it was around this same time that a more sinister, a more
                  patronizing practice was being put in motion. A Swiss firm called
                  Achair Partners and an Italian waste company called Progresso made a
                  deal with Ali Mahdi that they were to dump containers of waste material
                  in Somali waters. These European companies were said to be paying
                  warlords about $3 a ton, whereas to properly dispose of waste in Europe
                  costs about $1,000 a ton. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In 2004, after a tsunami washed ashore several leaking containers,
                  thousand of locals in the Puntland region of Somalia started to
                  complain of severe and previously unreported ailments, such as
                  abdominal bleeding, skin melting off and a lot of immediate cancer-like
                  symptoms. Nick Nuttall, a spokesman for the United Nations
                  Environmental Program, says that the containers had many different
                  kinds of waste, including “uranium, radioactive waste, lead, cadmium,
                  mercury and chemical waste.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But this wasn’t just a passing evil from one or two groups taking
                  advantage of our unprotected waters. The U.N. envoy for Somalia,
                  Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, says that the practice still continues to this
                  day. It was months after those initial reports that local fishermen
                  mobilized themselves, along with street militias, to go into the waters
                  and deter the Westerners from having a free pass at completely
                  destroying Somalia’s aquatic life.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now, years later, the deterring has become less noble, and the
                  ex-fishermen with their militias have begun to develop a taste for
                  ransom at sea. This form of piracy is now a major contributor to the
                  Somali economy, especially in the very region that private toxic waste
                  companies first began to bury our nation’s death trap.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Now Somalia has upped the world’s pirate attacks by over 21 percent
                  in one year, and while NATO and the EU are both sending forces to the
                  Somali coast to try and slow down the attacks, Blackwater and all kinds
                  of private security firms are intent on cashing in.</p>
              <p>But while Europeans are well within their rights to protect their
                  trade interest in the region, our pirates were the only deterrent we
                  had from an externally imposed environmental disaster. No one can say
                  for sure that some of the ships they are now holding for ransom were
                  not involved in illegal activity in our waters.</p>
              <p>The truth is, if you ask any Somali, if getting rid of the pirates
                  only means the continuous<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> rape of our coast by unmonitored Western
                  vessels and the producing of a new cancerous generation, we would all
                  fly our pirate flags high.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It is time that the world <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>gave the Somali people some assurance that
                  these Western illegal activities will end if our pirates are to cease
                  their operations. We do not want the EU and NATO serving as a shield
                  for these nuclear waste-dumping hoodlums.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It seems to me that this new modern crisis is truly a question of
                  justice, but also a question of whose justice. As is apparent these
                  days, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one man’s pirate is another man’s coast guard.</strong></span></p>

                                      was kick in the teeth?</em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext">‘Yes, Virginia’…, the 1992 Somalia military action
              by Herbert Walker Bush, which gave the US a bloody nose, was in fact
              about oil too... Little-known was the fact that the humanitarian
              intervention by 20,000 US troops, ordered by father Bush in Somalia,
              had little to do with the purported famine relief for starving
              Somalians. It had a lot to do with the fact that four major American
              oil companies, led by Bush‘s friends at Conoco of Houston Texas, and
              including Amoco (now BP), Condi Rice’s Chevron, and Phillips, all held
              huge oil exploration concessions in Somalia. The deals had been made
              with the former ‘pro-Washington’ tyrannical and corrupt regime of Siad
              Barre.</p>
              <p>Barre
              was inconveniently deposed just as Conoco reportedly hit black gold
              with nine exploratory wells, confirmed by World Bank geologists. US
              Somalia Envoy, Robert B. Oakley, a veteran of the US Mujahadeen project
              in Afghanistan in the 1980’s, almost blew the US game when, during the
              height of the civil war in Mogadishu in 1992, he moved his quarters
              onto the Conoco compound for safety. A new US cleansing of Somalian

              <p>I think Somali need a stable government now. If u ask me, the UN should find a better warlord among the rest and pump in tons of weapons and resources to him. Let him rule the other warlord and establish a republic. Then hopefully they can form their own nation and protect themselves from western waste throwers and also not to become full scale pirates.</p>
              <p>Of course tat depend on whether is there such a "better' warlord around...</p>

              <p>Somali is a failed state. They have only themselves to be blame. They had FAILED as a society. Democracy and freedom can only be won by paying the price and no 3rd party can win it for them. That they allowed petty warlords to rule over them and not fight back goes only to show how much they value freedom and civilise ways. There is absolutely NO EXCUSE to claim the warlord have guns and the civilians have no guns.</p>
              <p>The civilians had allowed the minority to control the larger population, and by not fighting back, they had only shown support for their criminal activities, even to the extend of warlords robbing UN aid supplies and selling it to the civilians.</p>
              <p>They had failed and failed miserably as a society. To condemn the west or any other civilisation in our world is to blame others for their own fault, espacially over a few vessels who dump toxic wastes or fish in their waters and condone piracy.</p>
              <p>Their warlords had chosen to amass wealth and power for themselves rather than to provide good management and husbandry of their rich resources is a crime not only to their own fellow citizens, but to a hungry world as well.</p>
              <p>UN had failed in Somalia, and so had the only country who cared enough to sacrifice their own sons to bring order to this wretched nation - US, who got 'kicked in their own faces for helping'. No other country in this 'politically correct' age will dare step in to bring order to Somali. for it needs a strong authoritative hand. Only Somalians can help their own country now, if they are to choose the path to civilisation instead of banditry and piracy.</p>
              <p>As no nation dares or would be allowed to bring order to the country, the best the civilise world can do is to protect themselves from piracy by these savages. I would support the killing and hanging of such pirates if they attempt to choke off trade - lifeblood of the world, as well as hunt down their leaders if ANY dares attempt to bring their banditry outside their despicable country to harm citizens of the world.</p>
              <p>There can be no mercy for such lawless animals and the world MUST never be held hostage by a failed nation again. They must pay the price for being savages. Do understand that if their ransoms are not paid, shipboard hostages are murdered and have their innocent lives ended.</p>
              <p>But save your pity for the Somalian children. The only way to save the country now is to take every single male and female child away from that blighted land and give them a good education elsewhere so that when they grow up, they can claim back what is rightfully theirs by birthright from barbarian criminal Somalian warlords. The present adult population of Somalia is weak and hopeless as a society and will only bring harm and a horrid environment for the children to grow up.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="head1_single_item">The only man Somali pirates trust</span></strong></p>
              <p><span class="item_body_bold"> Mombasa - When a ship is hijacked in the
              Indian Ocean, governments, shipping companies and aid agencies call
              Andrew Mwangura, the head of the Seafarers Assistance Programme. <br></span> <span class="item_body"><br> Mr Mwangura is an expert in piracy in the
              region, especially off the coast of Somalia, and his aid group has been
              involved in securing the release of 90 per cent of the vessels taken
              captive there.
              <br> <br> We talk to the pirates and hear what they want, he says.
              <br> <br>Working from a small office in Mombasa, the largest port on the
              steamy coast of East Africa, Mr Mwangura and nine volunteers use their
              contacts in the maritime world to locate missing ships. The
              organisation does not have fancy radar or satellite tracking software
              like some government security agencies. A few mobile phones and a radio
              are all they need.
              <br> <br>We cant afford equipment, but we work better than those who have
              all of the equipment, Mr Mwangura says. People dont trust the
              government; they trust us. Thats why they contact us first.
              <br> <br>The vast majority of piracy acts in the Indian Ocean are off the
              coast of Somalia, where a 17-year civil war has created a lawless
              state.
              <br> <br>The semiautonomous region of Puntland in northern Somalia sits at
              the entrance to the Gulf of Aden, which forms a bottleneck into the Red
              Sea. Any ship travelling from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean
              must pass through these pirate-infested waters.
              <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Piracy in Somalia started out as a group of local fishermen
              protecting their territorial fishing waters,</strong></span> but has evolved into a
              commercial enterprise as some companies pay up to US$2 million (Dh7.3m)
              in ransom to secure the release of their boats.
              <br> <br>After the collapse of the central government in 1991, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Somalia was
              left with no navy and had no means of issuing fishing permits or
              fighting illegal fishing in its waters. Maritime militias seized
              international fishing boats to demand payment for fishing rights. </strong></span><br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the beginning, the pirates were fighting for their rights, Mr
              Mwangura says. They only targeted fishing vessels. </strong></span>Once they started
              getting paid, they started hijacking other vessels. Illegal fishing is
              the root cause of piracy in Somalia.
              <br> <br> The pirates are well organised, well armed and well funded, he adds.
              <br> <br>The ones holding the guns on the boats, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they are just young boys;
              they are not pirates.</strong></span> The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> real pirates are living in big houses in
              Canada, the UK and here in Mombasa. Its a well-organised syndicate. </strong></span><br> <br>Mr Mwangura claims that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Somalis living abroad are funding and
              arming bands of pirates. These wealthy backers take most of the ransom
              money</strong></span> while <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the pirates who take the hostages get a few hundred
              dollars. </strong></span><br> <br>We are trying to tell people to please stop paying ransom, Mr
              Mwangura says. When you pay them, you are collaborating with them.
              Paying them encourages them.
              <br> <br>There have been 25 incidents of piracy off Somalia this year, the
              same number as all of last year, according to the International
              Maritime Bureau. This week, Somali pirates hijacked a Japanese ship
              carrying lead and zinc. At least two UAE-owned ships have been hijacked
              this year.
              <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Somalia does not have any form of solid government. It does not
              have sufficient resources to police its waters,</strong></span> said Cyrus Mody, a
              manager at the International Maritime Bureau.
              <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The pirates have realised that hijacking of vessels is a very
              lucrative business. </strong></span>That has made them a bit more bold in their
              actions. Paying large ransoms has enticed them to carry out attacks
              even more.
              <br> <br>Mr Mwangura helped negotiate the release of the 30-member crew of a
              French luxury yacht, Le Ponant, which Somali pirates held for seven
              days in April. The ships owner was reported to have paid a $2m ransom...</span></p>

              <p>No one is saying the piracy is justified, however you're focusing too much on the act itself but ignoring why they're doing it in the first place.</p>
              <p>It's kinda difficult to be a moral person when others are depriving you of your livehood.</p>
              <p>That's like asking why the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are shooting rockets into Israel even when their own people are suffering and inviting yet more suffering from the retaliations.</p>

              <p><em>US, who got 'kicked in their own faces for helping'.</em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext">‘Yes, Virginia’…, the 1992 Somalia military action
              by Herbert Walker Bush, which gave the US a bloody nose, was in fact
              about oil too... Little-known was the fact that the humanitarian
              intervention by 20,000 US troops, ordered by father Bush in Somalia,
              had little to do with the purported famine relief for starving
              Somalians. It had a lot to do with the fact that four major American
              oil companies, led by Bush‘s friends at Conoco of Houston Texas, and
              including Amoco (now BP), Condi Rice’s Chevron, and Phillips, all held
              huge oil exploration concessions in Somalia. The deals had been made
              with the former ‘pro-Washington’ tyrannical and corrupt regime of Siad
              Barre.</p>
              <p>Barre
              was inconveniently deposed just as Conoco reportedly hit black gold
              with nine exploratory wells, confirmed by World Bank geologists. US
              Somalia Envoy, Robert B. Oakley, a veteran of the US Mujahadeen project
              in Afghanistan in the 1980’s, almost blew the US game when, during the
              height of the civil war in Mogadishu in 1992, he moved his quarters
              onto the Conoco compound for safety. A new US cleansing of Somalian
              ‘tyranny’ would open the door for these US oil companies to map and
              develop the possibly huge oil potential in Somalia...</p>
