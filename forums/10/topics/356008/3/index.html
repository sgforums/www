Mountain<br> <br> April 16, 2009 "</strong></span><a href="http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_4599.shtml"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Online Journal</strong></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>" -- A</strong>SMARA,
              Eritrea -- One of the best kept secrets in the international media
              these days is the link between the USA, Ethiopia and the Somali
              pirates. First, a little reliable background from someone on the ground
              in the Horn of Africa.<br> <br> The Somali
              pirates operate out of the Ethiopian and USA created enclaves in
              Somalia calling themselves Somaliland and Puntland. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These Ethiopian and
              USA backed warlord controlled territories have for many years hosted
              Ethiopian military bases, which have been greatly expanded recently by
              the addition of thousands of Ethiopian troops who were driven out of
              southern and central Somali by the Somali resistance to the Ethiopian
              invasion.</strong></span><br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> After securing their ransom for the hijacked ships the Somali pirates
              head directly to their local safe havens, in this case, the Ethiopian
              military bases,</strong></span> where they make a sizeable contribution to the
              retirement accounts of the Ethiopian regime headed by Meles Zenawi.<br> <br> Of course, the international naval forces who are patrolling the Horn
              of Africa know all too well what is going on for they have at their
              disposal all sorts of high tech observation platforms, ranging from
              satellites to unmanned drones with high resolution video cameras that
              report back in real time.<br> <br> The French commandos started to pursue the Somali pirates into their
              lairs last year until the pirates got the word that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for the right
              amount of cash they were more than welcome in the Ethiopian military
              bases in their local neighborhoods.</strong></span> Ethiopia being the western, mainly
              USA, Cop on the Beat in East Africa <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>put these bases off limits to the
              frustrated navies of the world, who are no doubt growling in anger to
              their USA counterparts about why this is all going on.</strong></span><br> <br> Now that the pirates have started attacking USA flagged shipping,
              something that was until now off limits, it remains to be seen what the
              Obama administration will do. One thing we in the Horn of Africa have
              learned all too well, when it comes to Ethiopia, don’t expect anything
              resembling accurate coverage by the media, especially those who operate
              under the cloak of “freedom of the press.”<br> <br> Stay tuned for more on this from the Onlinejournal.com, the only site
              willing to expose the truth on matters no one else will touch.<br> <br> Thomas C. Mountain, the last white man living in Eritrea, was in a
              former life an educator, activist and alternative medicine practitioner
              in the USA. Email thomascmountain at yahoo.com.</span></p>

              <p><br>I just bring out the information that i've been reading and presenting my assessment in my perspective. If that is considered blind then we're all blind because you can't exactly give a more accurate assessment unless you're living there.</p>
              <p>Somalia was already attempting to stablize under the Islamic Court Union but was overthrow by warlords backed by the Ethiopians (Your foreign "peacekeeper" force)  and some say tacit US support. Even during the conflict the US conducted air strikes against supposedly Al Qaeda links. That's what they claimed, it's not like we can get a Somali to share with us what really happened.</p>
              <p>They can't exactly stablize when foreign countries try to get their preferred government in power and it doesn't help that their best hope was an Islamic one.  </p>
              <p>The problem is that the foreign trawlers are not bound by quotas like in their own countries. They can fish all they like and bear no responsibilities. Potentially that could devastate the fish population because they're not allowed the time to reproduce and grow. In the end, it's still going to affect the average Somali fishermen.</p>
              <p>There's a lot more factors to be considered than the ones we see on the news. Reporters and Journalists are not trained to be all knowing, they can only report the truth from their limited perspectives. Basing our assessments because of the different medias we consume and thinking that it is the only Truth is laughable at best.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The only US strategic interest in somalia after black hawk down is preventing the growth of AL QAEDA cell. I believe generally A stable circular govt was what is necessary to establish LAW and Order Rather than creating a taliban regime.  It was US intel in the region but with Jordanian special force on ground that took out AL Qaeda in Somalia. (Read killer elites)  like i say you cannot stop internal fighting unless they "Somalian" agreed to stop fighting among themselved.</p>
              <p>The topics of over fishing; over used of earth resources .....is a global problems. I can tell you right now is not happening only to Gulf of Aden....... But for Somalia fisherman can only do coastal fishing. There is something you need to know marine mammals  reside in deeper depth are not going to feed on coastal fishing.  Similarly marine fishes habita is at 40 - 50ft aren't going to be found at 100ft and beyond. Any other creature that can move between the 2 depth probably too big for Somalian fisherman to catch.</p>
              <p>Somailia fisherman probably would know that if he caught a Shark he will cut off the fin and the tail because he knows those would fetch a better price for Chinese Shark fin soups....economics demand dictate.   </p>

              <p>Because i have no idea where you're getting the conclusions that the deep sea and coastal marine food chains are not connected with each other and where does deep sea marine mammals come into play with this ? Also i would like to understand your confidence  that foreign trawlers are only fishing in deep sea and would never conflict with the Somali fishermen because that's not what i'm reading. </p>

              <p>Well, like i said no one wants to be the first to take the
              responsibility. It sounds very noble to apprehend the pirates but
              it's always finding out what to do with them that's the fun
              part.</p>
