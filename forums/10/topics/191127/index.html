            <div class='col-md body'>agree. but the impt point is having good opposition rather having sake of having.<br>WP has good members in aljunied but lost. CCK has steve chia but lost too.<br>this means singapore are prepare to pay and impt pay the price for what PAP claim is a strong mandate dispite dropping 8% in votes.<br><br>WP has stated what you have mention, but ppl choose to ignore them. in our society majority wins. so what else can we do now but Pay and Pay.<br>hopefully we can stop paying 5-6 years later.<br><br></div>

What's the problem? Democratic issue? I rather it than it is not been approved out of moral reasoning.<br><br>Melvin Tan? I still think the government had done a big waste to the talents. People like Melvin tan don't come everyday. How many can acheive his status and talent? If you can I think the country should also support your cause.

I think the raise of transport is much due to the private sector and other issue. The government can stop abit but how much?

But on HOW they brought about it.<br><br>"Public" consultation was to a limited audience and it's tokenistic in nature than anything.<br><br>Serious issues brought up by ppl are shot down with vague reason.<br><br>2) Melvin Tan. I was trying to say... BECAUSE of melvin tan... NS Laws have changed so unopposed. And as a result...13 year olds are moer restricted.<br><br>There wasn't opposition to voice out why laws here can change so easily.<br><br>3) Other countries have increases of GST with a basis. They have long history of budget deficit and usually GST increases are last resort.<br><br>Singapore, raised it to prevent a deficit. Plus, when GST was first introduced, it said that overall income for GST will decrease because tax structure has been changed that in the end, only people who buy alot of stuff is affected.<br><br>But turn out, GST gave govt moer income that the expected overall decrease.<br><br>4) We got a good transport system because we need to. American cities have transport system NOT for profit but as a SERVICE to its residents. Transport systems there aer usually borne by the city.<br><br>Here, we only care that transport companies don't suffer losses at expense of ppl's pockets.</div>
