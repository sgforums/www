            <div class='col-md body'>The MP is currently being paid $12,000.00 pm for doing a part-time job which he needs not have to perform but our MPs are being described as great talents and people with all kinds of ability beyond human or performance-rated proportion.<br><br>He can still keep his normal job without resigning when he is elected as a MP.<br><br>As part-time salary or allowance of $12,000.00 pm is simply too high to pay the MPs. Don't forget we the taxpayers still have to pay the MPs for life at about $8,000.00 pm after two terms.<br><br>In the case of an opposition MP, he has to do more works to produce checks and balances on the government. A backbencher MP does not have too much to worry as his works are preempted and covered by the autocratic leaders who except them not to ask too much questions.<br><br>An opposition MP is also under the risk of being sued for defamation and targeting by the party in power.<br><br>Opposition MPs would deserve to be paid more than the backbencchers who hardly attend meetings or raise questions in parliaments.<br><br>More likely since our MM Lee and PM Lee are so sure about their leadership and convinced of the righteuousness of their policies, backbencher MPs do not really have to query their leaders. All they need to do is to be able to speak in favour of their leaders' policies and be supportive.<br><br>MPs' job scopes consist of attending meet the people sessions about four times per month, Parliament once or twice per quarter, and some walkabouts.<br><br>If we divide $12,000.00 into say 6 attendances, MP is being paid $2,000.00 for each attendance. Where in the world can one receive $12,000 pm for a part-time sinecure job as our MPs many of whom only become active to appear on TV during the election time.<br><br>True, an MP needs to do some researches of problems and issues but how many of them really have done great works from their so-called researches. I think some forumers have done more than our MPs in bringing up real issues facing their constituents.<br><br>It is not worth paying $12,000.00 pm to our MPs (except opposition MPs) to carry out a part-time job which they need not perform in many cases except to be yesmen. I think to be realistic, we should pay our MP about $500.00 per attendance oe $3,000.00 per month with savings going to an endowment fund to help lower the costs of living currently faced by all citizens.<br><br>If certain leader or ministers have proven their worth such as having succeeded in turning around the economy during 1997-99 or 2000-2002, with upgrading to a value-adding model, we should pay such ministers $1,000,000.00 pa but this should not be taken as precedent to pay all the rest of ministers who have experienced highway collapses or high medical or housing costs.<br><br>Do not forget that beside the minister's salaries, tax payers still have to pay them to the tune of $750,000.00 pa for the rest of his life after two terms.<br><br>Those who have not yet proven results like Dr. Goh Keng Swee has should not be paid automatically $1,000,000.00 pa. If we really must bribe our ministers so as to prevent bribery, then this is not the kind of Minister we want. We only need to pay them sufficiently high to be worth of trouble to leave his job to serve the nation. If in the private sector someone has made 10 times our minister's salaries, let it be so our ministers are not risking their own capital or life saving like Bill Gate or Li Ka Shing and cannot be compared with such corporate bosses in the private sector as recommended by MM Lee.<br><br>His comparison is not apple-to-apple and cannot stand closer scrutiny.<br><br>All our Ministers have are paid million-dollar salaries should be regularly made to defend his performance based on acceptable objective yardstick and not by intuitions of the MM or PM alone. Ministers who have created NKF or repeated high costs or highway collapses are not talents and should be told plainly they have not performed by someone else as PM will probably find it hard to tell them so.<br><br>To create a more accountable and competitive government, our leaders should start changing their assumption that all their chosen men or women are talents. If they are, they must be independent and objective measurement yardstick, justification based on "I say what I like" rhetorics or presentation.</div>

But our MM Lee is still regarding many of them as talents and paying them million-dollar salaries and life-long free wages without evidence from real-life performance.<br><br>People know too well whether they have performed up to the mark. Those MPs who only know to be yesmen and constantly agreeing with many of the past wrong policies deserve to be axed.<br><br>Ministers who are regularly causing problems to the people in term of raising the costs of living and having no plans to create more jobs are not worth keeping or being paid obscenely inflated salaries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(as posted to FBU in reply to Hello XYZ on 17.4.2006)<br><br>If you disagree with my arguments, you can rebut or debunk them with more robust logics and arguments not the one-line rhetoric or salmanisation.<br><br>I have made three points in my post but you have offerred no substance in dismissing them as rubbish:<br><br>(1) MP's job scope in Singapore autocratic context is very simple consisting of :<br><br>(a) 4 meet-the-people sessions pm<br>(b) walk around and ask some questions but mostly could not solve them except in second guessing the leaders' unworkable past policies long-overdued for change. They are mostly too powerless to change the autocracy's hardlined policies capped only with assumptions that do not hold water in most cases<br>(c) two or three attendances of parliament with some researches done which did not amount to much which did not solve the current "20 major problems of the government" as posted in another thread. MPs often cannot disagree with the autocracy as comfirmed by SM Goh about use of the party whip.<br><br>(2) MP's job is a part-time job. He can keep his existing job. A number of MPs have given as reason for their retiring or stepping down the reason that they are too busy with their full-time job to serve the people.<br><br>(3) Over-rating of MPs as people with abilities and talents without showing proofs or evidences that they had solved real-life problems during the last two prolonged recessions. People are being told by these yes-men MPs (read the old Straits Times of the period 1997-2002) that our MPs or ministers could not help the citizens much except to wait for the world economy to recover. Now when the world economy finally recovers and when Singapore finally also recover being the last among the Asian Tigers to recover, our MPs and ministers suddenly come out to say that they have been great talents to build up the country over the past 40 years making comparison with the worse performers in SEA and not willing to compare with greater smaller countries or better Asian Tigers.<br><br>Are what I am saying in the foregoing rubbish or all rubbish. MM Lee has not proven abilities during the recent recessions to turn around the economy or build up a socially cohesive or vibrant country. He was not consonent with the youths as seen in the recent TV dialogue "Does my vote matter?". He mostly relies on the earlier period of industrialisation of the country during the 1960s to claim his success story - preferring to quick quiet about the lack of performance of his MPs and ministers in all the recent history as enumerated in the "20 major problems of the government".<br><br>If you cannot prove these three points wrong with robust facts and arguments as PM Lee has indicated he would do to answer to critics then, the leaders should pause and ponder the points and make amends to change past policies and do better.<br><br>Of course, they could always throw the spanner when they cannot answer to arguments such as by calling the youths idealistic, ungrateful or challenging those with views to stand for election. Such a mindset is counter-progressive and reflecting sheer arrogance and lack of concern or passion to serve the people.</div>

How much the MP gets would depend on how happy residents are with his work.  If you are not happy, give him a $1 angbao.  If you are very happy, give him a $50 to $100 angbao or as much as you like.

At the end of each year, each household is to give an angbao to the MP as payment for services rendered.  How much the MP gets would depend on how happy residents are with his work.  If you are not happy, give him a $1 angbao.  If you are very happy, give him a $50 to $100 angbao or as much as you like.  Fair isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Oop this is a good suggestion which has its merit. It is worth considering too with proper control and implementation. When Ang Bao are properly given and collected with accountability they can reflect the bonuses that should be given to the MPs to match dollar for dollar with a cap. Only then will there be a change and the MPs really have to work harder for the people.</div>
