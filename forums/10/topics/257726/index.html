There are many cases in history where non-violent protest have worked, have brought governments to really take the citizens seriously. Recent examples include the article 23 law in HK.<br><br>Non-violent protest were what brought down the british rule and brought PAP into power and gave us our independence in the first place. After which the PAP disallowed such protests.<br><br>The key is non-violence, even when faced with violence from authorities. reacting with violence will only give the govt a reason to crack down on the movement.
