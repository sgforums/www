Senseless law or not, they would not go against it. Yes, they would/might pack up and leave, point is, they would not break the law.<br><br>My other point was that even if the law/restriction were to be taken away, I believe the culture and nature of the people here would be they'd use other means. Maybe it's from habit over the years, maybe this culture was started because of the restriction, in any case my opinion is that the general public still prefers the normal means. Problem with people itself and not just the law itself.<br><br>I think I've said a tad too much, and I understand ultimately, your issue is with the law being there in the first place. My point was kinda off topic so apologies for that.<br><br>It'd be nice to have more avenue/options with which to express our unhappiness with certain issues, but would Singaporeans take up that other option?<br><br>My point is this, the songbirds did what they can within the constraints/law restrictions they had. In Singapore, we have even more restrictions, but should the restrictions be removed, would the people rise up</div>
