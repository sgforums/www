            <div class='col-md body'>I think the sentence is reasonable.. Can u imagine if u were in the bank, or, worse still, the one he held hostage? At that point in time with the gun pointing at ur head there's no way u can know if the gun was real or not lor. Just imagine the psychological trauma of the people there.. not knowing if (or when) the unpredictable fellow will pull the trigger and end his/her life.<br><br>I agree with the judge.. A harsh message must be sent out otherwise people low in cash will start robbing banks as a source of easy money, and maybe even using guns (real or bluff) and holding hostages.. knowing that even if caught, they'll get away with a light sentence.<br><br>As for his injuries, they were the result of his criminal action and hence i feel it's nothing worth sympathising.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got he has already pay for his crimes as being 1 eye blinded permantly, it deinfitely a social issue which the govt had overlooked or miss out ... i believed the govt r looking into this matter such Dr vivan has assured that he will look into his family problems ....<br>My view is that he shld be given a lighter sentence, he was really desperate to rob esp when u come to saving ur loved ones from suffering. He has also nv meant to hurt anyone in the incident, maybe i think the cisco guard was reactive &amp; too steadfast to open TWO bullets at him, although it is right &amp; his responsible to protect anyone from getting hurt.</div>

The reason?  Civil administration does not exist in a vacuum. Civil administration, as the word "civil" implies, involves dealing with civilians who live in a complex society governed by emotions, rules and quirks.<br><br>In discharging his duty, the civil servant has to take into account the environment and circumstances, something Singapore's civil servants are quite incapable of.  How else do you explain the Boxing Day tsunami debacle in Thailand where Singaporeans whose belongings were swept away were asked to pay a charge at the Singapore Embassy just to get a new passport??  Ridiculous?  Yes. But I think it's a mindset steeped in Singaporeans that there are rules and we have to follow them strictly unless there are clear instructions from the top.<br><br>How is public interest not protected by giving a lighter sentence of maybe 2 years to that man?<br><br>How is the man who was held hostage scarred for life?<br><br>You are speaking from a very hypothetical viewpoint.<br><br>Has the spate of bank robberies dissuaded people from going to the banks? ANSWER IS NO.<br><br>Singapore is so pre-occupied with order that everything else is lost in the process. This includes room for creativity and human autonomy.<br><br>We are very much living in Kafka's world without realising it. And as we write this, the Public Prosecutor could be beaming because he's nailed a case and he'll be up for promotion soon.<br><br></div>
