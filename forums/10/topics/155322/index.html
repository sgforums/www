Their paths cross over the Napier Bridge on a Thursday morning and their lives change irreversibly. Inba, the hired assassin, Michael, his intended victim, and Sidharth, the innocent by-stander caught in the cross-fire between the two. A horrific showdown results in their lives going in total disarray, changing their destinies.Directed by internationally acclaimed indian director Maniratnam, this movie is an innovative portrayal of the little explored genre of sociopolitical conflict, as to why the world is the way it is now..<br><img src="http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/6101/vidyasagarsetu2ag.jpg"><br>Great stunts by Vikram Dharma, top cast, excellent music by AR Rahman and breaktaking cinematography by Ravi Chandran makes this one of the biggest blockbusters of the year<br><br><img src="http://img335.imageshack.us/img335/4505/ayuthaezhuthu120xx.jpg"><br><strong>Review:</strong><br><br>As I began to recollect my science teacher telling that white light is composed of mainly red, green and blue, I thought of what could have been on the mind of India's finest director.An examination of sociopolitics ,the movie oscillates from the past to present and in one point the flashback merges with the present event. This same thing if you deploy as three flashbacks which gets merged with the present through a common incident, you get Aayitha Ezhuthu. Mani Ratnam chooses to adopt a style of film-making which is still in its experimental state, at least in India. The basic rule for the screenplay is that there no rules<br><br>There lives in the slum streets, a man who seeks the gun to get big money and status. He serves the politicians ill deeds, spoiling his own hands.<br>There was this man who would challenge anything he feels is wrong. He would even challenge the dirty politicians by contesting in the elections as an opposition.<br>There, in the dim-lit, smoky, freaky discotheque, the guy syncs his hips and hops with beauteous babes. He dreams: no violence, no challenges, just girls, and fun, and US<br>and these are the three shades in the spectrum of today?s young men?the three shades of YUVA.<br><br>A ManiRatnam film: As every ManiRatnam film has its own tale to tell, AYUTHA EZHATHU (Tamil version of YUVA) tells about the strength of young men and how each guy can sum up to make a strong nation.<br>The climax of the film shows a strong young man sitting in the assembly hall. That shows, the end of the film is a start for young men in this country to take the ruling pride.<br><br>But YUVA, the lifestyle of young men, runs fast. YUVA, the film, too runs fast. And ManiRatnam is the kind, who makes compact frames and leaves the rest for the viewer to understand. So some moments of the film look abrupt and absurd for a normal filmgoer.<br><br>The Last Line: It's nice to see a ManiRatnam film. It?s a fortune to listen to his story. And it's a Bliss to understand the inner sense of it.<br><br>As you stroll down the dark cinema hall to watch Aayitha Ezhuthu and if you are a few minutes late, you might assume that the climax is around. So begins the latest Mani Ratnam flick Aayitha Ezhuthu. And hey, you needn't worry for there is lot more to come and even if you miss this first scene, the scene repeats more number of times than the cost of your popcorn. Aayitha Ezhuthu is about serious cinema and not just for the popcorn eating cinema commoner.</div>
