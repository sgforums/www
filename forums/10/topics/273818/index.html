            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mods,<br><br>This is a sincere plead to you to read what I have to say.<br><br>I'm a occasional contributer to Speakers Corner in Sgforums, logging in from time to time to keep myself update on the political scene in Singapore.<br><br>Previously, the Speaker's Corner used to be abuzzed with lively exchanges between fellow forumites. True, opinions differ time to time, but nonetheless engaging and allows insights into differing points.<br><br>However recently, (after a time of absence), I've noticed a common occurence in Speaker's Corner. I've seen promising threads derailed by a common person, Mat Toro. His contributions are plain senseless and often is flame bait. Even neutrals have taken to flaming him, let alone the ''pro-democracy'' camp.<br><br>Before you allow the Speakers Corner to degenerate further, I urge you to take action against this user (troll).<br><br>Regards.</div>

Why should they ask us to be more understanding, and go along with their policy? we are not asking for a welfare state, but at least spare a concern for our needs, the increase of gst, have given to alot of business owner, an excuse to increase their price, and we have to suffer.
