Next time, you go AWOL during your NS, and then when your CO is passing down the sentence, tell him, sir, i want to go into DB instead of paying that $50 fine, and spend the 10 days or less in DB, and then you have to do marching every single day, and carry sand bag in backpack(forgotten the name)<br><br>then hor, you will understand what i mean? then hor, at every single yellow line, you have to shout this, Permission to carry on SIR[/quote]<br>only one day, you won't die lah. the problem with you is that you are too soft.<br><br>[quote]<br>either you are just plain stupid, or plain ignorance, which one are you? i don't care to know, after all, you are always contradicting yourself, first you proclaim to be a Pro PAP. which is what your posting have been telling people, then you like to retract back your statement to become a neutral party . Oh God, pick a side to support, will you? and please stick to it</div></blockquote>when did i ever say that I am pro PAP? Please show me.<br>I did say that I disagree with the govt on some issues but does that mean i need to disagree on everything with the govt?
