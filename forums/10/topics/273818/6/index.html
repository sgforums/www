A claim that it will bring in extra 1.5 billion sgd in tax revenue a year, while giving a 5 billion GST package...<br><br>Wouldn't it be better to delay the GST increase by 3 yrs, and not giving the GST package?

If it is delayed by a few years as mentioned above, it would be just before the next general election.</div>

And what has been given that are not taken from us?<br><br>2) This I agree. However, our stand here is the government has definitely alternative ways to reach the budget required. Our reserves are rising from between 3 to 30 billion US dollars a year. Just taking out US$1 billion a year from this excess to sponsor our supposed financial aid =&gt; isn't it better than increasing out GST by 2%?<br><br>Even though there may be stronger economical reasons that are not mentioned to us (since when PAP decide to tell us a lot of things), the timing of the GST increase + ministery pay rise is bad...<br><br>3) Foreigners have the option of having their paid GST returned at the airport.</div>
