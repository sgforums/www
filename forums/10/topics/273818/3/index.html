Why should they ask us to be more understanding, and go along with their policy? we are not asking for a welfare state, but at least spare a concern for our needs, the increase of gst, have given to alot of business owner, an excuse to increase their price, and we have to suffer. If our pay was to increase as well, i don't mind the gst increase at all, but the fact doesn't turn out this well, and i can live with it.<br><br>I will not vote for such a government in the next GE, i want a government will spare a thought for our sake, i am sake and tired of listening to their same old crap - the economy is improving, we are getting better, if that is so, why is it, there are more and more people complaining and voicing out, because we quit being a sheep and to be lead by them, we are standing up for ourselves,<br><br>if they are not going to improve themselves, one fine day, their ivory tower will fall down to the ground, after all, we, the citizens, are the one, maintaining their well paid salary, it is the citizen that make up the nation, not the government, without the citizen, they are nothing, we can always vote for another government.<br><br>who is paying for their salary?
