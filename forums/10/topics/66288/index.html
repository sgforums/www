            <div class='col-md body'>The value of our SGD is weighted against a basket of currencies from countries that we trade most with.<br><br>In the basket, are the USD, Yen, Euro, Sterling Pound, AUD.<br><br>The weightage of each country with the SGD is dependent on the volume of trade that is conducted over the last five years.<br><br>With the US Market being the most important market for our manufactured products, the USD serves as quite a strong influence over the value to the SGD.<br><br>Unfortunately, the USD is being weakened by the heavy domestic debt from the borrowings committed by US Government to fund its way out of economic recession.<br><br>The heavy borrowings were necessary to finance the wars that it has got itself involved with in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the continued expenditure to build a strong military, as well as to improve 'homeland security from scratch' - all made even more urgent and necessary after their 9-11 nightmare.<br><br>The huge domestic debt situation is made worse by the huge trade imbalance that the US is suffering from its trade relations with practically every country. The USA import more for domestic consumption then it is able to export to the whole world.<br><br>In a CNN special feature on Saturday night, a financial specialist is anticipating another recession for the USA in 2005 - if the present ballooning financial crisis is not addressed quickly in 2004.<br><br>While the USA is weighed down by its heavy financial burden, Australia is having a great time with its exports to Asia and the rest of the world - especially with the high demand of its agricultural produces in China.<br><br>The Australian economy has been quietly humming from strength to strength, from mid-2002 through end-2003, and still going strong.<br><br>The AUD is very stronger against the USD, and although the SGD has strengthened over the USD, the Singapore economy could not match the performance of Australia in 2002 and 2003.<br><br>This has resulted in the SGD strengthening against the USD, but comparatively weaker than the AUD, which is able to outpace the SGD in achieving a higher exchange valuation with the USD.<br><br>With our high dependency on the large US Market and her economic health for our industry and commerce, it is best that Singapore prepare for the worse to come in 2005.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This year, 2004, would be a gd yr to invest in equities(if no terrorists attacks reported, virus spreading etc.), well... at least for the 1st quarter... so should one commit his cash to foreign cash deposits like the AUD or in the stock market?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, the US is the major trading partner for most developed nations including Singapore. That is why such countries who depend on a lot of trade with the US will be hit as well should the US economy do badly.<br><br>That's why there are several major Singaporean corporate inroads into Australia in recent years - think Singtel-Optus, SIA-AirNZ-Ansett?... This is to diversify away the risks pertinent to the respective economies - Singapore's dependence on US economy, Singapore's own economy, Australia's booming economy...<br><br>To answer sunny6110, it really depends on your own risk appetite as well as outlook of the economy whether you should buy foreign currency denominated fixed deposits or invest in equity. Do you think AUD will strengthen further against SGD? What's the return you expect? Will you be able to find better returns in the stock market? Perhaps try buying Aussie stocks on SGX?<br><br>Cheers!</div>
