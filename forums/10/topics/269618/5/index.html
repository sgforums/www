They just refuse to face reality that many don't wanna come back for good.  They are so many I know of who got jobs there and even encourage the parents to migrate there.   The only one I knew who came back, because she had no choice, she wanted to settle down in Australia but could not find job there.  So if the local press this shows our local press is not reporting all facts.</div>

Doctors are well trained medically but as for management/managing people, hardly anyone of them can do well.  My cousin who works in the govt hospital keeps complaining doctors are difficult to work with, as they are not trained in management so they have unrealistic expectations for the work to be done. They think that just by "pushing the button" they will get what they want. They don't understand the management process.<br><br>Thus explains why we have ministers/MP who can't reach down to the level of common people.  Failure in its own sense!  Laughable!  Just because one was awarded scholarship does not mean he has the cut/calibre of that of a minister/MP.  Whatever they decide and do are "perfect"!!!!!
