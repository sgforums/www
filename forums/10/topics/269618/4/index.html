To me, I wanna say again, he is better off going back to be a surgeon in the hospital.  How much has he contributed to help the local since he become the manpower minister?  saw the TV interview, showed his normal day of work as minister/MP.  From the way he works, he did not impress me as someone who is in politics to go all the way to serve the people, rather he is someone employed as a minister/MP and is just doing the job he is paid for, that is all!  No passion!!!  To me, he is more of a KS, KS minister/MP!</div>
