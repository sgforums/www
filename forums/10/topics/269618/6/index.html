A good example, is the Eldershied Premium.  Eldershiled Premium only covers disability.  MIWs are afraid the aging population will be a liability to them so come up with this Eldershield Premium policy.  As the sickening Lee Hsien Loong has more than once said it clearly that he is not making Singapore a welfare state, so comes all these nuisance including the recent increase in hospital bills.  Our overseas singapore students will definitely take all these nuisance into consideration to decide to stay put or come back.  In other countries, the taxes are high but the government take care of their senior citizens.  Thus the self centred government is making Singapore such an unattractive country to come back to.</div>

If they are so desperate to get the overseas students back, they just need to do them  and us a big favour,  just get out and let a new party who will work for the good and benefits of the people take over.</div>

When have they ever listen to the voice of the people of Singapore.  There is no other voice, theirs is the one and only!  We are just here to follow and obey.</div>

You won't attract real talents with a draconian regime, only average joes and serfs. Real talents do not like to have their thoughts and experiences restricted.<br><br>Inventions and stuffs needs unrestricted creativity. There is no doubt that the average FTs and serfs will continue to pour into Singapore, but would it lead to a better standard of living for Singapore? Ultimately, with all these average joes and serfs, we will end up as a 3rd world factory.</div>

Instead, I know of a couple of overseas grads singaporeans who come back here to find jobs are having difficulty looking for jobs.</div>
