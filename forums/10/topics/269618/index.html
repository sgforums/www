            <div class='col-md body'>GAIN experience abroad, but come back to Singapore and be part of the adventure that is Asia's growth.<br>In making the call to 400 Singaporeans studying overseas, Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen told them that an exciting decade lay ahead for the country and region.<br><br>A diversified economy and strong growth presented ample opportunities and jobs that 'we need able people to fill', he said at a dialogue organised by Singaporean students and graduates studying overseas.<br><br>The Government paid particular attention to views from those who worked and travelled widely as these helped 'us keep our edge', he said to the 400-strong audience.<br><br>He told students their generation would witness a 'reinvigorated and renewed Singapore' - the result of domestic policies and regional growth powered by the likes of China and India.<br><br>So while they should gain experience and 'stretch (their) boundaries' abroad, he urged them to eventually return home.<br><br>His remarks at the dialogue, held as part of Confluence 2007, a career networking event at The Shangri-La hotel, reflected an ongoing effort by the Government to keep Singaporeans abroad connected with developments here.<br><br>What Dr Ng was particularly pleased about was that the event - held for the second year - continued to be organised by Singapore students abroad. It was, he said, a ground-up initiative which showed their desire to remain plugged in to national issues and learn about challenges facing the country.<br><br>Organising committee chairman Moses Lin Weiwen, 26, a University College London law graduate, said Dr Ng's overview about prospects here tied in with the aims of Confluence 2007.<br><br>It sought to raise participants' awareness of job opportunities here as well as keep them connected emotionally to Singapore, he said. 'We need people to feel for home, to miss home and to want to contribute to Singapore. If we don't, no one else will.'<br><br>Which is why participants like Imperial College student Cumarran Kaliyaperumal, 21, feel that the Government's pitch to those abroad should emphasise the emotional aspects of their connection to Singapore.<br><br>'Career opportunities and economic growth can draw someone anywhere. But what's going to bring me back here is the feeling that this is home and that family and friends are here,' the aeronautical engineering undergraduate said.<br><br>Echoing the sentiments, Dr Ng said: 'Home is what you feel; not what I say.'<br><br>He noted that of the 150,000 Singaporeans living, working and studying abroad, 40 per cent are in their 20s.<br><br>These young, bright Singaporeans are highly mobile, versatile and adaptable - and in demand among top companies worldwide.<br><br>The Government was creating more platforms for those abroad to keep in touch with home.<br><br>Among these is a revamped website for Contact Singapore, a network set up by the Manpower Ministry to highlight job opportunities here.<br><br>The issue of attracting Singaporeans back was one of several during the hour-long dialogue. Participants also expressed their views on matters such as foreign policy and political apathy.<br><br>Dr Ng said he found the exchange stimulating: 'Even though they have been away for some time, they are still very much interested in what Singapore is.'<br><br>Additional reporting by Cassandra Chew<br><br>Zakir Hussain, zakirh@sph.com.sg  - Sun, Jul 22, 2007,The Straits Times<br>________<br><br>Laughable!

The worst is they either don't see this as their root of problems or if they know they may just ignore so that life goes on and they can continue to do whatever that meet their needs, wants and fancies, without having to let the conscience prick them.    Politicans who are not willing to put aside the self to serve the nation wholeheartedly will hardly or will not win the trust and respect of the people.<br><br>Dr Ng is better off going back to hospital to be surgeon.  So far as a Manpower minister what has he done to help the locals?  Instead of helping the locals, he is allowing more and more of foreigners here to work without setting quota.   Who suffer, local people!   He is more for foreigners!  So don't think we need him as our manpower minister.   Those overseas are not ignorant or idiots, they are very aware of what is going on in Singapore that is why many after their study refuse to come back for good.  They are smart and will not be taken in by what Dr ng said in his article.  So he can jolly well give up his hope to get these people back for good.</div>

After all, I don't see London, Geneva or New York any less stressful than Singapore, but these cosmopolitan cities still draw the best brains by the thousands, if not millions.<br><br>If you're ambitious and driven, you would naturally want to compete with the best in the world - and in the process, you expect to be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">remunerated on terms befitting the world's best</span></span></strong>, not some elites of a third-world regime.</div>
