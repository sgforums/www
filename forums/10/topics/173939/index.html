            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Japan is considering a law revision to allow the US military to use it's ports ans airports if an emergency occurs in the Taiwan Straits ans areas near Japan.<br><br>A draft amendement of 1999 law on Japan-US military cooperation is expected to submitted to Parliment by year-end, the Yomiuri Shimbun cited sourcecs as saying.<br><br>If passed, the amended law will oblige Japan Govt to allow US forces to use those facilities<br><br>US has said its Military could need to use every commercial airport in Kyushu should crisis occur in the Taiwan Straits.</blockquote>What do you guys think ?<br><br>Won't this make Japan a legitimate military target and a blocking ship ? I mean US do have a history of aggression, and the law do encourage Taiwan to go independent.<br><br>This law will see Japan going to war in the very near future, no escaping since it's the law. The Japanese will have no choice but to sign up for military service, since chances of attacks are almost definate.<br><br>Is the Japanese PM selling out Japan ? With this law, Japan will be involved in every military expeditions of the US in the region. US would need to station less soldiers and take command of the Japs troops. Eventually, it's Asian VS Asian, and US watching CNN and Fox news for the latest death tolls and Japans fighting for Freedom and Democracy propagandas.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>US as always, will make sure their soliders are stationed in every corner of the world to ensure the outreach of their holy American ideals. They never get tired of meddling with other countries affairs in the name of justice, although their real motive remails hidden. They just screw up one thing after another. Ambitious Japan seems willing to join the madness and by default agrees to every move US makes. I have no regard for these two countires. Hell with them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MobyDog:</div><div class="quote_body">No, no the ship.

But by allowing commercial entity to be use, means that the US would be able to flood troops thru out Japan. So, no longer just those bases are military targets.<br><br>In  the Korean and Vietnam War, Japan was ultilise as a stagging and R&amp;R bases for US. But those are third world countries. Conflict in the Japan areas are Russia and China, They will be stupid if they don't consider Japan as an important legitimate target. These are countries with balistic and cruise missles, and large airforces. They are not Iraq. Many people were questioning why Saddam didn't attack the coalition forces first, than to wait for them to be large and ready. China and Russia will not allow that to fester. If they attack Japan, US will have an instant determined Ally.<br><br>When attacked. Will the avg Japanese blame the attacking countries or US &amp; their own government for baiting it. By then, will that change anything ?<br><br>In other words, it is as good as drafting another Taiwan Relation act extension to US - japanese version. US involvment equals japanese participation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup it has the potential to drag japan into the war.<br><br>Events may follow as:China initiate aggressive movement at taiwan.<br>US come in to help taiwan<br>US uses Japan bases to send out military help<br>China see Japan bases as the source for US help<br>China attack such Japan bases to block out US support<br>Japan will be able to draw upon its legistrate that it is a<br>def force and be able to expand its military to deal with<br>such china attacks.<br>Vicious cycle carry on,japan attack china in the<br>name of defence,vice versa.<br>If china cannot make it,may drag in fellow communist<br>north korea to help.So it get bigger and bigger.<br><br>wonder why japan will want to help US in this cross straits affairs that is non of their biz,japan will only end up suffering if she is dragged into the war.</div>
