            <div class='col-md body'>Insight: Down South<br>By SEAH CHIANG NEE<br><br>Middle class Singaporeans are giving the government the thumbs down despite Minister Mentor Lee Kuan YewÂ’s prediction of a golden era in the coming years.<br><br>A SUCCESSION of unpopular policies Â– incredibly ill-timed, if not ill-planned Â– has reduced the governmentÂ’s public popularity to the lowest level in many years.<br><br>It is ironic because the economy and the job market are on a roll, which should have resulted in a high level of optimism and improved feelings for the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party.<br><br>Instead the opposite is happening.<br><br>The sentiments among middle class Singaporeans have reached one of their lowest points despite Minister Mentor Lee Kuan YewÂ’s prediction of a Â“golden eraÂ” in the coming years.<br><br>Four recent factors have caused the plunge in public unhappiness.<br><br>(1) CabinetÂ’s 21% pay rise<br><br>The decision to raise the salaries of Cabinet ministers, already by far the highest in the world, by a whopping 21%, could not have come at a more painful time for Singaporeans who are struggling with widespread price increases.<br><br>(2) GST increases<br><br>The July increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 5% to 7%, led to an orgy of price increases covering most goods and services in Singapore.<br><br>The current inflation, the worst in 12 years, is partly imported but is blamed on the government because it has been increasing public fees, ranging from healthcare to stamps.<br><br>(3) Abandoned annuities scheme<br><br>After a public backlash, the government had to redraw a plan that would have Singaporeans put a part of their CPF (Central Provident Fund) into an annuities scheme that will pay S$250-S$300 (RM575-RM690) a month until death Â– or when they reach 85.<br><br>It was hugely unpopular because of the late drawdown (only 60,000 Singaporeans live that long) and, if the holder dies before 85, the unused money goes to others in the pool, not to his estate.<br><br>It was arguably one of the worst ideas from the PAP government and was abandoned. A new scheme is being considered to replace it.<br><br>(4) Shortage, over-crowdedness.<br><br>The gathering foreign influx (which has pushed the population to 4.68 million) is beginning to cause resentment Â– mostly against the government Â– as well as over-crowding and some shortages.<br><br>Singaporeans are likely to continue to have to bear and grin it since, like inflation, it is likely to continue into future years.<br><br>Shaping into the hottest topic is, however, the Cabinet pay rise Â– the second in two years Â– which would have brought down a government in most other countries.<br><br>It raised the Prime Minister Lee Hsien LoongÂ’s annual salary to S$3.76mil (RM8.64mil) and President S.R. NathanÂ’s to S$3.87mil (RM8.89mil), while Cabinet ministers start at $1.96mil (RM4.50mil) a year.<br><br>(By comparison, US President George W Bush earns an annual salary of US$400,000 (RM1.3mil) or one-seventh of what Lee gets).<br><br>Despite their compliant nature, Singaporeans have reacted angrily to the way their leaders pay themselves, feelings that I have not encountered in 25 yearsÂ’ of reporting Singapore.<br><br>Even PAP supporters are wondering why their political leaders have embarked on such an obviously politically dangerous course.<br><br>Â“The question is why? Why would people, very smart and talented people, with all the money in the world to spend, money they are not likely to finish spending in their whole life, still crave for more money?Â” a blogger asked.<br><br>Another said: Â“Actually if they can justify it well, I wouldnÂ’t mind them getting more pay, but where is the justification? Many people here earn in a month less than what a minister gets in just half a day.Â”<br><br>The year-end vibrancy of the top leaders who are benefiting from the windfall, contrasts sharply with a despondent mood among the poorer heartlanders badly hit by rising prices.<br><br>More people have been asking their members of Parliament for help. Reports of rising poverty have prompted one minister to say: Â“In Singapore, no one needs to starve.Â”<br><br>For months Singaporeans have felt pressured by the growing impact of the increasing number of foreigners here, including over-crowding and shortages, not to mention a reduction of opportunities.<br><br>For the government, this souring of the electorateÂ’s mood is worrying because it is over major bread-and-butter matters Â– prices, retirement savings, jobs Â– which can erode its power base.<br><br>One of SingaporeÂ’s most admired writers, Catherine Lim, has added her voice to the public criticism on the way Singapore is heading.<br><br>A climate of fear that stops citizens from speaking out against the government could eventually lead to the decline of Singapore, she said.<br><br>Lim praised the government for its economic achievements but said its AchillesÂ’ heel could be its suppression of criticism, using defamation suits against opposition politicians as well as bans on protests.<br><br>Â“A compliant, fearful population that has never learnt to be politically savvy could spell the doom of Singapore,Â” Lim told Reuters in an interview.<br><br>The 65-year-old Malaysian-born author said the worst-case scenario would be for a future leader to get away with corruption Â“because of the ingrained, unquestioning trust of a fearful, overly dependent peopleÂ”.<br><br>Lim said: Â“You could have a case of younger Singaporeans creating unrest because they do not have an outlet.<br><br>Â“What Singapore wants is managed creativity. So, not only would those really creative people not want to come, but those who are here want to get out.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love this country simply for being born here and having spent my childhood here.Nothing like growing up in the HDB block estates of Queenstown,playing soccer under void decks,getting people pissed and growing up. No matter where you go in the world,a part of Singapore would always be there with you no matter how you much you hate it/dislike it/dislike it abit or something.<br><br>So much for that.I really really feel that LKY has done a tremendous job into transforming this country from what it was in the 60s.Upon independence from Malaysia and since PAP was into power with Singapore being independent,since 1966 if im not wrong.Since then,look at how far Singapore has come into becoming a modernized nation with great modern infrastructure.Not only that,the law is 'fair' as well,no bribery and stuff. Gotta say PAP and LKY did a good job there.<br><br>But now i understand the feelings of the people when they are not pleased with what is happening at the moment and i feel the same as them.GST rise to 7% is a mistake really.I really don't know what would be the GST by 2010? Its something to be alarmed about for sure.Fuel prices are rocket high,cigarettes and stuff ( i don't know if theres smth to do with GST ).Basic daily necessities are something we all need and 7% is really too much.I really disapprove of it.<br><br>I can't but support the Worker's Party for its manifesto that stated that GST should be waived off for basic necessities and that is called caring for the people because simply daily necessities like rice,salt etc is what we need for daily lives and everyone needs food,the rich and the poor and everyone.Thats my point.<br><br>Not forgetting that they suggested having a scheme to allow Singaporeans who are in bad states to be able to withdraw from their CPF.<br><br>One final thing about WP.I think it was them who challenged HDB to prove to them why a 5-room HDB costs as much as it does today and they said that they had checked and including land prices and everything,the max cost should be $80,000. This came out in the 'Today' paper during the elections and that is concern for the people because right now,Singaporeans are paying ridiculous money for public housing.<br><br>PAP has tried to put all those out of the way who have stood up against them.JB Jeya and Chee Soon Juan being the more famous ones.<br><br>My point is,the PAP did a good job in bringing Singapore to a high level but now,something really needs to be done to stop whatever they are doing and reduce the costs which in my opinion is the most important thing affecting Singaporeans today.After all,im sure nobody wants Singapore's cost of living to be as high as Geneva. Well thats my opinion,hope i didn't offend anyone.</div>
