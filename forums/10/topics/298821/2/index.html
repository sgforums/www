            <div class='col-md body'>Its a Sad Christmas.<br><br>I don't remember one like this before.  One that I had such a tight budget spending on gifts, and going out for dinners.  Money just disappears so fast.<br><br>And yes, I am one of those seriously displeased over the policies that were put into place.  21% Increment for Cabinet Ministers, while every average Singaporean has to struggle against current inflation levels.  Honestly, who can tell me what the real inflation rate is now?<br><br>7% Goods and Services Tax, and when I dine out, i still get charged another 10% service charge.<br><br>Price increase for ERP gantries.  Supposedly to solve the jams on expressways.  A problem created when they drastically DROPPED the COE prices that sent everyone into an automobile buying spree.<br><br>And for crying out loud, LEAVE our CPF alone.<br><br>Already we are paying 20% income tax, 7% GST, and another 20% CPF.  The percentage of income we are giving up is almost the same as countries like Sweden, where all Social And Welfare benefits are borne by the Government.    I'm not saying we need to be like them, but just cut the people some slack!  More welfare benefits for the old and needy please!<br><br>Its shameful to see 50-70 year olds manning the counter at Macdonalds for $4 measly bucks an hour at their age.  THey are supposed to be enjoying their Golden years, not slogging away at fast food restaurants.  Let the pimply 14-18 year olds do that!<br><br>Its beyond shameful, its heartbreaking to see a 90 year old woman, walk the streets at 2am in the morning, prowling the streets just to find aluminium cans, cardboard boxes, cutting them up just to sell them for a few dollars.<br><br>We appreciate all the Economic policies thats been devised and implemented thus far.  We couldn't have made it this far without them.  But please, rethink the non-economic policies.  A little more welfare for those who really need them won't hurt.  The Government has to look after its people, not the other way round.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really love Singapore, I really do being a Singaporean. The sad thing, the country is really going into a state of decline.<br><br>I remember the times when people used to hang flags during National Day because they wanted to, because they just have to show love for their country. Now, it is hard to even find people hanging flags out of their window, even with the campaigns that encourage them to do so.<br><br>It has come to such a sad state that the town councils have to employ Bangladeshi workers to hang the Singapore flags for them along the corridor. I remember how my grandparents used to tell me how much they appreciated the government for raising their living standards, now, I hardly hear sincere phrases praising the government from anyone, including the older generations.<br><br>I really feel sad about the situation now. In schools, a whopping 45% of Singaporean students said they plan to leave the country in a survey I conducted.<br><br>The problem? Singaporeans simply don't feel that this is their home anymore. They are not getting any incentives by living here. Themselves, the foreigners and rich seems to be the government's focus when implementing policies. The tax-payers are left out in the midst of this so-called progress. I really am afraid that this country may just one day break down and fall into a state of disarray. The golden age is coming to an end. History has shown that city-states never last...</div>
