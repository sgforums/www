              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The state owned and controlled news media
                                  of Singapore, Channel News Asia of February 1st 2008, carries and
                                  article "MM Lee says Singapore must find fourth generation of leaders
                                  soon".<br><br>He says it is necessary to discover such leaders before
                                  the next general elections, and if not, Singapore will be in deep
                                  trouble. We know Singapore is a strange place with some strange laws,
                                  but this one beats them all. I mean a government going out looking for
                                  political leaders!<br><br>I have never heard of any incumbent
                                  government which has to go searching for leaders! Should not leaders
                                  have identified themselves yet, if indeed they are leaders? Does not
                                  the definition of the word “leader” mean that they have shown their
                                  ability to lead? And what sort of a leader is someone who is not
                                  prepared to even show himself! Certainly not a leader. And if Lee Kuan
                                  Yew has to go out now, with a deliberate plan to search for them; when
                                  they themselves are afraid to even show themselves; what sort of
                                  leaders are they anyway?<br><br>Should not someone tell Mr. Lee Kuan
                                  Yew that political leaders have got to at least identify themselves?
                                  They have to have shown political leadership. People have to know who
                                  they are. They should by now have got the support of the people.
                                  Without public support, no one can be a political leader.<br><br>Should
                                  not someone tell Mr. Lee that things are not done the way he wants? He
                                  cannot just go around the country and choose a few educated people,
                                  anoint them leaders, and order the population to obey them forthwith.
                                  It is not the same as employing a CEO of a company. Singapore is not a
                                  company, it is a country. People don’t just work in Singapore, they
                                  live there. The bottom line is not just increasing profits, it is the
                                  betterment of life; which means better social conditions, economic
                                  conditions, better education, a more thinking people, in other words
                                  being able to live as complete human beings. Countries require leaders,
                                  not managing directors which Lee is trying to find.<br><br>He talks of
                                  optimum size of Singapore. What does he know of optimum size? Should it
                                  not be the people to decide their population? His arrogance never
                                  changes. It is him deciding everything including the size of the
                                  Singapore population, and it is this arrogance of "I know best"
                                  attitude which is ruining Singapore.<br><br>He then talks about talent
                                  pool being scarce in the globalized world. And for once, he admits that
                                  even his grandchildren will probably decide to leave Singapore to live
                                  elsewhere; admitting there is huge suction pump like situation, which
                                  continues to make Singapore’s able and capable leave Singapore as quick
                                  as possible. He admits for once that capable Singaporeans are leaving
                                  Singaporeans in alarming numbers and those already abroad are refusing
                                  to return.<br><br>He was wrong in his belief that capable Singaporeans
                                  are attracted to foreign countries by big financial institutions and
                                  legal institutions. No this is not true. They leave Singapore because
                                  of the appalling state of the political situation. Where there is no
                                  human rights. Where you cannot live as free men and women. Where one
                                  man, Lee Kuan Yew is constantly talking and giving his unsolicited
                                  opinions where no one cares. And why should anyone care when it is only
                                  he and a handpicked few that have the right to decide all aspects of
                                  people’s lives?<br><br>No, the educated leave Singapore because they
                                  have passed the stage where only bread and butter mattered. They are
                                  not prepared to live their lives in absolute silence and obedience to
                                  one man. If it is God, it is understandable, but Lee Kuan Yew is not
                                  God and total obedience is unnecessary. And since Lee demands total
                                  obedience, they leave for places where Lee no longer can preach to them.<br><br>At
                                  at the rate Lee Kuan Yew is going on, he will only have the dumb
                                  illiterate old women to preach to. All the others would have gone to
                                  Australia by then unless Lee Kuan Yew wakes up and realizes that he
                                  himself is the reason for this impossible brain drain. It is not
                                  because of superior financial and legal institutions in Australia.<br><br>Lee
                                  Kuan Yew has made many speeches on this subject of brain drain;
                                  educated capable Singaporeans leaving Singapore’s shores, never to
                                  return. But no other country appears to have the problem that Singapore
                                  has. Australia is a net recipient of immigrants, that is, an
                                  overwhelming numbers of foreigners want to come to Australia.
                                  Australians themselves have no desire to leave their country. Why is
                                  that?<br><br>New Zealand is a net recipient of immigrants. An
                                  overwhelming number of people the world over want to live in New
                                  Zealand. But New Zealanders themselves stay in New Zealand. Some may
                                  work in Australia for some time, because of the special political
                                  relationship between New Zealand and Australia, which in many ways is
                                  almost one country. But they remain New Zealanders and proud to remain
                                  so.<br><br>The same situation in European countries and Canada and
                                  South Africa. Others want to go to live in these countries. Their local
                                  populations do not leave; like in Singapore.<br><br>Now let me tell you
                                  the real trouble that Singapore is in with their skilled population.
                                  Between 1999 and 2007, the number of lawyers in Singapore only
                                  increased by 400. For a business center like Singapore, at present, it
                                  only has 3,400 practicing lawyers. And as we speak more and more are
                                  leaving the profession and despite various carrots and enticements, the
                                  lawyers are not taking the bait.<br><br>In order to stem the high rate
                                  of resignations from the Singapore Civil Service and with diminishing
                                  numbers of new applicants, the government in their desperation had no
                                  choice but to increase their wages; hoping more money will make them
                                  stay. Sorry to say, it did not work. Despite increased salaries and
                                  wages, ever increasing numbers are leaving the civil service.<br><br>The
                                  same sad story with all the other government services. Lee Kuan Yew is
                                  finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain able capable
                                  and dedicated people in government positions or the professions.<br><br>The
                                  reason for this almost universal dislike and disinterest with Lee Kuan
                                  Yew and his Singapore, is not because of money. After all pay scales
                                  are good. Much better than any of the neighboring Asian countries and
                                  in many instances even better than Australia or New Zealand. No, it is
                                  not the money. It is Lee himself.<br><br>For educated capable people,
                                  it has almost become a disgrace to be called Singaporean. A country
                                  which beats his criminals with a cane for offenses, where you do not
                                  have any of the basic fundamental rights which a free people naturally
                                  enjoy, and the pain of having to listen to Lee Kun Yew day in and day
                                  out, claiming that only he has a cerebral capacity and others have no
                                  capacity at all; zero.<br><br>Well big boy, you can have the stage to
                                  yourself. Very soon, you will have no audience left. And you may find
                                  yourself speaking to yourself, ad nasium.<br><br>And now my advice to
                                  Lee Kuan Yew. At the moment there are no leaders in Singapore except
                                  for a handful. Dr. Chee Soon Juan, JB Jeyaretnam, Gandhi Ambalam, Chee
                                  Siok Chin and John Tan are leaders. Leaders because they inspire
                                  others; because of the sacrifices they have to make in standing up to
                                  you; and the courageous manner in which they remain undeterred despite
                                  your daily punishment. They have remained undaunted standing their
                                  ground in spite of the relentless persecution they suffer. These are
                                  leaders. Not the sort like Jeffrey Palmer or Hri Kumar SC who will do
                                  whatever you want as and when you demand it. Hri Kumar is not a leader.
                                  He is a poodle. And you cannot expect educated Singaporeans to listen
                                  to him, even if you wanted them to.<br><br>Let me tell you this Mr.
                                  Lee. Leaders have to voluntarily come out and lead. People do not
                                  miraculously turn into leaders just because you want them to.
                                  Leadership does not come about that way. You should stop your
                                  leadership search because you are wasting your time.<br><br>If you want
                                  the educated to stay, keep your mouth shut for once. Let Dr. Chee Soon
                                  Juan have his say. Stop your defamation actions. Stop abusing the law.
                                  Stop restricting the press. Allow free speech and expression. Realize
                                  for once that others are not as stupid as you think. Listen to the
                                  people. Allow democracy. This way you will stop the brain drain
                                  overnight; but you cannot do this. If you did what I ask, you will no
                                  longer be Minister Mentor. You will perhaps be in the dock in the High
                                  Court facing corruption charges.<br><br>And lastly let me tell you one
                                  more reason, even if minimal, for the exodus out of Singapore by the
                                  educated. It is this blog that I write, Singapore Dissident. It is
                                  being read throughout the island. I am constantly reminding
                                  Singaporeans about the pathetic lives they lead under your
                                  dictatorship. I keep saying they should either stay and fight, or
                                  leave. And it is effective in both these ways. Many Singaporeans have
                                  bravely come out in the open showing their opposition to your
                                  dictatorship. Such a phenomenon could never have been even imagined in
                                  the past. At the same time many have chosen the path to leave.<br><br>Lee
                                  Kuan Yew should realize that the situation is now hopeless for his
                                  government. It is getting worse by the day. There is still time to
                                  salvage the wreck by his government speaking to Dr. Chee and other real
