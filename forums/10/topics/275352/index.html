            <div class='col-md body'>That there is a certain systematic mass indoctrination or mental conditioning of the masses by the state-controlled newspapers is probably not happening by coincidence or chance.<br><br>Perhaps some insiders could tell us whether the newspapers were being used for such purposes and why were the leaders putting so many of their trusted confidantes to be CEO and executive chairman of newspapers.<br><br>Some years ago in the hey day of communism, our leaders have been talking many times about the power of repetition or iteration with constant admonition that if something is utter long enough they will be believed and become the truths.<br><br>In other words, we the citizens have elected our leaders to practise some kind of occult over us citizens who may be using them to convert people to accept their harsh policies. No wonder the leaders never seem to relent on their wrongful policies which drive up the costs of living because these policies were being pushed through with such occult. No wonder they did not seem to mind unpopular and wrong policies to keep increasing their own rewards and pays using propaganda to convert us the citizens to accept them finally even though they may not serve the people's ultimate interest.<br><br>From perpetually increasing costs of living to rewarding themselves with highest salaries and taxing people to the hilt to build state surpluses, who are we citizens to complain but to resign to the fact that we are being treated like some guinea pigs of mental conditioning by repetition by the state-controlled newspapers.<br><br>No wonder we the citizens seem ever so naive as to accept anything no matter how hurtful to our own wellbeing or living as we are all guinea pigs to have to endure all these dehumanizing of degrading.<br><br>It is time to ask some serious questions of the leaders. Are we humans and should we continue to be subjected to unjust indoctrination, occult or black magics ready to ensnare or warp our minds and mould them to suit their own desires.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it any coincidence repressive regimes devoid of press freedom churn out masses who are disproportionately more ignorant of going-ons around the world beyond their respective self-proclaimed paradises?<br><br>If you need any evidence, just speak to an average Joe in Finland, Singapore and Vietnam to get a grip of how vastly different their respective mindsets are.<br><br>That said, isn't the lack of press freedom - which basically deprives a fundamental human right to be informed and by extension, limiting the rights of the individuals - an integral part of most despotic regimes whose grip on power depends very much on stringing an ignorant and compliant citizenry along?<br><br>Perhaps, as some would put it, it's no exaggeration to suggest specious diatribes in the form of propaganda are more obscene than the most explicit pornography known to man. At least, man, for most parts, willingly indulge in the latter with an informed mind of what to expect, unlike the pack of lies and polemics masked by the smokescreen of more nonchalant causes in the case of the former.</div>

The point is not just about democracy but accountability, of which we have little of the latter. The trouble with the current situation is that because our democracy is so tailored to the ruling party's designs, that there is no avenue to voice our concerns, demand information, and accountability. In a normal democracy, such avenues exists but they don't in Singapore.</div>
