Besides, you may as well wave the white flag - it's the one war skill you guys are world leaders in anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Go on and write it off by calling me prejudiced - I've stated facts here (and there's plenty more where that came from), but just whitewash it - I've heard it all before anyway.  You've got no history of being profit-driven?  Why don't we ask the Israelis about that one?  I'm sure they've got plenty to tell.  Besides, if you guys are so saintly, why are you operating a mercenary army?<br><br>Look, like you said yourself, the French are a law upon themselves.  Fine, that's for you guys to sort out.  However, when you start trying to have your cake (pardon the Marie Antoinette pun) and eat it by prancing like show ponies on the world stage, that tears it.  Besides, if, as you claim, your people opposed the nuclear tests and your government went ahead anyway, it's time to get your own problems sorted out - so much for the birthplace of democracy, eh?<br><br>Now I'm done with YOU.</div>

The migration process usually requires that applicants be able to demonstrate their ability to support themselves, either by gaining employment or by setting up viable businesses (their previous business track record is also taken into consideration).  In countries where there is social support, this is done so that they don't end up taking in migrants who will be a drain on the welfare system.

            <div class='col-md body'>No, I think it's a matter of political philosophy.  Somewhere along the way, I think the Singaporean government has forgotten that it is supposed to serve the people, not the other way round.  If they had their heads screwed on straight, they wouldn't be telling to population to "grow up".  They also wouldn't be saying "You pay peanuts, you get monkeys" on one hand to justify their own salaries, and then expecting people to work harder with wage cuts on the other.  It seems that they've gotten it into their minds that they're this country's new royalty and so can do or say anything without accountability to the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I've said before, does the ruling party belong to Singapore or does Singapore belong to the ruling party.<br><br>If historical facts are any indication, I'm sure we all know what the answer is.<br><br>My beef with the system of Singapore. They push us hard, claiming that we need to be pushed hard in order to survive as we have no natural resources like redland where they can slack, I have no issue with that reality, Singapore's survival is in her people.<br><br>However the catch is this, after struggling so hard and shedding so much blood for the country, and in some cases, our lives (in NS "attrition") what does the ordinary folk get in return? Higher costs of livings, more policies to burdern then, an obvious lack of general rights and freedoms as an individual. Apparently our personal lives are nothing more then that wasteful time when we are not feeding the system with the bioelectric energy from our bodies and should be kept to the minimum.<br><br>Though I hate to quote him, John Rambo got it pretty well in Rambo II, many Singaporeans feel that their country does not love them as much as they have loved and bled for it.<br><br>In the end, is it any surprise that some wonder why some decide to leave? Why then, what is the point of living in Singapore when the theory of self-actualization can be better achieved elsewhere? What on earth are we doing here other then just being drones who are expected to serve a virtuality reality to keep it running for the good of a few who are more equal?<br><br>Really, what's in it for Singaporean to stay here? Those who do stay here certainly do not do so with the reason that they think the system is a condusive one, but due to reasons of more cynical praticality that the party never talks about, to them, most of the folk are happy with them and support them on whatever they may pass off the bat.</div>
