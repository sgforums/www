We want to leave and are actively making plans to, if we haven't left already.<br><br>Another group are the polar opposites of the first group. They believe in the system, and that life here is a good as it's going to get. They are happy living in their overpriced pigeon holes and driving their overpriced sets of wheels. They agree with a system where theres no sympathy and think those who fall by the wayside had it coming. Conformity is king with this group<br><br>And yet another are as disgusted as the first group, but due to various reasons (age, qualifications), they cannot leave.<br><br>The final group applies to quite a lot of people, at least those I've spoken to. They don't entirely agree with the system, but have been cowed by the propaganda into thinking that there is no better alternaitve, that they will head out into the great unknown where racism and crime are waiting . Hence they stick with the devil they know, rather than take a chance of finding a better life.<br><br>There is some generalisation involved in the above analysis, and some do not fit into the mould.<br><br>Gedanken, no worries, but I think I've just done what you should be doing with the above post!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, seems there are four distinct groups as said by viper<br><br>But for me,my dad knew no matter what, me and my siblings may not be able to make it in Malaysia, thats why he brought us over here. My aunt also moved over, same goes for my cousin who chose to to study in NTU, instead of Malaysian universities, and eventually setting here married.<br><br>Now, not comparing the differences between sg, malaysia and other countries, (well the debate is endless), the point is, people do strive for better life, whether its pursuing their passion, increasing  income of their family, escape from oppression, bringing their family into safer countries etc etc, people from time immemorable has always try to improve their life.<br><br>Jewish Exodus from Egypt, Singapore pioneers came from their homeland to settle here, Former East Germans flooding West Germans cities to look for jobs. They looked for better life, and why not?<br><br>People leaving sg to pursue dreams (like HENG@), my family left Malaysia for better living conditions in sg, Japanese retiring in Malaysia, its an endless cycle of migrations, crisscrossing the world.<br><br>Well, my personal view is this. Like I used to tell my friends, I dont care what your definitions of better life is (it can be anything), what you think of your present environment (you can KBKB about it the kopitiam), are you doing anything to improve your present conditions?<br><br>Definitons of better life? Up to you. You think sg is not good enough for you to study history deeply, and wish to further studies and build a career in this maybe lets say in merry old England, go ahead. Others may boo you, but I say I admire you for having the gumption to chase your dreams. I dont care if it turn up to be a failure, at least you want to, and you tried. Thats the most admirable thing a person can do.<br><br>Yes, people do condemn sg. gahmen. Urm for a start, I say the view are relative depending on your perspective, and even this perspective is relative too. Let assume all facts to be true, and people start to argue about the lousy environment here and how other countries are better, and many people join in the fracas. Whatever view people hold, I respect that decision. Its his perspective of that matter. He can choose to stay in sg and support the gahmen, I dont care. Let say its true sg gahmen is absurd in its thinking and actions, is he doing anything to prevent himself from the negative effects or reducing damages from the policies of the gahmen? Is he able to pursue his dreams here? If he says he gonna get a BMW by sticking to his job, which pays him $2000 per month, and harp on the quality of life in sg or COE is nothing to be worried about, can pay by installment etc etc, I probably will knock him on the head.<br><br>It shows this guy has not waken up to the reality of the society, not just sg society. On the other hand, if he says, the sg society and the gahmen suxx, is he gonna KBKB all day and not doing anything about it. Some genuinely do not have the capabilities to leave ,such as financial problems. Understandable. But many who KBKB chose to be ever-grumpy about it.<br><br>I always tell my friends who are now studying in the career sense, many who are thrown into the paper chase. Do something that will help them in their career. There are virtually degree holders everywhere. Can they do something to add value to their degree, like picking up additional skills during holidays, doing industrial attachment for the experience as well for the 'beautiful resume', doing investment, doing business etc etc. Unfortunately, this has met with blank stares. Typical Singaporeans mindset.<br><br>All in all, I do support people who wish to go overseas to better their life. All this nonsense about quitter and stayer irks me. Like most of the forumnites here, I do agree the gahmen is getting more and more absurd in their thinking. Soon the Prime Ministership is to be passed to DPM Lee (3rd Generation), but the whole gahmen is still having the midset of LKY era, especially with regard to the approach of setting policies. I mentioned this in other thread way before, they already have this 'irksome scholarly' approach to doing things. Now it is 'I am more logical in this aspect, trust me' attitude, will it become 'I am perfect, you must follow me'.?<br><br>In conclusion, like what viper said about four groups of people, true sg sucks, but there are way out. Not just way out of the country, but doing something more worth while than sitting down there sucking thumb.<br><br>Just my dua sen.<br><br>PS: I am already a SIngapore citizen and served NS. So me no Harimau, hehe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow... 5 pages.. i've tried reading thru everyone's post and am having a headache trying to grasp the different views presented. my command of the english language is not as powerful as most who have posted thus i shall just post my thoughts, simple as they are. sorry if it is repeat eh?<br><br>talents? humm... wat is defined as talents? scholars? high IQ? duh, i don't know.<br><br>wat i know is that those who leave have <strong>guts</strong>. it takes guts to move out of your comfort zone, it takes guts to pursue your own dreams, it takes guts to even voice out some of the views here. bear in mind most of those who venture out are often without much of a support group (example, being severly ill, alone, no mum to take care of you).  they have to adjust to a different culture, different system, built friendships from scratch, racism, etc. not everyone survives overseas, many got no choice but to return to singapore. it ain't as sweet and easy as some think it is.<br><br>i'm a simple person with simple requests in life. I used to be a "yes sir, no sir, pls tell me what u want me to do sir" kind of person. i wasn't a problem child (sleeping and talking in class ain't that biggie a problem ya?), listened to my parents for the smallest thing, agreed our ruling party did do a manificent, though not perfect job (no one's perfect), wanted to just work, get my HDB, bred and die.<br><br>for the first time in my life when i decided to chase my dream, i was shown the door in singapore. all i wanted was a university education - not distance learning, not part-time. i wanted the full experience of a uni student. couldn't get into ntu and nus cos my results are not good enough for them. however, overseas unis opened their doors to me and i grabbed the chance. go on and argue about "overseas uni wanna earn your money, degree not so good, etc", and i will tell you one thing : THEY gave me the chance.<br><br>in a strange way, i got to thank the "system" for opening my eyes. without the "system", i would have not thought of moving out of comfy singapore, would not have experience the ups and downs of being an alien in another country, would not have opened my mind. I thank the system for pushing me into the happiest years of my young life.<br><br>from my tiny view of the world, i know there are pros and cons to everything. in singapore, i got my food and comfort paradise.

Everyone knows why we leave, i don't know why this questions is discussed to the point of ad nauseum.<br><br>Singapore will always be constricted by land, or lack there of. There is only so much crap you can dump into the ocean. There will never be enough tiertiary places to meet demand. Once the 'future leaders' of singapore leave the country for like 3 years for Uni, they adapt to the lifestyle and most of them wouldn't want to come back. Remember about 8 years ago when the government decided there were too many doctors?!!? They cutback the number of students that NUS would take?? What's going to be next, there will be too many business students?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Quitters leave Singapore??</strong><br><br>All of us from Singapore have great great great grand parents, in my case, grandmother who migrated from the Indian continent, China, Europe and wherever else.<br><br>They left their home country to pursure better opportunities in Singapore. Are you calling your ancestors quitters? Isn't it the same argument? They gave up the 'hard life' in their home country to come to a place like Singapore and earn their keeps. A lot of them wanted to return to their home countries. Like the students in Asia, UK or States. But as time goes on, they decided that living in Singapore isn't that bad. Just like my counterparts over here. They settle down in their new country and have families.<br><br>So if you're calling us Quitters, you are yourself born from quitters consequently, we are all 'quitters' in Singapore.<br><br>Australians leave to migrate to UK, the Europeans migrate over here. I used to work with a French boss in the cafe. It is normal behaviour and one of those things that we just have to accept.</div>
