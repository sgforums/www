I would come back and put on my Number 4 even when I sold everything I owned in Singapore and moved abroad. Yes, it is about Pride and most of all it is about an unexplainable emotional attachment to my identity.<br><br>But to me, it is both patronizing and low the way our govt goes about ensuring that we stay and fight. That is what I am very disagreeable with because they made a wrong conculsion about me (I cannot say for the rest) and try to dangle a bone in my face. Well come to think about it, they never made a right conclusion of me between the day I was born in Spore to the day I left.</div></blockquote>Its a typical narrow-minded, money and material oriented way of thinking that once again, shows how those at the helm have been blinded by the $-sign, and even worse, conclude that everyone in Singapore are similarly blinded.<br><br>I will fight to preserve Singapore's independence and sovereignity should, I will however not fight to preserve the current system.</div>

So, Tang Liang How, even if he is what they say he is - a Chinese chauv---(cant spell the damn word), he will not gain too much mileage anyway.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Relax la, still think we are trishaw cyclist in the 70s ah?</span></div></blockquote>And in that last statement, Xprobe has picked out the crux of what is wrong with how those in charge view the Chinese culture and its embodiment in people like TLH. It is another area which they simply refuse to accept that Singapore and Singaporeans have moved on, and their thinking still harks back to that of the 1960s and 1970s, and presume everyone in Singapore thinks like they do.<br><br>Certain people at the top have this misconception (or fear) about people who call for a greater understanding for the Chinese language and culture. Theses advocates are immediately denounced as chuvanists (not sure I got it correct either  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) who favour communalism out to destroy Singapore (in fact anyone who disagrees with their views are "out to destroy Singapore" - see "SIA pilots" ). If one were to cast an objective eye on TLH's speeches and opinions (rather than letting the unbiased local press filter them), one would realise that he was merely calling for Chinese Singaporeans to understand more their own cultural roots (not advocating a return to the PRC or turning Singapore into a Chinese enclave). As for why theres this irrational fear by those at the top of such views, I believe Atobe would have greater insight into this than me.<br><br>Like Gedanken said, another victim of the PAP smear!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Urm, just my two cents please dont flame me<br><br>I read the whole thread before I post this, and before those posts I posted before, I didnt actually do the reading up.<br><br>While most of the opinions are against the present gahmen, nismo132 comes in to present his own perspective. Then some of us starts to flame, so as to speak. We call him 'utter fool' and and tell him to grow up. But he havent even make one personal remarks against any one of us yet.<br><br>It reminds me of the Bear's story, where his six teachers told him not be idealistic fool. The common agreement among the teachers is that one must conform, and our Bear is out of the box. We are doing what the teachers had done. While we do agree, and some of us feels strongly about this, we pushes nismo aside because of what he said. How to differentiate who is wrong who is right? We believes our points to be true, and others are flawed.<br><br>In anyway, majority doesnt win as we all had argued here. What common Singaporeans think we had argued against, same thing here. I just feel we are a tad overzealous when we readily call nismo a young kid on the block.<br><br>Give him some space. There are two sides to every coins.Like what one of us said, live and let live. If both argued out, and there are no common grounds, let each other be.<br><br>Just a sideline<br><br>What disturb me me after spending close to four months in sgforums, I seen many flame wars in various degrees. Some people just put out their own views, but were hacked to pieces by others. Their points were taken out, bit by bit, and in the end wonderfully, were labelled 'post this with hidden interest, intentions, conspiracies" and 'contradictory' and few personal remarks against the said fellow's integrity, character etc etc. This coupled with some vulgar language which I would not utter here, fascinates some, but also annoy many.<br><br>Well this is just my personal opinion, no offence to anyone here.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright. On a more positive note, the reasons why most people choose to live their hometown is because their hometown sucks in their own opinion. That is why my mum left her family because they weren't very nice to her long ago. My dad left his country because he was put on employment packages in SEA, because the job market back home was very bleak. Now most people leave their hometown because they cant get employed, or they earn very little money, or because livelihood is not enjoyable.<br><br>I know from my own travelling experience that life can be great overseas if you are on employment packages. When we were in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore (before), India and China, dad was provided with basic amenities; 5 Cs as an employment package from his employers. Life was very good and free easy, darn well better than back home. Its all about value people place on things, employers want people who can come up with ads, so they place high value on my dad to work for them... similarly, we place high value on more comfortable living, so we tag along with him migrating. Thus my family left our hometown, because we did not value it much at the time. But ofcourse values will always change.</div>
