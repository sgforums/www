A good part of the time, the ones who leave are treated as "talents" with the inverted commas.<br><br>These people leave Singapore and go to environments in which they can perform to their maximum potential, instead of being hampered by people who either have some inferiority complex or want to protect their rice bowls instead of being truly competitive.<br><br>These are the people who want to have the freedom to do what they see to be the right thing, instead of following the yes-sir-no-sir-three-bags-full mentality that pervades right from the beginning of the education process.  Unfortunately, Singapore is the kind of place where thinking for yourself makes you a pariah.<br><br>The strangest thing is that these are exactly the people that Singapore needs right now in its current stage of development.  The growth of the economy has resulted in a population that can no longer afford to play the game of producing goods that are cheaper than anyone else's.  Right now, they need people who can think outside of the square, but with the atmosphere of hierarchical compliance, they have done themselves in.  Recognising this need, the government instead decided to launch into its "stayers and quitters" nonsense.  The message they effectively delivered was "Singapore - love it or lump it".  Fine - faced with such a choice, many have chosen to lump it, and it's the government's poor judgement to have offered such a challenge instead of trying to coax these people back.<br><br>So, yes, in other parts of the world, they're talents.  It's only in Singapore that they're "talents".</div></blockquote>Bravo! 2 Thumbs Up! Gedanken, you put the issue right in its place. They live in this small island and think that they are the world.
