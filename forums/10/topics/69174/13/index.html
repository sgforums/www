            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like awhile since anyone posted anything on this lengthy thread...my turn... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I just wish to share my experiences with you all out there...Ged, Viper 52, Xprobe, AzRael, Heng@, I'm with you guys on your views. Like you mentioned Ged, it wasn't easy making the move, but we did it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I've been in Canada for almost 7 yrs now. Pretty much most of my 20s have been spent in this great country. Like most of you guys, I came over as an international student initially, but liked it so much that I stayed on and became a PR. The opportunities that this country has given me is something I'll never find back in SG. I know I'll just have the door slammed shut in my face. At least I don't have ppl here telling me that an Arts degree is useless, that I can't make a living with it, etc etc...I think what my degree did was to make me THINK. To think out of the box, but also to question and never accept conventional wisdom at face value without questioning.To think enough for me to pursue a grad degree and hopefully on to a PhD, all in a social science discipline, which our leaders would have frowned upon, given their practical mindsets.<br><br>To those who think we didn't try to better ourselves or create opportunities for ourselves in SG or stick around to change the system, I can tell you with all conviction that we tried. It is with our baggage of experiences, as Ged succintly puts it, that we are done trying, and have started migrating. If we can't effect changes because the elitist bureaucracy has deemed our opinions and ideas to be of little value, too radical, impractical, and/or just nonsensical, then we'll just contribute to countries that want mavericks like us...at the end of the day, I'd rather be a differing fool than a PAP-sanctioned 'great mind.'<br><br>Like Xprobe, I was also from a neighbourhood school...Normal Stream...hated the way lessons were taught. I'm never good at memory work or rote learning, so I only passed with a minimum of 3 'O's. Enough to get me to some private business school and earn a cert in Bus. admin, although I never really wanted to do it.  After being in the Canadian education system, I realized what was wrong all these years with SG's system....basically everything! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I won't bother going into details since many of you have already done so.<br><br>As for free speech, less hectic lifestyles, lower cost of living, etc, these are just some of the factors that made me wanna say here. But I think my greatest factor for staying is that I wanna give back to my adopted country the same chances it first gave me. Not SG...at least not with the Lee dynasty still in charge. AzRael, you totally got it right when you said that being a PR in Canada gives you more opportunities than a citizen in SG. For this, I'm grateful to the government of Canada.<br><br>Am I unpatriotic? Ungrateful? Nope...I even believed that SG was the best place on earth when I was a kid growing up; there was no place like home. I served my country with pride like many of guys in NS...went through Hell in training (Ged... grrr <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ...LOL  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), saw my fren fade away and die in front of me because of some freak training accident, lost one sec. school fren in a drowning accident in NS and yet still gave it my 101% simply because I still believed back then that I owe this much to my country...I'm done paying this debt of gratitude to the SG government...my life is my own to decide now.<br><br>To those that are thinking of migrating, ponder no further...take the plunge with an open mind. See the sights and open yourself to opportunities that are available only to the selected few in SG!
