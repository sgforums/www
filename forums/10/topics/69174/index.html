            <div class='col-md body'><br>Is this the time for us to find better paying jobs overseas, since our own domestic employment situation is poor ?<br><br>The present situation in Singapore is similar to the Filippinos during the early 1980s - and those from Indonesia and Vietnam from early 1990s - when their economies were shattered by political incompetency and lack of economic planning.<br><br>The warning cards were already on our table since the EARLY 1980s, when businesses were all complaining about the high costs of doing businesses in Singapore - such as stubborn insistence of annual wage increases, high CPF contribution to achieve a 40 percent mark, high land prices that resulted in high cost of developments and subsequent rentals and property prices - that affected all down stream costs.<br><br>The Government had claimed that THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR SINGAPORE.<br><br>How can they NOT know everything ?<br><br>They insisted on having ALL THE AVAILABLE and LIMITED SINGAPORE TALENTED PERSONS on their side, and every angles were supposed to have been covered.<br><br>Still we had the experience of the 1987 crash, and had almost recovered by 1991 - by then the Government returned to set the pace of wage increments in the Civil Service that affected the wages paid to Commerce and Industries.<br><br>CPF contribution was pushed back to 40 PERCENT again.<br><br>New fiscal policies were introduced with high COE prices that affected commercial vehicles, followed with ERP being introduced; while tax on fuel remained relentlessly high.<br><br>URA land sale prices were kept continuously high to maintain the 'false value of the bubble' that the Banking Community need, so that past property financing plans are not jeopardised.<br><br>Some would claim that these comments are with the benefit of hindsight. However, these were already the complaints that were voiced by nearly all sectors of Singapore Life - from ordinary housewife, hawkers, Small and Medium Enterprises to large Corporations; home buyers to industrial developers; entrepreneurs and established businessess planning new investments had begun to pick alternative sites with lower overheads.<br><br>These were already the writings on the wall, that were ignored.<br><br>Even the Opposition Party had written books about it, and offered solutions that were derided - but now we see Government adopting ideas that were already suggested more then TEN YEARS AGO.<br><br>Fortunately, those who are going overseas have found jobs based on the HIGHLY TRAINED SKILLS of these Singaporeans - as middle or high level managers, consultants, specialists.<br><br>We have yet to experience husbands and wives leaving the family to seek menial jobs overseas - as laborers, maids, farm hands.<br><br>Let us not fall into the silly and cheap political cliches created by the senior members of the Ruling Party, who had contradicted themselves by coining this label for these Singaporeans as QUITTERS; when at the same time these same Political Leaders had failed in their economic planning had also encouraged Singaporeans to 'SPREAD THEIR WINGS'<br><br>Many Singaporeans had 'spread their wings' since the late 1970s, more during 1980s, AND even MORE during the 1990s.<br><br>Those who DARE, WINS.<br><br>So are those who 'SPREAD THEIR WINGS' now 'QUITTERS' ?<br><br></div>

The migration process usually requires that applicants be able to demonstrate their ability to support themselves, either by gaining employment or by setting up viable businesses (their previous business track record is also taken into consideration).  In countries where there is social support, this is done so that they don't end up taking in migrants who will be a drain on the welfare system.  So, I don't know if these are "glorified stories of how ppl made it big elsewhere", but at the point of entry, they are already in a good position to make it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it so surprising at all that more and more younger singaporeans feel they can prosper overseas? Given a chance, half the scholars who are bonded to gahmen linked corporations would run at the first opportunity open to them in the region and the west. This coupled by a healther, more relaxed lifestyle (you dun need to work yourself to death just to earn peanuts) has prompted many of our talented individuals to seek their futures away from our society.<br><br>In fact, in a recent article in a magazine (the name slipped my mind), some parents were even urging their children to stay overseas if they were offered a job after they graduated.<br><br>A lack of distinct opportunities have made some ppl sit up and take notice. Singapore has limited chances and those few are already "streamlined" for the select high profile scholars whom certain companies have invested tons of money and time to groom.<br><br>It is not enuff that you have an impeccable and polished degree. You need to be a recognised scholar to stand any chance of reaching those upper echalons in a corporation. As a result, those on the not-so-prestigious parent's scholarship find themselves 2nd best in all departments, not because they lack the qualifications mind you, but simply because they are not scholars.<br><br>Hard work and proven results does not come close to a scholarly rite of passage up the corporate ladder. While we emphasize a significant portion on manpower qualifications, it seems the basics of track record and hard work have been forgotten. It is no longer enuff that you diligently perform your duties, you need to be "value-added" so that a company recognises your "talent" and contribution to the continued success it may have.<br><br>It's sad that we now have an overreliance on paper qualifications.</div>
