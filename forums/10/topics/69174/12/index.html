            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All..<br><br>I came across this forum while reading my daily ST headlines.  And being a singaporean living overseas, can't help but check out this topic.<br><br>Just thought i give my 2 cents' worth. I have been living in Amsterdam for 4.5 years. Reason for moving: Boyfriend is dutch. The thing is, the grass is not greener on the other side, nor is it browner. Admittedly, I've always wanted to 'get out' of singapore, not because of the govt. but because of the lifestyle (everyone chasing the 5 Cs, after designer clothes, etc, etc.). To me, there's more to life than chasing the materialistic lifestyle.<br><br>Life is different here in Amsterdam, but not necessary better (or worse). Holland has its own problems with foreigners.  The cost of living is quite high. It's expensive to own a house, though getting a car is cheap. There's lots of cultural activities here, but public transport is expensive and unreliable.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that there are 2 sides to every story. Being here, I'm quite proud to be a singaporean.  Singapore has come a long way in a short 39 years. Most other countries have a much longer history (centuries!).  We are smaller in land area than Luxembourg, but not less important. The govt. did what it had to do to build up the country. Decisions have to be made, and they may not always be popular with the people.<br><br>That said, I do think it is perhaps time for a change. The education system needs to be revamped, and work culture/ethics as well. So instead of condemning, why not give suggestions? It's either improve or approve...<br><br></div>

But ppl are leaving sg because of several reasons, e.g. better opportunites and rat race not as intense as in singapore.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi listen2u, it's interesting that you brought up 'better opportunities and rat race' because I know quite a number of dutch who wants to go to singapore for 'better opportunities'. Opportunities are created. It all depends on the skills set that the people possessed. If you want a more artistic environment, then perhaps it's a good choice to migrate. If you're an engineer or financialists, then singapore is a pretty good place to work. Lack of opportunities are everywhere.<br><br>And rat races are <strong>in part</strong> created by the people themselves.  The same people (some of them) who might be leaving singapore for another country because of the 'rat race' end up labelling the 'dutch/aussies/english/american/..fill in the blanks" as 'lazy'. Just because other people have a more relaxed view on the way of life doesn't make them lazy. People need to re-examine what their priorities in life are.  And my bf just commented "it's not the race that determine the speed, it's the rats"...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi fong_ams, your points maybe correct but I would like to point out that foriegn investor are shifting away from singapore. Therefore opportunities will be limited. Singapore is now wooing foreign talents to come here but  is there enough opportunities for all?<br><br>I do agree opportunites are there to be taken but if a pie is share among alot of ppl, someone might missed out. Those ppl who missed out might just choose the way out.<br><br>btw, i do not believe 'dutch/aussies/english/american/..fill in the blanks" as 'lazy'. I believe its the culture of each nation.<br><br>As what ur bf had mention, "rats detemine the speed", as the speed in sg here is fast. Thats y ppl choose to leave.<br><br>Maybe I did not see the whole picture, so do correct me if I am wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True that there are people leaving Singapore for greener pastures elsewhere. But there are much more, who are STUCK here because they don't have the financial means to do so. Let's say if they're given a tidy sum of money to decide whether to stay or leave, I'd say a large chunk of ordinary folks would gladly lable themselves QUITTERS - including myself.<br><br>Apart from ever increasing living costs and slimming chances of making a difficult living, there is little or no recreational venues to unwind ourselves over the weekend. It's just simply work, and pay our bills and taxes. That's it.<br><br>Doesn't this seems uncannily similar to a chicken coop where the chickens just get fed to lay eggs??<br><br>Does to me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm writing from my personal experience. I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from leaving singapore. It is a personal choice. Perhaps it will be interesting to ask which country people will choose if they have an opportunity to leave singapore, and why they think living in that country is better than staying in singapore.<br><br>Here in holland, the 1st tier tax is 33.4%, and 2nd tier is 40.35%. The actual income tax is low. The bulk of the tax is for social welfare, etc. Disposable income isn't that much better after those deductions. On top of this, you have to pay national health insurance, which varies from Â€25/mth to Â€150/mth.  Cost of living is high too as I've mentioned in my earlier post.<br><br>There may be more recreational activities since the land area is bigger than Singapore. But the govt. can't be blame for it. It may sound like i'm very pro-pap, but that's not the case. I'm just trying to be objective. There are a lot of things that PAP can do better. Introduce more flexible working schedules. Here 3-day week for working mothers are very common as childcare is horrendously expensive. Employees are very well protected, but this means it's very hard on employers and entrepreneurs. Holland is also trying very hard to attract foreign investment. It's something that's affecting developed countries.<br><br>It is a difficult case to argue. I'm not here to change anyone's mind. Just offering my views as a singaporean living in a foreign land.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by panja_v:</div><div class="quote_body">A friend worked for a Dutch MNC in Singapore and was treated fantastic, no way SIA will treat their employees like that. I have never been to Holland.... how is Housing, transport and medical costs?<br><br>Are the people heavily in housing debt? Just curious.... </div></blockquote>The dutch has very good laws protecting the employees. companies have to go to court to apply for a permit if they need to retrench the employees.  But the cost for an employer is tremendous, thus keeping foreign investment away.<br><br>Owning a house here is not easy. Most people rent and even then, there is a long waiting list. There are social housing available, but you have to join the housing association to be eligible for them. Even then you are not guaranteed anything.  We recently bought our first apartment and that cost Â€200,000 for 700 sq. feet. HDB flats in singapore are bigger than that.<br><br>Transport is also expensive and definitely not efficient. Ever since moving here, I miss the efficiency i've taken for granted in singapore.<br><br>Cars are cheap of course, compared to singapore. But traffic jams are quite terrifying. Having a 35km long traffic jam is quite normal.<br><br>There are also problems with the medical facilities. The waiting list is long. People have to wait 3-6 months for an operation.<br><br>Every country has it's own problems.  One of the main issue now in Holland is the tightening of immigration laws. There is a so-called problem of the migrants not integrating into the society. Racial discrimination still exists, despite it being known as a tolerant place.  These are issues that may not be reported in ST or other news, and thus make the country seems better.  If you're here as an expat (via a job in a MNC), then life is quite different, and easier. But if you move here for any other reason, then life can be quite difficult.  Expats are always treated differently no matter which country they are from.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree and understand fong_ams. I am a student in a Uni in UK. I left home at the age of 15 and have been in this country for close to 7 years. I have met and know many people that try to come over to the UK and study. Some of them are very very determined to come over, and i will ask them why are they so desperate to get out of SG. And they'll say the same things, greener pastures, PAP lousy, better pay blah blah blah. Though i do agree with some points, i mean, its true that PAP has lost touch with s'poreans, and that especially if you are able to land a job in the UK,your salary will be damn good lor. But, i dun see landing a job overseas as greener pastures.<br><br>I know 5 friends, who graduated a year ago, all got 1st class honours in their engine degrees. All applied for jobs in the UK. They all confident, but they after they went for interview after interview, they all kenah rejected. I dunno why they are rejected, but i being in this country for so long, i can guess, that as usual, we asians are always looked down upon, and passed over. One of the 5 friends said the interviewer told him he did not get the job, because he finds that as chinese, we are too humble. How ridiculous is that?!  Now, all 5 of my friends went home liaoz, and they all got jobs, that although they complain stressful, they are happy with. They may be paid slightly less than if they were in UK, but they won't have to tahan stupid childish racism, bad food and bad weather. Instead, they can now work at home.<br><br>In short, i just would like to say to those pple thinking of leaving SG, that leaving and striking rich is not as easy as it seems, and that you all should consider whether the benefits you get for moving to 'greener pastures' are really worth all the hassle.<br><br>I personally will be back home after my degree, and if i can't find a job at home, than i will just stay home and rot, cause i will never move to a land without chicken rice and tau huay again.<br></div>

In this kind of environment, the Sporean type of efficiency is NOT necessary because it is not a key element that will affect their survival, unlike us. So I gave up long ago to demand them to meet the "Sporean" standards. But when you think about it, this may be why they dont feel as stressed as us. Look at the restaurants and check out what time they eat dinner. 6pm, something like that. You know, sometimes I think they laugh at us for being so up-tight. "Small country mentality" or "Xiao Guo Xin Li"</div>

The thing about corruption is not as bad. Does not affect your everyday life such as electricity, post office, etc if you know what I mean. But there is corruption and you got to see it from their perspective. Firstly, there will always be corruption or "lubrication" in China. It is part of the culture for thousands of years because things are done mostly based on "jiao qing". The way to deal with it is not to worry too much about it. Things are getting better, especially with the public sector being restructured. Police are getting higher pays, appointments are performance and academic based, etc.</div>

If you use a Spore mindset, these things will drive you crazy, cursing and swearing all the way to the airport. But if you just take a step back and play observer, you actually learn alot about why they behave in a certain way. E.g they drive like crazy, and you wouldnt understand why they do it...until you know how the traffic law with regards to accident responsibility is allocated. You dont understand why some of them spend such a huge premium for branded products until you hear about some factories making soya sauce with human hair. These are very interesting observations. You will have fun.</div>
