That's why lots of people are making their complaints here as you can see. I challenge them to speak their mind to the govenment and I think most will opt for anonymity.

I hear this being echoed by Islamic and Christian fundamentalists and terrorists! Saddam Hussein also said that US is the BIG SATAN. I wonder how stupid they can be! US is a Christian country based on godly constitution and there is no country like it. It was started by pilgrims from England. I always liked the US and hope to work and live there.
