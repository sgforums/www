Are you calling your ancestors quitters? Isn't it the same argument? They gave up the 'hard life' in their home country to come to a place like Singapore and earn their keeps. A lot of them wanted to return to their home countries. Like the students in Asia, UK or States. But as time goes on, they decided that living in Singapore isn't that bad. Just like my counterparts over here. They settle down in their new country and have families.<br><br>So if you're calling us Quitters, you are yourself born from quitters consequently, we are all 'quitters' in Singapore.<br><br>Australians leave to migrate to UK, the Europeans migrate over here. I used to work with a French boss in the cafe. It is normal behaviour and one of those things that we just have to accept.

The only thing you're showing is how wet behind the ears you are, that you don't even realise that some of us have not only asked that question, not only worked out our answers, but indeed have tested our solutions and found that they work.  You're well behind the game here but you think you're ahead, and that's what makes you holier-than-thou.</div></blockquote>I do agree with nismo in the sense, leaving solve any sg individual problems. One can also 'prophesise' the effects of singaporeans leaving en masse, such as talent drain, weakening economy, birth rate falling etc etc....so the effects of many people leaving will endanger singapore as a nation. As one would say, love the country but not the gahmen.<br><br>However, I only totally agree with nismo if he said it 10 years ago. This idea of migrating to other countries was mooted many years ago, but the gahmenship at that time is relatively not absurd as now. It was a period of transition between LKY and GCT, economy was good, there doesnt seem to be stifling environment, people in the gahmen arent so 'I am good, follow me' kind of attitude. There is still ISD around, plus other clampdown on certain political arena like free speech, I must admit.<br><br>But it is getting worse now. People arent changing for the worse, its the leadership which I feel is getting weirder. How to blame on people in the first place? We have people like SIm Wong Hoo and the 1.99 shop owner (what her name again) who change sg from a old traditional biz style system to an idea driven entrepeneurial one. We have now many people with the tenacity to improve the economy and business arena in many sense, like freelancing, internet based business, Creative type of entrepeneurship which focus on skills, ingenuity and logical thinking, than a degree or diploma qualified management. We have people opening up the arts scene. Many of us here are displaying our talent in drama, literature, drawings, many others.We have so many arts theatres opening up,  We have people who dare to go for their dreams - racing, bus arena (like those guys in the bus forums). We also have people (not only us or Chee Soon Juan) who are giving feedbacks to the gahmen on how to improve the society as whole...BUT?<br><br>Good news to hear a lot of Singaporeans (not most of them) are also trying improve individual pursuit, but also contributing to the society. But the main problem is what I usually style 'Mah Bow Tan' syndrome. Why isnt the leadership listening to the people? Why is it more stifling now, with increasingly so many layered policies dictating our fiscal policies (man, CPF already taken our hard earned money, my economic teacher can argue why CPF is more money draining than economy saving), disregards to feedbacks, 'scholarly' approach to solving problems, and many other points we had put out here on this forum.<br><br>It was absurd to hear 'bartop dancing ban lifted', 'debate over oral sex', these are clampdowns to the very individual level. Are these bans relevant to the society in the first place. Shouldnt the gahmen focus on economy and other macro policies, instead of what we individuals do? I personally dont see how bartop dancing can badly influence our youngs as compared to sticking chewing gums in MRT trains causing thousand of dollars to scrape off. Is the policies implemented before and now relevant and effective?<br><br>All in all, nismo is not wrong to say we should try to improve our society or getting to the crux of the problem, but with the present degenerating environment, how can one blame the so called 'quitters'?<br><br>PS: Why 'Mah Bow Tan' syndrome? Few years ago his son wanted to go polytechnic although he can go JC, Mah Bow Tan frowned on it, and it was all over New Paper. I was pissed off, and Mah attitude and thinkings resemble the gahmen's ones.<br><br></div>

Not his fault that he is young and idealistic. We were once, remember? Back then, we got inspired by stories and tales about great people who made the world a better place, touched people's lives and aspired to be the same. THEN, reality starts to set in. But for the first few times, we didnt want to see it that way, we rationalized that we must have missed something and the put-downs were meant to be encouragement and not demeaning in anyway. Then time passes and we get the same treatment over and over again, we backtracked and thought hard. Nope, nothing was amissed in what I wanted to say or do. THEN, it strucked you. I gave Spore 15 yrs of my life. I cant afford to given another 15 yrs. But nis-man can. So, let him go and tackle it. He may get lucky. Who knows?</div>

I know for sure that staying in Spore, I will not be able to go at peace. There will definitely be regrets. I am happy and contented outside the system, although I am less comfortable and take bigger risks here, at least I am my own man.<br><br>Fug man, just let me do what I want to do la! (in the legal and good sense context). Why does the gahmen want to play a part in such a minor thing? Dont they have bigger and better things to take care of?</div>

My take on this is: of course there is crime overseas, but there are precautions one can take when it comes to such things. Its not like we don't take precautions against crime in Singapore. Do we go around HDB void decks staring long and hard at groups of Ah Bengs? Thats an instant ticket to being the victim of crime in Singapore. Similarly, there are places to avoid going to, and things we shouldn't do when overseas, to reduce the chances of being victims of crimes overseas.<br><br>I've stayed 4 years overseas, and those 4 years have really changed my perspective of life and opened my eyes as to what sort of life I really want.</div>
