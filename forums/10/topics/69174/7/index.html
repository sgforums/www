Change it. Unhappy about the long hours at work? Change or work around it. Want to do more with your leisure rather than just watch movies or play golf? Go ahead and do so.Â”<br><br>LetÂ’s be honest. Enacting change in Singapore is not a simple act of waking up and deciding to do something about it.  As one of our readers told us, Â“It takes courage for a person to pursue his dreams, but it takes much more for a Singaporean to pursue his!Â”<br><br>The combination of our conservative traditional values and a socio-political structure which charts very bright lines between what is desirable and what is not, gives rise to  powerful social pressure that makes it extremely difficult for someone to pursue his own convictions, especially if it is seen as unconventional.<br><br>So even if we want to enact change, we know we can expect a host of systemic barriers, not of our making, to spring up and prevent us from meaningfully articulating our desires for change or making those changes."</span><br><br>Its not that we do not want to change things, neither is it that we have not tried.
