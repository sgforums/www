            <div class='col-md body'>on a more serious tone, our system, the capitalist system is planned and designed by and for the elites, the elitist system. It shouldn't come as a surprise that the very people who are sitting on it are still sitting around. This system is to protect the very people who designed it...so the middle and lower class people are more badly affected.<br><br>on the surface it may seem that we're being cared for by the gahmen...but..how much truth is in it? I don't know. Perhaps no one can give a good answer either. But we can see and feel the effects. If the system is good, our own ppl wouldn't be leaving and not coming back, our birthrate wouldn't go so low so prematurely (afterall we're still a "developing nation")<br><br>more importantly, it's more of the individual opinion of whether or not they like it here in singapore..there can be no agreement or disagreement. only the emigration statistics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Say Viper, you said that one of those who got PR is not returning to Oz for a few more years?  If that's the case, he/she had better check the regulations.  The way it's been explained to me, you need to be in Oz for 3 out of the next 5 years to maintain your  status.</div>

It is increasingly becoming apparent to a lot of Singaporeans that the overpriced pigeon hole and expensive set of wheels do not make a happy life. For my case, I think its more of "We are the willing going into the unknown, so as to avoid doing the unnecessary for the ungrateful."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>No matter how the spin doctors try to put the gloss over the "stayers and quitters" remarks, theres no doubt what the PM meant when he first made the speech.<br><br>My friend knows about the 2 out of 5 years rule (this has been reduced from 3) for the PR, but there are ways to get around that. He runs a business here with biz contacts in Aust, and the rules state that the residency requirements can be waived if he can prove that by being overseas, hes contributing/helping the Australian economy.
