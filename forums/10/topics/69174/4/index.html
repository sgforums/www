Would they have been Â“problem childrenÂ” if they hadnÂ’t tried testing their ideas and solutions out?  I think itÂ’s presumptuous of you to assume that we havenÂ’t.<br><br>Look at peopleÂ’s reactions to XprobeÂ’s initial statement about being a problem child.  These are people who have been there, pushed the limits and run up against a wall time and time again.  No, actually IÂ’ll correct myself Â– they have been run up against a wall time and time again.  These are people who have tried to do the right thing by convincing, consulting, confronting and eventually coercing, and at the end of the day theyÂ’re lucky if the reaction they get is confusion.  From the looks of the posts here, what you have quite easily adds up to at least 30 combined years of experience in testing out ideas and solutions, only to have them canned by the naysayers and sheep.  ItÂ’s no sudden change weÂ’re asking for Â– our conclusions are driven by continuous and chronic resistance to change.<br><br>And here you come, adding insult to injury, assuming that these people have not tried.  If they had not tried to change things and been noticed for trying, why were they labeled problem children?  WouldnÂ’t they just have been another face in the crowd?  The sentiment that you have expressed is one of the things that makes the people who have tried, pushed, been knocked about for trying, and then having had it all written off as a nonevent, say Â“Forget it, IÂ’m cutting my losses hereÂ”.  You said Â“at least youÂ’ve attempted to make a differenceÂ”, at the same time blithely ignoring the prior attempts of these people to make a difference.  You ask if it counts for something?  I think youÂ’ve just provided us with an answer yourself, and itÂ’s a resounding no.<br><br>Just have a look at the people who have posted here Â– the level of intelligence you find here is much higher than the average in Singapore (yes, that even includes ST, loathe as I am to admit it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).  From what I know of these posters, we have an accountant, a successful business owner, a race engineer-to-be and a psychologist (apologies to the rest - I donÂ’t know what you guys do).  We are the ones who want to build Rome, and we are the ones who see that whatÂ’s actually being built is a Hollywood set.  Every time we point out the obvious, we have our intelligence insulted by being told, Â“No, the proper answer is yes sir, no sir, three bags fullÂ”.<br><br>And still you assume weÂ’ve never tried.  Where have you been, Nismos?  What have YOU done?   Have you been to teach in a government school, to find that your colleagues meant it when they told you not to work too hard on the first day?  Have you been backstabbed for delivering better results than your colleagues, because you spotted a grievous error and corrected it?  Have you spent hours presenting your case in the clearest and most compelling way possible, only to be told, Â“But thatÂ’s just not the way weÂ’ve done thingsÂ”, while leaving the key issues untouched?  Have you watched someone 20 years your senior get knocked into the slow lane because he dared to try and be innovative?<br><br>Until you can truly appreciate the feeling of the posters who commiserated with Xprobe, I donÂ’t think youÂ’ve got any business speculating if weÂ’ve tried.  ThatÂ’s naÃ¯ve at best, sanctimonious at worst.<br><br>Am I a quitter?  Hell, yes, and proud of it.  IÂ’ve got to see the self-possession to step back and assess my situation and see that in this environment, making a contribution means shutting up and doing as youÂ’re told.  IÂ’ve got the experience to tell me that trying to help build Rome is a losing proposition, not because Rome cannot be built but because some idiot in charge is using the blueprints for Lot 5 at Universal Studios instead.  Sure IÂ’ll quit, and thatÂ’s testimony to my common sense.  Why would I want to be a team player when the team (in the very loosest sense of the word) doesnÂ’t even know the objective of the game?<br><br>Am I laughing at you because all of a sudden youÂ’re beneath me?  Why would I?  The only thing that would show is that IÂ’m still carrying the baggage of my experiences here.  IÂ’m not even thinking about you Â– IÂ’ve got bigger fish to fry.<br><br>The laugh IÂ’m laughing is a relieved one Â– IÂ’ve escaped those miserable confines and gotten myself a real life.<br><br>IÂ’m under no illusions about being under a different shepherd now.  What IÂ’m happy about is that said shepherd is my conscience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take is that the system is in place for the survival of the masses. But the masses in the 70s is different from the masses of the 90s. LKY admitted in his memoirs that there are wastage (and it means people like us).<br><br>But you got to think, is the system that is designed on the 70s basis still relevant today? I would think that some of our intellectually sound leaders dont think so in their private thoughts. But to even suggest tweaking it is a big career risk to themselves. Perceived as a herculean task. Plus the fact that they are trained to play along with the "team". Others, well just want to keep the status quo because at this stage and age, no one likes disruption. Under such an environment, how to even improve when all the things that I have seen them do is to defend themselves.<br><br>Nismo has noble thoughts and is still an idealist. I was once, and young too. But there comes a time that you just have to see it as what it is. Why try to explain it away? Well, I quit the system because it doesnt work for me. Anyone would be stupid not to. If it works for you, great and I congratulate you. It's a free world, or didnt they taught you that back home?</div>

Cheers mate!<br><br>Nismos, I don't about the others, but I'm certainly not laughing at those who stay. I feel happy for those who like it here, for they have found what makes them happy, and if being here floats their boat, they can go ahead. Sure I have my opinions about their decisions, but I'm sure they have their about mine.<br><br>I feel sad for those who would like to leave but cannot because they don't qualify for some reason or another.<br><br>I feel pity for those who don't like it here, but believe the propaganda that they grass is not greener on the other side, without actually going to try the grass for themselves.<br><br>Do I want to contribute to Singapore? Sure I want to. But thats not the question, the question is would the system allow me to. And as for changing the system from within, do you seriously think you'll be allowed to? I have seen too many nails hammered back into place by the system to believe in that any more.<br><br>Are things getting better? Sure, if you compare it to days gone by, then I suppose I can give a qualified yes.<br><br>But deep down inside, from what I've seen and from what I've heard, Singapore will not get better to what I want it to be.
