Therefore you have approximately 1 million to reconcile.<br><br>This is what I found out from MOM regarding the statistics<br>"Coverage<br><br>The survey covers a sample of private households on the main island of Singapore. It excludes workers living in construction worksites, dormitories and workers' quarters at the workplace and persons commuting from abroad to work in Singapore. To achieve full coverage of the labour force in Singapore, data on residents (also known as locals, i.e. Singapore citizens and permanent residents) from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the survey are combined with foreign workforce data compiled from work passes</span> issued by the Ministry of Manpower. This change was made to align with the methodology used in the General Household Survey, 2005 conducted by the Department of Statistics so as to improve the accuracy and comparability of the data.

            <div class='col-md body'>For all the despotic measures adopted by this regime, I'm curious as to how they haven't tilted the staggered tax system further by introducing a higher income tax (in percentage) for the low income earners - and reduce the income tax for the high earners.<br><br>That way, this will truly be an "all-inclusive society" where the economic base of this fascist regime is effectively born almost exclusively by all the commoners.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
