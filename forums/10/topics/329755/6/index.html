              <p>Uncle, during my social study, i did touch on Marxism, horseshit or not, this system change our world as what it is today, actually, every system is throughly defined at it very best, but just that people make a mess out of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are base on democracy, but what kind of democracy if rights are often seen as offend by our ruling party. Aren't we messing with democracy too?? Mao had changed communism to Maoism, a status that set himself like God, so LKY may change democracy here into Leeism, he had wittingly and smartly change the rules of democracy toward his one man show game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We agree that the world is ever changing as it turns, nothing remain static, even LKY has to go one day, what do you think the situation will be if LKY goes tomorrow, is PAP going to be so strong again without it backbone, is opposition going to step up their forces, do we see a drastic change in Singapore Politics that may hurt citizens and economy.</p>

              <p>Regarding the topic,</p>
              <p>For sure Singaporeans, and many other Asians for that matter, either consciously or subconsciously, have a general positive bias to all things Western.</p>
              <p>It's ok to admit it.</p>
              <p>Then comes the next question, why?</p>
              <p>I believe this comes from the last 200 years, up till now, when the Western world is more advanced in almost all fields.</p>
              <p>This can be also due to legacy of Western colonialism.</p>
              <p>First, it is important to mention this subject.</p>
              <p>To understand the present, we have to see the past, to understand how we get to here.</p>
              <p>For instance, due to colonial legacy, in political system, almost wholesale graft of Western system is applied in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I like to mention the anecdote that the parliament building in Singapore, the interior design, seating arrangement, and layout, almost totally copy the British one.</p>
              <p>Of course there are other important legacies, such as using the British criminal code, using British education system (O-level, A-level) and so on.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine what this mean?</p>
              <p>In social setting, I like to remind you that the most prestigious hotel in Singapore is Raffles Hotel, a colonial building, and also it is filled with rich visitors from Western countries presently.</p>
              <p>In other societal indicators, the best universities, which the best sons and daughters of Singapore are sent to, are Western universities.</p>
              <p>Media, I need not mention, Western cultural products, daily permeating the lives of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In this equation, what impact has Singapore got on the Western world? Almost none. This is a very lopsided relationship. Western "domination" is very strong. No wonder in this unequal relationship, there is a natural tendency in people's mentality to worship all things Western. What else will happen?</p>
              <p>But, I am not saying this to critique Singapore. I am not sure myself whether this is good or bad.</p>
