              <p>Certainly, ang mo thinking are more liberal then us, but libertism also has it disadvantages, with freedom, the lack of family orientation and discipline exist in them. Therefore i would said that, to envy their liberal lifestyle, you first, hv to take a look at what are the disadvantages in a liberal society. Then maybe you can be in a better position to choose to envy them or not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of the non discipline they have are</p>
              <p>1. accessible to firearms</p>
              <p>2. freedom of sex, (hormone, gays etc) and of course HIV</p>

              <p> if someone is overly filial, and the parents is understanding, than there will be no conflict.</p>

              <p>Wise words from the great leader Lee Kuan Yew:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each in
                  the same condition and needing a blood transfusion. The first, a
                  Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later.
                  The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few
                  days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and
                  survived.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> That is the X factor in development</span>." - 27 December 1967</p>
              <p>"The Bell curve is a fact of life. The blacks on average score 85 per
                  cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The whites
                  score on average 100. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Asians score more ... the Bell curve authors put
                  it at least 10 points higher.</span> These are realities that, if you do not
                  accept, will lead to frustration because you will be spending money on
                  wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow." - Lee Kuan Yew, The
                  Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>"I started off believing all men were equal.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I now know that's the
                  most unlikely thing ever to have been</span>, because millions of years have
                  passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this
                  earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had
                  different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I
                  didn't start off with that knowledge.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> But by observation, reading,
                  watching, arguing, asking, that is the conclusion I've come to.</span>" - Lee
                  Kuan Yew, The Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</li>
              <li>"If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious
                  and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit,
                  that's a very tricky business. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We've got to know his background... I'm
                  saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think that,
                  and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully
                  about this, we could have a tragedy." -</span> SM Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times,
                  September 19, 1999 on Malays in the Singapore Armed Forces</li>
