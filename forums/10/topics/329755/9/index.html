              <p>nope,typed in 4th..3rd was vulgar language =)</p>
              <p>the first language should be mother tongue.so if one is a mly,den mly is his/her 1st language,chinese,den mandarin first..etc..the y key here is mother tongue should be first.</p>
              <p>english is a language of commerce cuz at one point the "guai low" were more powerful.</p>
              <p>lky did not bother with chinese as its not his upbringing bcuz he was raised in a more westernised family backgnd. would a so called traditional chines family not teach the children to learn mandarin as a priority over english,an foreign language?</p>
              <p>in retrospect,becuz we take english as a more impt language set us apart from other 3 wyrms in the sense that we have lost much of our own racial identity.if thats impt to people.thats y prc are despised on though we share the same root while caucasians are worshipped when they pointed cannons at our forefathers.</p>
              <p>no doubt credit must be given to lky for enforcing english on us so that now we are able to communicate with caucasians for business that brings in money.</p>
              <p>but no credit would be given to him for understanding chinese as a language should not be neglected for it was a political n commercial move as he saw china rising in power..</p>

              <p>It's logical when you consider the pursue of happiness is merely our brain telling us to satisfy an evolutionary need.  </p>
              <p>It's also illogical to assume Singaporeans will ever be happy because you just can't satisfy your urge to be happy. There's periodic satisfaction (New gadget, new car..etc) but you can never truly be permanently happy.  </p>
              <p>Let's say at 2011 the opposition wins a decisive proportion of the GRCs and become the dominant government. Let's just say, to avoid being said i'm a PAP supporter that the opposition does not mess up and really did improve Singapore economically and socially.</p>
              <p>There would still be Singaporeans that would be unhappy with the government then and i would gladly bet good money on it.</p>
              <p>They would still demand more say in the government, they would still demand higher wages, they would still demand better work benefits. And the new government cannot keep giving in, they have to draw the line somewhere.  Can anyone say with confidence that i am wrong?</p>
              <p>My issue is not that the PAP government cannot be removed. My issue is the blind belief that any change will naturally be for the better. The irresponsible faith that it's possible to categorize the solutions of the world into good and evil.</p>
