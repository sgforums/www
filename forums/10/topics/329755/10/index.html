              <p><br>Angel, I really am lost in words when I read your post, I just shake my head.   This remind me of an encounter from a friend.   She is from hk.  Went on 1st date with the local guy.   The guy brought her to foodcourt and just could not be bothered to ask what she wanted to eat and drink, he just left her sitting there and went to get food/drinks himself.   Came back with coffee for the lady.    Lady actually does not drink and cannot drink coffee but too paiseh to reject.   later after the date, she had stomachache.</p>
              <p>May be should send those local guys for training in how to behave and treat a gal during dating.   A regular (man) in the army actually suggested this.  Those guys who are doing well in treating gals need not attend.</p>

              <p>May be should send those local guys for training in how to behave and treat a gal during dating.   A regular (man) in the army actually suggested this.  Those guys who are doing well in treating gals need not attend.</p>
