              <p>Wise words from the great leader Lee Kuan Yew:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital,
              each in the same condition and needing a blood transfusion. The
              first, a Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few
              hours later. The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion
              but died a few days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a
              transfusion and survived. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is the X factor in
              development</span>." - 27 December 1967</p>
              <p>"The Bell curve is a fact of life. The blacks on average score
              85 per cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture.
              The whites score on average 100. Asians score more ... the Bell
              curve authors put it at least 10 points higher. These are realities
              that, if you do not accept, will lead to frustration because you
              will be spending money on wrong assumptions and the results cannot
              follow." - Lee Kuan Yew, The Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>"I started off believing all men were equal. I now know that's
              the most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of
              years have passed over evolution, people have scattered across the
              face of this earth, been isolated from each other, developed
              independently, had different intermixtures between races, peoples,
              climates, soils... I didn't start off with that knowledge. But by
              observation, reading, watching, arguing, asking, that is the
              conclusion I've come to." - Lee Kuan Yew, The Man &amp; His Ideas,
              1997</li>
              <li>"If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very
              religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a
              machine gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know
              his background... I'm saying these things because they are real,
              and if I don't think that, and I think even if today the Prime
              Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a
              tragedy." - SM Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, September 19, 1999 on
              Malays in the Singapore Armed Forces</li>

              <p>How about the issue and demands of asking the schools to teach creationism as a science subject?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How about making political issues based on religion (sounds familar) .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How about the recent issue of a school deciding to go witch hunting for homosexuals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hell...even in a rather liberal nation, the voice of conservatives is still a rather large one.</p>

              <p>Come on! Just because I ask singaporeans to stop sterotyping Caucasians as everything good, does that mean the only other way to view them is everything bad?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Most ang mo are christians, and they believe that Jesus is certainly ang mo, is their people, thus they believe God is Ang Mo. So, for the rest of us, chinese, malay, india, thai etc etc are simply lower class, followers that are not worthy of their God.</p>
