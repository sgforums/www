              <p><strong>Economic Meltdown: The “Dollar Glut” is What Finances America’s
                                          Global Military Build-up</strong></p>
              <p>by Prof. Michael Hudson</p>
              <p>I am traveling in Europe for three weeks to discuss the global
                                          financial crisis with government officials, politicians and labor
                                          leaders. What is most remarkable is how differently the financial
                                          problem is perceived over here. It’s like being in another economic
                                          universe, not just another continent.</p>
              <p>The U.S. media are silent about the most important topic policy
                                          makers are discussing here (and I suspect in Asia too): how to
                                          protect their countries from three inter-related dynamics: (1) the
                                          surplus dollars pouring into the rest of the world for yet further
                                          financial speculation and corporate takeovers; (2) the fact that
                                          central banks are obliged to recycle these dollar inflows to buy
                                          U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the federal U.S. budget deficit; and
                                          most important (but most suppressed in the U.S. media, (3) the
                                          military character of the U.S. payments deficit and the domestic
                                          federal budget deficit.</p>
              <p>Strange as it may seem ­ and irrational as it would be in a more
                                          logical system of world diplomacy ­ the “dollar glut” is what
                                          finances America’s global military build-up. It forces foreign
                                          central banks to bear the costs of America’s expanding military
                                          empire ­ effective “taxation without representation.” Keeping
                                          international reserves in “dollars” means recycling their dollar
                                          inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills ­ U.S. government debt issued
                                          largely to finance the military.</p>
              <p>To date, countries have been as powerless to defend themselves
                                          against the fact that this compulsory financing of U.S. military
                                          spending is built into the global financial system. Neoliberal
                                          economists applaud this as “equilibrium,” as if it is part of
                                          economic nature and “free markets” rather than bare-knuckle
                                          diplomacy wielded with increasing aggressiveness by U.S. officials.
                                          The mass media chime in, pretending that recycling the dollar glut
                                          to finance U.S. military spending is “showing their faith in U.S.
                                          economic strength” by sending “their” dollars here to “invest.” It
                                          is as if a choice is involved, not financial and diplomatic
                                          compulsion to choose merely between “Yes” (from China,
                                          reluctantly), “Yes, please” (from Japan and the European Union) and
                                          “Yes, thank you” (Britain, Georgia and Australia).</p>
              <p>It is not “foreign faith in the U.S. economy” that leads
                                          foreigners to “put their money here.” This is a silly
                                          anthropomorphic picture of a more sinister dynamic. The
                                          “foreigners” in question are not consumers buying U.S. exports, nor
                                          are they private-sector “investors” buying U.S. stocks and bonds.
                                          The largest and most important foreign entities putting “their
                                          money” here are central banks, and it is not “their money” at all.
                                          They are sending back the dollars that foreign exporters and other
                                          recipients turn over to their central banks for domestic
                                          currency.</p>
              <p>When the U.S. payments deficit pumps dollars into foreign
                                          economies, these banks are being given little option except to buy
                                          U.S. Treasury bills and bonds ­ which the Treasury spends on
                                          financing an enormous, hostile military build-up to encircle the
                                          major dollar-recyclers ­ China, Japan and Arab <span>OPEC</span> oil producers. Yet these governments are forced to
                                          recycle dollar inflows in a way that funds U.S. military policies
                                          in which they have no say in formulating, and which threaten them
                                          more and more belligerently. That is why China and Russia took the
                                          lead in forming the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) a few
                                          years ago.</p>
              <p>Here in Europe there is a clear awareness that the U.S. payments
                                          deficit is much larger than just the trade deficit. One need merely
                                          look at Table 5 of the U.S. balance-of-payments data compiled by
                                          the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and published by the Dept. of
                                          Commerce in its Survey of Current Business to see that the deficit
                                          does not stem merely from consumers buying more imports than the
                                          United States exports as the financial sector de-industrializes its
                                          economy. U.S. imports are now plunging as the economy shrinks and
                                          consumers are now finding themselves obliged to pay down the debts
                                          they have taken on.</p>
              <p>Congress has told foreign investors in the largest dollar
                                          holder, China, not to buy anything except perhaps used-car
                                          dealerships and maybe more packaged mortgages and Fannie Mae stock
                                          ­ the equivalent of Japanese investors being steered into spending
                                          $1 billion for Rockefeller Center, on which they subsequently took
                                          a 100% loss, and Saudi investment in Citigroup. That’s the kind of
                                          “international equilibrium” that U.S. officials love to see. “CNOOK
                                          go home” is the motto when it comes to serious attempts by foreign
                                          governments and their sovereign wealth funds (central bank
                                          departments trying to figure out what to do with their dollar glut)
                                          to make direct investments in American industry.</p>
              <p>So we are left with the extent to which the U.S. payments
                                          deficit stems from military spending. The problem is not only the
                                          war in Iraq, now being extended to Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is
                                          the expensive build-up of U.S. military bases in Asian, European,
                                          post-Soviet and Third World countries. The Obama administration has
                                          promised to make the actual amount of this military spending more
                                          transparent. That presumably means publishing a revised set of
                                          balance of payments figures as well as domestic federal budget
                                          statistics.</p>
              <p>The military overhead is much like a debt overhead, extracting
                                          revenue from the economy. In this case it is to pay the
                                          military-industrial complex, not merely Wall Street banks and other
                                          financial institutions. The domestic federal budget deficit does
                                          not stem only from “priming the pump” to give away enormous sums to
                                          create a new financial oligarchy. It contains an enormous and
                                          rapidly growing military component.</p>
              <p>So Europeans and Asians see U.S. companies pumping more and more
                                          dollars into their economies, not only to buy their exports in
                                          excess of providing them with goods and services in return, and not
                                          only to buy their companies and “commanding heights” of privatized
                                          public enterprises without giving them reciprocal rights to buy
                                          important U.S. companies (remember the U.S. turn-down of China’s
                                          attempt to buy into the U.S. oil distribution business), and not
                                          only to buy foreign stocks, bonds and real estate. The U.S. media
                                          somehow neglect to mention that the U.S. Government is spending
                                          hundreds of billions of dollars abroad ­ not only in the Near East
                                          for direct combat, but to build enormous military bases to encircle
                                          the rest of the world, to install radar systems, guided missile
                                          systems and other forms of military coercion, including the “color
                                          revolutions” that have been funded ­ and are still being funded ­
                                          all around the former Soviet Union. Pallets of shrink-wrapped $100
                                          bills adding up to tens of millions of the dollars at a time have
                                          become familiar “visuals” on some TV broadcasts, but the link is
                                          not made with U.S. military and diplomatic spending and foreign
                                          central-bank dollar holdings, which are reported simply as
                                          “wonderful faith in the U.S. economic recovery” and presumably the
                                          “monetary magic” being worked by Wall Street’s Tim Geithner at
                                          Treasury and Helicopter Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve.</p>
              <p>Here’s the problem: The Coca Cola company recently tried to buy
                                          China’s largest fruit-juice producer and distributor. China already
                                          holds nearly $2 trillion in U.S. securities ­ way more than it
                                          needs or can use, inasmuch as the United States Government refuses
                                          to let it buy meaningful U.S. companies. If the U.S. buyout would
                                          have been permitted to go through, this would have confronted China
                                          with a dilemma: Choice #1 would be to let the sale go through and
                                          accept payment in dollars, reinvesting them in what the U.S.
                                          Treasury tells it to do ­U.S. Treasury bonds yielding about 1%.
                                          China would take a capital loss on these when U.S. interest rates
                                          rise or when the dollar declines as the United States alone is
                                          pursuing expansionary Keynesian policies in an attempt to enable
                                          the U.S. economy to carry its debt overhead.</p>
              <p>Choice #2 is not to recycle the dollar inflows. This would lead
                                          the renminbi to rise against the dollar, thereby eroding China’s
                                          export competitiveness in world markets. So China chose a third
                                          way, which brought U.S. protests. It turned the sale of its
                                          tangible company for merely “paper” U.S. dollars ­ which went with
                                          the “choice” to fund further U.S. military encirclement of the
                                          S.C.O. The only people who seem not to be drawing this connection
                                          are the American mass media, and hence public. I can assure you
                                          from personal experience, it is being drawn here in Europe. (Here’s
                                          a good diplomatic question to discuss: Which will be the first
                                          European country besides Russia to join the S.C.O.?)</p>
              <p>Academic textbooks have nothing to say about how “equilibrium”
                                          in foreign capital movements ­ speculative as well as for direct
                                          investment ­ is infinite as far as the U.S. economy is concerned.
                                          The U.S. economy can create dollars freely, now that they no longer
                                          are convertible into gold or even into purchases of U.S. companies,
                                          inasmuch as America remains the world’s most protected economy. It
                                          alone is permitted to protect its agriculture by import quotas,
                                          having “grandfathered” these into world trade rules half a century
                                          ago. Congress refuses to let “sovereign wealth” funds invest in
                                          important U.S. sectors.</p>
              <p>So we are confronted with the fact that the U.S. Treasury
                                          prefers foreign central banks to keep on funding its domestic
                                          budget deficit, which means financing the cost of America’s war in
                                          the Near East and encirclement of foreign countries with rings of
                                          military bases. The more “capital outflows” U.S. investors spend to
                                          buy up foreign economies ­the most profitable sectors, where the
                                          new U.S. owners can extract the highest monopoly rents ­ the more
                                          funds end up in foreign central banks to support America’s global
                                          military build-up. No textbook on political theory or international
                                          relations has suggested axioms to explain how nations act in a way
                                          so adverse to their own political, military and economic interests.
                                          Yet this is just what has been happening for the past
                                          generation.</p>
              <p>So the ultimate question turns out to be what countries can do
                                          to counter this financial attack. A Basque labor union asked me
                                          whether I thought that controlling speculative capital movements
                                          would ensure that the financial system would act in the public
                                          interest. Or is outright nationalization necessary to better
                                          develop the real economy?</p>
              <p>It is not simply a problem of “regulation” or “control of
                                          speculative capital movements.” The question is how nations can act
                                          as real nations, in their own interest rather than being roped into
                                          serving whatever U.S. diplomats decide is in America’s
                                          interest.</p>
              <p>Any country trying to do what the United States has done for the
                                          past 150 years is accused of being “socialist” ­ and this from the
                                          most anti-socialist economy in the world, except when it calls
                                          bailouts for its banks “socialism for the rich,” a.k.a. financial
                                          oligarchy. This rhetorical inflation almost leaves no alternative
                                          but outright nationalization of credit as a basic public
                                          utility.</p>
              <p>Of course, the word “nationalization” has become a synonym for
                                          bailing out the largest and most reckless banks from their bad
                                          loans, and bailing out hedge funds and non-bank counterparties for
                                          losses on “casino capitalism,” gambling on derivatives that
                                          <span>AIG</span> and other insurers or players on the
                                          losing side of these gambles are unable to pay. Such bailouts are
                                          not nationalization in the traditional sense of the term ­ bringing
                                          credit creation and other basic financial functions back into the
                                          public domain. It is the opposite. It prints new government bonds
                                          to turn over ­ along with self-regulatory power ­ to the financial
                                          sector, blocking the citizenry from taking back these
                                          functions.</p>
              <p>Framing the issue as a choice between democracy and oligarchy
                                          turns the question into one of who will control the government
                                          doing the regulation and “nationalizing.” If it is done by a
                                          government whose central bank and major congressional committees
                                          dealing with finance are run by Wall Street, this will not help
                                          steer credit into productive uses. It will merely continue the
                                          Greenspan-Paulson-Geithner era of more and larger free lunches for
                                          their financial constituencies.</p>
              <p>The financial oligarchy’s idea of “regulation” is to make sure
                                          that deregulators are installed in the key positions and given only
                                          a minimal skeleton staff and little funding. Despite Mr.
                                          Greenspan’s announcement that he has come to see the light and
                                          realizes that self-regulation doesn’t work, the Treasury is still
                                          run by a Wall Street official and the Fed is run by a lobbyist for
                                          Wall Street. To lobbyists the real concern isn’t ideology as such ­
                                          it’s naked self-interest for their clients. They may seek out
                                          well-meaning fools, especially prestigious figures from academia.
                                          But these are only front men, headed as they are by the followers
                                          of Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago. Such individuals
                                          are put in place as “gate-keepers” of the major academic journals
                                          to keep out ideas that do not well serve the financial
                                          lobbyists.</p>
              <p>This pretence for excluding government from meaningful
                                          regulation is that finance is so technical that only someone from
                                          the financial “industry” is capable of regulating it. To add insult
                                          to injury, the additional counter-intuitive claim is made that a
                                          hallmark of democracy is to make the central bank “independent” of
                                          elected government. In reality, of course, that is just the
                                          opposite of democracy. Finance is the crux of the economic system.
                                          If it is not regulated democratically in the public interest, then
                                          it is “free” to be captured by special interests. So this becomes
                                          the oligarchic definition of “market freedom.”</p>
              <p>The danger is that governments will let the financial sector
                                          determine how “regulation” will be applied. Special interests seek
                                          to make money from the economy, and the financial sector does this
                                          in an extractive way. That is its marketing plan. Finance today is
                                          acting in a way that de-industrializes economies, not builds them
                                          up. The “plan” is austerity for labor, industry and all sectors
                                          outside of finance, as in the <span>IMF</span> programs
                                          imposed on hapless Third World debtor countries. The experience of
                                          Iceland, Latvia and other “financialized” economies should be
                                          examined as object lessons, if only because they top the World
                                          Bank’s ranking of countries in terms of the “ease of doing
                                          business.”</p>
              <p>The only meaningful regulation can come from outside the
                                          financial sector. Otherwise, countries will suffer what the
                                          Japanese call “descent from heaven”: regulators are selected from
                                          the ranks of bankers and their “useful idiots.” Upon retiring from
                                          government they return to the financial sector to receive lucrative
                                          jobs, “speaking engagements” and kindred paybacks. Knowing this,
                                          they regulate in favor of financial special interests, not that of
                                          the public at large.</p>
              <p>The problem of speculative capital movements goes beyond drawing
                                          up a set of specific regulations. It concerns the scope of national
                                          government power. The International Monetary Fund’s Articles of
                                          Agreement prevent countries from restoring the “dual exchange rate”
                                          systems that many retained down through the 1950s and even into the
                                          Œ60s. It was widespread practice for countries to have one exchange
                                          rate for goods and services (sometimes various exchange rates for
                                          different import and export categories) and another for “capital
                                          movements.” Under American pressure, the <span>IMF</span> enforced the pretence that there is an “equilibrium” rate that just
                                          happens to be the same for goods and services as it is for capital
                                          movements. Governments that did not buy into this ideology were
                                          excluded from membership in the <span>IMF</span> and World
                                          Bank ­ or were overthrown.</p>
              <p>The implication today is that the only way a nation can block
                                          capital movements is to withdraw from the <span>IMF</span>, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization
                                          (WTO). For the first time since the 1950s this looks like a real
                                          possibility, thanks to worldwide awareness of how the U.S. economy
                                          is glutting the global economy with surplus “paper” dollars ­ and
                                          U.S. intransigence at stopping its free ride. From the U.S. vantage
                                          point, this is nothing less than an attempt to curtail its
                                          international military program.</p>
