              <h1 class="clr">New no—filing service by IRAS to make tax filing easier</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Personal tax filing season is just around the corner. But
              this year, one out of five taxpayers will not even need to lift a
              finger with a new no—filing service.</p>
              <p>For those whose employers automatically submit their incomes to the
              Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) and who claim standard tax
              relief items, they will not need to file their taxes.</p>
              <p>Some 7000 employers participate in the auto—inclusion scheme, and they are listed on the IRAS website.</p>
              <p>IRAS
              wants to encourage all companies who have not signed up to do so.
              Companies that participate in the scheme will not need to give out IR8A
              forms to their employees.</p>
              <p>IRAS has already informed employees who
              qualify through mail. These taxpayers will only need to login to the
              IRAS website and check their details if there are no changes.</p>
              <p>If there are changes, all they have to do is follow the instructions on the website to update the records.</p>
              <p>Deputy
              commissioner of IRAS’ individual income tax division James Khor said:
              "There are taxpayers who feedback to us that since all the info is
              pre—filled, they don’t need to make changes, why do they need to key in
              every year again?"</p>
              <p>"We decided that since there are taxpayers who
              need not change anything, we decided to further simplify and reduce
              compliant costs by saying if there are no changes, there’s no need for
              you to file a return at all," he continued.</p>
              <p>"We ran a pilot last
              year and the feedback was generally very good. The taxpayers just want
              reassurance that they don’t need to file if they satisfy the criteria,"
              he added.</p>
              <p>Taxpayers who did not receive the letter will have to
              file taxes the traditional way. These are usually people who have other
              sources of income such as rental, or are freelancers.</p>
              <p>IRAS also
              makes things easier for this group by having tax officers stationed at
              five community clubs — Bedok CC, Changi Simei CC, Chong Pang CC, Toa
              Payoh Central CC and CSC@Bt Batok — from 17 March to 18 April to guide
              those who need help through the process.</p>
              <p>Those who have questions about this new service can call 1800—250—6217 or email IRAS at nofiling@iras.gov.sg. — CNA/ac</p>
