He was a member of the Workers' Party Central Executive Committee but resigned months back due to an online argument in sammyboy.<br><br>He has his own blog here <a href="http://singaporealternatives.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://singaporealternatives.blogspot.com/</a><br><br><strong>Chia Ti Lik</strong>, a lawyer by profession, is also an active participant in sammyboy.
