              <div>Jason, before you venture to advise me on how to solve my
              problems, i think that you have to answer a
              few questions:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>1) Since the mods do not get  paid, why are they so
              <span><span><span>enthusiastic about performing their
              duties?</span></span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span><span><span>2) I am not the only person who posted the
              so called nonsenses on SG forum, so why are the mods 'training
              their guns' on me? Is it because what i am doing hurts the vested
              interests of some individuals severely?</span></span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span><span><span>3)It is with regards to your mod
              greengoblin. during his debate with parn, he claims that he follows
              the instructions of you and fireice, but unfortunately, his
              conduct is in no way suggesting that he is following instructions.
              Instead, he seems to be following his own
              initiatives!</span></span></span></div>

              <div><span><span><span>As for the possible reasons, i don't wish to
