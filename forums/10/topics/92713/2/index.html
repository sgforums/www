            <div class='col-md body'>Hi People,<br><br>The following article was in yesterday's New Papers; about how town councils resort to embedding nails on walls in common areas and void decks to deter children from playing ball games there.<br><br>This article simply shows, how Singaporeans NEED to be ked by their noses, because they can't do what is right, or simply instil some obedience in their children.<br><br>Any degree of freedom given or left for Singaporeans, and it will eventually be abused. Just look at how typically motorists behave on our roads and highways - it REFLECTS, and it clearly shows that Singaporeans, cannot do without a leash.<br><br>==========================================<br>The New Papers<br>===========================================<br><br>Nails and barbed wire keep Tampines and Hougang void decks football-free<br>Hardly visible, but they burst balls<br>By Tay Shi'an<br><br>BARBED wire around beams. Rows of nails on walls, near the ceiling (left).<br><br>That's what you'll find at some void decks and pavilions in Tampines and Hougang. The town councils have put them up to stop children from playing soccer in these common areas.<br><br>If footballs hit any of these spikes, they will burst.<br><br>A Tampines Town Council spokesman said there are about 100 blocks in its central division that have nails and barbed wire.<br><br>The Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council, which overseas some areas in Hougang, said 27 blocks have void deck nail studs, but no barbed wire.<br><br>Picture/ KUA CHEE SIONG<br>They were put up two to three years ago in Tampines, and a year ago in Hougang.<br><br>Both town councils said this was done after numerous complaints from residents about void deck soccer players.<br><br>Problems include excessive noise, ball marks on walls, damaged light fittings, as well as stray balls accidentally hitting people.<br><br>And the spikes have claimed a few 'victims'.<br><br>A 15-year-old boy living on Hougang Avenue 8, who would identify himself only as Mickey, said his football burst after hitting the nails.<br><br>He said: 'I lent my football to my friends and went upstairs to change for the game. When I came downstairs, the ball had burst. My friends told me it hit one of the nails.'<br><br>Mickey declined to give his full name, saying he did not want to get into trouble.<br><br>The nails and barbed wire are hardly visible, as the town councils have taken care to paint them the same colour as the walls.<br><br>Both are located at least 2m from the ground, out of reach of most residents, thus posing a danger only for balls kicked too high.<br><br>Spokesmen for both Tampines and Pasir Ris-Punggol town councils said they had received positive feedback about the spikes, and that they have been effective in stopping children from playing soccer in void decks.<br><br>Hougang resident Mary Anthony, 41, is happy with the nails.<br><br>'I live on the third floor, and the noise can be very distracting, especially when my children are studying,' said the secretary, who has two kids aged 7 and 10.<br><br>'It's also quite sad sometimes to see the freshly painted walls covered in marks,' she added.<br><br>Others thought the measures were too extreme.<br><br>Said Tampines Rovers director of operations R Vengadasalam: 'By putting up barbed wire, you make young boys look like criminals. Barbed wire is supposed to be used in prisons to keep prisoners from escaping.<br><br>'By bringing it into housing estates, you make the boys feel that they cannot play.'<br><br>Added a housewife in her 40s, who gave her name only as Mrs Goh: 'The nails are really not nice. After all, children need a place to play.'<br><br>Other residents, like student Adeline Low, 16, were worried about safety issues.<br><br>'Some kids might be playful and climb to touch the nails,' said the Tampines resident.<br><br>But MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Charles Chong said the nails should not cause any danger to residents as they are located near the ceiling.<br><br>He added: 'The town council has assured me that the nails are very secure and won't fall off.'<br><br>Mr Sin Boon Ann, MP for Tampines GRC, added that the nails are not very sharp, though sharp enough to puncture a ball.<br><br>Both town councils declined to reveal the cost of installing the spikes.<br><br>Picture/ KELVIN CHNG<br>PILOT PROJECT<br><br>The New Paper also contacted 14 other town councils to see what measures they had in place to stop children from playing soccer in void decks.<br><br>Of the six that replied, only East Coast town council said it had used nails. It has nails in the void deck of only one block, Block 52 on Chai Chee Street.<br><br>They were fitted in June this year as a pilot project.<br><br>Most of the other five town councils said they are unlikely to consider this measure.<br><br>All eight town councils interviewed said they also use other measures, such as signboards and routine patrols, to stop void deck soccer players.<br><br>Some rope in the help of Residents' Committee members and the police.<br><br>Others also take down the names of these soccer players and give them to their schools, so that the kids can be counselled.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Where can the children play?<br><br>IF not in void decks, then where?<br><br>Do Singapore kids have enough places where they can play soccer?<br><br>No, said student Tan Wei Liang, 15, who plays with about 15 of his friends almost daily.<br><br>Their 'pitch' in Hougang is a less-than-perfect concrete space between a few blocks of flats.<br><br>Said Wei Liang: 'There are no fields around here. If we play on the grass patch across the road, the ball always falls into the big canal and we must retrieve it. We also cannot play near the road. Then how?'<br><br>This was echoed by Tampines Rovers director of operations R Vengadasalam.<br><br>He said: 'Tell me, how many plots of vacant land are actually playable? Many have pot holes because they are leftover from construction. Boys can get injured playing there! I would rather they play in a void deck because it's flat.<br><br>'NO HARM'<br><br>'There's no harm in letting boys play there. Better to kick about in the void deck than to take drugs in the void deck.'<br><br>He felt extreme measures to stop children from playing soccer in void decks, such as nails and barbed wire, go against the promotion of soccer.<br><br>But Mr Sin Boon Ann, MP for Tampines GRC, disagreed. He said: 'This is a practical measure to prevent kids from using community halls as soccer fields. We are not discouraging them from playing, just not in the wrong place.'<br><br>Mr Sin also said there are sufficient open spaces in Tampines for kids to play soccer, such as Tampines central park and the school fields.<br><br>But though there are nails in his estate also, Mr Charles Chong, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, hopes they will eventually disappear as new soccer pitches, such as the one near Hougang's Block 543, are built.<br><br>He said: 'Measures like spikes are not a long-term solution to the problem. I don't like to see the spikes there permanently, as they show our failure to provide proper fields for kids to play.<br><br>'We should instead try to create more alternatives for kids to play in.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have read most of the posts.<br><br>My feel is that "what price freedom?"<br><br>when we say freedom and democracy, what models are you looking at? obviously a lot of us are looking tiowards the american model. Well maybe we should look around the region, the south east asian region. Almost all the south east asian countries, minus phillipines, have not so liberal democracy. there are reasons why it is what it is, namely history is one of them. The further you can look backwards, the better you can understand now, as well as see the future.<br><br>Press freedom.<br><br>I agree that the press is definitely to a major extent, toeing the line. very ambivalent about this, but with the Internet, we should be able to  sieve out the propanganda of the local news.  I notice that the Ruling PArty has actually shifted from emphasising Critical thinking to Creative thinking. Just a theory, but maybe because if really everyone thought critically, then maybe we see through the whole plot.<br><br>I read the news to know whats happening around the world. Sometimes i just get sick of the pro-PAP news as well as, commentaries on parliament that never seem to raise a point of contention, that i just pass them.  i dare say you can't expect much change when you restrict what people can say to what you can control.<br><br>Medical Fees<br><br>i find that quite amusing. Frankly speaking maybe health care should cover the basic things like cholestrol check blood test etc. The rest have to be paid. he reason why the burden of health care is gradully shifted upon the consumer, not just in singapore, is because with  newer technology, there is just too many checkup you can do and still call it the minimum requirement. Last time i dont think there were mamograms, MRI,  etc,.<br><br>its along story<br><br>overall i just find that Singaporeans will turn angry and politically opinionated. After awhile we just internalize that theres no need for political participation<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Atobe<br><br>I understand your frustrations over some forummers bantering with a serious topic. But political maturity takes time and, of course, it can't be achieved if we allow ourselves to be led by the nose.<br><br>The first thing we can do is to raise awareness. So, keep posting all socio-economical and socio-political issues here. By and by, forummers' cognizance will be raised.</div>
