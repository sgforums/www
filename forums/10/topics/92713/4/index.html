            <div class='col-md body'>i believe most singaporean like to be lead by the nose. we can see it the daily life and how govt treated us in their policy implementation. some like it some dont. those who like it are those who simply dont care anything that doesnt concern them or they cant do anything about it.<br><br>what wrong with complaining and making criticisim in singapore?<br>do we need to provide a better suggestion before we can criticise? eg. do we need to run faster than poh seng song to criticise his timing in olympic games? or do we need to beat joycelyn yeo to criticise her below par standard in olypmics game.  criticism can be treated as a form of motivation for the govt or everyone of us to improve better if it is a reasonable demand. and they are paid to provide a better living in singapore.<br><br>do we need PAP? yes we do, until we can find a better party.<br>do we need opposition party? yes we do too, so that we can really have a balance democracy society and to keep a check on govt policy. the reason why so many of us having anti sentiment is because we have yet to find a balance of power in the politcial scene that some of us feel the govt is having too much power and opposition is too weak to offer some form of resistance and questioning.<br><br>sometimes i just tell myself, the only time i can make a difference is during election time. i cast the vote whom i believe will make a difference in balancing the power dispite only 1 vote.</div>

Qitai, how do you conclude that I am opposing for the seek of opposing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So, by your logic, you don't want to run and get elected; then why should you ask people to run? There is one Chinese saying, you should not impose on others the things that are undesirable to you! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>This is nothing to do with whether PAP is doing a good job now or what; this is about instituitional building. Could you guarantee that the autocratic PAP could always be that good? The newer generation of leaders are not as good as the pioneers, so say many. Thus, what will happen in the future generation of leadership?<br><br>There isn't a "fair" comparison, Qitai. The only fair comparison is to put these PAP leaders into other country and ask them to run it; see what will turn out of it. IN fact, we do not need to do that, simply by observing the fiasco on Suzhou Industrial Park, we will know how good is good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>To rule a small country with million dollar ministers is a joke to start with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> People complain about leaders in the world are corrupt; eg. China. But have you ever thought of it this way, would they be as corrupt if they are given million dollar annual pay?<br><br>There isn't a fair comparison, Qitai. Singapore is just a very small country, not even the size of Shanghai! We took about 40 years to reach this far, but Shanghai only took 20 years to become a fully modernized city! How to compare? And it is going to surpass HK and Singapore probably in five to ten years' time! So, by your logic, their leaders are good or even better than PAP? Then why not outsource our political leadership to them? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Just joking.<br><br>Don't need to compare to places like Indonesia or some ulu ulu backward countries. We want to be Swiss Standard and world class, we must compare with the highest standard possible.<br><br>Thus, how good is good, is not the primarily question. How to be better, is the primarily question.

You can go to NYC or Tokyo if you like Mega cities. You get your extremely high property price there too since you like it so much. Ohh.. just to throw you some more goodies, you get to travel 1-2 hours each way to work and have to work till 10pm daily there too. I am sure you will like it there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I measure the (economic aspect of the) quality of the people's life base on their earning power compared to the cost of living.

My ideal country increase our pay but reduce our expenses, not just make mega city.<br><br>There are many other things when it comes to quality of life but I will not write a big essay here, a trend that seems to be getting popular here. I do not know if the durians are worth it, it cannot be measure in economic terms. But didn't people want more support for culture or non-economic pursue? You sure you know what the people want? Not just what you want? I don't support the building of the durians but I don't oppose it either. If enough people likes it and wants it, then we build it.<br><br>Sigh... don't know why I write so much. Talk too much liao. So, I shall stop.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Qitai,<br><br>Precisely! If you are not on our side, what gives you the right and power to tell people to cheong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>OK, you want the property price to go down, but there are lots of people in Singapore wants the property price to go up! Get it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>PAP has opened up the can of the paradox worms back in 1991 when it decided that property prices should go up because it thought that with people having "high stake" in their property (technically speaking, HDB flats aren't even considered as a long term stake!), they will not migrate and run away, staying back to fight any intruders in times of need. It has artificially pushed up the property prices, especially those HDB prices! And now you complain it is just too high and want it down? And still, you say PAP is good at managing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The fact is, either way, they lost. There is a downward sticky pricing mechanism installed in the pricing of HDB flats. After the crash of 1997, we are all stuck with inflated property prices, at the same time, negative assets. And you still want the property price to be down? It means that more private property holders will go bankrupt. It will mean that more Singaporeans will be stuck with negative assets for their whole life time!<br><br>The fact is, once PAP push the property prices up, there is no return from doom. Did you protest violently against such ill-conceived strategic policy move 12 years ago? I did. The rational is that we will create inter-generation wealth/income inequality and the high property prices will push up rent that will be detrimental to our economic progress. At the same time, it will mean higher prices and cost of living will go up. But everyone was singing praises all the way back then about the "ingenius" move!<br><br>We are stuck now, all thanks to PAP. Go down, cannot. Go up cannot.<br><br>Ironically, after 10 years of implementing such strategies, trying to give Singaporeans "ownership" of this country by material means (remember the SingTel shares distribution?), the Goh CT adminstration started to lament about stayers and quitters issue back in 2002! It has demonstrated the total collapse of the initial policy! And you still say they are good government?<br><br>Please refer to a study done by our own DOS (Dept of Statistics). If you are going to talk about quality of life, then we will talk about it. We, as one of the most advanced Asian economy , has earned the lone of the lowest percentage Wage to GDP ratio! What does that mean? It could only mean that the income distribution is very badly skewed. And how does that compared to quality of life to the general public?<br><br>Even PPP cannot define properly the "quality of life". People in Indonesia may be "jobless" but they live happily off their land, could Singaporeans do that?<br><br>However, you got it right. Property prices in Mega cities may be high, cost of living may be high, but their general wages are high too! And why shouldn't you compare the social welfare system? Isn't that an indicator of the minimum quality of life maintained in the system? And in fact, quality of life should include the stress level as compared to the wages they earn! It is not merely wages, but wage per hour of labour that matters.<br><br>How many people could afford a $300 ticket to goto the Durian for a play? If they pay anything less than that, then who is to foot the $50million yearly maintainence fees? There are people without jobs and without social welfare; without water and electricity, without knowing how the next meal will arrive; and you actually agree to a white elephant like the durians? I would rather put the $600million in banks, take the $1million interests generated to give out as social welfare! And furthermore, I save the $50million yearly maintenance fees and could well spend it on more meaningful sponsorship of cultural activities and groups! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>On the contrary, I think this discussion is getting somewhere. At least it makes you face the ugly side of PAP management.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">Okay, my patience has run out. Another chicken and duck talk here (direct Chinese Translation). Analogy all wrong too. I am not even on your side and you talking about me being a commander asking you to charge. *Peng.*<br><br>And also, let me tell you this - "I WANT THE PROPERTY PRICE TO GO DOWN, NOT UP!!!". Get it??!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And let me tell you this too - I look at the quality of life, and not build a mega city. You can go to NYC or Tokyo if you like Mega cities. You get your extremely high property price there too since you like it so much. Ohh.. just to throw you some more goodies, you get to travel 1-2 hours each way to work and have to work till 10pm daily there too. I am sure you will like it there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I measure the (economic aspect of the) quality of the people's life base on their earning power compared to the cost of living. The closest thing of what I have in mind is what they call the PPPGNIPC value. Even that is not good enough since it does not factor tax, social benfits and such. My ideal country increase our pay but reduce our expenses, not just make mega city.<br><br>There are many other things when it comes to quality of life but I will not write a big essay here, a trend that seems to be getting popular here. I do not know if the durians are worth it, it cannot be measure in economic terms. But didn't people want more support for culture or non-economic pursue? You sure you know what the people want? Not just what you want? I don't support the building of the durians but I don't oppose it either. If enough people likes it and wants it, then we build it.<br><br>Sigh... don't know why I write so much. Talk too much liao. So, I shall stop. This is leading nowhere again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
