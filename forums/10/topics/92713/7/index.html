            <div class='col-md body'>I will still reply to Paperchicken's second question:<br><br>2 MRT accidents. Do you think the authorities are indifferent. If you are an MP what will you do.<br><br>First of all, most of those are NOT accidents. Those are SUICIDES. IT just happens that those thinking of suicides like to do it in MRT. If they don't do it in MRT, they will do it elsewhere.<br><br>The solutions should be targeted towards the suicide tendency, not the means or ways that the suicides are taking place. To talk about putting up barriers in MRT station or putting hefty fines on those walking beyond the yellow line is just merely a passive step.<br><br>The question now lies in understanding why suicide rate is extremely high now in Singapore. More than one suicide per day? Have anyone heard about any PAP MPs mentioning this as a great concern?<br><br>If structural unemployment is going to stay as a permanent problem, we need a permanent solution to tackle this problem. A social welfare structure must be established.<br><br>Besides, from the mental health perspective, SOS hotlines and other social service hotlines should be well publicized.<br><br>AS for MRT, I think it is only right for them to enhance their stations. The lack of physical barriers may just be a design flaw. The only way to "entice" MRT to spend that amount of monies on barriers, is to increase the fines of MRT delays due to such human strategies to a very high prohibitive level. This is a "reverse" social engineering against the establishment. Else they will not find the "incentive" to install barriers and be totally "indifferent" approach, taking the easier and "profitable" way out of the problem!<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Paperchicken,<br><br>Maybe you are ignorant about how proper interviews work IN SINGAPORE. Try interviewing LKY or LHL like that and see what you get. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> For some simple questions, maybe they will entertain you. But for something more in depth, most probably they will ask you to send in your questions.<br><br>Impromtu interviews are very rare in Singapore. Before any reporters want to seek an interview with any politicians, opposition MPs included, they will have to send their questions to them. It is up to them to reply or say which questions they decline to reply. Sometimes, they actually "edit" the questions. What you see on TV is all edited. Some questions are not answered as the interviewees declined to answer. These shots are edited away and skipped. That's how it works.<br><br>I can see this forum is pretty active, but as compared to 3 million Singaporeans, these 2000 individuals are considered few. Most Singaoreans out there are either apathetic or with no views at all. This is not my opinion, but comments and feedbacks from my fellow friends in the mass media industry. If you are doubtful about that, try to ask the person sitting next to you on the MRT train about the current affairs questions.<br><br>After having saying that, I am all free and willing to participate in any forum discussions as I have always done so. But for some "sensitive" questions which cross the path of party politics, I will refrain from commenting. As I have said, there are proper channels to put the views in proper.<br><br>As far as I can see, the questions you have raised have no such political sensitivity. But I will still do it one at a time, for other people to disgest. Lumping everything together is not appropriate at all.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperchicken:</div><div class="quote_body">To Goh Meng Seng<br><br>You say you want to run for election.<br><br>You can win votes here by voiceing your views and opinion here.

Its also a good platform for you to voice your views.<br><br>The PAP politicians always like to stonewall and give standard answer.

Or most job for that matter. But they may be asking for $1200 while a foriegn worker asking for $400. So, should the work goes to a local or a foriegner?<br><br>(2) How to define if no Singaporean wants to take up the job offer before giving it to foriegn worker? Advertist for 6 months without takers? Or some other qualification?<br><br>(3) Does one needs to consider quality of work here?<br><br>Just some practical questions for considerations here. </div></blockquote>What I mean is if a Singaporean can do the job - mostly white collar side. We know most Singaporeans won't do low level jobs unless in pure desperation - 1200 dollars /month is reasonable for survival in Singapore - don't u think?. Of course no foreign worker would work for 400 bucks without accomodation- the rent in Singapore will bankrupt them  but I am refering more to foreign top level expats who get accomodation, cars and a nice LARGE salary . In Australia , if an employer wants to employ a foreigner , they have to write to the immigration department explaining why this foreigner has the skills that no australian can match.<br><br>Quality of work ...if the Singaporean is no good, get another Singaporean. Simple. Not all singaporeans are sloppy in their work , at the same time not all singaporeans are meticulous enough .</div>
