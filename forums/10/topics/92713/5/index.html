Sorry, I don't pity these people. They are the ones who cause the property to raise by speculating in property.<br><br>Those with just one property? They sell one, they buy one. So, price go up or down, sama sama. And what gives them the right to sell it at a higher price? They got off the hook, somebody else kenna stuck with the high price housing? So, problem just go from one Singaporean to another Singaporean.<br><br>So, is there any benefit to increase the housing price? Benefit who? Those with more than one property loh. Sorry, I cannot suppor that.<br><br>And price go down, CPI go down, the younger generation do not need to bear the burden of the old. Long term wise, it is good. You keep the housing price up, every generation suffer forever. Why do that? You mean since the older generation has already suffer on the housing price already, the young has to suffer the same thing too?<br><br>Mistake is made. So, what to do? To be fair and not too heartless to those who are already stuck, keep the housing stable and reduce it slowly over longer period of time. That is what I will do if I am in control. Jack up the price to help these people and make the future generation suffer as well? Sorry, I cannot agree with that.<br><br>Just my views on housing.</div>

He was asked by the property developers to study the trend and his conclusion was that we will be heading for a total burst by 1997. URA chided him for that conclusion and shut him up. The rest is history. This is the kind of "good govt" you are talking about! The extend of social engineering is scary.

And yet, you are here to claim that we have a "good" govt. How good is good? If they are really that good, we wouldn't be suffering continuous exodus of local talents every year for the past decade!<br><br>It is fine for you not to be on our side.

But you are at least better than Atobe, so I will reply.<br><br>For any entity, there is always a combination of good and bad. It is not always either you are perfect or you are absolute evil. I support PAP in general because they did a lot more goods than evil. I believe that there is gray. Maybe you believe in black and white only.<br><br>Also, I wouldn't put all the blame on property price on PAP. I would only blame them for intervening too late. There are many reasons the property price goes up. To analyse that is again another big topic. Yes, government plays a big role, but it is not just them who cause this. One of the big culprit of this is actually the buyer themselves - being willing to take insane loans and commitment assuming prices will only go up. No, I am not putting the blame on the people. I am just saying we are all at fault, buyers and government.</div>

I consider it a virtue to admit my self-deficiencies sometimes. In this case, I admit my lack of knowledge if there are indeed enough support for this durian. Abstaining is also a kind of vote. Acknowledging that someone else may have better information is also a virtue. You know you do not support the durian. We can safely assume the unemployed do not support the durian. But can we assume the rest of the other 3 Million citizen do not support the durian? What if there is 1.1 Million who supports it, 1 Million against it and 1.1 Million who choose to abstain? Should it be build?<br><br>The point I want to make is that you have your opinion, I have my opinion (abstaining is an opinion too). But neither of us can speak for the other 3.2 Million people.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Qitai,<br><br>AS I have said, this is nothing personal and will not be a mudslinging exercise.<br><br>This problem is wide spread, so much so that we take it as the "norm". Nobody likes to be "labeled" unfavourably. But I must admit, I am also one of the victim of this social engineering and "brain washing". To solve a problem, one must first admit there is this problem. Without such problem recognition, no problem would be solved as it seems that there isn't any problem.<br><br>I do not label you as anything just because you are not "on my side". No, not at all. I am the first one who shoot at Goh CT's labels of "Stayers and Quitters". But from your five little postings here, I could see the pattern evolving, as I have explained, why it shouldn't be so. And of course, it may be a pre-judgment on my part to blame such reactions from you to the social engineering process that we are constantly subjected to, throughout our whole life. This social engineering is even worst than the Matrix, I used to jest. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>What worries me is not whether you are on my side or not, but it is the way you see things, you judge/see things and you rationalize things. For example, to abstain from making a preferrence on a decision is very much different from saying, I will support anything if the "People want it". That's totally different attitude altogether. Whether other people want it or not, you don't have preference; you will not support nor against any decision made by others. That's what we call "abstaining". But your stand is totally different and could not materialize as we have already concluded nobody really knows what "the people want". We, as a part of the people, should determine on our part, what we want and not waiting to "conform" with other people's preference; that's what I am saying. It is the "conformist" attitude that I am worried about. Herd mentality evolves out of conformist attitude and could do great harm to a nation or any organizations.<br><br>I took special interest in your thinking process, not to throw mud at you, but just to point out, as a matter of fact, our society is deeply poisoned by the system of social engineering happening here in Singapore. Nothing against you, really.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">Sigh.... why do people has to always resort to making this kind of statement? Does agreeing (in general, but not always) with the government means I have been brainwashed? Do you need to label people that way just so you can get people to be on your side? Please stop using this kind of tactic. If you want discussion, we discuss. But please do not degenerate to that.<br><br>Also, please stop your assumption about me.

Nothing against you, really.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div></blockquote>Well, when I disagree, I say it. It is not as if I only say yes all the time. So, did I always say everything is perfect. NO! I defend when I think it is right and I criticised when I disagree. That is what I do. Anything wrong with that?<br><br>And if I am on the fence or feels that I am not qualified enough to say anything, I keep quiet, unless asked.<br><br>Let me share with you a piece of my mental build-up. If you keep supporting PAP on every issue, I will counter that. If you continously oppose every issue, I will counter that too. I have a build-in balancing mechanism in me. Wouldn't want to say it is good or bad. But that is just me.<br><br>Anyway, I never use the words "I will support anything if the "People want it"" hor. <strong>So, again, please do not put words into my mouth.</strong> If any of my choice of my words seems to say that, tell me. I will be more careful with the choice of words next time.<br><br>Additionally, no one is free from social influences. Have you ever heard of the word "mimes"? Ever wonder how coherant the opinions of any countries seems to be even though across countries, the opinion defers (E.g. Iraq War - you see how most french man oppose the war, while most Americans agree with the war). It is up to individual to exercise his free will to make a decision to filter information and resist conforming to the masses. You probably do not agree, but I always feel view myself as being quite successful in this area.<br><br>And let me just add - being free means not just not conforming to the government. It also means not conforming to the opposition. It means being yourself, having your own opinion. Throw away whether it is PAP or opposition. Disregard that. And that is when you truely achieve freedom of thoughts. And that is the highest level of freedom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Qitai,<br><br>I always take caution when looking at such "surveys". Who are the people being surveyed and what are the priorities are in their list? If these people "travel" alot within the places, then transportation cost will be given higher weightage. Singapore, being a small country, will definitely "cost less" simply because the cost of travelling from one end to another is determined by the size of the country/place.<br><br>Thus, it is NOT surprising that Jarkarta or Ho Chi Minh city may appear to be more expensive than Singapore; Or even Shenzhen, if you want to travel from one point to another, the distance we are talking about is normally above 100km! And within one day, you could have done many of these trips! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And if this survey is taken from expatriate or according to expatriates' lifestyle, of course, it doesn't reflect the real cost of living for the people there. It is really stupid to believe that people in China or Ho Chih Ming city could possibly sustain a high cost of living when they earn so much lesser than Singaporeans!<br><br>Thus, my first reaction to this survey is that, this survery is about cost of living for expatriates living in these cities. I have been to China, quite many places and experience the "normal people" lifestyle. The cost of having a meal could be extremely expensive, or that extremely cheap; depending on where you eat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">Goh Meng Seng,<br><br>I was just surfing the net to look at quality of life and cost of living.

What surprises me is that even Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are more expensive than Singapore.<br><br>Rank 2004     City                 Country          Index 2004<br>1             Tokyo                 Japan           130.7<br>4             Osaka                 Japan           116.1<br>5             Hong Kong                             109.5<br>7             Seoul                 South Korea     104.1<br>11            Beijing               China           101.1<br>16            Shanghai              China           95.3<br>20            Sydney                Australia       91.8<br>29            Hanoi                 Vietnam         85.6<br>30            Shenzhen              China           85.6<br>31            Taipei                Taiwan          85.3<br>32            Guangzhou             China           84.9<br>36            Ho Chi Minh City      Vietnam         84.5<br>45            Jakarta               Indonesia       83.9<br>46            Singapore                             83.6<br>67            Melbourne             Australia       77.5<br>80            Auckland              New Zealand     74.2<br>86            Wellington            New Zealand     72.8<br>87            Brisbane              Australia       72.7<br>88            Adelaide              Australia       72<br>94            Perth                 Australia       70.7<br>104           Kuala Lumpur          Malaysia        67.7<br>109           Mumbai                India           66.8<br>115           Tianjin               China           65.6<br>116           New Delhi             India           64.7<br>117           Dacca (Dhaka)         Bangladesh      64<br>119           Bangkok               Thailand        63.5<br>127           Colombo               Sri Lanka       60.4<br>132           Karachi               Pakistan        56.3<br>133           Chennai (Madras)      India           54.2<br>137           Bangalore             India           51.1<br>138           Manila                Philippines     48.8<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by goh meng seng:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Qitai,<br><br>I always take caution when looking at such "surveys". Who are the people being surveyed and what are the priorities are in their list? If these people "travel" alot within the places, then transportation cost will be given higher weightage. Singapore, being a small country, will definitely "cost less" simply because the cost of travelling from one end to another is determined by the size of the country/place.<br><br>Thus, it is NOT surprising that Jarkarta or Ho Chi Minh city may appear to be more expensive than Singapore; Or even Shenzhen, if you want to travel from one point to another, the distance we are talking about is normally above 100km! And within one day, you could have done many of these trips! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And if this survey is taken from expatriate or according to expatriates' lifestyle, of course, it doesn't reflect the real cost of living for the people there. It is really stupid to believe that people in China or Ho Chih Ming city could possibly sustain a high cost of living when they earn so much lesser than Singaporeans!<br><br>Thus, my first reaction to this survey is that, this survery is about cost of living for expatriates living in these cities. I have been to China, quite many places and experience the "normal people" lifestyle. The cost of having a meal could be extremely expensive, or that extremely cheap; depending on where you eat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div></blockquote>You are certainly right to be skeptical. I would be too. You can go to <a href="http://www.mercerhr.com/summary.jhtml/dynamic/idContent/1096705;jsessionid=1RXY0OYVHWCYWCIHAEEQOCAKMZSI4I2C" rel="nofollow"> mercer webpage</a> to see the details of how this survey is done. You need to register though. You can even ask for a result using different weightage if you are interested (you need to pay for this service though). A point to note is that in my search for this information, it is noted though that most of the webpage seems to derive information from this source anyway. Just search on google using "global cost of living ranking" and you will get several webpages which eventually points to this source. So, I guess it means it is reputable enough. If you can find other sources, let me know. We can always compare varies result from more than one sources. Only point to note that each source must be reputable and professional.<br><br>Anyway, even that, I still agree with you that it is best to get a hands-on experience and talked to local about the actual living condition rather than just these surveys. This is also why I like to talk to people from differenet countries on their cost of living. The man-on-the-street will usually be very frank about the cost there (mostly complaining). Making home visits and getting my hands on the property, cars etc brochure is also part of the things I do/collect while traveling.<br><br>Once you have done that, you may realize that actually Singapore is very good compare to a lot of countries. At least my comparison mostly ends up Singapore being in quite a favourable position.<br><br>Since you have been to China, do you think the income compared to the cost is better over there? And what is the typical income over there as well as the typical cost of living? Or for that matter, any country that you are quite knowledgable about.</div>
