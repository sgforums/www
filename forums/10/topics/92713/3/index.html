Second class here with a house and ample opportunities is much better. After all back home , u still have to compete with scholars (which u have no chance unless ur one ) or foreign talent for jobs and opportunities. Australia - once u prove ur worth and become an essential part of their company...they don't care what color, they will still promote u ....only initial part of proving urself can be abit of a hassle  ...but at least they don't condemn u at the first go<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Scorps,<br><br>Don't need to be bothered by those who tell you to migrate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If everyone tries to take the easier way out of problems, everyone will forever be LOSERS who will only think of running away once he/she meets obstacles.<br><br>If you need to work overseas, then go. But you must remember that you must come back to Singapore to exercise your voting right if the GE is called and your GRC is being contested. This is the most pro-active thing you could do as a citizen. There is no need to give up your citizenship and lose your roots here just because those people up there are screwing up the whole place with bad policies and management. You should instead, value your power and rights to change the status quo.<br><br>I used to be like you, an arm chair critic. Even up till now, I don't see anything wrong to be an arm chair critic because different people has different priorities and risk adversity. However, it strikes me one day when a PAP veteran criticize me of supporting an opposition that has no working faculties at all. IN my heart, I would prefer to have a balanced political system and thus my support for the opposition. But in my head, I know what he said is true and unbias; opposition back then, doesn't have the infrastructure, system and people to make it a viable instituition at all. From then on, I keep pondering about this for quite a while and decided that it is time for me to join an opposition party and make it working. I have since, never looked back after I have met up with Mr. Low TK and joined Workers Party.<br><br>However, I understand that not everybody could possibly make the same choice as I did. People have different commitments and considerations and we will have to respect that. But I believe, you are contributing to a better Singapore, however small it may be, by writting here, criticising and commenting about the ills of this society. No doubt about it. You could do even more if you join a political party, be it PAP, Workers Party or otherwise; but I think one has to live within his means.<br><br>The fact that you are writting, shows that you still care for this country. If everybody stop writting about this country, then that will be the great sad day for Singapore.<br><br>Keep it up. Don't need to be bothered by what other people think. Just believe in what you do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by scorps125:</div><div class="quote_body">btw i stay in sembawang grc zone ... it really takes time and effort and courage to voice out to the town council or MPs for ur zone any constructive feedbacks... there are jus so many things that the residents can do as a deciding factor in implementing some of the grc's plans ..e.g. lift upgrading, crime prevention programs, residents' welfare etc... I admit it will be tough jus whining it all here....Even this forum is visited by pro-PAP parties or those dedicated RC members... I dun wish much...I jus wish whether i migrate or not that our future generation's life in spore will be a much better and MORE DEMOCRATIC" one, if there EVER was democracy.</div></blockquote></div>
