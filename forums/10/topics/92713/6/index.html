From the look of the several websites pointing to those data, I have enough reason to believe those are unrelated websites. Of course I may be wrong. But I just post what I can find. Anyway, it is not my job to convince you here. I think those figures are believable base on what I have read and I think it is good to share those figures, so I post it loh. But you keep throwing doubts at it without checking if there is any observable reason to doubt it.<br><br>I do not owe anyone to justify those data, okay? This is just something I like to look at in my free time, compare how each country is doing. And I am just sharing those data since I always hear people say Singapore cost of living high etc etc.<br><br>If you doubt it, go and study mercer website loh. I already show you the source of those data. What else you expect me to do?<br><br>You disappointed, I also bo bian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lah, not possible to give you everything; even googles doesn't keep archive for a decade.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Just talk about the most recent PM Lee's national rally speech of urging the youth to "take ownership" of Singapore. ACtually, the first time I raise this "ownership" thing was back in 2002, when PM GOH put on the "Stayer and Quitter" labels.<br><br>There are two main articles, one in 2002, one in 2003.<br><br>Here they are:<br><br>In 2002, 29/11:<br><br>http://groups.google.com.hk/groups?q=madcow++ownership&amp;hl=zh-<br>TW&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=3de7a051%40news.starhub.net.sg&amp;rnum=1<br><br>Chris, it sometimes bug me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>People claim so loudly that they are "fighting" for the "freedom" of<br>Singapore... freedom of speech, freedom of going on rally<br>march....but at<br>the end of the day, they just want "freedom" for themselves to "screw"<br>others! To criticise PAP is ok and deem as the "rights" and "freedom"<br>that<br>they are "fighting" for; but when it is their turn to be "screwed"<br>(excuse<br>my language, I seldom use such unsightly words) and criticized, it is<br>their<br>"freedom" to tell people to "shut up"!<br><br>This is the whole irony of "Opposition politics" that I don't see eye<br>to<br>eye.<br><br>The "Power" of people is not getting jailed and bankrupeted but<br>rather, the<br>ability to reflect upon oneself.<br><br>I have been quite sympathetic towards the various "hardship" that<br>various<br>"prominent" opposition members are going through. I could almost<br>instantly<br>pointed out the various "unfairness" in treatments towards these<br>individuals. However, when I sat down and ponder over it since last<br>election, my religious belief had provided a light to all these<br>miserable<br>sufferings. Karma.... the most fundamentals of "cause and effect" is<br>actually repeatedly effecting sufferings to these individuals. And it<br>seems<br>that they are really too absorbed in this cycle of "bad karma"<br>unknowingly,<br>so much so that they are all blinded by the "poisons" in their mind.<br><br>As for press freedom, I would agree with you that it is the ability to<br>interpret "news" from different angles that matters. I am no<br>different from<br>many people, living under the "proporgandas" mass media for most of my<br>youth. At one point of time, I even "worship" LKY as a super idol! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It is in the later part of my life, I have learnt to "dissect" News<br>to see<br>clearly what it is to tell what exactly it was. It has been clear to<br>me that<br>it is the "ANGLE" that makes the critical difference.... even hard<br>cold<br>"statistics" could fool you in forming your perspective! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>However, I have found out that most Singaporeans, especially the<br>youth, are<br>just too "lazy" to "remake" their perceptions or just totally<br>apathetic<br>towards current affairs. They would take whatever the newspapers say<br>as<br>"Truth" without second thought. Such lacking of "creativity" in<br>dissection<br>and reformulating information into different angles and perspectives<br>is the<br>direct result of our rigid education system. The ability to<br>think "twice" or<br>"thrice" (from different perspectives) about whatever information<br>given to<br>you is a very important steps in creative thinking.<br><br>Thus to me, it is ironic that our govt is all giving talks<br>about "creative<br>thinking", "creativity" but in actual fact, their tight control over<br>the<br>media is detrimental to such efforts! Some of my friends in the mass<br>media<br>would tell me that the "social spiritual aspiration" of our fellow<br>Singaporeans are really very low. They score almost nil in having any<br>concerns of the society as a whole, be it social economic aspect or<br>just<br>social justice in perspective. Why is this so? We used to have<br>a "vibrant"<br>society with many highly respected people with great aspiration in<br>maintaining social awareness back in the 50s, 60s or even early 70s!<br>But all<br>these people have somehow turned apathetic towards almost everything<br>that<br>concerns the society as a whole! If you look at the press and media<br>back in<br>50s and 60s, you can find many high quality and inspirational<br>writtings that<br>put concerns on the welfare of the society as whole; be it in debates<br>on<br>politics, self-rule, independence or otherwise. IN Chinese, this is<br>termed<br>as the period of "blossom of hundred flowers". In fact, it is with<br>such high<br>quality social awareness and dynamic aspiration towards the social<br>welfare<br>that bonded so many people together to contribute towards the<br>formation of<br>Nantah. This spirit has since totally demolished, destroyed and<br>trashed with<br>the closing of Nantah. The great power of "mobilization" through such<br>highly<br>inspirational writtings in the media had been a "miracle" of the past<br>that<br>could not be remade at present.<br><br>IT is precisely the lack of such social awareness and social<br>participation<br>that resulted in the "Quitter &amp; Stayer" scenerio. When you do not<br>have the<br>sense of "ownership" of this place, there will be nothing left here<br>to be an<br>"excuse" for you stay on. Such "ownership" isn't exactly what GCT<br>perceived<br>it to be.... ownership of SingTel shares, HDB flats... etc etc. Such<br>sense<br>of "ownership" could only be found in the process of social<br>participation in<br>all aspects, including politics. The inability of PAP govt to realize<br>the<br>importance of diversity in all aspects of social life is a remarkable<br>oversight on their part!<br><br>It is only natural for people to yearn for "social justice" to be in<br>place.<br>When what you see are all "tilted" towards one side, such "soccer<br>game" is<br>just very boring as the result is so much "predictable"! It is only<br>when you<br>have a truly leveled playing field for everyone and the diversity<br>within the<br>game, it will make people interested and gains loyalty towards the<br>game!<br><br>Thus it is a grave mistake that PAP govt had chosen to ignore the<br>committee<br>on politics in remaking Singapore and just brush away such important<br>critics<br>and recommendations that could have change the whole attitude of the<br>society! PAP govt has been talking about social bonding and social<br>bonding<br>without actually knowing what is exactly wrong with our social<br>bonding.<br>Social bonding will only come when one feels the sense of "ownership"<br>towards the society! (Just like the "ownership" the Chinese, who had<br>contributed, feel towards Nantah) And without a diverse and yet<br>leveled<br>playing field, nobody will want to be bother about participating in<br>events<br>that could have moulded the society's direction and maturity.<br><br>The recent answers by the minister of state Dr. Ho about why political<br>gathering or rallies are "tightly" controlled, is a gross<br>demonstration of<br>the total lack of understanding on what constitute an important role<br>in<br>social bonding that would prevent more people from turning<br>into "quitters"!<br>All people needs attention; by participating in social gathering such<br>as<br>political rallies or gathering will give the people the opportunity of<br>expressing their needs of attention. By merely approving the license<br>of such<br>gathering will show these people that the govt respect their will in<br>such<br>social participation. By turning down such requests for fear of some<br>"bogeyman" theory is really a pathetic move in curbing social<br>participation<br>by the people. When these people feel that they are not wanted in<br>social<br>participation of any sorts, they will turn pessimistic and the<br>feeling of<br>"ownership" of this place call Singapore will disappear! How could<br>you ever<br>hope to promote strong social bonding by turning down such functions<br>that<br>provide the opportunity for people to groom their social<br>participation and<br>thus create social bonding?<br><br>If one day, we no longer attract any people to attend even<br>an "opposition"<br>party rallies, it would mean that we would be doomed as a Nation!<br>Such sense<br>of "ownership" and "social participation" will be lost forever and we<br>might<br>have only "zombies" in our homeland.<br><br>I feel that PAP govt should be GLAD instead of feeling threaten when<br>there<br>is a large crowd attending political social gathering or rallies; it<br>just<br>shows that people still CARE about Singapore's politics and social<br>well<br>being. There is still a little bit left in sense of "ownership". The<br>more<br>you try to curb such social participation, the worst you will get in<br>loosing<br>local born Singaporeans.<br><br>If there are more and more people who step out and write critics on<br>govt<br>policies, PAP govt should not feel offended or defensive about it...<br>worst,<br>offensive about it. It is only natural in a democratic society. And<br>they<br>should be HAPPY that social awareness (which is linked directly to<br>social<br>bonding) is rising and people still care to participate in social<br>debates!<br><br>If there are more and more people who step out to join "Pro-Singapore"<br>political parties, be it PAP (ruling) or non-ruling parties, PAP govt<br>should<br>feel glad about it, not feel threaten by such environment. The more<br>PAP govt<br>exerts the elements of "FEAR" into Singaporeans with regards to social<br>participation as in politics, the more it is working towards breaking<br>up<br>social bonding.<br><br>So, as usual, I digress. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It seems to me that PAP govt is just in the tunnel of darkness; they<br>knew<br>the problems, however, it is ironic that sometimes, they just do the<br>opposite things to aggreviate the problems <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>MADCOW<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperchicken:</div><div class="quote_body">Can you create the link here or better still just post your ideas here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Second reference:<br><br>In 2003, 25/06<br><br>http://groups.google.com.hk/groups?q=madcow++ownership&amp;hl=zh-<br>TW&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=3ef97610%40news.starhub.net.sg&amp;rnum=4<br><br>Hello Katami,<br><br>You reminds me about Dr. Kevin Tan who has been featured in recent ST<br>Insight.<br><br>He had spend 15 years talking to "air" and what he gets is only<br>disappointment and inaction from PAP regime. He even got<br>the "bashing" from<br>PAP for commenting on the "confusing" elected Presidency.....<br><br>His fire has somehow "died" after facing such "inaction" and I think<br>he<br>feels that all his "good advices" had fallen on death ears.<br><br>We must face the reality of PAP "dictatorship"; a poitical system that<br>doesn't emcompass healthy competition will only breed arrogance and<br>monopolistic behaviour from the ruling party. I am just like Dr.<br>Kevin Tan<br>and you, believing that by sitting in front of our keyboards, we could<br>possibly get "somebody" to "listen" to us, and make changes<br>accordingly. No<br>doubt, they do once a while, "responded" to our "calling", but you<br>would<br>have noticed that such reaction is really very slow and reactive.<br><br>There is really no room for non-partisan politics in Singapore. You<br>want<br>people (be it Singaporeans or PAP) to take you seriously, you must be<br>prepared to lay down your life, assets and everything you have, and<br>stand by<br>your ideals and words. We are afterall, decent people who think "a<br>little<br>more" and have a little more concerns for the well being for a<br>country call<br>Singapore. We should stand up as a true warrior to stand by our words<br>and<br>ideals.<br><br>Political competition will only be good for both PAP and Singapore in<br>the<br>long run. I just happen to know the vast pathetic state of affairs<br>happening<br>in RCs.... A friend of mine is a member of RC, though he had only<br>attended<br>two events in his RC. He had not attended any functions for months but<br>recently, he still get his "appointment letter" from PAP govt! Why?<br>It could<br>only be that PAP govt has really hard time to find young and dedicated<br>people to join RC! And the situation is "bearable" basically because<br>there<br>isn't any "threat" of competition from the opposition camp!<br><br>As a member affliated to Workers' Party, I have to encourage my<br>friend to be<br>more active in RC activities! Citing the reasons that if young people<br>don't<br>come out from their comfortable pigeon hole to take ownership of the<br>country<br>right now, there will be a crisis of lineage from the old guard to the<br>young. If that happens, the social bonding will be adversely<br>affected. All<br>this development is really unhealthy for the future development of<br>Singapore, whereby the sense of belonging and ownership will drop to<br>the<br>bottom.<br><br>The only way we could "jerk" the PAP govt into more active<br>recruitment and<br>actions on the ground is to compete against it.<br><br>The recent mass media coverage on Workers' Party renewal process has<br>created<br>a healthy "awakening" from the original apathetic lot of<br>Singaporeans. The<br>hit rate on Workers' Party website shot up tremendously. This is a<br>hint that<br>there is some hope at the end of the tunnel that Singporeans still<br>care and<br>bother to find out things more "political". Apart from that, our<br>recruitment<br>drive and outreach efforts have been met with overwhelming respnose<br>from the<br>ground. It shows that deep down alot of people's heart, they are still<br>concern about our country's political future.<br><br>After having saying that, I think if you really want to contribute<br>constructively to the development of our country's political future,<br>you<br>should make your stand, get yourself involve in partisan politics, be<br>it PAP<br>or Workers' Party or otherwise. Some believe they could join PAP and<br>create<br>changes from within.... but what we have witnessed so far is that<br>these<br>people had been "drown" by PAP instead.<br><br>Unfortuntaely, I have heard that SDP is fragmented and their youth<br>group is<br>basically "defunct" to a certain extent. SDP is basically dying a slow<br>death. It is really a pity that SDP, having once been the "strongest"<br>opposition party when it won three seats in the parliarment, had<br>deteriorated into such a pathetic state. I think it is time for Dr.<br>Chee to<br>rethink his party's overall strategy and political approach; if we<br>look at<br>the political era as a market place, obviously, his political<br>branding and<br>approach has no "demand" from the "onsumers", Signaporeans at large.<br><br>Workers' Party is actively recruiting new blood into its rank and<br>file. And<br>I believe with your aspiration of "good" towards Singapore society and<br>Singaporeans as a whole, Workers' Party's "Pro-Singapore" and<br>"Pro-Singaporeans" stand will resonate with your ideals well.<br><br>If no young ones are to take ownership of Singpapore as a whole,<br>there will<br>not be a land call Singapore in essence. If there is no young ones<br>who are<br>willing to step forward to join political parties, there will be no<br>PAP or<br>other political parties... opposition politics will extinct one day.<br><br>MADCOW<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a teaser on CPF:<br><br>http://www.google.com.hk/groups?q=CPF+group:soc.culture.singapore+author:MADCOW&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=3bec146c%40news.starhub.net.sg&amp;rnum=1<br><br>PAP Govt, through the civil service and GLCs, are the one who will going to<br>benefit tremendously by this CPF cut as they employed about 40% of Singapore<br>workforce.<br><br>Due to this simple fact, it will create a depressionary pressure on the<br>economy if such "savings" are not re-injected into the economy. It would<br>mean that instead of having budget deficit, PAP govt may just have budget<br>surplus during economic downturn. Due to the increase in GST, govt revenue<br>at half time already increased by 5%!<br><br>Sometimes it makes one wonder whether such CPF cuts is necessary or not, or<br>isit for the purpose of saving GLCs from the red, instead of helping to<br>retain MNCs from relocating?<br><br>My guess is that foreign MNCs will sooner or later, shift out of Singapore<br>and there is nothing we could do to prevent this from happening. Thus<br>whether such across the board CPF cut is necessary will remain to be seen.<br><br>AFter the massive round of "asset enhancement" back in 1990s, we have been<br>forcefully put on the path of no return. It is impossible to pay for your<br>mortgage with your CPF in full if the CPF is cut to 30% when they have<br>increased your contributions to Medisave and Special accounts.<br><br>Imagine that a household with total income of $4000 will not be able to pay<br>their mortgage for a four room flat that cost $200,000 when the 30% CPF will<br>only puts in less than $700 in ordinary account. This is cost a great middle<br>class crunch and it will create a deterrence effect to young couples<br>planning to marry.<br><br>The social-economical impact of the 6% cut in CPF will be too wide to be<br>estimated.<br><br>As we are faced with STRUCTURAL economic problems, retaining sectors that<br>are STRUCTURALLY unsound to our economic model would be unwise. And since it<br>is "STRUCTURAL" in nature, a blunt and crude method like a cut of 6% of CPF<br>across the board is not a good method at all. There are still companies<br>making money and such CPF cut would mean a "windfall" given by Govt at the<br>expense of the workers.<br><br>CPF should not be used as a economic policy instrument at all. It may be<br>very tempting and easy to use but it is ineffective to address specific<br>problems happening at specific area.<br><br>PAP govt should let the Labour Unions at various economic sectors to play<br>the important role of managing and fighting for workers' welfare and<br>preventing them from being "exploited". Allowing companies that are making<br>money to have a cut on workers' pay, be it CPF or otherwise, is an<br>exploitation!<br><br>That is why I think the Labour Chief should step down as he doesn't know<br>what he is talking about when he urge for CPF cut, as much as possible!<br><br>Employers' and employees' welfare and benefits should be balanced up,<br>especially so during economic downturn when unscrupulous employers will<br>always tend to utilize such situation to exploit employees even when they<br>are making money. The check and balance should be provided by the labour<br>unions.<br><br>Govt is just taking an easier way out for employers to make a statutory cut<br>on the CPF so that the power of labour unions in exercising checks and<br>balance  would be marginalized.  This should not be so.<br><br>If the PAP govt really thinks that in some sector, there should be drastic<br>cut, then let the employer and employee negotiate for it. Even though I<br>strongly oppose PAP govt using CPF cuts as policy instruments, I think at<br>the very worst, it should be done in a way that more flexibility should be<br>exercised so that welfare of workers (especially those in profit making<br>industries) should be safe guarded.<br><br>My proposal would be, take out the six percent and turn it into a variable<br>component. For civil service and GLCs, this variable component should not be<br>cut as by doing so, they will put on deflationary pressures on local pte<br>consumptions and expenditure. For foreign MNCs, let the unions go and<br>negotiate. That is the best out of the worst thing the govt should do.<br><br>MADCOW</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Paperchicken,<br><br>As far as I am concerned, my mission here is to dispel ill-conceived perceptions people like you have against opposition party members.<br><br>You claim we don't have ideas, but have you done any research before you utter these words? I have just given you the links, and here is a more important link to Singapore parliament house whereh you could search and see for yourselves, the numerous ideas, suggestions and speeches made by opposition MPs. Compare the average 270 speeches to some PAP MPs who only make only a few speeches during their term of office! Here is the link:<br><br>http://www.parliament.gov.sg/parlweb/hansard_search_latest.jsp<br><br>But I will still oblige you with my little PERSONAL view on the selected topics. I will start with Dr. Chee's issue.<br><br>First and foremost, I am not a fan of Dr. Chee, else I wouldn't be in Workers' Party instead of SDP now. I do not subscribe to his confrontational approach, which is doing more harm than good to alternative politics. But before anyone writes him off, have you read his various books? "Dare to Challenge"? Here again, we are forming our perceptions and likings, subject to the manipulations of local Mass Media. Just like our mass media seldom report on Opposition MPs' speeches, giving people the impression that they did not have ideas or any "worthy contributions", but the fact is, they have contributed much more than any PAP MPs. You will have to do your own research to find out the truth.<br><br>If you are asking me the question of "harm", then I would ask you back, what "harm" are you talking about? Embarrassing us or our court, internationally? This is just like asking whether we should blame the one who pointed out our mistakes to the world to know, instead of blaming ourselves for the mistakes made. Yes, he has caused embarrassment to us, as a country. But where does the actual harm lies? So far, neither the court nor the CJ has replied with respect to his claim of unfair treatment. Why?<br><br>Yes, he should be blamed for the embarrassment we suffered, but not the "harm".<br><br>If you are referring to the ST's article, SDP Destination Unknown, then I refer to my views posted in YPAP forum:<br><br>http://www.youngpap.org.sg/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=3326<br><br>"I think this Ernest Chee has big political ambition. Don't know his age or eight characters, else can do a bit of calculations on him!<br><br>SDP, though has very much neglected its ground work and being distracted by bad publicity brought about by Dr. Chee, has somehow complemented what is lacking in local alternative politics. The exposure to the international community may be a necessary move in the later stage of development. However, Dr. Chee has jumped the gun. The timing is not right, just yet. I think we shouldn't jump the gun and write down SDP totally at this stage.<br><br>There is a subtle political motive in having this article published in ST at this particular timing. Have you ever wonder why the initial request of bringing forward the trial dates have been "reversed" at the last minute? The trial cannot be "more important" than official business and there isn't really a necessity to change official arrangement just to fit the trial. It could have been postponed to later dates if both parties are busy during the original trial dates! (instead of bringing forward to 26 Aug).<br><br>The timing is one of political considerations. The new PM is going to give a great speech of "Ownership", "Inclusive" society on 22 Aug; how could there be suddenly a law suit against a political rival right after such speech of "Inclusiveness"? Obviously, the timing is not right to bring forward to 26 Aug.<br><br>They should have done away with the law suit altogether, just to keep the promising speech of the new PM alive, entrenched in Singaporeans' heart. That would be the greatest convincing move to show Singaporeans that the new PM means it when he talks about inclusiveness, accompanied by this act of goodwill and tolerance. This would be something like what the new PM over the causeway has done, letting Anwar free as a man, in a National recouncilation effort, showing to the world and Malaysians that this new PM is a man of his own, living out of the shadow of the ex PM Mahathir.<br><br>But alas, they have to do it to show consistence to past practices. But to "minimize" this negative impact on the new PM, something must be shown to "justify" this move. Thus, showing Dr. Chee as an opposition leader "not worthy" to lead the once glorious SDP and how his leadership could have brought upon a weakening of SDP, is the best way to "subtlely justify" such demolition of him in this defamation suit.<br><br>The perception projected is this, "Dr. Chee has brought disaster to the once glorious SDP, he deserves no sympathy even as an opposition leader if he is to be bankrupted by the two ex-PM". Of course, to make the article "looks" neutral, one sentence mentioned good about Workers' Party will do the trick. This is why the author did not go further than that one sentence!<br><br>Look beyond the words, even beyond the "between the lines".<br><br>Goh Meng Seng "<br><br>I think we should give a fair assessment to a contraversial person like Dr. Chee, always bearing in mind that most of the "negativity" has been projected by local mass media. IT is up to each and everyone of us to really do indepth research on Dr. Chee, going through his works and books, to understand him more, before we pass comments or judgments.<br><br>This is not to say I support him, or vice versa. But to me, politics is about perceptions. And I am very wary about perception projected by our local mass media. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Paperchicken,<br><br>I couldn't believe you! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Who is being evasive? I have finished answering the first questin, so? I have already shown you where to get info on what Workers' Party views...<br><br>Just admit it, you are just plain bias. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Couldn't take the fact gracefully. If you got any strong comments about my opinion on Dr. Chee, so spew it out! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You are just chanting your ill-conceived perception again and again, without able to put any value to it! I am really amused. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I will be answering your second question tomorrow. I thought I could do it one at the time, giving you some time to respond but I am truly mistaken. You don't have anything in your head at all to comment!<br><br>Keep chanting your sutra for the moment. I will post again tomorrow. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperchicken:</div><div class="quote_body">To Goh Meng Seng<br><br>As far as I am concerned, your presence here has to reinforced ill-conceived perceptions people like us have against opposition party members.<br><br>There are good opposition members like Low and Chiam and Slyvia Lim.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are really going to run for election. You must remember one thing. The voter is always right. Never criticise your voter. Second thing always be humble.<br><br>You say ppl are plain bias. If Low or Chiam or Slyvia Lim contest in the election ppl will support them because they already have a track record ppl know who they are.<br><br>You are just a newcomer a nobody yet you go around bragging about your "bright ideas".<br><br>You complain that the media is biased. Well you have an opportunity to voice your views why arent you taking it.<br><br>Dun waste you time at sammyboy type of forums. Those ppl are anti-govt they will vote for you. If you really want to win you have to get the vote of the middle ground here.<br><br>If you want ppl to respect you, you have to earn it.<br><br>If you cant step out of your comfort zone you will never make any progress.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest a few policies for whoever who wants to be a politician<br><br>1. Job protection for all Singaporeans - old and young . No foreigners are to take a job a Singaporean cannot do unless ur talking about employing an nobel prize for economics winner etc. Restrict  sponsorship/scholarship of 10 top foreigners  per year.<br><br>2. Reduce the number of ministries and ministers . Reduce the pay of the ministers to maybe standard rates comparable with most countries...which would make it around 200k /annum.<br><br>3. No mayors - waste of money . We have MPs already in each constituent. They do the job of the mayors.<br><br>4.All money remaining from cutting minister's pay and mayor's jobs - goes to essential needs such as attracting companies to the region , healthcare , education<br><br>5. Reduce streaming to secondary 2 - if they can do it ...they do express /normal/gifted . Allow students to jump the grades or train them in uni type of subjects if they have capabilities to do so . Allow students to take part in vacation workplace attachments to see how working life is,so that would be a replacement for those who don't want ECAS .<br><br>Just some suggestions.....only ...for those potential politicians.<br><br></div>
