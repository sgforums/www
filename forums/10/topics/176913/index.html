            <div class='col-md body'>Classic Singapore Ills<br><br>===============================<br>In her 40s, back with a degree - but no job<br><br>Feb 3, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>I WAS elated to be able to join my family for the recent Chinese New Year reunion dinner after missing the past two years' to pursue a degree in Australia.<br><br>Although I am happy to be back in Singapore, I faced an uphill task re-entering the workforce, due to my age. I am in my 40s.<br><br>Employers are reluctant to recruit older candidates because they believe such workers are not healthy and would cost them in medical expenses. I find such discrimination grossly unfair.<br><br>As the population ages, Singapore needs to keep older workers employed for longer. Older candidates should be assessed and recruited according to the same criteria as younger ones.<br><br>If this issue is not addressed soon, older job seekers would become disillusioned and leave Singapore to take up jobs overseas. It would be a shame to lose talented, able and healthy workers to other developed countries due to this age discrimination.<br><br>Why should we be penalised when we have taken up the Government's challenge to upgrade our skills and qualification?<br><br>Sharon Lee Soh Leng (Ms)<br></div>
