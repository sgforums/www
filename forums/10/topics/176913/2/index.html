            <div class='col-md body'>from st forum.<br><br><strong>Blow the whistle on discrimination against older workers </strong><br><br>I REFER to the letter, 'In her 40s, back with a degree - but no job' (ST, Feb 3), by Ms Sharon Lee Soh Leng.<br><br>Blow the whistle on discrimination against older workers<br><br>It is one of those sad stories that make people sometimes lose faith in the prevailing hiring practices and workplace accreditation systems.<br><br>It is ironic that some companies and organisations spend so much money and effort on getting recognised for workplace excellence - for example through achieving the People's Developer Standard, and by coaching and developing staff to reach greater professional heights -but do not act consistently upon their beliefs when it comes to hiring older workers who have taken up the Government's challenge to upgrade their skills. The myth that younger employees are better, healthier and more energetic must be debunked. There are scores of younger workers who cannot take the heat and job-hop all too often.<br><br>What the older workers lose out in terms of age, they more than make up in experience, character and maturity of thought.<br><br>To improve herself, Ms Lee would, most probably, have had to leave the security of her previous job, pluck herself from a familiar environment and be deprived of the warmth and smiles of loved ones. Despite all these, she triumphed and this speaks of the tenacity, courage, resilience and passion in her.<br><br>To live a fulfilling life without regrets, one must follow the heart, dare to dream and be willing to embark on the journey of self-renewal and unlimited possibilities. I recall how I felt encouraged when listening to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong make his inaugural National Day Rally speech at the NUS University Cultural Centre two years ago. To paraphrase from memory, he said the Government would give us wings so that we might fly, be exposed to the world, blossom, and then come back enriched and contribute to Singapore.<br><br>Yet it seems to me that when some of us like Ms Lee fly back to make our contributions, we become disillusioned and have our wings clipped and dreams dashed.<br><br>Our society cannot move forward if employment practices limit human potential. I urge the authorities to tighten the process of monitoring organisations that do not adhere to the guidelines spelt out in the code of responsible employment practices which advocate that staff should be treated fairly and be recruited based on skills, experience and capability.<br><br>The whistle must be blown on companies that discriminate, based on age or otherwise, and the appropriate penalty meted out.<br><br>Lena Soh Kwee Kim (Ms)<br></div>
