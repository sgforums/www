            <div class='col-md body'>Jim Rogers, a former partner of George Soros in the famed Quantum Fund.<br><br>The fund manager, who has traveled extensively in emerging markets and lives part of the year in Asia, says sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi and Singapore that recently made large investments in Citigroup and UBS AG (UBS, news, msgs) <span style="color: red;">are likely to lose a lot of money on their ploys</span>. "They're making a big mistake; these banks have many more problems still ahead. They should wait until these companies are really on the ropes a few years from now . . . and trading at $5 a share."<br><br>But aren't they supposed to be the smart money? Maybe not. "I know these people, <strong>and they have never given me the impression that they're smarter than anyone else</strong>," Rogers says.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Greed Stampede</strong><br>by Eric Margolis<br><br>NEW YORK Â– Western nations have been rightly scourging China for flooding world markets with toxic food, toys, nutritional products, clothing and other tainted goods. ChinaÂ’s government closed its eyes to this malefaction.<br><br>But meanwhile, Wall Street was exporting toxic financial instruments called sub-prime mortgages around the globe. WashingtonÂ’s regulatory monkeys saw no more evil than those in Beijing.<br><br>HereÂ’s how the sub-prime mess developed. A single mother, say in East St Louis, was peddled an initially low interest adjustable mortgage by a flim-flam broker. When rates rose sharply, she couldnÂ’t pay and was forced to abandon the home she should never have bought to begin with. Multiply this little human tragedy by hundreds of thousands, and, voilÃ , the spreading sub-prime mortgage crisis.<br><br>Meanwhile, the worldÂ’s leading financial institutions built a $500 billion to $1 trillion house of cards based on these sleazy mortgages. They were bundled, chopped up like stolen cars, and peddled everywhere as secure, high-yielding American securities.<br><br>Once the sub-prime crisis broke, banks holding such `Chinese paper,Â’ to use an old Wall Street term, panicked. Not only couldnÂ’t they find any more stupid buyers, the wildly inflated values they gave these securities turned out to be totally bogus. This, in turn, gravely undermined the asset base of lending institutions holding `Chinese paper.Â’<br><br>BritainÂ’s Northern Rock (aka `Northern WreckÂ’) suffered a run on the bank and is now clinically dead. CIBC lost up to $2 billion. Two of the worldÂ’s biggest banks, Citicorp and UBS, lost $9 and $10 billion respectively. They nearly capsized, and had to be rescued by Gulf Arabs and Singapore. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley face $9-10 billion of write-downs. More banks will soon reveal billions of losses, all thanks to `innovate finance.Â’<br><br>How could the brightest Wall StreetÂ’s financiers, who claim unrivaled expertise in managing clientÂ’s assets, be so stupid and incompetent?<br><br>After the flu and bad taste, few diseases are more contagious than greed. So began the greed stampede as Wall Street bulls charged into the sub-prime Valley of Death.<br><br>Blame begins with the Bush Administration. Faced with hugely expensive foreign wars and the dot com bubble, the White House got Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to nearly nothing. This produced the monster property bubble that is now bursting. Cheap credit became a dangerous drug, financial `speedÂ’ arousing false economic euphoria that helped keep Republicans in power and fueled swarms of unregulated, parasitic hedge funds.<br><br>Rock bottom US interest rates made bankers and investors search out higher paying investments. Sub-prime mortgages were Wall StreetÂ’s answer. In a giant Ponzi scheme, new investor money was used to pay off old investors, building a giant pyramid that collapsed this past fall.<br><br>The US Federal Reserve, which is supposed to regulate mortgages, failed its duty. So did other US financial regulators, like Treasury and the SEC. They, and auditing firms, allowed banks to egregiously misvalue their mortgage holdings and create `conduitsÂ’ and `off balance sheetÂ’ vehicles that were new forms of accounting fraud.<br><br>Many bankers and managers simply failed to understand the mind-numbing complexity of financial derivatives. President George Bush lauded `the new financeÂ’ as the model of Republican economic policy. It turned out to be Â– the financial equivalent of Iraq. Worryingly, no one knows how much the worldÂ’s rickety financial structure now depends on these arcane financial alchemies. We enter 2008 threatened by the prospect of new financial earthquakes and recession.<br><br>Instead of facing fraud indictment, CEOÂ’s of the big peddlers of `Chinese paperÂ’ got millions worth of golden handshakes, or raises. While government was busy prosecuting Conrad Black over $3 million, the public was defrauded of tens of billions. No one has yet been prosecuted for these outrageous crimes.<br><br>If there was a time for government to justify its existence, itÂ’s now. Prosecute the sub-prime fraudsters, from salesmen to CEOÂ’s. Forget golden handshakes. They deserve steel handcuffs.<br><br><a href="http://www.ericmargolis.com/archives/2007/12/the_greed_stamp.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ericmargolis.com/archives/2007/12/the_greed_stamp.php</a></div>

If it is up, then this thread is dead.<br><br>At the moment 27 Dec 2007, the major indexes are trading at near the highs.  So the probability that Temasek and GIC make money on their equity investments is higher.  For the long term, lets wait ten years to see how this billion dollars investments go.</div></blockquote>Ask Prince Al Waleed... He's laughing all the way to the bank today... after all, he owns a share in one of the most valuable one: Citigroup... Bought in when they were distressed and its one of his most valuable holdings now.<br><br>I'm a little amused cos I thought Jim Rogers was quite close to UBS... seems rather ungentlemanly to slime a former close associate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyways, his expertise is on commodities... And UBS does have a strong commodities trading business...<br><br>So why is he (a) sliming a bank he was known to be close to before and (b) sliming a bank that does have a strong commodities trading business, exactly the growth area he is so bullish about?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GIC was deduced to be losing money by people observing that they hired and fired their top people frequently and turn-over there is also quite high.  This is known in the market.  Till now, little is known about GIC's exposure to what type of investments.  With the latest buying of Merril Lynch's stock in such large amount, it is now known openly world wide.  If they lose money again, then all Singaporeans lose face.  People would indeed vent their anger when they are asked to pay more to subsidize the loss either by their votes or street protests.  People would demand accountability, at least some scapegoats would be brought forward to appease the people's anger.<br><br>If they make money, then things would be a lot better for everyone except the opposition.<br><br>I am not against the UBS and Merril Lynch investments.  But i think one would wonder why tumasek and gic are so back-side itchy to go into these investments?<br><br>they would be very smart indeed if they have bought an oil-field in 1998 to 2001.  something which benefits the country directly since Singapore does not have natural resources.<br><br></div>
