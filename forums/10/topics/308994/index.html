              <p>Sorry Bro.... But I disagree with you on this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">FireIce could have chosen her words better</span></strong>.... but she wasn't wrong in the FACTS that everyday.... someone old or/and Young will die. This is a fact. And I don't think she is being a <strong>''Spoilt Brat'' </strong>for pointing that out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beyond this 'Cleaning Auntie'..... there are also thousands inside S'pore's Old Age Homes or Hospital who are old and sickly..... who might or might not have been abandon by their families, who might be rich or poor. So, how much thread do we need to put down here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>TS is correct to 'highlight' the problem facing the old and elderly.... who sadly, have to work even at an old age. But FireIce isn't Wrong to said that this happens around the Whole World.... therefore, are we to feel sad all the time</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #888888;">Cause everyday of the year, people - young &amp; old, rich &amp; poor - will die from WAR, HUNGER, CRIMES.... etc, ALL OVER THE WORLD</span></strong>.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So tell me Bro..... how much thread should we post here for everyone that dies <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>I dont think you are the only one that find this disturbing. Even Chinese from PRCs find it disturbing that the elderly has to work as cleaners or cardboardscrapers. This is especially true for asian countries where the old are supposed to retire with dignity and respect. If you travel to other asian societies, the elderly do not work as cleaners. I feel very embarrassed when an elderly old man or auntie with frail legs has to serve me or clear my plates because that is so unchinese to be served by an elderly person.</p>

              meaning one lah...<br> hinting tt our cheng hu make ppl work to death....<br> so this thread here is not about death itself, is about cheng hu
              rite?<br> (wtf, which thread here in SC not about cheng hu one....)<br> <br> but then hor, u know ah, old ppl... they used to working all their
              life.... when no work then they feel is wasted... relli waiting for
              death to come... to them tt is scary.....so they rather go
              work..<br> U all got relli talk to such old ppl to understand these or
              not....tsk tsk...<br> <br> dunno why today so many things to talk lah<br> usually i dun bother to say one... cos not worth saying to u all
              lah....<br> some things i ownself experience and understand can
              oredi.....<br> say out oni later become flame, then ä½ çˆ¸æˆ‘ knn need to do more

              <p> </p>
              <p>but it is also true lah, if old ppl dun work, it is same as waiting to die... worse then death itself. But if they work not just for 3 meal, then it is ok lah. Somehow, i dun think that is the case here leh. Most work so hard and so late into the nite, when they shd b at home enjoying the company of their family and grandchildren.</p>

              <p>Are you one of those people you mentioned above? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the large majority are slogging their ass off to make ends meet, therefore they have less time to spend with their parents. Don't think they are at fault, it's just the fast paced competitive environment here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One needs to understand also, money is not a static commodity, it is dynamic, inflation can erode the value of your retirement savings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The salary structure in Singapore is skewed in favour of the professionals (unlike other developed countries) and there is little redistribution of income from the rich to the poor (unlike other developed countries).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why our Gini Coefficient is higher than most developed countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have rich men in power, who enact laws to favour their own self interest, thereby enact laws to favour all the rich neglecting the poor.</p>

              <p>I think fireice has a point that looking after the parents is not only the government responsibility, but the problems she mentioned, do they not happen in other asian societies?</p>
              <p><strong> I think the point she missed is that all the other asian countries has some form of safety net</strong> <strong>and Singapore has little.</strong> The important question is why only Singapore?  Why not Taiwan or Korea?   In other asian countries when the kids abandoned their parents, the govt take care of them. In Singapore, the govt ask you to work longer... thats the difference.</p>

              <p>We are not a welfare state, the only welfare in existence are those ascribed to P4P politicians.</p>
