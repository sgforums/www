              <p>Join the opposition one day, Summer hill.</p>
              <p>By the way, in your earlier comments, you said that nothing has changed since WP entered parliament. The real fact is that yes, because having a small number of oppositions will not change much in Singapore, but the reality of having a bigger change is to have more oppositions into parliament.</p>
              <p>Of course today, there isn't enough oppositions to block constitutions or policies that are harmful to Singaporeans. Today, we have 81 PAP MPs and we only have 6 for the WP MPs. So do you really think this number is enough to change Singapore today?</p>
              <p>For me, I would definetely say no. With a small number of oppositions, the PAP is still able to create and amend policies that they want, but oppositions could not block policies that can be harmful to Singaporeans or change policies. We are still living in the old PAP today.</p>
              <p>Those living in oppositions may enjoy amenities without even paying peanuts while those living in PAP may enjoy amenties and even upgrading programs, but you got to folk out the money all by yourself and it can even cost more than peanuts. So which is your choice, oppositions or PAP?</p>
              <p>Summer hill, the only way to see real and big change in Singapore is coming the next GE, vote for the oppositions and also ask your friends and family to vote for them as well.</p>

              <p>WP did impact Singapore, but only to a certain extend. I visited the WP's website today, and I was pretty happy that WP object to the voluntary sterilization.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I find the  Voluntary Sterilization Bill quite evil......because, "Currently, a spouse, parent or guardian of persons "affected with any hereditary form of illness that is recurrent, mental illness, mental deficiency or epilepsy" has the power to give consent on their behalf. This is even though such persons may still be capable of giving their own consent despite their conditions." That means the doctor makes the decision for the patient. That's forced sterllisation!! Crime against humanity!!! I think I might cry and kill the doctor if this ever happens to me.</p>

              <p>On abortion? Maybe pre-marital sex might have contributed the most. You generally know that abortion can occur because of unwanted pragnency, lack of money to raise a child or cause harm to both/either the mother and/or feotus if pregnancy continues. But if I were to speak on this over here, I would say that high cost of living and other factors would also contribute to abortion.</p>
              <p>Cameras. Obviously some are useful, but some, they are useless. In fact, even when CCTVs are installed, we still see both residents &amp; foreigners leaving all unwanted rubbish and worst, urines as well as cigarettes left behind. With these useless CCTVs installed, that increases our service &amp; conservancy charges which we would have to pay more.</p>
