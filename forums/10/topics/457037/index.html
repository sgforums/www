              <p>first of all, let me declare i'm not pro-PAP nor pro-opposition... i believe that democracy can be achieve in Singapore but some concerns need to be addressed first. i do not believe that one party is safe for a country, i believe that having some opposition to check the power of the ruling party is essential and utmost required so as to prevent power corruption (absolute power corrupts) the current government realised that the new age Singaporean will not and does not kowtow to them. as we are more educated now and world news more accessible by the general public (CNN, Bloomberg can be viewed on Starhub) we can see and judge for ourselves what is right and what is wrong... Singapore is not perfect but hey, it's still home and we as the next generation are holding our own fates in our own hands.</p>
              <p>now my concerns and " complains";</p>
              <p>we voted the opposition into parliment on the last election. an epic victory in Aljunied GRC and Hougang... Workers' Party has made history in our political system and hey, i was quite satisfied that at last, we can be heading towards a more, "people people" Singapore by checking the PAP's power and rebutt their policies if it seems unfair to us Singaporeans but... (Workers' Party, i hope you are listening)</p>
              <p>what the heck have you guys been doing since you got voted into Parliment? Hello, wake up, wake up... we are paying you tens of thousands of dollars a month to think of our benefits, to help ease our concerns due to rising cost and world's economy and to question what is worth questioning in regards to our ruling party's policies. but what have you guys been doing?</p>
              <p>first, one of you go and have affair, refused to own up and got sacked... now whereabouts unknown. then the Hougang election so much drama... from the "i didn't take part in the internal vote" and change to, ""oh, i didn't have time to inform them to strike my name off in the internal voting"... a honourable man think first and speak after he has gathered his thoughts... you don't just shoot off our mouth and retract that later... no problem, you still won the seat which is predicted. Hougang residents see the flag not the candidate... i'm also glad that you guys won the seat to be honest... curb the power of Pay And Pay... remove ERPs, alter COE... hey it's ridiculous right? 600+ a month just to pay for COE... haven't include car loan yet... plus 300 for petrol, 100+ for insurance and then plus road tax... wah... really cannot swallow...</p>
              <p>but what do you guys do with all our tax payers money?</p>
              <p>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1219898/1/.html</p>
              <p>you went to ask is there any inequitability of the legal system... put it bluntly, hello! you guys are really free huh? this case has been closed for so long and you want to dig it up again? Politics is politics... judiciary is judiciary...don't mix it up... i mean do your homework properly lah. when citing previous cases, the offender received similar punishments so as a former lecturer in Temasek Polytechnic, you should have prepared all these before shooting your mouth off... again, is this issue of great importance? questioning the judiciary system in respect of a traffic offence is not of utmost importance for us Singaporeans now.</p>
              <p>my sister in law just graduated from SIM-University of London with 1st Class honours in Accounting and Finance and she can't find jobs yet... my own Poly classmates graduated with a 2nd class honours also can't job yet until he's thinking of joining property. Aren't these more crucial than a traffic offence? who is bothered? i don't really care if Woffles Wu would be hanged for asking someone else take the rap but i care if we can put bread on the table now since US has drought, food prices will soar and recently, petrol prices went up again.</p>
              <p>these are more pressing issues so i urge you dear Oppositions; don't take our money and start buying Kate Spade, don't start having affairs with our money... take our money and think how to make our lives a little better, a little less stress and a little more liveable. in the long run, your children will benefit too</p>

              i agree it's not just their burden but make an issue out of it... ask intelligent questions... ask, check, query and debate what is important not something that has no bearing to our lives. show us that you are working hard for us too and we will appreciate you guys in the next election. you can also cite examples of how hard you fought for us in parliment and even if you receive refutes or rebuttals, we appreciates it...
              
              <p>unless you want to be a one hit wonder and return Aljunied back to Pay and Pay in the next election</p>

              <p>Ruling party vs opposition party in managing the country. This is so passe.</p>

              <p>No one is to be blamed. Everyone has to help themselves. I’ve
                  also been looking out for job for past one month plus without
                  success but I don’t go around blaming everyone like government. I
                  just continue to put in efforts and try everyday to search for an
                  opportunity. I believe it will come. I’m not pro or against
                  government but I just want to say don’t blame the government for
                  everything because you are responsible for yourself.</p>

              <p>first of all, let me declare i'm not pro-PAP nor
              pro-opposition... i believe that democracy can be achieve in
              Singapore but some concerns need to be addressed first. i do not
              believe that one party is safe for a country, i believe that having
              some opposition to check the power of the ruling party is essential
              and utmost required so as to prevent power corruption (absolute
              power corrupts) the current government realised that the new age
              Singaporean will not and does not kowtow to them. as we are more
              educated now and world news more accessible by the general public
              (CNN, Bloomberg can be viewed on Starhub) we can see and judge for
              ourselves what is right and what is wrong... Singapore is not
              perfect but hey, it's still home and we as the next generation are
              holding our own fates in our own hands.</p>
              <p>now my concerns and " complains";</p>
              <p>we voted the opposition into parliment on the last election. an
              epic victory in Aljunied GRC and Hougang... Workers' Party has made
              history in our political system and hey, i was quite satisfied that
              at last, we can be heading towards a more, "people people"
              Singapore by checking the PAP's power and rebutt their policies if
              it seems unfair to us Singaporeans but... (Workers' Party, i hope
              you are listening)</p>
              <p>what the heck have you guys been doing since you got voted into
              Parliment? Hello, wake up, wake up... we are paying you tens of
              thousands of dollars a month to think of our benefits, to help ease
              our concerns due to rising cost and world's economy and to question
              what is worth questioning in regards to our ruling party's
              policies. but what have you guys been doing?</p>
              <p>first, one of you go and have affair, refused to own up and got
              sacked... now whereabouts unknown. then the Hougang election so
              much drama... from the "i didn't take part in the internal vote"
              and change to, ""oh, i didn't have time to inform them to strike my
              name off in the internal voting"... a honourable man think first
              and speak after he has gathered his thoughts... you don't just
              shoot off our mouth and retract that later... no problem, you still
              won the seat which is predicted. Hougang residents see the flag not
              the candidate... i'm also glad that you guys won the seat to be
              honest... curb the power of Pay And Pay... remove ERPs, alter
              COE... hey it's ridiculous right? 600+ a month just to pay for
              COE... haven't include car loan yet... plus 300 for petrol, 100+
              for insurance and then plus road tax... wah... really cannot
              swallow...</p>
              <p>but what do you guys do with all our tax payers money?</p>
              <p>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1219898/1/.html</p>
              <p>you went to ask is there any inequitability of the legal
              system... put it bluntly, hello! you guys are really free huh? this
              case has been closed for so long and you want to dig it up again?
              Politics is politics... judiciary is judiciary...don't mix it up...
              i mean do your homework properly lah. when citing previous cases,
              the offender received similar punishments so as a former lecturer
              in Temasek Polytechnic, you should have prepared all these before
              shooting your mouth off... again, is this issue of great
              importance? questioning the judiciary system in respect of a
              traffic offence is not of utmost importance for us Singaporeans
              now.</p>
              <p>my sister in law just graduated from SIM-University of London
              with 1st Class honours in Accounting and Finance and she can't find
              jobs yet... my own Poly classmates graduated with a 2nd class
              honours also can't job yet until he's thinking of joining property.
              Aren't these more crucial than a traffic offence? who is bothered?
              i don't really care if Woffles Wu would be hanged for asking
              someone else take the rap but i care if we can put bread on the
              table now since US has drought, food prices will soar and recently,
              petrol prices went up again.</p>
              <p>these are more pressing issues so i urge you dear Oppositions;
              don't take our money and start buying Kate Spade, don't start
              having affairs with our money... take our money and think how to
              make our lives a little better, a little less stress and a little
              more liveable. in the long run, your children will benefit too</p>

              <p>are you saying now, a neutral Singaporean who has no interest in either camps cannot say what he or she feels? Does my post show favourtism to PAP? </p>
              <p>of course if one is unemployed, it's not the government's fault nor the opposition fault. in my post, i'm not saying who's at fault. I'm just putting up an example that instead of harping on Dr. Wu's case, why not harp on something else that is important like unemployment and social assistance. </p>
              <p>I'm just indicating my unhappiness why are they wasting resources on something that has no bearing in our daily lives like COE, ERP, GST but on someone's traffic offence. when you see it on the news, i'm like, "er... why you keep harping on something that really has no bearing on national level." if you harp on CHC's case in misuing $$$ for music career, at least it's on national level and we can prevent another 50 million from missing.</p>
