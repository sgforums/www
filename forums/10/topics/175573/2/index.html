            <div class='col-md body'>really they have a master in econ and management and still cant find a job? Shit i was playing to do those subjects in the university? By the way did they try to gain some working experiences between their honors and master? I heard from a hr manager that they will usually quiz the ppl with why they advance to master straight away. If there is no good explanation like u receive a scholarship then they will need to think thrice before hiring as u are overqualified as a junoir and too inexperience to hold good positions.</div>

Its still the weakest link till today.<br><br>If i remember someone at the top once made this comment, a graduate with a degree that can made it through university is sure to be smart and capable to get a good job anywhere, that includes going overseas.<br><br>Thats why society treat graduates as someone smart and capable of taking care of themself.  if not his degree or masters is just as good as no degree.<br><br></div>
