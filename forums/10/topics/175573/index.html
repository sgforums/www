            <div class='col-md body'>MM Lee has been reported as saying that the main issue in the upcoming election is whether PAP will deliver a better standard of living.<br><br>Well spoken !! How about walking the talk and do something about the paranoid to increase fees and charges first. These are the existing wrongs in the government policies that cause people's standard of living to drop from the high in 1970s to the low in the 1980s and 1990s in the first place due to government's repeated fee increases.<br><br>For a start how about eliminating double charges on lands as lands are already paid for by citizens.<br><br>In this way, the fees on utility and transportation costs will then not be so high.<br><br>How about not jacking up the HDB flat prices through creative accounting as done in NKF. Why charge flat owners HDB resale levies when flats are already sold?<br><br>MM Lee and his party have made many election promises befor like "more good years", "jobs, jobs jobs", "growth triangles", "asset enhancement", or "Swiss standard of living", "value-adding economy" or "CPF retirement nestegg".<br><br>Has he or his party really delivered these and many other promises made in several previous elections.<br><br>Instead of improving citizens' standard of living to first world standard (he claims as main issue in this coming election) only our costs are going up to first world or swiss standards but not workers' average wages.<br><br>So with such miserable and disappointing records, can citizens now be expected to trust MM Lee's words ?<br><br>How about NKF? Is he admitting the the NKF type of policy to build 30-year reserves is causing great pains borne by the majority of lower middle and lower income citizens, Yet while not hesitating to spend monies to help citizens overcome jobless problem during bad time, he is still seen as unrelentless in wanting to build more and bigger reserve.<br><br>Can he use the reserve to create jobs or lower the high costs of living due to high government fees and charges and high HDB prices and resale levies. What is the use of building reserve if it cannot be used to help lower costs.<br><br>In fact without trying to make election promises like "we will deliver a higher standard of living" he can do a lot now before the election - by not increasing any more fees and charges and not making lower and lower middle income citizens poorer.<br><br>By changing policy of recovering full market costs and selling services at full market prices, the citizens will be thankful already that they will not become poorer. Why so paranoid to make the people poorer as the government has been doing all these past 40 years.<br><br>It is the government relentless fee increases that are making the citizens poor.<br><br>Without all such fee increases citizens will be happy and there will be no need to talk about curing the problem of the poor or improving the standard of living.<br><br>Leave well alone and get real as Diana says. Do not introduce talk too much or go for big projects or build 7 wonders and just don't increase any more fees and citizens will be most happy to vote for PAP.<br><br>Can MM Lee realise his 20 major mistakes as posted and come down from high ivory tower and start working for the people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's right salman has again characteristically salmanised the main issue - whether MM Lee can deliver his past election promises and walk the talk.<br><br>Salmanisation is the art of avoiding answering to difficult question or the crux of arguments by evasive one-liner denial, and retorting the opponent's poser by throwing back the same question asked.<br><br>Salman is going round and round in circles. Perhaps that is his assignment i.e. to depoticise any criticism or unfavorable views of the administration.<br><br>He is not contributing to the truths or solutions but is only seeking to salmanise the views of others so as to avoid answering real issues or problems.</div>
