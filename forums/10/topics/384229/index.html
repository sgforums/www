              <h1>Singapore's 'Martyr,' Chee Soon Juan</h1>
              <h2>by Hugo Restall</h2>
              <p><strong>Striding into the</strong> Chinese restaurant of Singapore's historic
              Fullerton Hotel, Chee Soon Juan hardly looks like a dangerous
              revolutionary. Casually dressed in a blue shirt with a gold pen clipped
              to the pocket, he could pass as just another mild-mannered, apolitical
              Singaporean. Smiling, he courteously apologizes for being late–even
              though it is only two minutes after the appointed time.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, according to prosecutors, this same man is not only a criminal, 
              but a repeat offender. The opposition party leader has just come from a 
              pre-trial conference at the courthouse, where he faces eight counts of speaking 
              in public without a permit. He has already served numerous prison terms for this 
              and other political offenses, including eight days in March for denying the 
              independence of the judiciary. He expects to go to jail again later this year.</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee does not seem too perturbed about this, but it drives Singaporean Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong up the wall. Asked about his government's persecution 
              of the opposition during a trip to New Zealand last month, Mr. Lee launched into 
              a tirade of abuse against Mr. Chee. "He's a liar, he's a cheat, he's deceitful, 
              he's confrontational, it's a destructive form of politics designed not to win 
              elections in Singapore but to impress foreign supporters and make himself out to 
              be a martyr," Mr. Lee ranted. "He's deliberately going against the rules because 
              he says, 'I'm like Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi. I want to be a martyr.'"</p>
              <p>Coming at the end of a trip in which the prime minister essentially got a free 
              ride on human rights from his hosts–New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark 
              didn't even raise the issue–this outburst showed a lack of self-control and 
              acumen. Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the man who many believe still runs 
              Singapore and who is the current prime minister's father, has said much the same 
              things about Mr. Chee–"a political gangster, a liar and a cheat"–but that was at 
              home, and in the heat of an election campaign.</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee smiles when it's suggested that he must be doing something right. 
              "Every time he says something stupid like that, I think to myself, the worst 
              thing to happen would be to be ignored. That would mean we're not making any 
              headway," he agrees.</p>
              <p>But one charge made by the government does stick: Mr. Chee is not terribly 
              concerned about election results. Which is just as well, because his Singapore 
              Democratic Party did not do very well in the May 6 polls. It would be foolish, 
              he suggests, for an opposition party in Singapore to pin its hopes on gaining 
              one, or perhaps two, seats in parliament. He is aiming for a much bigger goal: 
              bringing down the city-state's one-party system of government. His weapon is a 
              campaign of civil disobedience against laws designed to curtail democratic 
              freedoms.</p>
              <p>"You don't vote out a dictatorship," he says. "And basically that's what 
              Singapore is, albeit a very sophisticated one. It's not possible for us to 
              effect change just through the ballot box. They've got control of everything 
              else around us." Instead what's needed is a coalition of civil society and 
              political society coming together and demanding change–a color revolution for 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>So far Mr. Chee doesn't seem to be getting much, if any traction. While many 
              Singaporeans don't particularly like the PAP's arrogant style of government, the 
              ruling party has succeeded in depoliticizing the population to the extent that 
              anybody who presses them to take action to make a change is regarded with 
              resentment. And in a climate of fear–Mr. Chee lost his job as a psychology 
              lecturer at the national university soon after entering opposition politics–a 
              reluctance to get involved is hardly surprising.</p>
              <p>Why is all this oppression necessary in a peaceful and prosperous country like 
              Singapore where citizens otherwise enjoy so many freedoms? Mr. Chee has his own 
              theory that the answer lies with strongman Lee Kuan Yew himself: "Why is he 
              still so afraid? I honestly think that through the years he has accumulated 
              enough skeletons in his closet that he knows that when he is gone, his son and 
              the generations after him will have a price to pay. If we had parliamentary 
              debates where the opposition could pry and ask questions, I think he is actually 
              afraid of something like that."</p>
              <p>That raises the question of whether Singapore deserves its reputation for 
              squeaky-clean government. A scandal involving the country's biggest charity, the 
              National Kidney Foundation, erupted in 2004 when it turned out that its Chief 
              Executive T.T. Durai was not only drawing a $357,000 annual salary, but the 
              charity was paying for his first-class flights, maintenance on his Mercedes, and 
              gold-plated fixtures in his private office bathroom.</p>
              <p>The scandal was a gift for the opposition, which naturally raised questions 
              about why the government didn't do a better job of supervising the highly 
              secretive NKF, whose patron was the wife of former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 
              (she called Mr. Durai's salary "peanuts"). But it had wider implications too. 
              The government controls huge pools of public money in the Central Provident Fund 
              and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp., both of which are highly 
              nontransparent. It also controls spending on the public housing most 
              Singaporeans live in, and openly uses the funds for refurbishing apartment 
              blocks as a bribe for districts that vote for the ruling party. Singaporeans 
              have no way of knowing whether officials are abusing their trust as Mr. Durai 
              did.</p>
              <p>It gets worse. Mr. Durai's abuses only came to light because he sued the Straits 
              Times newspaper for libel over an article detailing some of his perks. Why was 
              Mr. Durai so confident he could win a libel suit when the allegations against 
              him were true? Because he had done it before. The NKF won a libel case in 1998 
              against defendants who alleged it had paid for first-class flights for Mr. Durai. 
              This time, however, he was up against a major bulwark of the regime, Singapore 
              Press Holdings; its lawyers uncovered the truth.</p>
              <p>Singaporean officials have a remarkable record of success in winning libel suits 
              against their critics. The question then is, how many other libel suits have 
              Singapore's great and good wrongly won, resulting in the cover-up of real 
              misdeeds? And are libel suits deliberately used as a tool to suppress 
              questioning voices?</p>
              <p>The bottling up of dissent conceals pressures and prevents conflicts from being 
              resolved. For instance, extreme sensitivity over the issue of race relations 
              means that the persistence of discrimination is a taboo topic. Yet according to 
              Mr. Chee it is a problem that should be debated so that it can be better 
              resolved. "The harder they press now, the stronger will be the reaction when 
              he's no longer around," he says of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>The paternalism of the PAP also rankles, especially since foreigners get more 
              consideration than locals. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund will 
              hold their annual meeting in Singapore this fall, and have been trying to 
              convince the authorities to allow the usual demonstrations to take place. The 
              likely result is that international NGO groups will be given a designated area 
              to scream and shout. "So we have a situation here where locals don't have the 
              right to protest in their own country, while foreigners are able to do that," 
              Mr. Chee marvels. Likewise, Singaporeans can't organize freely into unions to 
              negotiate wages; instead a National Wages Council sets salaries with input from 
              the corporate sector, including foreign chambers of commerce.</p>
              <p>All these tensions will erupt when strongman Lee Kuan Yew dies. Mr. Chee notes 
              that the ruling party is so insecure that Singapore's founder has been unable to 
              step back from front-line politics. The PAP still needs the fear he inspires in 
              order to keep the population in line. Power may have officially passed to his 
              son, Lee Hsien Loong, but even supporters privately admit that the new prime 
              minister doesn't inspire confidence.</p>
              <p>During the election, Prime Minister Lee made what should have been a routine 
              attack on multiparty democracy: "Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members 
              in parliament. Instead of spending my time thinking what is the right policy for 
              Singapore, I'm going to spend all my time thinking what's the right way to fix 
              them, to buy my supporters' votes, how can I solve this week's problem and 
              forget about next year's challenges?" But of course the ominous phrases "buy 
              votes" and "fix them" stuck out. That is the kind of mistake, Mr. Chee suggests, 
              Lee Sr. would not make.</p>
              <p>"He's got a kind of intelligence that would serve you very well when you put a 
              problem in front of him," he says of the prime minister. "But when it comes to 
              administration or political leadership, when you really need to be media savvy 
              and motivate people, I think he is very lacking in that area. And his father 
              senses it as well."</p>
              <p>However, the elder Mr. Lee's death–he is now 82–is a necessary but not 
              sufficient condition for change. Another big factor is how civil society is able 
              to use new technologies to bypass PAP control over information and free speech. 
              The government has tried to stifle political filmmaking, blogging and podcasting. 
              Singapore Rebel, a 2004 film about Mr. Chee by independent artist Martyn See, 
              was banned but is widely available on the Internet.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, pressure for Singapore to remain competitive in the region has 
              sparked debate about the government's dominant role in the economy. Can a 
              top-down approach promote creativity and independent thinking? The need for 
              transparency and accountability also means that Singapore will have to change. 
              That is the source of Mr. Chee's optimism in the face of all his setbacks: "I 
              realize that Singapore is not at that level yet. But we've got to start 
              somewhere. And I'm prepared to see this out, in the sense that in the next five, 
              10, 15 years, time is on our side. We need to continue to organize and educate 
              and encourage. And it will come."</p>
              <p>He doesn't dwell on his personal tribulations, but mentions in passing selling 
              his self-published books on the street. That is his primary source of income to 
              feed his family, along with the occasional grant. As to the charge of wanting to 
              be a martyr, once he started dissenting, he found it impossible to stop in good 
              conscience. "The more you got involved, the more you found out what they're 
              capable of, it steels you, so you say, 'No, I will not back down.' It makes you 
              more determined."</p>
              <p>Perhaps it's in his genes. One of Mr. Chee's daughters is old enough that she 
              had to be told that her father was going to prison. She stood up before her 
              class and announced, "My papa is in jail, but he didn't do anything wrong. 
              People have just been unfair to him."</p>
