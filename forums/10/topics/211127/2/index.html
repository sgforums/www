            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The military coup in Thailand proves that democracy does not always work.</strong><br><br>Of course, I am being delibrerately provocative but the facts in this case illustrate it well. Thaksin has won two elections convincingly (one a landslide) and he enjoys tremendous popularity in the rural provinces. His autocratic style has led him to be hated in Bangkok and the cities, but the vast majority of the Thai population, mainly poor rural communities, support him. He has introduced populist policies like cheap healthcare to all and improved the rural economy, something no previous Thai PMs had been able to do. Sure, there is corruption in Thailand but as the international media unanimously agree, there has been corruption with every single Thai administration to date. The difference is that despite the corruption and cronyism, Thaksin has improved the Thai economy and the lives of the people. Of course, he and his supporters have grown far richer than the rest, but everyone else has also done better.<br><br>The popularity of Thaksin means that in a one man-one vote system, it is impossible to unseat him in a democratic election, as long as he enjoys the support of the majority rural poor. Military intervention is thus the only option.<br><br>It was a very peaceful coup and indeed it is the model of military coups if such undemocratic action can ever be desirable. The Thai king has been very wise to give his approval to the coup leader and thus stamp out any violent protests, which may push the country into chaos.<br><br>The outcome is thankfully peaceful and life can return to a semblance of normality now. People in Bangkok are happy that Thaksin has gone and that finally there might be an end to endless street protests (and to think some Singaporeans think believe street protests are a good thing!).<br><br>But it proves the failure of democracy and the need for military force to remove a democratically and popularly elected government.</div>
