              <p><br>Why on Earth would you want to send your Kids to an international School in Singapore?  It is not just because it is international School for foreign Kids it is Also a Totally different Educational System altogether.</p>
              <p>Unless u are planning to move out from Singapore. Than you should be outside of Singapore. Not in SG studying some American system of education or japanese system?  </p>
              <p>I had help ran programmes for foreign kids in Singapore. This has nothing to do with Singaporean accepting the fate. This has everything to do with being a Host.</p>
              <p>You expect oversea MNC to create jobs in Singapore only and forget about their life? </p>

              <p>You know ah.. those international schools in Singapore got a long waiting list ok ?.. if the Canadians expat have to compete with Singapore students to get in.. then wats the point of their existence ?</p>
              <p>Ofcors the school can be more subtle .. don put that "only Canadian" may apply. They can simply sift out the locals and accept only Canadian passport holders during application process.</p>
              <p>But usually during application.. parents are required to put a non-refundable deposit. So it is better to just let applicants know what the school priorities are wat. Save the hassles.</p>

Aiya, what summer are they talking about, in Singapore here, everyday is summer. Peoples just dun appreciate the wonderful education system we have here, our govt are very pro in education, but somehow good stuff alway invite condemnation, envsion and jealousy. Let them talk what they want, afterall, everyone is entitled to their own different opinons, same as everyone have a different asshole size.</p>

              <p>This is like the stupidest post ever. Sorry to burst your little bubble, but the Singapore culture and education system is not the supreme way-of-life that everyone should follow, or else they are stupid.</p>
              <p>Or maybe you don't know what expats are. Expats don't come to Singapore to find a new home and culture. They come here because they had an opportunity to get paid. Most expats living in Singapore move here because their company offered a pay raise, to pay for their kid's education, and to pay for their housing (and it's usually a nice house). Why would they say no?</p>
              <p>But they're here for business. They're not interested in coming to Singapore because they want to see how awesome you are. Therefore, they live in an American (or wherever they came from) community, making friends with American people. Their kids go to American schools and make friends with American kids. When they graduate, they're going to go back to the States and attend college there.</p>
              <p>It has absolutely NOTHING at all to do with the difficulty of education, and you're an ignorant asshole if you think that it does.</p>

              <p>And also all the international schools around the world don't accept the local students not just only  in singapore.</p>
              <p>Reasons-</p>
              <p>--We have different educational curreculum from singapore, and also we have to go back   to our own country, thats why international schools are formed.we come here is just for money, to go straight.</p>
              <p>--In international schools we don't sing singapore national anthem, In american school, we sing "The Star-spangled Banner" which is the usa anthem. So why should a singaporean living in singapore sing other country's national anthem. And also after studying in international school for long time, he or she will become forgetting the singapore culture and strange to the singaporean community even though he or she still live in his own country.So that can cause the young singaporean student think himself as american or canadian. which can make him un-patriot to singapore.that's why the government MOE and the school both try to ban singaporean to enter to inter schools. I have some rich singaporean friends in school. They are also like that, feels like they don't really like to make friends with singaporean out there. And I feels really sad for that..</p>
              <p>--If singaporean want to enter interschools, they have to pay fines which is about 40% of the school fees. so i admit that there are still rich singaporean kids in there.</p>

              <p>I don't have to sing any American anthems at my American school. Also, I don't know if that 40% fine thing is true; I have a few Singaporean friends myself, and while some of them are really rich, most of them aren't that rich. (Well, that's relative to the people at my school, most of whom are pretty rich anyway, lol.)</p>
              <p>But yeah, the part about different curriculums is true; if you're going to go to an American college, the best thing would be to go to an American school. There are some specific requirements, like taking at least one American history course in high school.</p>

              <p>This is like the stupidest post ever. Sorry to burst your little bubble, but the Singapore culture and education system is not the supreme way-of-life that everyone should follow, or else they are stupid.</p>
              <p>Or maybe you don't know what expats are. Expats don't come to Singapore to find a new home and culture. They come here because they had an opportunity to get paid. Most expats living in Singapore move here because their company offered a pay raise, to pay for their kid's education, and to pay for their housing (and it's usually a nice house). Why would they say no?</p>
              <p>But they're here for business. They're not interested in coming to Singapore because they want to see how awesome you are. Therefore, they live in an American (or wherever they came from) community, making friends with American people. Their kids go to American schools and make friends with American kids. When they graduate, they're going to go back to the States and attend college there.</p>
              <p>It has absolutely NOTHING at all to do with the difficulty of education, and you're an ignorant asshole if you think that it does.</p>

              <p>Being ambassadors, diplomacy is much required to foster better understanding, espacially since you are only guests and motivated by, to put it bluntly, greed. We Singaporeans can be accomodating, but only if you, as a guest, does the initiation part first, to open your palms, face it forward signifying you have nothing to hide, with absolute openness to understand our culture as we seek to understand yours, so that we may live side by side, as we had done with the evidence of our multi-racial society.</p>

              <p>I suggest that you read the post he was replying to. That was even more tasteless. No matter who you are, you also represent whatever background you come from. That applies to Man!x as a local - the host - but da-vid was specific in rubbishing him. You may have grievances against other expats for their haughty attitudes and their criticisms of Singapore, but don't hurl them at this member without good reason.</p>
              <p>Man!x posted, and enough folks have retorted. It should be done and dusted there. You're dgging it up and taking sides unnecessarily by letting chest-beating nationalism get in the way of judgment.</p>

              <p>Alamak , Summer school are for parents who don't want their children to idle at home during the "summer" school holidays. Thats why the curriculum are less structured.</p>
              <p>Instead of semester break.. they call it summer break or winter break lah.</p>
              <p>Older kids go for summer camps. It's just additional programs so the kids don't go crazy lah.</p>
              <p>Some older kids who don't go for summer camps/schools.. may take up summer jobs to earn some pocket money mah.</p>
              <p>Younger kids.. because of the limited options and activities.. most parents who choose not to take vacations during this period prefer to put them in summer school lor .....</p>
