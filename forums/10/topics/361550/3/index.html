              <p><br> I, as a Singaporean, do not enjoy your tone. Perhaps you may had
              been provoked, of which I do not deny. But do know that you
              and the children of such schools exists ONLY because of universal
              sufferage, of which we,.Singaporeans, have no wish to see your kind
              denied of your culture and heritage. We could have enforce the
              rule, since money MOTIVATES your kind to work here. But
              we DID NOT. Appreciate this fact, and be thankful.</p>
              <p>Secondly, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, remember you are, no matter how
              great you presume your country to be, or how great your education
              system is, (what is the yardstick anyway? Acknowledging
              our education curriculam is good as your senators often
              do would make our system better, but why quibble, kids are kids and
              innocent anyway, good or bad, we will ultimately learn one way
              or another.), AMBASSADORS of your country.</p>
              <p>The way you put us and our citizens down is absolutely high
              handed and disgusting, and i am sure many of your fellow matured
              citizens would share such feelings. But i forgive you, for you are
              only an immatured kid.</p>
              <p>Being ambassadors, diplomacy is much required to foster better
              understanding, espacially since you are only guests and motivated
              by, to put it bluntly, greed. We Singaporeans can be accomodating,
              but only if you, as a guest, does the initiation part first, to
              open your palms, face it forward signifying you have nothing to
              hide, with absolute openness to understand our culture as we seek
              to understand yours, so that we may live side by side, as we had
              done with the evidence of our multi-racial society.</p>
              <p>Accept my post in a positive spirit, otherwise we will
              needlessly never see eye to eye and instead of fostering
              understanding, only unnecessary misunderstanding will
              prevail.</p>
              <p>But it is your choice. The ball is in your court now.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I see Kuali Baba already replied to your post, so maybe this post isn't necessary. However, I would like to say a few things.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying how awesome the US is and how lame Singapore is. You know, I'm only American by my accent, education, and birthplace/passport. My mom is actually Chinese, and my dad is Taiwanese (they both learned English and immigrated to the US for college). Basically, I'm a Chinese person who can speak English and Chinese (except not reading/writing). Not very different from Singaporeans, right?</p>
              <p>Singaporean culture is not wrong, bad, or stupid. I never said any of those things. If you read my post, I was merely stating the fact that expats do not come to Singapore to find a new culture and embrace it; therefore, their kids do not enter the local education system.</p>
              <p>And as Kuali mentioned, you should read the post that I was replying to.</p>
