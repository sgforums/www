            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Metaphorical replied:<br>You seow har? If give korea &amp; finland people be our pm &amp; ministers, then all the sg real ministers &amp; Lhl do what? They the one kena elected by citizens! Sg got no gov talent meh? must be other countrys colony! Seow!<br><br>RT:<br>Actually like the benchmarking of ministers' salaries to few lottery winning lucky CEOs in the private sector, it all got started as an issue when government wants to get more pays by selective comparison.<br><br>There is now no need for proper argument with this kind of comparison as it is about use of power. So what is wrong if SIA pilots also want this kind of benchmarking. In fact their benchmarking is more reasonable being industry to industry or apple-to-apple and not trying to ask for a first-prize winning ticket in the big sweep.<br><br>When government says it wants to improve the economy or globalise it must outsource local jobs to foreigners. Actually citizens find that many foreigners are not talents but come in to learn or under-study local's talents on the jobs to replace them with a few dollar cheaper.<br><br>So if we have this kind of outsourcing going on to replace citizens, government actually is telling citizens they can outsource ministers' jobs as it will mean great saving of at least $23 million of public taxpayers' monies while getting more competitive and talented ministers with good track records in turning around economy.<br><br>What is wrong with this kind of outsourcing? Many countries have employed foreign mentors who are more action-oriented who will solve problems rather than talking about all the talents without improving lives of ordinary citizens.<br><br>It is not small amount to save the $23 million per year over-paid miniters' salaries as to citizens' knowledge many Finland's good ministers are willing to be paid less than half of what our ministers pay themselves against people's strong objections.<br><br>These foreign talented foreign talents will help our citizens to improve their lives so why not? A white cat can catch mice so can a blank cat.<br><br>Metaphorical:<br>You still never answer: you want sg become colony har?<br><br>Ministers is vote by citizens, how can give other country ex-ministers come in charge our citizens' life? You not scare they sabot sg har? Sg gone already, they easy just go back their countrys. We all how? Save $23 milions or $46milion but whole sg gone. Where worth?<br><br>If bill clinton be sg president, he sure bring all his ex kaki inside white house come work sg. Then how? Our sg civil servants kena retrench har? All our senior experience grassroot old guards how? Sack them har? Seow!<br><br>Korea people come be our PM, you know what sure happen our glc &amp; tamasek or not? He sure give all the big good contracts for his korea co &amp; samsung. Our glc &amp; ntuc eat what? Eat grass har? Seow!</blockquote>RT:<br><br>You want to claim our ministers are properly voted by the people and so are entitled to write their own pay cheques as they like comparable to the few lucky lotter winning CEOs in the private sector without proper evaluation and interview then you must justify their voting by the citizens through proper election and proper voting process.<br><br>Tell me which one of the ministers have been properly voted by the people. Name me the ministers who have got into office through proper voting by the citizens which has been fairly and not GRC voted into office through dubious blockage of their right to vote for best individual candidates of their own choice.<br><br>Have there been proper election or fair contest all these years since the block election system with the excuse to field a slate of candidate for racial harmony.<br><br>There are many other ways to field candidates for racial balance. By doctoring with the one-man-one-vote system and prevent citizens from voting the best single candidates of their choice by making candidates to join up in a GRC blocking before they can be voted , it is simply an interference with their rights to put up their best individual candidates of their choice for election.<br><br>Without fair election where ministers are properly voted they do not truly represent the choice of the people. GRC has prevented citizens from exercising their right to put up the candidates of their free choice and it is a gross interferences by blockage of individual candidates of people's choice.<br><br>So many of our so-called talented ministers have simply walked over without any contest because individual best candidates are unable to stand for election unless they are able to form blocks of candidates.<br><br>Are they chosen or elected by the people or are they simply gerrymandered into office without being voted by the people in actual casting of votes.<br><br>Do you call such a election election at all? Is such an election legitimate reflecting the actual free choice by the people.<br><br>Without proper voting are they sanctioned to make such decisions like receiving or paying themselves world's highest salaries and still claiming these are not enough and still claiming that they have the mandate of people to do so.<br><br>Which of the elected presidents were also properly elected with people being free to duty to choose the candidate best able to look after our reserve independently without fearing the ruling party power-play to prevent him from compiling the asset lists as has happened to ex-president Ong Teng Cheong.</div>
