            <div class='col-md body'>This morning, I drove pass a secondary school. I saw a group of about 15 students standing outside a locked gate guarded by some students inside. I look at the digital clock inside my car and it shows 7:22am.<br><br>Just then 1 young lady came to the gate and the student opened the gate, then another car drove in and the gate was opened for it to enter. I assume that these 2 must be teaching staff.<br><br>May I ask this, if the student are penalised for being late (class start 7.30am), why then are the "late comer" teaching staff spared the "punishment". Have our MOE admistrator so blindly followed the rules but  did not know that the rules applies to themselves?

Some of us start only at 8am or 9am.<br>Maybe they are afternoon session staff who  came early for CCA or something.<br><br>Because i know that morning session teachers need to report by 7am. If they are late, there might be disciplinary action taken by the principal individually not with the students =P. Imagine teachers kena locked out by their own students.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">yes, i did assume that those 2 could have being a teacher unless the cleaner drove to work or the cleaner come in executive style dressing. </div></blockquote> Did those 2 come in in executive style dressing? if they are then they are definitely not teaching staff, school teaching staff don't come in executive attire. These days all are smart casual.<br>Parents coming to meet teachers, suppliers of school materials, even contractors, come in to school before classes begins, cleaner would have to come to school earlier to make sure everything is clean before classes begin, and they come in smart casual attire then change for cleaning job. It is wrong to assume that anybody else who come in later than the students are teaching staff.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">nobody did, but to see that the students are lockout before school starts and the teachers are allowed in didn't make sense. </div></blockquote> It makes sense for parents to come and meet the teachers just before the classes begin. It does not make sense for teachers to come at 7am when they lessons start at 10am, and then have to stay back till 7 pm to attend meetings.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">am i not right that, principals and teachers are adminstrators designated by MOE? </div></blockquote> All are employees of MOE, but principals are overall in charge, teachers teach, discipline master take care of discipline. Blame whoever you like, but the proper channel is, talk to the discipline master or the vice principal, then the principal, ....you never learn from 2LT Li huh?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">i agree, but have you heard or seen some who gathered and smoke with their students in polythenics? no, i have not seen them but heard about it thru my son. </div></blockquote> If you see that in polytechnic, go raise the issue with the polytechnic, you are stretching too far here.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">some time I ask, schol starts at 7.30am. you are late at 7.25am? </div></blockquote> The classes start at 7.30 am, students may be required to come in earlier, and the check point is at the main gate. You better be entering the gate by 7.15am, or unless your classroom is just next to the main gate. We don't decide what time students should come in, the school does, and if these rest of the school can come in before that, why should the 15 of them be special, super white horse?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">yes, i agree that whoever is late is subjected to the rules. but if the top is not straight, the bottom is crook </div></blockquote> Are teachers subject to the same rules as the students? Obviously not.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SevenEleven:</div><div class="quote_body">no, it's just a thought that pop-up.<br><br></div></blockquote> but don't blame the teachers too soon, their lives are not easy. I will be happy if you start questioning the parents first!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Teachers can be docked pay if they are late or AWOL. The reason why the punishment is not made so clear to the pupils and the public is that they still need to maintain some image of authority in order to do their jobs.<br><br>Also, in any case, just because the people in power or at the top are in the wrong doesn't mean you have the right to be in the wrong as well. So if the teachers are in the wrong it doesn't mean that the pupils are right to follow them as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's best not to draw too many conclusions from one senario.<br><br>If benefit of the doubt is given, these two 'latecomers' could very well be teachers on leave who were summoned back on a last-min basis by their principal - thus they have EVERY RIGHT to be 'late'.<br><br>They could also be teachers on afternoon classes coming in the morning; in that case, they are perfectly within their right to have the students open the gate.<br><br>Plenty of reasons exists to explain that situation. We should not be too eager to cry foul because of one incident.<br><br>Although i must say, a handful of students keeping out a group of 15 with a gate inbetween depicts a old-'skool' confrontation...all they need now is riot gear and a few molotov cocktails  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
