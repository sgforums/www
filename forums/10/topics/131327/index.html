If that is the case, then I agree with eddenboy and dragg that anybody off the street can run the 2 companies. We don't even need a transport minister.<br><br>However, on the other hand, a petition never ever works in Singapore. We have more than 30,000 people signing a petition against the Casino but was left sitting in the Istana. No point having another recycle paper for the president.</div>

Even for those earning a decent amount, we don't see a need for the raise since their service sucks and I believe their profits should cover for the new trains they are going to replace. Don't really take the bus so I can't really comment but MRT service is sucky and most of the time the air-con is barely working. This is something that will impact the majority of Singaporeans and I don't agree to it, unless the profit is not such an obscene figure.</div>
