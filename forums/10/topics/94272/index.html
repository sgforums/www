            <div class='col-md body'>It may be wonderful if you are able to speak mandarin to many of our Singaporean Chinese of different dialect mix as mandarin could be used as a common language to unite Chineses not only in Singapore, but around the world! But the funny thing here is that many young Singaporeans did not even know how to speak a word of their own dialect! Just imagine a Singaporean called themself Hokien does not know how to speak Hokien and a Teochew, his own Teochew dialect! Were we too enthusiastic in promoting Mandarin and forgetting about our own roots? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Culture is but a seed left behind to be groomed by the young ones. Traditions and cultures are not essential in life that we have to sow them even though they may give us an edge over the rest.<br><br>It is about time for our culture to evolve from our roots. We are living in different conditions and time, so we must learn to adopt new practices to improve our own lifestyle. Sticking to old traditions and thoughts may dent our pursuits. The ideal situation is to have both, but the benefits of one weighs over the other so it's possible we exchange or benefit the most out from it if we are denied having them simultaneously.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look at history itself, how do countries with many languages or cultural or religious groupings survive?<br><br>In a big country like India or China, there are bound to exist diverse groups and sub-groups based on language or religious denominations.<br><br>Ultimately for such countries to survive, common heritage, cultures or language are important and critical factor to bind different people together for national unity and sovereignty.<br><br>Such groups or dialents may provide richness of cultures and certain desirable diversities but over time such pluses may become minuses as such diverse groups may tend to be affected by conflicts or even demands for  separations.<br><br>A smaller country will be even more vulnerable to divisiveness due sensitive references or emphasis on cultural or dialect diversities. Let a Singapore nation be one where people generally speak a common unifying mother tongue - mandarin supplemented by a working language - English in our case.

It is true that cultures and languages are facing extinction or have already been extinct.  But you'd like to know that although, for example, it may die in Singapore, it is being revived somewhere else in the world.  It also so happens that it is the young generation that is reviving lost cultures, traditions and even languages.
