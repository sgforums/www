              <p>ya, i saw many old uncles who took their CPF enjoyed themselves
              in pubs with PRC aunties...you can see them changed, botak also
              highlighted their few hairs, wear jeans that they never wear before
              in their whole life, go facial when they never even wash their
              faces for most part of their life..travel to china to meet PRC
              babes when they dun even left singapore before..wow! within a few
              months, 30 years of CPF saving...gone..a total lack of financial
              control. Then they go back to collect plates and bottles.</p>

              <p>u saw many ? how many?? the cpf money rightfully belong to them, sad enough if a small portion of them choice to spent it that way then they have to bare their own consequence.</p>
              <p>the prob here is the dishonest govement  denying the citizen from their rightful earning.</p>
              <p>the money in cpf would be better off use in inversment, insurance etc etc.</p>

              <p><br>who are you leh?? why all of the sudden someone from nowhere come in and challenge me leh..aiya, nevermind lah, but just dun personal attack me lah, we are all here for fun mah, i hv never attack anyone personnally with vulgarity, the most i said is stupid or crazy, even i like my Uncle ATOBE or Ah Chia, they make my days. So what if we wins or lose here, the most important is the public, how they view us if they come to read or view here. So by saying a gal suck or cock is not going to give you a good image. I am ok, this is cyber, but you need to have some dignity ya. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Ok lah, anyway, understand from my Powerpuff gal from the durian
              puff shop who now works in CPF, she told me at least 60%
              singaporeans do not have enought minimum sum to draw their CPF upon
              55yo. That is sad</p>

              <p>true its a social prob. but not a big one enough for the goverment to implement all this, goverment's intention is to eat our money.</p>
              <p>anyway this is a soical prob that exist long before cpf is around, so it has nothing to do with it.</p>
              <p>its the goverment who are allow all the prc gals into singapore without valid reason.</p>
              <p>and it is also the govement's fault for not paying the police enough, which is why they are so short of manpower,hence there is nothinh much they can do as well.</p>

              <p>elinda, you have a point.    In a way, the CPF account is as good as the ruling parties' bank account.    Whenever they implement anything, they just take money from it without our consent, they treat as though it is their bank account.  knn</p>
