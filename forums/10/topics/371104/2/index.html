              <p>I feel that CPF is not a bad scheme and it especially useful for those who don't have the habit of saving money. However, they should let us withdraw part of the money at the age of around 45 and withdraw the total balance amount at the age of 60. 62 years old to start withdrawing is a bit too late. I wonder will I ever live long enough to get my money back.</p>
              <p>Not only that, other factors like foreigns talents invading, recession, retrechment will increase the higher chances of us being jobless at a younger age. Maybe at around 45 years old we may need a sum of money to overcome such crisis..</p>
              <p>Anyway, think bout the reason why gov actually increase the age of withdrawing from 55 to 62. U think it because of the increasing life span, encouraging employers to hire old folks?

              <p>I feel that CPF is not a bad scheme and it especially useful for those who don't have the habit of saving money. However, they should let us withdraw part of the money at the age of around 45 and withdraw the total balance amount at the age of 60. 62 years old to start withdrawing is a bit too late. I wonder will I ever live long enough to get my money back.</p>
              <p>Not only that, other factors like foreigns talents invading, recession, retrechment will increase the higher chances of us being jobless at a younger age. Maybe at around 45 years old we may need a sum of money to overcome such crisis..</p>

              <p>for many singapore uncles and aunties alike, 45 yo to them is a golden age for spending, CPF is a welfare of Singaporeans, basically from the middle class to the lower income class, the rich dun even bother about it. Since the 90s, i think CPF have become so flexible that it can be use to buy AAA class shares and bonds and also personal insurance, i think at that time, any profit gain from share can be withdraw out, that was what my Dad told me. But due to people using up their whole CPF on share, lost badly and even gain, spent lavishly end up CPF their CPF got nothing in it, so govt tightened the flexibility by not allowing profit gain to be withdraw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, today is unlike our ancestor yesterday, our average age of death is at 60 to 65, today, with better hygience, good healthcare, good life and education on health, our life span had increased to average 76 yo. Couple with an aging population that needs to work if not will die at the void deck, and a economy that needs both experiences and manpower, the official retirement was moved from 55 to 60 then to 62yo. You can withdraw your CPF at 55 partially and another time at 62yo if you meet the criteria of having enough self saving and assets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CPF have never failed to pay any one who have meet it critieria to withdraw his/her CPF, it had alway fulfil it trust to all. Whatever the govt used it or not is not an issue, but for 7 extra years of providing the funds, you also gain tremendously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To think that you will die before 65yo will be sad. Still young ya</p>

              <p>When a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>performs it is done with so much emotion that the essence of the drama gets lost with all the language of shock and awe for effects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somehow it seems to be lost amongst Singaporeans that the Employer's portion of the CPF contribution is part of the Employee's Monthly Wage.</p>
              <p>Is it generosity on the part of the Employer to contribute his share into the Employee's CPF - as the Employee already has 20 percent lopped off from the monthly wage ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=KV72O4mQ-WwC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=central+provident+fund+contribution+in+1955&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=evuuHY2TwI&amp;sig=ycid4_bIEcGXDsAVjUcgd8wlsBk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JRF5SsanKdaGkAXfytmwBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Singapore’s Central Provident Fund </a>scheme was started by the British Colonial Government in early 1955, and was not depended as a source of funding for national economic growth until the PAP took over the reins of Self-Government in 1957 - (from Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock, who left behind an empty State Treasury).</p>
              <p>The PAP had since then seen the CPF as a source of cheap funding for the many infrastructural development in Singapore, and the amounts collected monthly was increased even as more Singaporeans entered the workforce and had their payroll properly accounted.</p>
              <p>The original CPF in 1955 had the contribution amount fixed at 5 per cent by each party - the Employer and the Employee; and over the decades, the amount was gradually increased to save for the retirement age of 55 years.</p>
              <p>Even as the amount of contribution was being increased through the years - the PAP Government in 1984 had commissioned a study headed by a retired PAP Minister Howe Yoon Chong to look into the future prosp of the CPF.</p>
              <p>Following this study, the withdrawal age was recommended to be delayed in two stages, from age 55 years to a later age 60 and the next to be paid out by age 65.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, more features were added to the CPF in which the Account is divided with funds held back into different accounts and in order of priority - the Special Account (SA), Ordinary Account (OA), and Medisave Account (MA).</p>
              <p>Today, we have also included <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/CPF/my-cpf/Healthcare/PvdHC2.htm">Medishield, Medisave-Approved Integrated Shield Plans, Medifund and CPF Investment Scheme </a>- in which the monthly or annual premiums are deducted from the approved CPF account portions.</p>

              <p>How has the CPF scheme affected Singaporeans and their retirement ?</p>
              <p>Have we not been hearing that Singaporeans are <a rel="nofollow" href="http://knowledge.smu.edu.sg/article.cfm?articleid=1080">‘asset rich but cash poor’ </a>?</p>
              <p>With 90 per cent of Singaporeans living in public housing properties - that are over-priced to start with, what will be the real value of these properties when these reach closer to the end of the 99-year lease period ?</p>

              <p>An abstract from the above study is quite telling and done so with less drama:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore's Central Provident Fund (CPF) has served well in the old economy as a macroeconomic stabilisation policy. It finessed the developmental state and created socio-political stability with home ownership extended to health, education and asset enhancement schemes. However, structural changes with globalisation, information communication technology (ICT) and the new knowledge-based economy (KBE), plus a series of crises and downturns since the Asian crisis have undermined full employment as the lynchpin of the triangulation and CPF model. Announcements made in August 2003 are germane to this paper's discussion of the reinvention of the CPF model. Profound and creative reinvention to balance between neo-liberal market-based solutions without losing the socio-political control enjoyed by the ruling regime, however, remains a political choice as in delinking the CPF–fiscal process, CPF serves members or state.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All in all, can the CPF scheme sustain itself in an environment when the birth rate is declining, and for the CPF to succeed - it will require either a growing entry of CPF contributors to make up the size of withdrawals from a growing number of retirees; or the management of the funds will have to supercede the amount that is expected to be withdrawn by the retirees at the approved ages.</p>
              <p>Will the continuous plans to delay the withdrawal age, or new schemes to spend the CPF savings on dubious approved plans help Singaporeans in any ways ?</p>
              <p>If at all the CPF is operating in an environment that track close to a Ponzi scheme - requiring more and more participants into the Provident Fund, that will require the ever increasing new migrants into Singapore to begin work, contribute their CPF payment and with sufficient numbers of immigrants to balance the books of the growing withdrawal amounts by retirees and Singaporean migrants going overseas.</p>
              <p>Will it surprise anyone that the PAP Government will ignore the major parts of the recommendation - made by a Third <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/parliament/erc/summary_0715.htm">Economic Review Committee – Sub-Committee on policies related to taxation, the CPF System, Wages and Land – 15 July 2002 </a>- when two earlier ERC had submitted their reply after the Economic Crash in 1987 and the next in 1997 ?</p>
              <p>What constructive contribution can the resident <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> in this Speaker's Corner offer except cynical venom dispensed with all the characteristic drama ?</p>
              <p>Even a retired Civil Servant <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vsion/Ngiam_Tong_Dow">Ngiam Tong Dow </a>has expressed his more potent views with less drama - does he have to take a hike too ? </p>

              <p>Jesus!!!  where are u from?? dont be lost, boy.....looks

              help you reach your financial goals like retirement, education,
              health, property investment using your cpf....if u do need help...i
              can recommend some good consultants...just pm me...lol</p>

              hdb,..hmmmm...how about pte condo ?? pay your cpf to pte developers
              through the non govt banks. ....bingo, your problem solved!!</p>
