              <p>It's 14.5% from employer, just to update you.</p>
              <p>And its all based on a $4,500 ceiling (You put in 20% of $4500 even if you earn more than that per month)</p>
              <p>Locking your $$$ is a way for the govt to have a pile of $$$ to sit on in case of a rainy day. That is where many governments are turning to in the economic crisis to pump extra cash into the markets.</p>
              <p>And I think its 62 years old that you can draw upon your cash now (and even for special account, you can only withdraw a certain specified amount per month, not the entire sum)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are good and bad of CPF scheme.  The good things are that members can use cpf funds to purchase HDB flat with small interest rate and some kind of force savings for those who do not know how to save.  The bad things are the rules on minimum sum, medisave,etc.  It should go back to basic when members were allowed to withdraw the full sum upon reaching the age of 55 years, many years ago.  What they do with their money is their personal matter.  Upon reaching that age (55), they should be matured enough to use their cpf funds wisely.  Of course there are small minority who waste their cpf funds unnecessarily.  I would urge the govt to go back to basic then people will stop accusing them of intentionally retaining their life savings.</div>

So at the end of the day, you got 1 million in your CPF, remember 14.5% of it is what the laws provided it.

              <p>There are good and bad of <span>CPF</span> scheme. The
              good things are that members can use cpf funds to purchase
              <span>HDB</span> flat with small interest rate and some
              kind of force savings for those who do not know how to save. The
              bad things are the rules on minimum sum, medisave,etc. It should go
              back to basic when members were allowed to withdraw the full sum
              upon reaching the age of 55 years, many years ago. What they do
              with their money is their personal matter. Upon reaching that age
              (55), they should be matured enough to use their cpf funds wisely.
              Of course there are small minority who waste their cpf funds
              unnecessarily. I would urge the govt to go back to basic then
              people will stop accusing them of intentionally retaining their
              life savings.</p>

              <p>Ok. So there is this cpf contribution but I still see many old people in some dark corner of Chinatown collecting plates and worst stil collecting bardboxes and many of these people did not anyhow spend their cpf money.</p>
              <p>Most of these people are old aunties and not the typical uncles who withdraw all their money to spend on PRCs prostitute that you mentioned</p>
