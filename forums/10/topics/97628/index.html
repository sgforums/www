            <div class='col-md body'>One forumer ask me this question:<br><br>redbean wrote:<br>goh meng seng,<br><br>what kind of opposition are you when 145,000 people with medisave arrears are crying for help? hope i didn't get the figure wrong.<br><br>My answers as follow:<br><br>I will fight for the right priorities!<br><br>Ngiam TD is right that PAP govt shouldn't try to micro manage the economy. Forced saving like medisave is silly. Just like somebody has expressed frustration about IRAS forcefully deducted the taxes he owes from his bank account which would put him into situation with little money left for the next meal.<br><br>PAP govt is too obsessed with rules and statistics. It will only care about its own coffers and intakes, damn about how people will survive.<br><br>Needless to say, there are of course some who could afford to pay up the tax or the medisave arrears but refused to do so for whatever reasons. But in this bad economic situation, there are even more genuine cases of great financial stress which make them unable to pay up! Instead of exercising empathy and discretion, in one swoop, the agencies of the govt acted like souless machines!<br><br>If a person couldn't even be sure of where the next meal will come from, would you expect him to pay you tax arrears or even forced saving like medisave?<br><br>The more decent thing the govt should practice is to send social workers to screen out those people who are in arrears. Who are the genuine people who could not be forced into saving like medisave. Allow them to renew their licenses so that they could make their living but at the same thing, pay it in various installments. Putting people into jail or even fine them will not solve the problem but will only expose the ruthlessness of the PAP govt.<br><br>Sending reminders and reminders of arrears of payment is useless. SingPower claims that they don't cut off electricity and water that easily, but will send reminders after reminders.... but if the client does not have a job and money to pay, no amount of reminders could solve the problem what! Such cases should be referred to social workers to go and find out the situation on the ground.<br><br>If our PAP govt claims that structural unemployment is here to stay, then I will say, simply stating the fact will not help at all. A systematic social welfare system has to be in place to cater to such misfortunate ones. Fining people, jailing people forcing people to make payments on whatever arrears and cutting off necessary utilities are not going to help at all. If social workers has established that a family is indeed in financial trouble, money chasing tactics from CPF, IRAS and SingPower are the least thing we should expect to happen to them.<br><br>Where is the "Caring" and "Gracious" society that PAP is promising when the govt under its charge are so unforgiving and uncaring, least gracious?<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is taken from HGCC website:<br><br>http://www.wp.org.sg/hgcc/service.htm<br><br>The Hougang Constituency Education Trust is another establishment under the auspices of Mr Low. The Trust grants financial assistance through the award of bursaries to needy students living in Hougang constituency.<br><br>When Mr Low was elected MP for Hougang in the 1991 General Elections, the only bursary available in the constituency was provided by the Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) under the Hougang Community Centre. Advisors of such "community" organisations have always been either a PAP MP or in opposition wards, a prospective candidate of the PAP at a next national election.<br><br>In August 1992, Mr Low initiated the formation of the Trust with the support and help from five concerned Hougang residents, namely Mr Ng Thee Lim (deceased), Mr Lim Leck Theng (deceased), Mr Toh Guan Chua, Mr Ang Kim Soon (deceased) and Mr Phoon Song Ngh (deceased). The Trust worked vigorously to raise funds through the auctioning of plaques at the Chinese Seventh Month commemoration festivities and temple functions.<br><br>Since then, the Trust has seen yearly awards of some 80 bursaries for needy students from Primary to Tertiary levels. The awards are usually presented by the MP at the Christmas Children's Party function held annually in December by the HGCC.<br></div>
