              <h2 class="art-PostHeader"><a title="Permanent Link to Police report against relief cabby: Real Threat or Mere Paranoia?" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/06/08/police-report-against-relief-cabby-real-threat-or-paranoia/"><span style="color: #778888;">Police report against relief cabby: Real Threat or Mere Paranoia?</span></a></h2>
              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p class="art-PostHeader">During a visit to Sai Kung last Sunday to promote his reform package to the people, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang was greeted by hundreds of disgruntled citizens who heckled, abused and accused him of âselling outâ the people. (read report <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/06/07/hong-kong-protesters-heckle-tsang-at-reform-roadshow/"><span style="color: #6d7e7e;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Not only must he put up with a torrent of verbal abuse including vulgarities in Cantonese from the crowd, he also had to guard himself against possible flying eggs and slippers thrown at him from nowhere.</p>
              <p>One protestor ran towards him swearing to âdo him inâ and was stopped by the police before he could reach Tsang. Despite the cacophony, no arrests were made. The police simply stood by and watched.</p>
              <p>Had the scenario occurred in Singapore,Â riot trucks will be called in immediately and the protestors arrested and brought away forcefully by our Singapore Police Force.</p>
              <p>Last week, a 52 year old relief cabby Mr Teo Kian SengÂ was charged in court for âthreateningâ his PAP MP Lee Yi Shyan. One would have thought that he must have done or said some horrible things to scare the wits out of the newbie MP, but all he did was to remind Lee that he hoped he would not see a ârepeatâ of the torching incident of Seng Han Thong last year.</p>
              <p>How this can be construed or misconstrued as a âthreatâ by the MP and the Singapore police is anybodyâs guess. The poor man had gone to see Lee at his Meet-the-People session in Bedok over a summons received by his elderly mother for leaving her âgarang-guniâ along the corridor.</p>
              <p>The media did not report what transpire in the conversation between the two men, but surely Mr Teo would not have uttered those regrettable words for no good reason.</p>
              <p>Either he was provoked into doing so or he had a slip of tongue. One thing for sure: the exchange between Mr Teo and Lee is unlikely to be a pleasant encounter.</p>
              <p>In all likelihood, Mr Teo probably said the âthreateningâ sentence out of anger or frustration and bears no malice or ill-will for it was not mentioned if Mr Teo had raised his voice or behaved in a hostile manner towards Lee.</p>
              <p>An understanding and magnanimous gentleman would have forgotten the incident and let it pass instead of lodging a police report.</p>
              <p>In most cases, the police will not even bother to investigate and will simply refer the complainant to the Magistrateâs court, but of course when it involves a PAP MP, they are especially âefficientâ.</p>
              <p>The PAP MPs should realize that they are bound to encounter rude, unpleasant and unruly residents during their grassroots work. There will be people who are unhappy, peeved and angry at the government and they will naturally become their immediate targets to vent their frustrations on.</p>
              <p>During his visit to Tainan county last year in the aftermath of the Typhoon Morakot, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-Jeou was mobbed by angry villagers who threatened to beat him into a pulp. The unfortunate scene was telecast âliveâ on Taiwanese TV.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere in Asia, it is relatively common to see lawmakers being heckled, abused and even beaten physically by disgruntled citizens when they are out in the public.</p>
              <p>While violent behavior should not be condoned and deserved to be prosecuted, more discretion should be exercised by the authorities in the dealing of cases like Mr Teoâs which appears to be ambiguous in nature.</p>
              <p>The role of an MP is to serve as an intermediary between the people and the government and to be an official channel for feedback from the ground, whether positive or negative.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew wrote in his memoirs that he and his entourage was jeered, heckled and jostled by opposition supporters when he was campaigning for the PAP in strongholds held by the Barisan Sosialis and he was even pushed into the drain on one occasion.</p>
              <p>The present generation of new PAP MPs are indeed âstrawberryâ MPs who appear unable to differentiate between real threat and mere paranoia.</p>
              <p>Facing and dealing with unhappy Singaporeans are part and parcel of their work as MPs. If the PAP MPs are so easily âthreatenedâ, then perhaps they should seriously reconsider their positions as representatives of the people in Parliament.</p>
              <p>It is so much easier being a MP in Singapore compared to Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian countries and it is a shame that PAP MPs still get paranoid over such trivial incidents.</p>
              <p>These are the kind of MPs we get when they do not have to fight tooth and nail for every single vote from the people and are whisked into Parliament either through walkovers or GRCs.</p>
              <p>Under the PAPâs uninterrupted rule for more than five decades, the term âMPâ has taken a new definition altogether. Instead of serving the people as they should be, they are now behaving like little emperors whom the people must kowtow to and beg on their knees for help.</p>
