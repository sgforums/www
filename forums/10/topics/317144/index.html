              <p><span class="postbody"> Goods and Services Tax is the tax started in those countries of large
              geographical area experiencing difficulty in administering reporting
              and certifications of income.
              <br> <br>We do not need such a tax because of we have a smaller graphical
              area where it is possible to implement reporting of business incomes
              through annual auditing and submissions of business incomes.
              <br> <br>In addition, we are the only country in the world where people pay
              heavy taxes on vehicle excise duty, petrol tax, road tax, COE and ERP
              taxes using excuses of all sorts to squeeze more with lies like we are
              incurring budget deficits when the government is hoarding and hiding
              its billion surpluses.
              <br> <br>On top of these indirect taxes we have the heaviest tax of all -
              the housing tax which Mah Bow Tan introduced which is without
              justification in view that lands were already paid by people under
              taxes.
              <br> <br>If Lim Kim San has been around he would find it extremely
              unconscionable to tax so heaving through housing at the costs of some
              $80 - 100 K per family with excuse of "No free Lunch" to do so.
              <br> <br>Yet with so many taxes as stated in the foregoing there is no need
              or justification for GST. Yet GST is being introduced which is actually
              a double-tax over and above personal income and corporation taxes and
              all the indirect vehicle and housing taxes.
              <br> <br>No wonder people are hard hit and unable to feedback their families
              because after paying his personal income and corporate taxes he is
              still required to pay more taxes.</span></p>

              <p>The part in red, there are many countries which have GST in addition to personal income and corporation taxes too.</p>
