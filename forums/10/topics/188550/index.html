            <div class='col-md body'>Still remember the journalist who wrote a long letter to PM Lee to complain about his unfair dismissal on account of an article he wrote which the special editor refused to publish.<br><br>He pleaded how being an international renown journalist he was summarily dismissed by his superial special editor on account of an unfavorable article he drafted for publication and how he was overruled by a less experienced editor.<br><br>He pleaded with PM Lee was his explanation which showed that the special editor was being over-sensitive about his views in that article.<br><br>It appeared that our press is totally overshadowed and controlled by the authority vested in that special editor. There was no news that that journalist was subsequently given a fair hearing by the PM. It is not known if he was reinstated or compensated for such treatment through a proper hearing.<br><br>No wonder none of the 10 journalists having dialogue with MM Lee dared to counter the vehement points made by MM Lee about Singaporeans' fears to speak up on their views about government.</div>

It will take a very courageous journalist like Lee Han Shih to write something critical about government mistake or HDB making heavy losses.<br><br>Alternative views about goodness of free flow of information by Michael Backman was challenged by a strong letter from MITa. Such view will not be published very often.<br><br>Once a one-off article was published of retired civil servant Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow view about success of Athenian system practising diversities of the people, as against the Spartan system of control and discipline.<br><br>But this was the only article ever published with no follow-through as apparently no one dared to follow up with more views on this subject. So even if once in a while we read of diverse views written about in election time such news will very soon dry up once the election is over. It is like opening a little crack in the window to let in a bit of flesh air and that window will be closed again.</div>
