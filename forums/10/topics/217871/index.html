            <div class='col-md body'>THE suggestion to levy a tax for the use of plastic bags should be implemented by the government soon.<br>I refer to the article 'Cut use of plastic bags? Levy tax on users' by Peh Shing Hui on Oct 27.<br><br>There has been a lot of talk about reducing the use of plastic bags and many initiatives have been taken by supermarket chains on this but little has been achieved.<br><br>Any other move to encourage the use of recycleable bags will also fail because the use of plastic bags and other plastic products, without any consideration for serious environmental damage, is a national habit that is almost impossible to change.<br><br>Whether it is the neighbourhood minimart or the big supermarket chains, most customers will insist on using plastic bags even for small items.<br><br>This can also be observed at the shopping malls every day.<br><br>A tax levied on plastic bags is in line with pay-as-you-use schemes such as the GST, ERP and so on.<br><br>Despite much publicity, there is still widespread public ignorance of the huge environmental costs associated with plastic bag usage.<br><br>Since all the efforts at weaning Singaporeans off the dependence on plastic bags have produced miserable results, it is time we gave legislation a chance.<br><br>Phillip Ang Keng Hong<br><br>(Straits Times Forum Page, 31 Oct)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to my observation, Singaporean did not adopt the lifestyle of sorting out their rubbish according to the the rubbish's nature (ie. organic / recycleable or according to any other catergory. Japanese are doing this for years.). So they put every rubbish into one plastic bag and throw them down the rubbish chute. I still remember my primary school health education textbook states that, it is more hygiene (as it will keep the stench inside the plastic bag) and cleaners are less prompt to injuries. Keeping rubbish inside plastic bag also helps to prevent pest like rats and cockroaches away, as stated in the same textbook.<br><br>Yes, of course, we can also use the recycleable bags to put our rubbish in. But do you trust it to contain gravy (virtually 80% water)? As it is basic physicsWe all know that liquid will always find it's way to the bottom of the container, as it is basic physics. Of course, we can use the water resistance recycleable bags. What about the cost of these bags? Are they cheaper than the good-old plastic bag? Can an average Joe afford these recycleable bags to put the rubbish?<br><br>Basic uses aside, the price tag of these recycleable bags is marked $1. Of course, it is viewed as cheap in some of the well-off family, but does it apply to your average Joe?<br><br>Has Mr (I assume it is a "Mr" from the name "Phillip") Phillip Ang Keng Hong ever put these into consideration before making such a suggestion?</div>
