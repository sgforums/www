Indonesia's forcible displacement of villagers, the deliberate poisoning of crops and water sources and its refusal to allow international aid agencies to provide relief in the early stages of the occupation led to famines.<br><br>It is graphic and difficult reading, containing allegations of the mutilation of sexual organs, the burning of nipples and genitalia with cigarettes, the rape of pregnant women, and the rape and torture of women in front of their children. The commission found lists of East Timorese women who could be routinely forced to go to a military post or headquarters so that soldiers could rape them.<br><br>The armed forces and their proxies have been accused of killings by beating and torture, of burning and burying people alive, of displaying human ears and genitals to the families of the disappeared, and of ordering victims to dig their own graves before execution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There no doubt that there are advantages and disadvantages with regard to NS. A country cannot survive just based on politics and hope that ppl don't invade us. You just need a crazy president in one of our neighbouring country to invade us and all will be gone down to drain.<br><br>This is something that we cannot take it for granted as there is too much at stake. Also why would we want to poke our nose into other countries politics and stuff when we have our own backyard to look after. Yes there maybe issue with their goverment, but that doesn't mean we should and we can force them to change by using santions and stuffs.<br><br>It the same as Nguyen case where there are people that try to pressure our goverment to change the law. You think you will like it when someone is telling you how to run ur own country? You won't like it isn't it? So it the same as other countries, we have no right to interfere with how they rule their own country even though we don't agree with it.<br><br>Don't forget Singapore are good at maintaining good relation with other countries. Example like we are one of the few country that can maintain good relation with BOTH China and Taiwan isn't it?<br><br>Bottom line is if you don't like someone to do that "something" to you, then you shouldn't do it to them too.<br><br>From the long history of human race, politics have always been a mixture of righteous and scheming. Even if sometime it mean having to agree with something that is not right in order to get thing done. Also governing a country is not as easy as just using mouth to say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As i said earlier, politics is a dark game where you don't always agree or disagree as there are many thing to consider. This is not up to us to decide, who know maybe you or i or someone else maybe doing the samething if we are in their shoes. Reason is simply you gotta to look at the whole picture if it is advisable. You can call it selfish or whatever, but that is just human nature.<br><br>Even if we did our best and fall at least we won't blame ourselves when we lost cos we did our best to protect our love ones. Even if they die, they will know we did our very best to protect them.<br><br>Moral issue, sadly to say it don't always exist when politics is in play because each of them will want what is best for their own countries even if it mean selfish decision.<br><br>Trade with Myanmar will do both countries good in term of economic so i don't see why we don't trade with them. Even though rumour have been around regarding laundering of drug money for them, but well it something that is yet to be fully proven.<br><br>Also if Aung San Suu Kyi is to come to power, i don't think it will cause relation to turn bad as in the view of politician, both will stand to gain if they work together.<br><br>In politics there is no forever friends nor forever enemy. Decision are made based on interest of the nation rather then personal grudge. If you are the PM and you think this country and that country and that country not doing the right things when governing their own country, do you stop trade with them?

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to topic -<br><br>Lets see a balance side of the whole story.. shall we ?<br><br><strong>US approved 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor</strong><br><br>Previously secret documents published by the National Security Archive at George Washington University prove that the United States government gave the green light for the 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor, which resulted in the deaths of some 200,000 Timorese people over the ensuing quarter century.<br><br>At the ArchiveÂ’s request, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library released two key declassified documents revealing the role of President Ford and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Archive posted them on its web site on December 6, accompanied by five previously unpublished State Department documents.<br><br>The documents expose the official silence and outright lies advanced over the past 26 years to deny that Ford and Kissinger were involved in, and ultimately responsible for, the atrocities carried out by the Indonesian military dictatorship.<br><br>It had been known previously that Ford and Kissinger held a discussion with General Suharto in Jakarta on the day before IndonesiaÂ’s full-scale invasion on December 7, 1975. But the precise content of the meeting has never been revealed. It was always obvious that Ford and Kissinger must have sanctioned the invasion, yet Kissinger explicitly denied this.<br><br>By the time that Ford and Kissinger visited Jakarta, the Indonesian military had already made several incursions into East Timor, the most notorious being in the border town of Balibo on October 16, 1975. Five Australian-based journalists in Balibo had been killed by the Indonesian military in an effort to prevent wide reportage of the attack.<br><br><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/dec2001/kiss-d19.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/dec2001/kiss-d19.shtml</a><br><br>The militias are credibly reported to be under the direction of Kopassus, the dreaded Indonesian special forces modeled on the US Green Berets and "legendary for their cruelty," as the prominent Indonesia scholar Benedict Anderson observes. He adds that in East Timor, "Kopassus became the pioneer and exemplar for every kind of atrocity," including systematic rapes, tortures, and executions, and organization of hooded gangsters. Concurring, Australia's veteran Asia correspondent David Jenkins notes that this "crack special forces unit [had] been training regularly with US and Australian forces until their behavior became too much of an embarrassment for their foreign friends." Congress did bar US training of the killers and torturers under IMET, but the Clinton Administration found ways to evade the laws, leading to much irritation in Congress but little broader notice. Now, congressional constraints may be more effective, but without the kind of inquiry that is rarely undertaken in the case of US-backed terror, one cannot be confident.<br><br><a href="http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19990826.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19990826.htm</a><br><br>Why ? benefits who ? for Oil of course<br><br><strong>AustraliaÂ’s plunder of East TimorÂ’s oil and gas</strong><br><br>Both the US and Australian governments refused to publicly condemn these attacks. Gough WhitlamÂ’s Labor government even denied the incursions were taking place.<br><br>CanberraÂ’s role in this incident reflected the broader desires of Australian imperial interests in the Asia-Pacific. For East Timor, this meant brutal military occupation so that Australia-based mining and oil interests could more easily access the untapped wealth of the Timor Sea. AustraliaÂ’s acceptance of the invasion and occupation of East Timor also helped open the door for these same business interests to Indonesia itself.<br><br><a href="http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2005/650/650p14.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2005/650/650p14.htm</a><br><br><strong>East Timor: AustraliaÂ’s double betrayal</strong><br><br>Since the East Timorese independence referendum in 1999, the Australian government has received approximately $1 billion dollars in taxes on oil taken from the Laminaria Corallina field, which is fully situated in East Timorese territory.<br><br><a href="http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/576/576p24.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/576/576p24.htm</a><br><br><strong>You see why Australia is stationing troops in Timor now... nobody does this without benefits.. you know ..</strong><br><br><strong>EAST TIMOR - the U.S., Australian, and European sponsored, Indonesian-invasion and genocide</strong><br><br>This brief article contains information on how the U.S.A, U.K., Australian &amp; other Western Governments sponsored the Indonesian plunder of East Timor from 1975 to 1999.<br><br>A good read<br><a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~eye/propaganda/articles/east_timor.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.iinet.net.au/~eye/propaganda/articles/east_timor.html</a><br><br>US , British and Australia are great pals.. even operate similarly.
