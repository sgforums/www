            <div class='col-md body'>"I dreamt that I was hit by a 4 - 5m high waves and I was dragged and pulled into the sea, it was dark and I don't know where I was at that time"... I dreamt this.... was quite sometime ago and I was curious and I really don't know what's the real true meaning of my dream..... after sometime, I stopped travelling to any parts of Asia like I used to, well especially Malaysia this year.  Along the way, I planned to go to Bali but I changed my mind and decided not to go there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>And now... you see what had happened to Asia?  Asia was hit by the waves... and you know what?  I guess I was so lucky that I was still here safe and also shocked to know that my dreams really came true, it's not me hit by waves but it's Asia hit by the tsunami waves  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>And now I have this idea... I don't know whether it's good or bad, but I think  it's a great idea for Singapore to be the best place to keep track of Asian's earthquake movement and to be the Center of sending International warning signals to other parts of the countries in this world when earthquakes or tsunami waves or hurriance or typhoon happens, because Singapore is in the center of other Asian countries and it's safe and it's where you can get help easily especially when it concerns medical treatment (SOS), and modern technology and network and other type of services to other countries, this is all I have in mind and am not sure whether the highest authority will take my idea into great consideration...<br><br>Wish for peace and harmony in life....... safe the planet..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice idea.Hope that the authorities are willing to take up this idea.If not, we should encourage geologists and relief NGOs to set-up shop here.I'm thinking that we can use our location and coordinate relief efforts and disaster monitoring  due to our excellent communications infrastructure and our transportation links.We need to find a niche in the 21st Century and since we have always used our geophysical location to our advantage, we can do so again.Imagine, a medical research hub, disaster and geological coordination center, logistics and oil refining, perhaps a future satellite launch and maintenance hub. That sounds as good as any a future when compared to today.Problem is that we need a progressive government and professional regulatory agencies who are able to impress on others our capabilities and willingness to do so.</div>
