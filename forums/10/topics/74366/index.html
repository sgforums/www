            <div class='col-md body'>I support the easing up of censorship in singapore. Sometimes too many cuts in the show really leave one bewildered on wat is going on or miss out an important detail.<br><br>However sad to say there r always complain kings and queens who will jump up and write an equally convincing essay on being strict on censoring... They even complain about scenes where guys should not dressed up as girls in show (after a silly show where MC king dress up as girl) or allowing shows tat r too violent to be in. Guess censorship board is torn up between the 2 parties.<br><br>Frankly they should ignore most silly complaints to step up censorship...</div>

Because Singapore's movie making industry is disconnected from the Western world via conservatism. Singapore is a backwar.. i mean.. conservative society, films and film making is thus DULL compared to that in the West.
