              <p>I think the Singaporeans that welcome foreigners, besides Malaysians, are mainly those who ever worked or studied overseas before. They feel the sense of being Asians in a Caucasian land, thus, they are better in interacting with other Southeast Asians, Chinese and Indian nationals.</p>
              <p>The ones in NUS, NTU, SMU don't quite welcome. They are always badmouthing them behind their backs, not in front of them, that's why there are no evidences proving of their hostility towards them.</p>
              <p>Americans are superior. I do agree. However, my sis said, in NYC, a White American, even of the British ancestry, is probably not a cut above the rest when compared to other races. It's not in Georgia or Mississippi, where the Southern traditions still stay. NYC is very very diverse with a place full of all sorts of immigrants. It had outlawed slavery of the Blacks about 70 years before the whole nation outlawed it. All sorts of culture take place in this bustling city and call it the land of the free. This is true for Toronto and Vancouver as well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, even you also can migrate there to shine. Or your kids can do so one day.</p>

              <p>And i am also surprise u excluded Singapore PAP government of being racist.At first glance,LKY,LHL n GCT seem to be noble person,not racist n welcome all nationalities to stay n live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But,it is only their cover up act.They have no love for their own countrymen or women,not to mention their own race.They will slaughter any races,so long as they are Singaporeans n make them as slaves n work for them.They will suck up their money,they will prolong their retirement age,they will lock up their CPF money.</p>
              <p>LKY,LHL n GCT will do anything immoral just to let themselves get the highest pay in the world as politicians.In short,they are a bunch of hypocrites.To me,they are the most racist ppl in the world.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: small;">Today if you think 4 races are multi diverse cultural than ALL of you are WRONG. It is the present of minority that gives Singapore the sense of Multi Culture society.  4 is not multi. 4 is only quattro.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">Ironically today our cabinet minister are so limited in minorities representation. Saddly we are loosing our minorities residents. I am not sure about culture diversity in Singapore we  merely evolved to a <strong>C</strong>inga<strong>P</strong>ore<strong>F</strong>. where our middle name as a CPF initial.</span></span></p>

              <p>I think the Singaporeans that welcome foreigners, besides Malaysians, are mainly those who ever worked or studied overseas before. They feel the sense of being Asians in a Caucasian land, thus, they are better in interacting with other Southeast Asians, Chinese and Indian nationals.</p>
              <p>The ones in NUS, NTU, SMU don't quite welcome. They are always badmouthing them behind their backs, not in front of them, that's why there are no evidences proving of their hostility towards them.</p>
              <p>Americans are superior. I do agree. However, my sis said, in NYC, a White American, even of the British ancestry, is probably not a cut above the rest when compared to other races. It's not in Georgia or Mississippi, where the Southern traditions still stay. NYC is very very diverse with a place full of all sorts of immigrants. It had outlawed slavery of the Blacks about 70 years before the whole nation outlawed it. All sorts of culture take place in this bustling city and call it the land of the free. This is true for Toronto and Vancouver as well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, even you also can migrate there to shine. Or your kids can do so one day.</p>

              <p>My sister said this! My sister said that! and 'I think blah blah blah' you think what? Go see and experience NYC or anywhere outside your own constituency for yourself get a first hand experience on racsism and then I would really like to hear more from you.</p>
