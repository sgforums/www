              <p>Yes. The crime rate scene happens especially in Harlem neighbourhood in NYC.</p>
              <p>It's true the media will do window dressing on its ways to promote global diversity at the workplace. Same for Singapore. Although the PAP always emphasizes on racial harmony and globalization and not forgetting, foreign talent, do you think Singapore is still so welcoming towards those foreigners?</p>
              <p>I tell you, many many are still unwelcome.</p>
              <p>Look at the Bangla workers. How they are being treated and discriminated? Remember when the government tries to designate housing for them in Serangoon? There are many local dissidents to this policy.</p>
              <p>I still don't know how far those new races are being discriminated at the white collar workplaces. But then let me tell you it is in human nature that when one sees a foreigner the first time, especially of different skin colour, he or she tends to ask questions about culture. There will still be judgement anyway. I see a foreigner as a foreigner usually, except probably for Malaysians or Indonesians. I talk to them like tourists. I don't really socialize with them the way I can socialize with my local friends.</p>
              <p>The 1st introductory impression of a foreigner is always more judgemental than towards locals.</p>
              <p>US, Canadian and Australian authorities do not declare Chinese New Year, Aidil Fitri, Deepavali, African festivals or any other non-American, non-Canadian, non-Australian or non-European festivities as public holidays even at municipal level, rather than national level. This is because they are only constituting a very tiny percentage of the national demographics. It's just like allowing Burmese or Filipino festivals declared as public holidays in Singapore now. How weird can this be if they are declared?</p>
              <p>To me these countries do follow what the UK has been practising as of 17th and 18th century as when these countries become independent, people of the British ancestry make up the majority in them. But then they do allow Jewish festivals to be public holidays there now.</p>
              <p>Thus, anyways, I don't think Singaporeans are even more cosmopolitan than the New Yorkers or Torontoans by judging at the ways Singaporeans preceive the foreigners. It is only in the eyes and ears of the PAP or people who have worked or studied overseas before. Singapore does not even have rights for the minority immigrants, whereas HK, NYC and Toronto have them. So how can Singapore be more cosmopolitan than them?</p>

              <p>I thought this is the one.</p>
              <p>Singapore since time immemorial does not even have one such group.</p>
              <p>The people are the problem in welcoming foreign talent as they tend to compete fiercely with them.</p>
              <p>The government has been trying to hide this fact by continuously painting over it to make bad things seem good, or unnice things seem nice.</p>

              <p>New York City - (not New York State) - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neighbor/neigh.shtml">is sub-divided into some very famous districts, </a>known as Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Transit Districts, and some other Housing districts.</p>
              <p>Each of these districts has its own characteristics in the congregating of different immigrant ethnic groups that tend to be drawn to their own community, who had arrived earlier; and as the growth of each ethnic group differ from each other, one group will grow faster then the other and will expand into other areas.</p>
              <p>Some districts are seen to be "up-market" for the high priced development of the past and new residential and commercial projects that attracted those who can afford to stay in these districts.</p>
              <p>This has resulted in "commercial and residential segregation" of communities to their respective districts that may not necessarily be negative, as each group support the activities of the other.</p>
              <p>The strain between the communities only appear in the different quality of the environment and social amenities that are evident between different districts where the rich live and work, and where the less rich live and work, and where the poor live and unable to qualify for any work.</p>
              <p>Is there "racism" in New York ?</p>
              <p>It is a place where migrants have arrived to find a new beginning since the 19th Century, and where a man's entrepreneurship to flourish.</p>
              <p>It is a City that runs on commercial ethos, where if you are able to "Best the very Best" that the system has produced - you will be recognised, feted and rewarded.</p>
              <p>It is an open City where migrant arrivals depend on the policies set by the Federal Government.</p>
              <p>The positive feature is that all are migrants in New York City, the open hand of generosity is always extended to help - where homeless shelter exist to provide warmth and hot food in the cold winter months, and programs exist to assist the poor to find subsistence.</p>
              <p>If racism exist, it is due to the human instincts at work that develop pre-conceived ideas towards those different from oneself, and the defensive mechanism interplay.</p>

              <p>Singapore seems so welcoming towards foreigners only because the PAP says so as they want $. The bosses also like it as it can cut on their hiring expenses. It is not really the commoners that want such things but they fear to speak out.</p>
              <p>Of course the Straits Times won't say that the local people don't quite like foreigners. In NTU, for example, there are many anti-foreigner sentiments among the local students everywhere. They always insult those foreigners who don't know how to behave properly.</p>

              <p><br>Hahaha actually its the opposite, i've read a lot of comments here in sgforums and there's always a lot of insulting comments on the foreigners... so we are no different from them. but I notice you dont have any insulting comments on the Americans and Europeans. Try going to europe or US I'm sure the people there will give you some insulting comments too, because of our funny chinese eyes, laughing at our singlish, calling us pandas...</p>

              <p>You don't have real experience of Singaporeans not welcoming foreigners either. Complaining on the internet is different from actually not welcoming. So how could your opinion be accurate when you do not have experience of both spectrums to draw your conclusion from?</p>

              <p>I think the Singaporeans that welcome foreigners, besides Malaysians, are mainly those who ever worked or studied overseas before.

              <p>The ones in NUS, NTU, SMU don't quite welcome. They are always badmouthing them behind their backs, not in front of them, that's why there are no evidences proving of their hostility towards them.</p>
              <p>Americans are superior. I do agree. However, my sis said, in NYC, a White American, even of the British ancestry, is probably not a cut above the rest when compared to other races. It's not in Georgia or Mississippi, where the Southern traditions still stay. NYC is very very diverse with a place full of all sorts of immigrants.

              <p>still dont see the pt why compare to places of such diverse and cultural backgrounds. i am not singapore are perfect but it is also ridiculous to compare NYC with singapore. probably the one who need to open heart to accept  is you. the heart to accept differences among different ethnic background, cultural , social opinion.</p>
