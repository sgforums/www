              <p>Firstly, racism has nothing to do with the number of different races living together.</p>
              <p>New York and Singapore has nearly about the same cosmopolitan mix of different population living and working together, althought the ethnic types may differ.</p>
              <p>Secondly, racism is about attitudes in prejudices, discrimination, and negative acts towards those who are different from ourselves.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, racism can happen anywhere on earth, and does not require a situation where the majority race discriminate against the minority race. As was seen in Iraq during the rule of Saddam Hussein when his minority Sunni Muslim Community held political power and discriminated against the larger population of Shiite Muslim Community.</p>

Even Hong Kong has a surprising no. of Africans, Indians and Malays, not just Ang Moh, even though many of them can hardly muster any Cantonese. The standard line in the west is that you can eat different kinds of food in restaurants. What a load of hogwash! If u've got the money, you can eat Sushi in Moscow or Vietnamese in London. Big deal. Its called splashing the cash - somebody will want to take it if you are willing to pay. But what about eating different types of ethnic food at prices where students can afford, for breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper? Students in Singapore living on their own dun even need to cook.</p>
              <p>The US always tout the line that a melting pot is some cool thing. Really? U guys lack the experience to see through tat crap. A melting pot is the worse thing to happen to minority races. It means they get assimilated into the prevailing white culture and they lose all their characteristics. Look at the kids of minority races who are born in the US and attend US schools from a young age.</p>
              <p>They dun teach your ethnic mother tongue in schools, they dun celebrate your religious occasions, nor New Years. Countries like the UK celebrate bloody pointless "Bank Holidays" several times a year for what ridiculous purpose other than to have long weekends (even the historical origins suck and lack any modern relevance)! Or maybe, they like to celebrate banks that ruined the world economy? Why can't they designate those days to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year or Deepavali or Hari Raya when they have such a huge population of ethnic Indian/Pakistani/Chinese in their country? It shows true respect and love for your fellow citizens. You mark the occasion, you celebrate with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
              <p>If you're Chinese in the UK/US, the Lunar New Year is so inconvenient to celebrate with your family and friends cos its white man's country geddit? Even the celebrations in the Chinatowns across the white world are always held on the WEEKENDS only.</p>

              <p>Yet they always scratch their head wondering why the minorities are so unhappy, why there is so much anger, resentment, social unrest, rioting and racial crimes. Never heard of the crime rates in New York or London? Never occurred to you that once the sun sets, kid and grandparents are NEVER seen on the city streets in these countries? U get stabbed or shot geddit? The streets are dirty and crime is serious. Contrast that to where you are now. If I see my little nephews at night in town, I'd joke that its past their bedtime, not the fact that they r in danger of getting sexually abused by paedophiles/kidnapped/killed etc.</p>
              <p>Look closer to home, Singapore does MANY things right, but the West will never acknowledge that - they are too proud to even consider what Asia can teach them. I've been to Malay and Indian friends homes to celebrate their Hari Rayas and Deepavali's - only in Singapore dudes.</p>

              <p>Yes. The crime rate scene happens especially in Harlem neighbourhood in NYC.</p>
              <p>It's true the media will do window dressing on its ways to promote global diversity at the workplace. Same for Singapore. Although the PAP always emphasizes on racial harmony and globalization and not forgetting, foreign talent, do you think Singapore is still so welcoming towards those foreigners?</p>
              <p>I tell you, many many are still unwelcome.</p>
              <p>Look at the Bangla workers. How they are being treated and discriminated? Remember when the government tries to designate housing for them in Serangoon? There are many local dissidents to this policy.</p>
              <p>I still don't know how far those new races are being discriminated at the white collar workplaces. But then let me tell you it is in human nature that when one sees a foreigner the first time, especially of different skin colour, he or she tends to ask questions about culture. There will still be judgement anyway. I see a foreigner as a foreigner usually, except probably for Malaysians or Indonesians. I talk to them like tourists. I don't really socialize with them the way I can socialize with my local friends.</p>
              <p>The 1st introductory impression of a foreigner is always more judgemental than towards locals.</p>
              <p>US, Canadian and Australian authorities do not declare Chinese New Year, Aidil Fitri, Deepavali, African festivals or any other non-American, non-Canadian, non-Australian or non-European festivities as public holidays even at municipal level, rather than national level. This is because they are only constituting a very tiny percentage of the national demographics. It's just like allowing Burmese or Filipino festivals declared as public holidays in Singapore now. How weird can this be if they are declared?</p>
              <p>To me these countries do follow what the UK has been practising as of 17th and 18th century as when these countries become independent, people of the British ancestry make up the majority in them. But then they do allow Jewish festivals to be public holidays there now.</p>
              <p>Thus, anyways, I don't think Singaporeans are even more cosmopolitan than the New Yorkers or Torontoans by judging at the ways Singaporeans preceive the foreigners. It is only in the eyes and ears of the PAP or people who have worked or studied overseas before. Singapore does not even have rights for the minority immigrants, whereas HK, NYC and Toronto have them. So how can Singapore be more cosmopolitan than them?</p>
