              <p>You have listed 3 examples, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">none</span> are ration donations to volunteers. You have in this post compared volunteers with those needy ones.</p>
              <p>And you still don't get the point right? The money for food still need to come from somewhere. Just because SBL gives free rations to the needy doesn't mean you should make use of them to get free rations for volunteers. It is also a duh fact that the money used to obtain these free rations come from voluntary donations too. So what, you think it is logical to use money from one volunteer (of money) just to sponsor another volunteer when this volunteer has the means to easily pay for a meal? Do you mean to say you will expect a free meal in return if you volunteer your services?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In short, you are still adamant in transferring monetary responsibilities from one charity organisation to another.<br></span></p>

              <p>If you do not support paying 'voluntary' organisers with money from donations, then why are you having no qualms at all about 'paying' the volunteers with free rations coming from donated money?</p>

              <p>Even for sch CCAs, the sum also usually comes from the CCA funds, which are contributed by the CCA members and managed by the treasurer. So this system is already there even for young kids in schools.</p>

              <p>I see your viewpoint, but to me, I still see this as being an individual volunteering to help the old folks, and funding your own clothes, food and accessories. The charity org is merely there to take care of logistics, transportation and ordering of food, and management of the crowd of 50, in addition to making sure that no one is taking advantage of the situation to injure or take away things of the old folks for god knows what reason.</p>
