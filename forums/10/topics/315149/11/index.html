              <p>t-shirts and peripheral stuff are unnecessary. t-shirt can be sponsored in whole by corporate sponsors if a charitable organization wants to look good. `donating' or `paying' for the t-shirt do not directly benefits the final/intended recipient of the charitable organization is clearly not right. if i was told to buy a t-shirt and the nett proceeds goes to the needy, i will consider, but if i were to pay so i can be `identified' or help create visibility to the organization, then i think it is a load of bull.</p>
              <p>lunch and paints, nails, etc. all should be part of the operation costs that is built in to run the activities. otherwise, why don't they `charge' for the paint brush, nails, hammer, sand paper, etc.? it is ludicrous to even `charge' for it as you implied in pt.3.</p>
              <p>if all the above are the reasons for the monies that is levied, the organization is either very ineffective or there's something shady going on. today, the spirit of giving should still be done in good faith, but we all need to be `smarter donor' so we are not taken for a ride. unfortunately in singapore, there are (stillï¼‰many of such organizations that `prey' on the people's good heart.</p>

              <p>it is funny you should mentioned it. i recently donated a sum of money to the kwan-in welfare society(kwc). i think they are one of the more obscure charitable organizations around. they had sent unsolicited mail to my mailbox. when they acknowledged my donation, they sent me a receipt with a small note that says "a benevolent family will be blessed". i have to admit that i `feel good' receiving that note altho' i am not expecting anything. a form of emotional blackmail?</p>
              <p>i donate to about 5 charitables on a regular basis but this is the first one that sends a note with the receipt. will i be inclined to donate again to kwc in future? very likely because of their gesture. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

                                                      Since the NKF saga, you can't expect people to continue to donate
                                                      blindly, without asking.</p>
              <p>Even the government are encouraging people to raise questions of
                                                      a charity they find suspicious, so why are you faulting forumers on

              <p>Please explain how the deduction by TS was reasonable. I'm not saying now the points raised are not possible. As you should have read too, I have come to a conclusion with HyperFocal that both parties will have different views.</p>
              <p>I'm disagreeing with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">irresponsible and unfair</span> deduction that TS is making.</p>
              <p>Let me give you my example. Imagine you are doing an event for your company, and you made every participant pay $10 for t-shirts and food. Then people declare that you should have done this and that to reduce the $10 payment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then finally, they charge your for embezzling funds for yourself based on that </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"should have done this should have done that"</span>. Now you tell me is this deduction on you fair and responsible? This is exactly similar to what TS is doing.</p>
              <p>Also, this is not kindness at all. This will, as Uncle Ver Sg has said, indirectly influence volunteers not go volunteer their service for these poor old folks. You tell me whether his unreasonable (unless you can explain how it is reasonable) conclusion will affect these old folks. Yes, what goes around comes around. And I'm talking about making slanderous remarks instead of fair and responsible comments to affect operations.</p>
              <p>With all these stated, are you sure you still want to support TS in his conclusion?</p>

              <p>Zaxis, you think that project management cost means no need to pay for all the electricity, papers, petrol, delivery men (they are not volunteers), phone bills, etc, many many other costs. Even hosting the website, and sending out emails, put costs on the bandwidth. Pretty sure all these costs will exceed $300. You are a little too narrowly focussed that project management cost means paying directly to the organisers, thus think only of profit making. Next thing we know, you will say HFH should host their website on free web hosting services, and utilise free web-based emails too. But this part I understand your viewpoint and concern, especially after the NKF saga.</p>
              <p>Then again,  the question back to you is, why are you hesitating to email them to ask about it? Still waiting for others to do work for you?</p>
              <p>Everything you say so far is only may be this may be that. Then finally with all the may bes and assumptions, you think you have every right to levy a charge on them for profit making.</p>

              <p>Anyway, this is taken from a blog.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">There has been so much debate about
                  Habitat For Humanity Singapore charging each Operation Homeworks
                  participants $20 to cover the cost of the event. Hmm… don’t be so
                  calculative la… as long as the way the money is spent is accounted for,
                  let’s not be so calculative.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I am so tired after attending Habitat
                  for Humanity Singapore’s Operation Homework today. The HFH staff had
                  rated the extent of cleaning that each of the house needs on a scale of
                  1 to 10. 1 being the least cleaning required and 10 for complete
                  cleaning. Our team was assigned to an unit rated 10! Haha….</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">When we first stepped into the unit, we thought it really doesn’t deserve a grade 10 until I saw this.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-543 aligncenter" src="http://cseek.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/p1040882.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544 aligncenter" src="http://cseek.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/p1040884.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
              <p>The white stuff on the blanket is maggots! And there are more of
                  that, some hardened stains (which we suspect is faeces) and waste at
                  the bottom of the cupboard when we removed all the drawers.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-545 aligncenter" src="http://cseek.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/p1040883.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Oh no!!!!!!!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Now we know why it’s given a grade 10!
                  Yes, Cant Bee and I were jumping up and down when we saw the mess. We
                  just had to grit our teeth, bear with the stench to remove the waste
                  and scrub the floor.  Luckily we had Magic Kleen.</p>
              <p>ok… shall not talk about it anymore as I am still trying hard to erase the images and stench from my mind.</p>

              <p>The fees are redundant and the accounting for them are not convincing.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned that the event was inefficiently planned, then they should revised it and not let volunteers pay redundantly for things which were already covered under donations.</p>
              <p>Why let volunteers be the receiving end of an inefficiently planned event?</p>

              <p>I mentioned "inefficiently planned" in inverted commas because I see it from both in yours and TS's shoes.</p>
              <p>To me, it is not really that inefficiently planned. You might as well tell me that them hosting up their website for a fee, or having rented an office space, are redundant expenditures, because they could host free websites or simply operate from home. You might even say fumigation is unnecessary because they can simply find and sweep/pick away the bed bugs.</p>
              <p>And to me, the volunteers are not considered as the receiving end; they are on the giving side. Contrary to that, it is the old folks who are at the receiving end. Finally, it is not like you are forced to both give and do. One would have to be willing to both give the donation and do the charity work.</p>
