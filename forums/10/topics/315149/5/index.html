              <p>they print small quantity lo.. 50 plus pcs only.. could be around 8 bucks liao. seriously, I think surely got buy lunch for the elderly too.. if not they look at you volunteers hungrily eating in their flat and had to cook huh?</p>
              <p>like all the arguments before, Cleaning agents, and all the stuff required. I think even if they left over with 1 dollar from your 20 bucks, it's only 50 bucks out of the 50 people. Can just treat the committee members a meal for their organising effort? $6.00 for those cleaning equipment, and etc, why not you try buying a pail lo.. I think easy easy 3 bucks. and are you going to just use one kind of agent to clean everything in the house?</p>
              <p>Come on. Profit making, You plan a BBQ with 20 people easily hit 10 bucks already lo. Not to mention 50 people.</p>

              <p>some elderly separate cleaning pails from washing pails. the new pail can be a gift for them? who knows their pail could be leaking and damaged? Free Lunch is calculated inside the $20. just like how can mcdonalds sell you a burger at that price? they also can say free chilli sauce, but the cost are all included lo..</p>
              <p>I never seen the t shirt nor the size of the logo, but they charge by colours too. if your logo got a bit of fading/blending/shading, they charge as non standard solid colour kind, so higher price. like I've said, it's only 50pcs. small quantity.</p>

              <p>Right. You increase the amount to attract more people to sign on. how do you justify if the money used in this all Regular force? NSFs are actually a pair of eyes for the general public to deter corruption too.</p>
              <p>You sure you can break even? if one NSF pay one month is 500, means that the govt have to tax everyone each month 1k because the 500 didn't include all the logistic, food etc.. Yes. They tax that absurb amount to increase their advertising to attract regulars. Now CPF 20% already you sianz half, next time they take another 20% for National Defence, You like that?</p>
              <p>Reservist to you it's like going prison, to some others it could be a breakaway from the mundane working life and catch up with his buddies.</p>
              <p>NS training isn't about having a rifle in your closet. Now everyone is trained, they just have to issue you one rifle and you'll be good to go when the time arise.</p>

              <p>"to some others it could be a breakaway from the mundane working life and catch up with his buddies."</p>
              <p>Thats you what. Your buddies are the same jailmates from before. Of course if you are a mindless PAP drone, working life IS mundane.</p>
              <p>"NS training isn't about having a rifle in your closet. Now everyone is trained, they just have to issue you one rifle and you'll be good to go when the time arise."</p>
              <p>Good for you. 1 rifle is enough already. Man I would hate to go to war with this kind of nua fool.</p>
              <p>"You sure you can break even? if one NSF pay one month is 500, means that the govt have to tax everyone each month 1k because the 500 didn't include all the logistic, food etc.. Yes."</p>
              <p>You fucking idiot. Can you read or not? You are <strong>already</strong> paying for the training, feeding and paying hundred thousands of NSF for two years + reservist training + overseas - where does the money come from? Singapore is ALREADY paying for the army that it has - the amateur army. Why should there be AN increase in tax if the money used in the NSF army is diverted to a smaller professional fighting force?</p>
              <p>"And how do you justify all the parades? NDP, SAF day? rehearsals plus training, means more weekends will be burnt. True, maybe can make it for 1 and half year, but maybe cannot go home on weekends, more confinements. And the facilities are limited too, all the units are queuing to use live range, or those training grounds. Not only NSF using, the NSmen and Regulars also queue for it.</p>
              <p>In addition, AHM? Are you expecting soldiers to just run 21km without progressive training?"</p>
              <p>Hello when was the last time your unit RUN 21km. I doubt that cuddles was in an active unit because there was a LOT of time wasted. Its not as if during the 2 years you are training all the time. Most of the time you are doing cleaning of some kind. The army is not efficient because it is run by a couple of 20 year old know nothing commissioned NSMen officers. Pray tell what is the use of wayang parades. To instill fear into the hearts of terrorists like MSK.</p>

              <p><strong>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
              <p>Operation Homeworks intends to achieve the following aims:</p>
              <p>1. Improve <strong>SAFETY</strong> of the home</p>
              <p>For example: provide trunking of electrical wires so that home accidents are reduced due to the improved home conditions.</p>
              <p><br>2. Improve <strong>SANITATION</strong> of the home</p>
              <p>For example: see to the repair of toilet systems and the changing of beds infested with bed-bugs so that the health of the elderly and living conditions can improve as a result of a better and cleaner home environment.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Mindless PAP drone? I have told you in the first few entry that I'm trying to be objective here. I work for myself, not for the PAP. even if you work in other countries, you also have to pay taxes and etc, doesn't that make you any better? oh yeah that's right, I do have buddies in my same jail. Some friends I made for life. Surely you do have good buddies from the NS days right?</p>
              <p>1 rifle and you call people nua fool? how many hands do you have? 10? you can only handle one at a time anyway! all you need are rounds, ammo.</p>
              <p>Can you be sure a smaller Professional army can deter threat? If crisis arise, are you just going to be running away with your family? and since you are making it into a smaller professional force, why would I choose to sign on then? you have to increase the perks or whatever benefits will definitely require much more Money. I won't sign on for 500 bucks or 1k lo. and I'm not going to do much calculations either. You live in this country you have to do whatever responsibility as a citizen, go everywhere also the same. If you don't contribute enough to their economy, you think others want you?</p>
              <p>FYI, I did ran the 21km during NSF days. I'm not an officer, but from a combat unit. no doubt not all people are required to run that distance as an NSF but many ran at least 10km. You can't deny that shrinking to 1 and half can't justify those combat units who has intensive trainings. I don't know about what unit you're from neither do I want to guess. I don't look down on service/support units because I know everyone suffers no matter in what vocation. It's insensitive of you to say the officers or bash others just because you have never been through what they been through.</p>
              <p>seriously, NS is every Man's responsibility. you have served and I respect you for that no matter what vocation you were from. You can take the training in there to cultivate your own mind or you can hate the days in it. which I think you hated it.</p>
              <p>I've seen you three people's threads and posts are always against the govt. Why don't you be more objective? Criticise anything and provide justifiable solutions? Not just say, Shrink 1 and half period. Nor, Govt should help period. If you don't mind, why not post the alternate solutions to those that the govt passed down? Like how to solve the Taxi problems, Control the Traffic conjestions.. etc.. It'd be more useful as you will directly benefit from the suggestion.</p>
              <p>Like I mentioned, the govt are also human, you can't control what mistakes they will make. Given if it was you, somehow you'll get criticise too. The greatest ability of man is Neng Qu Neng Sheng. Life is never easy, it's what you make do with it. You have 5 bucks you eat 5 bucks, you have 10 bucks you eat 5 bucks you save 5 bucks. You choose whatever you want in your life. That's the only thing you can control.</p>

              <p>Numbers for the needy requiring painting I don't have. IF you have to do spring cleaning and painting in a day, I doubt anybody can finish in a day within a specific time frame.</p>
              <p>it's just a couple of needy, do you need to coordinate with another charitable organisation?</p>
