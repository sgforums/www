              <p>If you are in their database and you don't like it, it is your responsibility to voluntarily withdraw from the database. No one is putting a gun on your head to force to accept and read their emails. You have so much queries, yet don't even have the guts to email an enquiry =&gt; obviously the type that wait for things to happen only.</p>
              <p>And please explain how much they can profit from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">monthly</span> Operation Homeworks with the collections of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only $1k</span> from the volunteers going, after deducting T-shirts, food and the other accessories, logistics and etc.</p>

              <p>I personally feel there will be less volunteers (I could be wrong) if you ask people to contribute both time AND money for a T-shirt that people dont really need. If the volunteers are really charitable and have the means, they WOULD do both (without the additional cost of a Tshirt and can BYO food).</p>
              <p>That being said, I strongly believe that not for profit financials have to be as tightly scrutinized as private sector companies especially those that have lots of assets and/or large donations.</p>

              <p>If you are still so concerned, I'm repeating the following again:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The solution is simple. You can simply write a letter directly
                                      to the organisation to ask for a  breakdown of the costs
                                      instead of whining here.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Or do you still prefer to be the</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You are one that talks a lot but do nothing.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it seems you like to draw parallels with very unrelated events. The gold tap is a unnecessary and luxurious installment. I fail to see how, from the accounting of how the $20 from the volunteers will be spent, that the expenditure here is both unnecessary and luxurious.</p>
              <p>The more you post, the more you seem to me to have a motive of intentionally trying to disrupt community service provided for these old folks now. Even if that isn't your true intention, you are still indirectly responsible for trying to bring about it (seen from your posts to very much wanting the newspaper to report on this). You better believe in karma.</p>

              <p>In this thread alone you have displayed</p>
              <p>1) your "waiting for others to do" mentality<br>2) your high propensity to transfer responsibility and blame<br>3) your total disregard to the volunteers<br>4) your whining attitude with no guts to contact HFH directly<br>5) your easy comparisons in a illogical manner<br>6) your cowardice by hiding behind an online nick to whine in a forum</p>
              <p>You asked for transparency for the $20, you were given. Then you attacked <span style="color: #ff0000;">how it could be better spent</span>, and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>not</strong> how it wasn't properly accounted for</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point here is that you were told how the $20 was spent. The point is not how it could have been better spent.</span> Yes, they could do other methods as you suggested to reduce the $20. Fact is, they did not. But, whether the organisation is efficient a not, is totally different from whether they took in the $20 for themselves. Somehow, you just want to link these two together, and then proclaimed loudly that it is a wrong-doing on their part (when you raised that their financial account should be looked into). For what motives, only you would know.</p>
              <p>You might also have indirectly brought about less care for the poor old folks. Remember, what goes around comes around.</p>
              <p>In addition, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you have also levied corruption and wrongdoing charges based solely on factors that they could have improved on, and none on inappropriate and illegal stuff that they have done</span>. The examples you have raised so far were  comparisons between inappropriate behaviour (gold tap) vs inefficient organising (could have gotten free food, etc). Probably that's why you have to hide behind an online nick, because if you were to go out there to say all those you have said, you will be most likely sued for slander.</p>

              <p><br>1) The T-shirt is unnecessary. Why cannot issue something cheaper or re-usable to identify? Are there really so many willing volunteer to identify?? And what morale purpose, care to clarify? What is the morale purpose of wearing a t-shirt when those are WILLING volunteers??</p>
              <p>2) People are already volunteering, can't the org be generous enough to at least treat them to lunch? Not very nice to charge money for lunch of volunteers, you know.</p>
              <p>3) Donations from corporations and donors should be enough to cover equipment. Since there is a steady flow of donations, why is there a need to charge money from volunteers?</p>

              <p>actually i don't find it unreasonable to question the doings of VWOs and their accountability. I find it healthy and good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what I do find questionable is ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the expectation that money should be raised by someone else while 'volunteering' can be done by the individual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and to carry this further - if the money is raised by someone else ALREADY, the individual SHOULD NOT need to contribute - the point being that an individual should contribute when and if he feels something is worthwhile to give money to - not to feel that as long as someone else is giving money, why should I?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and that the government is solely responsible for its peoples welfare - considering that the govt SHOULD be made up by the people and if you take for granted that simply becos one party had been in govt for a long time, the citizen only has the responsibility to accuse and not assert - then I think the citizen is a big cause for such a government. You can't blame the govt when most people only know how to criticise and don't want to do real work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If everyone has this point of view, donation, governance, responsibility will ALWAYS be left to someone else because you feel that you yourself as part of the macro picture that makes up all singaporeans have no liability towards making this society work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem with pointing fingers at a job badly done is that... you affect people who are actually TRYING to get the job done. (even though some do it really badly), without actually encouraging or asserting anyone to get the job done BETTER. It is really not constructive and while the same critical people keep on talking about how one should help the old, the needy, the disabled in a much BETTER way - it is only if someone gets out to do it, that it is ACTUALLY done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Else... better someone being 40% productive than no one doing anything at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, my question is - why stop at the accusations? It isn't enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But of course, we will have armchair critics who feel that their opinions is the best thing they have that is valuable but not their effort.</p>
