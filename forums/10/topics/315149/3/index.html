              <p>Can this activity be done in another way?</p>
              <p>Can actually treat it as a gathering. Instead of go chalet, can go help old folks.</p>
              <p>1.Those who want to join this volunteering, buy a standard sticker label and write your name and "code-name" to let other members identify and old folks home admin identify.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Ask everyone to bring one pail, 2 rags, one pair of plastic gloves. If not, get one person to buy the nessesary, and spilt the bill with a receipt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Ask some of them to bring makan, e,g, fried beehoon, if somebody can volunteer, can add in one luncheon meat or fried chicken wing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Make sure have a list who is confirm coming, at specific time, if 80% confirm coming one has arrived, just go to old folks home, no need to wait.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course there are other matters which need some coordination and pre-work.</p>
              <p>Those not happy with this arrangement, can no need to volunteer for this outing.</p>
              <p>If in the end, only one or two cats turn up, and feel paiseh, never mind, try to organise volunteering outing 2 weeks later, no problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't worry, no need to pay $20, all base on your own free will. This is just an outing niah.</p>

              <p><br>you just make me feel disgusted here. We are talking about volunteering, not money! The emphasize is on helping the old folks, not talking about why should we pay for all the thing and all sorts of ur rubbish arguments, which in turns pointing back to the government!</p>
              <p>You think too much about money, and the orgainser has said already, 20 bucks is for ur lunch, water, t-shirt and probably all the detergents and things u need to clean up. i believe the charity itself has to bear some of the expenses inccurred too! Why do u think that by paying 20 bucks, it means the government wont supply and pay for all these?</p>

              <p>YOu are right.   Most of the time, they are not genuine in helping.   As for the case of buying annuity, it is protecting themselves, protecting their asses, they are kiasu, kiasi that the ageing population here have no savings and in time to come gahmen will have to waste money to help them.    They are never genuine.    Even for the recent giveaway, it is just giving us sweets to please us so that they can take with no limit out of us.</p>

              <p><br>The government has to ensure that money are properly given out to those who really needs it. It is not easy to manage so many applications at once, for all u know some pple sure will exploit the system if not carefully managed. I also noe it is not easy to apply for financial assistance, as i myself hav tried to apply, some were successful, some were not because of the different criteria set by different organisation.</p>
              <p>As you said, the "government" (I dun think u should use the word government) stepped in and offered, but the she wasnt forced to. That was wad you think, hav the CHEEK, but to me, i think it is nothing much. Not that i am rich, or those "elite"who doesnt care. yup.</p>

              <p>that is a separate issue. I have to say although your point is correct in a certain manner.. as in govt should do something about all these charities, see what they need, blah blah. but the point is, some people want more money spend on amenities, roads, parks, lifts whatever. Some people don't want a huge percent of  of taxes to go into charities. many people want to see progress packages.</p>

              <p>Singapore has way too many people for such a small piece of land. The pursuit of a better life has left the last generation of singaporeans abandon many virtues, filial piety, kindness, and care for society. People work hard and defer marriages, thus the differences between aging and young gets wider.</p>
              <p>to add on, with those influx of FTs, competition between locals, drives any young lad or lady to strive harder and neglect love, relationships, friends even more.</p>
              <p>Because earth spins and time doesn't stop. Every minute they think of a solution for a problem, it already deviates from the main and branch new problems. Have you not encountered one issue not settled another problem sets in that kind of situation in life?</p>
              <p>It's just like any job in life, can never finish solving. Work keeps coming in, what you can do is make do with the choices you can make.</p>
              <p>Everyone wants to see a budget for them. Nobody will reject money. The fact is we live here and we have to live with it. Not happy with the system, you can always have the choice to lead an opp party or simply just migrate.</p>
