              <p>most non-profit org and donation centres in singapore today operate on the wrong premise. the founder/director will find a niche to position the org and then appeal to the masses to donate/contribute. it gets shady the moment it draw up the costs lines; salaries, admin, infrastructure and other costs associated with running the organization. in most likelihood, these are inflated. what's left of it; i.e. grants or donation will then be channeled to the core activity. this type of covet `business' is designed to enrich a few individuals.</p>
              <p>the good that comes of out the nkf saga is now these organizations, which otherwise is operating below the radar, is now open to scrutiny as well. youth challenge, etc. are some that got owned.</p>
              <p>singaporeans today are still donating in good faith. it is blind faith in some cases but the trust is wearing thin.</p>

              <p>No doubt it is a blind kind act, or whatever it is. Those running shady "charitable" organisations are those who've lost their conscience. If you really want less of such nonsense, everyone should just take care of their own parents till the time you can't anymore.</p>

              <p><br> You sure that's transparent? when people contribute better items,
              they worry if the volunteers keep it for themselves or not. Some
              needy asked for higher end items which also defeats the purpose of
              donation. you also can't justify why this old man gets a better
              item than the other who gets another with a chipped corner.</p>
              <p>You can be sure, some singaporeans treat items donation as an
              avenue for trashing.</p>

              <p>I remember there was a time at some old folks home, when we gave them some wrapped present, there were the old aunties that complained that someone else's present is larger, and then want to change, although the presents were actually about the same... just some display ornaments. Then there were some who waited around and wanted extra.</p>
              <p>Then at another charity concert for old folks, some of these old folks actually requested a second helping of food. But overall, could see most are quite happy. However, there are some who still give that gloomy look, because of reasons like not food or their presents not as nice as the other person's.</p>

              <p>very well, I think you can surely show your support by donating the 20 dollars? :) you don't have to go down volunteer at all or maybe if you want, you can ask if they have anything they need help with? like maybe contacts for getting cheaper lunch sets, or cleaning agents all in bulk?</p>

              <p>One can volunteer lots of things - time, money, and even one's life. Some people have volunteered their lives doing something which they feel is worthwhile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The whole point in volunteering is to contribute what you have to a cause that you find worthwhile.</p>

              <p>Don't confuse the spirit of volunteerism with failure in administration. Why is administration so important in charity? Because charity has real long term beneficial effects ONLY if it is consistent, well researched, and far reaching.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many volunteers only see one side of the coin - they evaluate their entire experience of donating their time/money through their own eyes and often an adhoc volunteer experience. But unless you have been a consistent long term volunteer, few will realise the amount of work that goes into making sure that ad hoc efforts can measure up into long term benefits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> For many people who are involved in administrating charity work - it isn't about those few old folks you visited that weekend, it is about a much larger picture and how to tie up all the loose ends so it isn't simply a sporadic short term joy that you bring to them!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is similar to the argument of salaried people working in VWOs. The theory being that if these people want to help others, they should do it for free. But if I honestly ask you whether you would give up your current job to take a big pay cut so that you can do something worthwhile FULL TIME - would you? Until you know what it takes - then perhaps you know why it takes more than you expect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, in view of the recent cases of mismanagement of charity administration - I think for the individual, what is most important to THEM is this - do you let someone else's failure become your excuse not to do something that is worthwhile? That's simply pointing fingers from your arm chair and sucking your thumb becos you think you are better than the rest.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Before we go further - you mention 'if and when" you donate - so question is Do you give? How much do you give? HOw often do you give?</p>

              <p>Tell me also -  </p>
              <p>how many of the people working in these organizations do you know?</p>

              <p> How many do you know personally and how many of those that you observed are not doing a real job?</p>

              <p>How long have you spent observing, studying the usage of funds and whether these funds have gone into good use?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't make unsubstantiated statements based on hearsay then condemn volunteer work for being worthless unless you have done all of the above. Just because SOME volunteer organizations don't do a proper job does not mean volunteer work is useless.</p>

              <p>you mention he figure of $10k in your post - do you know how much $10k buys?</p>
              <p>$10k buys.. one.. miserable.. power wheelchair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you have any idea how many people are hoping,dreaming for a power wheelchair that will give them independence and freedom and everything we take for granted?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's only with people trying to put together many $20 from many people that funds can be chalked up to buy items.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT having said all that - if you do not stop at all these rhetorics and discussion and lofty ideals - and actually go out and donate that $10k  - I can recommend you a worthwhile family to donate that amount to and ensure that the entire amount goes to them. :)</p>

              <p>... and what has my preference in donation has anything to do with how connected YOU are with these organizations? And in what way have I 'condemned' Voluntary work? Which word/s were used to condemn Volunteerism? Or are you just directing attention away from that $20 Fee?</p>
