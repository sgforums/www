              <p>I mentioned "inefficiently planned" in inverted commas because I see it from both in yours and TS's shoes.</p>
              <p>To me, it is not really that inefficiently planned. You might as well tell me that them hosting up their website for a fee, or having rented an office space, are redundant expenditures, because they could host free websites or simply operate from home. You might even say fumigation is unnecessary because they can simply find and sweep/pick away the bed bugs.</p>
              <p>And to me, the volunteers are not considered as the receiving end; they are on the giving side. Contrary to that, it is the old folks who are at the receiving end. Finally, it is not like you are forced to both give and do. One would have to be willing to both give the donation and do the charity work.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I never said it was inefficiently planned. Stop putting words into mouth.</p>
              <p>My opinion was that the current payment can be further revised and improved. Seems like you're ever-ready to accuse people who disagree with you.</p>
              <p>Since donations are in place, they can also further consider hiring and paying workers at market rate of $5 per hour, instead of expecting free labour.</p>
              <p>It should not even be volunteer work at all if the org can afford to hire and pay director/CEO.</p>

              <p>I didn't say you said it. I said I see it in your shoes. Perhaps you could suggest a better phrase for me to use then... Redundant expenditures?</p>
              <p>2nd paragraph =&gt; now you are putting words into my mouth. I have already told you I agreed with your opinions on the fees that they could be reduced or were unnecessary. Need me to remind you on which sentence a not? And I haven't accuse you of posting anything illogical, simply because you didn't. Btw, you have now made an accusation. Because I disagree with you? Which I didn't</p>
              <p>Your idea of hiring workers will incur even greater costs. Who pay?</p>
              <p>I have no comments about the last paragraph. But all I can say is all (I dunno any which didn't) such large organisations pay their directors.</p>
