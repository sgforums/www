              <p>From some of the replies, can see clearly that some people expect that since the government is voted in (not that these people gave PAP their votes), they should only wait for the government to do all the work. They fail to realise that it is not a question of whether the government should, but whether you are charitable and proactive enough to provide such a service.</p>
              <p>I wonder if they lost their job, would they also wait for the government to find them a new job? And question WHY a new job wasn't planned for them, or rather, found for them. Seems very likely so from their logic.</p>
              <p>The simple logic is if people don't do for you, you go do it yourself. With a "you wait for me, I wait for you" mentality, nothing will ever get done.</p>

              <p>man. so the debate should be "should social welfare be the prerogative of the state ONLY?" ultimately if the govt doesn't seem to be doing her part effectively, so her citizens should stand in the lurch?</p>
              <p>myself, i volunteer with several local vwo. not all of them are fully funded by govt, some of them are quasi-NGO so to speak. i.e. to say they receive certain proportion of their funding from govt and the rest from their own revenue sources - donations, fundraising and fees (like this $20). have been for such projects and i've also paid varying amounts ($10 - $20) for shirts, f&amp;b and i also understand certain amount goes to defraying the overheads and for their funding for the year's projects. hence i pay willingly too.</p>
              <p>so hyperfocal and qlqq9 - point being you all kpkb so much abt govt say you all contribute income taxes (which i believe will be very "sizeable") and complain govt don't do their part in aiding the needy/poor. pls noe the proper proceedings before you actually criticise (read para 2) and dont lump all the vwo/charity just because of a few infamous e.g. - nkf and youth challenge.</p>
              <p>your act by not contributing or helping suffices as it is, even though your value systems are dubiously unsound to start with (who to blame? whoever that nurtured you i reckon?)</p>
              <p>by nitpicking and being so anal about every single charitable or volunteering project that comes and then creating every possible linkage to govt inaptness/corrupt charity practices and what not? you not only deflate the confidence of the public to contribute but also deter the efforts for people in the social work line.</p>
              <p>i rest my case. there are far too many cynical arm chair critics around.</p>

              <p>... I can understand that buying a cheap affordable lightbulb &amp; changing it is considered occupant's jurisdiction...</p>
              <p>... but the replacement or renewing of internal electrical wirings is quite another matter. If it is noted that rewiring is necessary due to age of residential block, this should be the jurisdiction of HDB, and not the occupants who by the way, are regarded Poor Elderlies.</p>
              <p>... If the government shouldn't be expected to 'do everything', then why on earth are they even controlling how long people should live, work, and keeping all of people's heard earned MONEY? YOu aware of your irony?</p>

              <p>... ok, lets wait 6 months down this year of 2008, then someone
              please go and conduct a survey asking these people, whether by
              living in the dark more often, and not watching TV, or using even
              an electric fan, improved anything financially for them..
              ok?</p>

              <p>... by then, do note that Electric Tariffs will have shot up a

              <p>... lets see how this Har Brain solution works out...</p>

              <p><br>You sure that's transparent? when people contribute better items, they worry if the volunteers keep it for themselves or not. Some needy asked for higher end items which also defeats the purpose of donation. you also can't justify why this old man gets a better item than the other who gets another with a chipped corner.</p>

              <p>most non-profit org and donation centres in singapore today operate on the wrong premise. the founder/director will find a niche to position the org and then appeal to the masses to donate/contribute. it gets shady the moment it draw up the costs lines; salaries, admin, infrastructure and other costs associated with running the organization. in most likelihood, these are inflated. what's left of it; i.e. grants or donation will then be channeled to the core activity. this type of covet `business' is designed to enrich a few individuals.</p>
              <p>the good that comes of out the nkf saga is now these organizations, which otherwise is operating below the radar, is now open to scrutiny as well. youth challenge, etc. are some that got owned.</p>
