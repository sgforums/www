              <p>Singapore has way too many people for such a small piece of land. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">pursuit of a better life</span> has left the last generation of singaporeans abandon many virtues, filial piety, kindness, and care for society. People <span style="color: #ff0000;">work hard and defer marriages</span>, thus the differences between aging and young gets wider.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">to add on, with those influx of FTs, competition between locals,</span> drives any young lad or lady to strive harder and <span style="color: #ff0000;">neglect love, relationships</span>, friends even more.</p>
              <p>Because earth spins and time doesn't stop. Every minute they think of a solution for a problem, it already deviates from the main and branch new problems. Have you not encountered one issue not settled another problem sets in that kind of situation in life?</p>
              <p>It's just like any job in life, can never finish solving. Work keeps coming in, what you can do is make do with the choices you can make.</p>
              <p>Everyone wants to see a budget for them. Nobody will reject money. The fact is we live here and we have to live with it. Not happy with the system, you can always have the choice to lead an opp party or simply just migrate.</p>

              <p>I did explained. and I do understand what I wrote. If you cannot change the situation, change yourself. Adapt your thinking, adapt to the environment. Have problems blame society, no job blame FTs. Social problems has always been there, 2 decades ago, singaporeans were fighting with each other to learn english to gain an edge over another.</p>
              <p>So why not you tell us what do you have in mind that can change the situation? it's just like the recycling issue, singapore has no recycling culture in the first place. It's very hard to convert the mindset of those already instilled in it. What you can do is educate your future sons/daughters with the appropriate values so that they can set it right the next time round.(provided you have the positive thinking.)</p>
              <p><strong>imo, everything starts from each and every individual</strong>. If everyone don't kiasu rush into train without letting the passengers out first, it would be a greater joy to take public transport. Everybody makes a big difference.</p>

              <p>it's not turning a blind eye, it's doing a part as an individual. Everybody don't have to influence others, just teach the kids right from now on, the world would be a better place.</p>
              <p>nobody can predict what will happen in the future, that include the govt who're also just human. given you or me or anybody else, 3 years down the road our decisions will also be criticized. Opinions just differs from each other taking upbringing and life experiences into consideration.</p>
              <p>brain drain is also a personal preference by those people. Let's say if you work in your current company, the colleagues are good the pay is fine, another opportunity comes and higher pay, better prospect, anybody would go for it. so if anybody goes overseas and liked the life there, finds a good job opportunity, earn higher pay, anybody will go for it too.</p>
              <p>The govt can ask you to go out gain exp, come back help singapore grow. BUT they can't force you to do it. You make whatever decisions you want in your life. they don't want brain drain but have they stopped anybody from travelling to see the world?</p>
              <p>People are like sand. Very true. When you give them a square bottle, they fill it up. Pour them into the a Star Shape Bottle, they might leak a little but they WILL still fill it up.</p>

              <p>1 and half year?  May I ask what unit you were from? Is it easy to coordinate ops for a company or battalion with a few outfields? It's easy for you to say quality of training. and that wiki doesn't tell anything.</p>
              <p>And how do you justify all the parades? NDP, SAF day? rehearsals plus training, means more weekends will be burnt. True, maybe can make it for 1 and half year, but maybe cannot go home on weekends, more confinements. And the facilities are limited too, all the units are queuing to use live range, or those training grounds. Not only NSF using, the NSmen and Regulars also queue for it.</p>
              <p>In addition, AHM? Are you expecting soldiers to just run 21km without progressive training?</p>
              <p>Easy to say shrink another half year. But seriously, you'll definitely compromise safety with such time frame.</p>

              <p>Right. You increase the amount to attract more people to sign on. how do you justify if the money used in this all Regular force? NSFs are actually a pair of eyes for the general public to deter corruption too.</p>
              <p>You sure you can break even? if one NSF pay one month is 500, means that the govt have to tax everyone each month 1k because the 500 didn't include all the logistic, food etc.. Yes. They tax that absurb amount to increase their advertising to attract regulars. Now CPF 20% already you sianz half, next time they take another 20% for National Defence, You like that?</p>
              <p>Reservist to you it's like going prison, to some others it could be a breakaway from the mundane working life and catch up with his buddies.</p>
              <p>NS training isn't about having a rifle in your closet. Now everyone is trained, they just have to issue you one rifle and you'll be good to go when the time arise.</p>
              <p>WAR is not funny. I don't wish to see any conflict or war. All these NS is necessary. without a doubt. I do agree time is wasted, but it is for a noble cause.</p>
