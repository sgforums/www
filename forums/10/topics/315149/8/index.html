              <p>Well said. I would advocate giving to large multinational charities such as Oxfam and Red Cross for international. For local, I would give to Catholic or Buddhist. Thats just me though. Please dont donate when there is President Day etc so as to add to PAP's propoganda. Donate after and before. </p>

              <p>1) It is not only the lunch box. It is the number of bottles of water, each participant usually will get more than 1 bottle. You think cleaning the house you won't sweat ah. You got do such charity work before a not? As for lunch, as an organiser that wants to attract more volunteers, surely you won't just buy a measly small packet of chicken rice for $2.50 for all the hard work and money they have contributed in serving these old folks.</p>
              <p>2) You ask from Singapore Buddhist Lodge, then where they get the money from then? You only think of transferring the problem elsewhere.</p>
              <p>3) Have you ever bought low-quality school house or CCA T-shirt, also for $10? At least I knew that was the price 8 years ago. With inflation, GST increase, etc, it is definitely harder to get it for $10 now. Again, as an organiser, would you also buy low quality and uncomfortable clothes for these volunteers (who paid for it)? Doesn't make sense right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, what both of us said here still doesn't hold perfectly. The only difference is I listed circumstances due to what I have self-experienced, whereas you raised them purely as a conjecture. However, to know whether HFH will actually give their volunteers lousier stuff (which seems rather unlikely), I guess you will still have to go there to see it yourself. But to whine and complain before doing that is totally childish.</p>

              <p>Don't think about having a regular Volunteer organisation, because not everyone has the time to be a regular volunteer due to individual commitments.  And for those who thinks of just contributing money and fold arms stand one side, stop arguing about Volunteering/Charity Organisations because you merely make the donation seem like a form of paying of bills, expenses.</p>
              <p>anyway, when such incentive is official, it makes volunteering sounds like a joke since you still wants an incentive.

              <p><br>Because singaporeans lost their community spirit and virtues along the way! And with people same mindset as you, thats why everything freaking thing in life must come with some incentive before you do it! What about forgetting about that incentive, instead let the Elderly live without rent, that is if the incentive is worth enough for the flat rent?</p>
              <p>now, as long as money in involved, you will come up with another being not transparent here and there issue. Don't talk about Volunteers need to eat or what, have you never heard before, to help others you have to help yourself first? SO only if you have EXTRAs to spare, maybe you can help. with EXTRAs, you won't jeopardise your own life at all! instead of eating KFC for 2 days in a month, change to a pack of chicken rice for those two days and you'll have 10 bucks for Charity already.</p>

              <p>with draw H4H IPC status</p>
              <p><span>Institutions of A Public Character (IPC) Status</span>&lt;!-- #EndEditable --&gt;             &lt;!-- #BeginEditable "contents" --&gt;</p>
              <p>CONDITIONS FOR THE CONFERMENT OF IPC STATUS</p>
              <p>1.</p>
              <p>The objects of the IPC must be charitable in nature and its activities and operations must be carried out on a non-profit-making basis. Activities considered charitable are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Advancement of education<br></li>
              <li>Relief of poverty and distress<br></li>
              <li>Other charitable purposes which help and benefit the community</li>
              </ol>
              <p>2. The Comptroller of Income Tax (CIT, IRAS office) may reject the name of the proposed IPC if we consider it inappropriate or misleading, and may reject conferment of IPC status if we consider the likely activities and programmes of the proposed IPC as likely to go beyond the charitable causes which justify IPC status.     3.</p>
              <p>The IPC may be an organization:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>registered as a company limited by guarantee; or</li>
              <li>registered as a society; or</li>
              <li>established by statute,</li>
              <li>and therefore subject to regulation as a company or society or statutory establishment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Or the IPC may be a fund set up for defined charitable purposes, in which case the fund must come under the purview of a company, society or statutory establishment.</p>
              <p>    4. The charitable activities of the IPC must be beneficial to the community as a whole and not confined to sectional interests or group of persons based on race, creed, belief or religion, i.e. they must satisfy the public benefit test, unless otherwise approved by the Minister for Finance.     5.</p>
              <p>The charitable activities must benefit the Singapore community unless otherwise approved by the Minister for Finance.</p>
              <p>    6. The IPC must be administered by a group of independent trustees i.e. there must be <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/others/charities/charities_g1.2_registering%2Bas%2Ba%2Bcharity_glossary.asp#Independence_of_control">independent control</a>.     7.</p>
              <p>The selection of auditors must have the prior approval of the CIT (IRAS office) using these forms, whichever applicable:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>IPC Auditor Declaration Form</li>
              <li>Central Fund Member Auditor Declaration Form</li>
              </ul>
              <p>    8. The organisation should submit its audited financial statements and annual returns of donations to the CIT (IRAS office) within the stipulated time without fail.     9.</p>
              <p>Any alteration or amendment to the Memorandum of Association or its equivalent has to be cleared with the CIT (IRAS office).</p>
              <p>    10. Basic information on the activities and financial standing of the IPC shall be made conveniently accessible to the public by posting them, in the prescribed format, on the Internet.     11. The conferment of IPC status shall be subject to review every five years. Activities and funding levels will be monitored to see if the IPC status should be renewed.     12.

              <p>Again, it seems you do not understand what was said. Nowhere did I mention that the serving would not be as good as S$2.50 chicken rice. No need to put words into other's mouth you know?</p>
              <p>I'm charging you that</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>2) You ask from Singapore Buddhist Lodge, then where they get
                                      the money from then? You only think of transferring the problem
                                      elsewhere.</p>

              <p>You could only simply suggest a transfer of the monetary responsibility from one organisation to another. In this thread, not only have you pushed blames; you are now pushing responsibilities. Well done!</p>
