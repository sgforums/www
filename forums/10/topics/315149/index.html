              <p>doing volunteer @ redhill still need to pay S$20.00</p>
              <p>"Habitat for Humanity is
              recruiting 50 volunteers for Operation Homeworks this Saturday (26th
              April 2008) and it will be held at Redhill Close. Volunteers will be
              helping the elderly clean up their 1-room flats (most of which are in
              rather bad condition because they mostly live alone), so as to improve
              their living conditions.</p>
              <p>Participation cost is S$20/person, which goes to help augment the
              operational costs. T-shirt, lunch and water will also be provided.</p>
              <p>The slots are on a first come first served basis.</p>
              <p>If you are interested, please reply to <a href="mailto:info@habitat.org.sg">info@habitat.org.sg</a>.
              Registration will close latest by this Wednesday (23 April) or when the
              slots have been filled up. In your reply, please provide us with the
              following details:
              <br><br>Complete name (given name &amp; surname):

              <p>a lot of very kind people often not only contribute $$ but also volunteer their time</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is more important to find out exactly what the $20 is for - then determine if it is worthwhile or not than to think that just becos u volunteer its other people's business to come up with the money to cover the costs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>becos a lot of meaningful projects are not able to proceed - not becos not enough volunteers - but becos of not enough money.</p>

              <p>so you mean that since the people benefiting from the clean homes are the old jobless elderly, they should pay you for rendering your services right?</p>
              <p>it's just your own effort that you do for the elderly and not some cheap labour. nobody is forcing you to clean the house like renovating or what. For all you know it could be just simple cleaning. Somemore you won't be asked to one man clean whole house lo.</p>
              <p>although there have been shady charities before, but in this instance, you clearly don't understand what does volunteering means at all.</p>
              <p>like other forumites said, if you so JJJJ, don't be a volunteer.</p>

              <p>so you mean that since the people benefiting from the clean
              homes are the old jobless elderly, they should pay you for
              rendering your services right?</p>
              <p>it's just your own effort that you do for the elderly and not
              some cheap labour. nobody is forcing you to clean the house like
              renovating or what. For all you know it could be just simple
              cleaning. Somemore you won't be asked to one man clean whole house
              lo.</p>
              <p>although there have been shady charities before, but in this
              instance, you clearly don't understand what does volunteering means
              at all.</p>
              <p>like other forumites said, if you so JJJJ, don't be a

              <p>firstly, the elderly will probably need to recognise the t shirt to know they're volunteers from the event.</p>
              <p>secondly, some people prefer to have food delivered to them while they are doing the cleaning and obviously tired after it, many people wouldn't want to search for food.</p>
              <p>it's true they might earn some profit from your 20 dollars. but for all you know, the money could be funds for the next event or even pocket money for some of the elderly.</p>
              <p>not forgetting the pails or cleaning agents, are you going to bring that yourself?</p>

              <p>Do volunteer as a group/team means the volunteers are well taken care of while they r volunteering to take care of the needy.  All those "taken care of" needs $$ wat.  It's not like they r forcin u to join to pay the 20 bucks...And they surely did not make any gimmicks to tag on ur heartstrings, thus make u feel more compassionate.</p>
              <p>Dun like, then f***off, do ur own volunteering.  They are many others who think it's justified &amp; go for it, afterall, it's abt charity.  Win-win situations, dun u think?</p>
              <p>If not, then u shld try settin up ur own volunteering grp &amp; we shall see how u r goin to do it w/o any financial assistance.</p>

              <p>If they don't provide refreshments, people will complain that the volunteers are not being taken care of.</p>
              <p>If they don't provide T-shirts, the volunteers won't have proper identification. You want them to carry cards instead? Oh sure.... printing cards cost money as well. And surely it wouldn't kill to give them something to commemorate their volunteerism.</p>
              <p>Like I said..... just take that $20 to be a donation! Even without refreshments and T-shirts, the organization still needs to cover the costs of organizing the event, okay? Transport, logistics, and publicity are all not free! And even if they do have some money left over, what the hell is so wrong with them keeping it for future events, as long as they meet the general guidelines for charities?</p>
              <p>Surely the volunteers themselves would bear all that in mind when they give the $20?</p>
              <p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: If you don't like it, then don't volunteer at this organization lah! Sheesh!</p>

              <p>this is actually a simple matter: if HfH can account for the $20 legitimately and in a transparent manner, and that it doesn't go to the director's pocket, why are we even having this discussion?</p>
