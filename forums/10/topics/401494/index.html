              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p>The long suspected truth is finally out – that the PAP has been giving out Singapore PRs and citizenships to foreigners like toilet papers.</p>
              <p>According to a Straits Times report today, an application for PR or citizenship takes only “four to six months to process.”</p>
              <p>This means that a foreigner can potentially become a Singapore citizen in less than a year.</p>
              <p>The state media reported last year of a Chinese national Zhang Yuanyuan who obtained her Singapore PR within 2 months of application. She later returned to China and participated in its National Day Rally.</p>
              <p>There appear to be no QC on the foreigners being granted Singapore PR – even construction workers, cleaners, masseurs and prostitutes were given PRs relatively easily.</p>
              <p>The lax criteria for Singapore PR is in stark contrast with the stringent requirements laid down by other countries.</p>
              <p>For example, applicants for Malaysian PR “must have resided in the country for a continuous period of not less than five years under a valid entry permit preceding the date of application.”</p>
              <p>In Australia, prospective migrants “must have an occupation that is listed on the Skilled Occupation List if they are not sponsored by a state or territory government.”</p>
              <p>They also need to pass an English proficiency test known as IELTS and reside three out of five years in Australia before they can even apply for its PR.</p>
              <p>There is no minimum residency period for Singapore PR. Neither do applicants need to pass an English proficiency test.</p>
              <p>As a result, Singapore has been swarmed by large number of PRs and new citizens who are unable to speak a single word of English.</p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>Faced with a potential backlash from the voters at the coming elections, the PAP is cutting back on the inflow of foreigners to appease the public.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be deceived by the latest political gimmick by the PAP again.</p>
              <p>During the recent May Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called for the “understanding” of Singaporeans to accept a greater influx of foreigners in the near future.</p>
              <p>Unless Singaporeans send a strong message at the next election, they will surely be relegated to being a second class minority in their own country pretty soon.</p>
