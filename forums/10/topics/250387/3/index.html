They care about the short term; maximising existing opportunities. I'm not sure whether to lapse into paranoia and suspect that the Govt has some damaging data that we don't have, or that the civil service mindset is to suspect the future won't be as good and keep building up a war chest for the rainy day irregardless whether the decisions made simply aren't feasible in the long term.<br><br>Today, what I see is a paranoid Govt which doesn't seem to trust its citizens unless they follow a path they deemed as "correct". All else to be discarded. The entire education system is structured in this manner, and again it is a case of maximising opportunities for the short term and never for the long term. People who don't fit the desired mound are discarded, or even run down.
