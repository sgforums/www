However there is a rising trend of foreigner settling down in singapore, which goes to show that Singapore is not a bad country like some quitters or overseas student try to describe.<br><br>In long run singapore will be better off with more FT because singaporean just doesnt appreaciate being a singaporean anymore, so what difference does it make if we have a FT or not.<br><br>If you want to quit, you should quit totally and happily, dont quit with a heavy heart and behave like a fox trying to reach the grapes<br><br></div></blockquote>yeah, funny that  u r comfortable with pple coming all over to pillage, rape and take what they can b4 they head back? i know it is an uncouth way of putting it, but dun u think sinkapore `opens' itself, or should i say `herself' too willingly in accepting this FTs?<br><br>u think about it, sinkapore wants to be all things to all mankind. so the broadest talent can come and `help' sinkapore prosper. how realistic is that? hub this, hub that, we got this we got that...i recently attended a social enterprise talk organized by nus biz club and the mp penny low mentioned that dreaded words that made me walk out halfway thru' the seminar....that sinkapore can be the hub for social entreprenuership for the region as we have the ppl resources and talents that will mk sinkapore as THE hub. what the fcuk? i think u need pple in the right mindset first to embark on such  thing b4 u talk abt putting the infrastucture and resources to it. talk about putting the cart b4 the horse.<br><br>MM Lee, nor you can nvr win a subjective argment like the one he raised. i think he is `smart' enuf to put it forward becos one can adequately isolate the points for a pin point rebuttal. bangladesh has a nobel prize winner, is the country better than singapore? not necessarily so, but no one will view bangladesh any worse. In fact, i think the folks who are humbly quiet about their achievements are the ones who deserves the loudest applause. take the macarthur's foundation fellowship winners, most of them are humble geniuses who dun go about braggin' abt what they have achieve.<br><br>MM Lee, i think overstep the line. he may have done singapore well over the last 30-40 years, and definitely still yield considerable nfluence in the way singapore is run, but his arrogance and mindless rapping about the other countries is uncalled for, and showed little class. i am sure he is aware that the country exist as a `journey', not a `destination'. the sinkapore story is not finish yet, but surely he is not making it any easier for future sinkaporean leaders to follow his snooty behaviour and ruin the good work he has done. and certainly we hope future sinkapore leader will learn to eat humble pies b4 shooting off their mouth and loud hailed abt what a great nation she is. sinkapore is great only if others say so....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact of that matter is, like it or not, the ministerÂ’s are going to get their pay rise no matter how much we debate it. I am against this pay rise myself, but as a pragmatist I recognize that with our current political climate, things will be the way they are no matter how much we debate or protest this amendment. That is not to say debate isnÂ’t healthy, in fact, the debates they have gone on and the reactions they have triggered from the ministers and those in authority if brought about a more conscious awareness upon the state of things. So I say, cautiously, letÂ’s move on, but as good citizens lets be mindful of the pledges and promises that have been used to justify these pay rise. IÂ’m certain that even individuals like Gazelle would agree with the simple economic notion of Â– you pay for what you get.</div>

He is not saying that they have mediocre government. He is saying that even with mediocre government, they are able to survive. But not Singapore.<br><br>So this shows that the Danish writer is already out of point in his argument. What he should point out is that Danish cannot survive with mediocre government. Perhaps he can give some examples on this point. Then he can go and counter MM Lee that even with mediocre salary, they were able to attract top talents that could ensure the survival of their nations. This would make MM Lee's argument invalid.<br><br>What the Danish writer had achieved here is only to show how good their country is compared to Singapore.

But now what i see is trying to cover up any mistakes they done and try to justify it making it seems like they are doing the right things and even carry on doing it .
