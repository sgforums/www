              <p>Some how, I have a queasy feeling that some 'well-providing' parents 
              might be presumptuous if not imbalanced in their life priorities.<br> Using the example of farming for fruit, it doesn't matter how much 
              water/ fertilizer a farmer gives the plant, without adequate sunshine (=
               inculcation/ 'light'- see following) the plant will never fruit, if 
              ever it even properly grows.<br> That said, a child's neglect for his / her parent could be simply have 
              been due to a parent's inadequate inculcation ('light'- pls see above) 
              of values in the child such that the child, having had little guidance 
              in his/ her growing years, now fails to understand the need to care 
              adequately for his/ her parents, having received previously only a 
              superficial show of affection.<br> <br> The 'slogging' of the parent could be born out of social pressures/ 
              norms- eg. many Singaporeans both of today and yesteryear strive for the
               5Cs- Car, Cash, Condo, Club, Credit cards (in no particular order). 
              Following such social norms, the parents likewise strive  to achieve 
              these particular status symbols; their children enjoying a 
              materialistically good life being merely consequence of the parents 
              abundant/ obscene salaries.<br> Do note that more often then not, health, the environment, others 
              welfare isn't included amongst the 5Cs- (e.g. the Country club is for 
              amusement, showing off and use of the jack pot room lah- ditto the other
               C's).<br> <br> The parents might be well paid employees, whose job scopes either demand
               little concern about global affairs, or preclude them from such 
              concerns: e.g. employees of BP might be too 'busy'/ disadvantaged should
               they raise 'unprofitable' issues such as related to 'global warming', 
              oil spills from 1km below sea level etc, this results in individual 
              having hearts too hard to adapt with the ever changing times.<br> <br> In this fast paced world of constant change, many issues compete with a 
              person's ability to provide for one's parents. Whilst the child might 
              have been fortunate to have been brought up in a materially robust 
              household, his perspective of his status  within the parent's hierarchy 
              of priorities might have been only a lowly sixth C- 'Child'. His being 
              adequate provision attributable mostly to the 'overflow-effect' related 
              to the robustness of his parents salaries- the preceding 5 Cs being 
              priority, the neglect of his emotions and personal concerns resulting.<br> <br> Unfortunately, due to changing world circumstances, that child is now 
              unable to draw a similarly generous salary nor adapt to changing social 
              norms. Holding sacred the same hierarchy of priorities he was brought up
               with, his parents are correspondingly ranked 6th- after the car, condo,
               card, cash, club- as before/ respectively.<br> The now breadwinner might have kids of his own and thus unable to cope 
              with the demands of a demanding spouse, bills etc etc. Without a 
              sustained emotional bond, the child is unable to empathize with the 
              needs of the elderly (nor most other persons for that matter). Though 
              his expense on his parents as a proportion of his full salary might be 
              equal to what he originally received (e.g. 10%), this becomes grossly 
              insufficient in light of the diminished nature of his drawn salary and 
              the high medical/ upkeep costs incurred by an uncooperative, sick 
              elderly- as such, a rethink and reorganization of the family's 
              priorities and finances is in dire need.<br> <br> So it is the plight of the pitiful old who squandered their early 
              fortunes upon the 5Cs, only to receive relatively little from a child no
               less 'filial' (in regard to his/ her particular upbringing)- just a 
              sorry 'family misfortune'  that their child now earns less then what 
              his/ her parents earned before/ expect to earn.<br> <br> So is this the plight of the average Singaporean, <br> I don't know, U tell me.<br> <br> All said, I still stand by my earlier post [<a href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?p=441580#post441580">link</a>] that the NFC 'filial piety' ad is misinforming in its omission of the fact that dementia is a disease that "<span style="color: red;">is <strong>NOT </strong>part of normal aging</span>"~ Video 'Going Home' [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj-YMiY4RAA&amp;#t=8m32s">video excerpt</a>]. <br> The NFC, if not confident of producing a 3-generation ad, ought to take a
               leaf from the 2006 2-generation ad of the Petronas 2006 CNY greeting:
