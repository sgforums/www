Hong Kong has a limited land and population (7.1million); whereas Ireland has a limited constraint on population (4 million). </div></blockquote>You have absolutely no clue about how the economy runs. Low corporate tax attracts investors, that's clear. Look at how the STI shot up immediately after the announcement of the cut in corporate tax. Businesses are very cost sensitive. Small population? That's why both Hong Kong and Ireland have a large pool of non-local workers...supplied by Mainland China in the case of Hong Kong and by Europe in the case of Ireland. That's why also we need FT in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maurizio13:</div><div class="quote_body">In my opinion, I think when you reach a certain age (65-70), you should retire, because no matter how much you would like to dispute it, our biological system don't function all too well, you are more likely to make sub-optimal decisions.</div></blockquote>If you are an imbecile, you are a fool at any age <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I was a kid then but I saw it happen.<br><br>I remember long ago in the early 80s, the toy maker Tomy was in Kallang industrial estate. Tomy operated with very little people, mostly are automated machines. When Tomy moved to Thailand, back then PM (now MM) came down to talk to the Japanese boss. The boss said costs are high because JTC rentals are too high for factory space. Tomy asked to negotiate for a better price. JTC flat refused and Tomy therefore decided to look elsewhere.  Now just one day before all the operations is moved to Thailand, MM come show up and ask Tomy to revert decision. Japanese boss tell MM, its too late. Besides, the price JTC charge for floor space is just too high and too inflexible.<br><br>Therefore it is not a problem that the policy makers do not know. Its just a convenient oversight. So after Tomy case, in the 80s, these "leaders" know.<br>Its a fact that our policy makers priced us into uncompetitive zones and yet shift the blame of us that we demand high salaries, but keep raising the cost of living.<br><br>So when all the policies are made and changes to policies are done, its always that the people to give more, put up with higher cost, live with less basic things, and etc. But I had not seen any shared commitment from the policy makers. They simply sit on their high horses enjoying their lives raising their salaries to greater heights while they tell us there will be no welfare, we have to live on less, pay more and vote them because otherwise there will be horrible chaos because someone not as elite as them cannot run the country.<br><br>I look at Japanese PM, Abe. He lead the way to cut his salary and asked the ministers to do so. In a country where the cost of living is so high, I do not see their minister's pay higher than our own and yet they had dropped the pension scheme and had a pay cut to help the economy recover.<br><br></div></blockquote>If we are making toys today, we are dead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>We should have have moved out of these low-value industries much earlier.

The STI increase as a result of investors changing their portfolio of investments, maybe switching from savings/forex/bonds to stock market, as a lower corporate tax rate will increase their dividend yields. There are more buyers than sellers, therefore demand outpace supply, as a result price for stocks increase, the stock increase is the result of interaction between buyers and sellers in the market, if Mr. A sells to Mr. B, Mr A makes a profit. In what way does this benefit the company? Do they get new funds for new physical investments? This does not translate to capital investments flowing into Singapore to build new factories.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">If you are an imbecile, you are a fool at any age <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>I guess everybody can see what an imbecile you are right now.</div>

I showed you how the stock market works, it has nothing to do with capital investments (building factories), it is just investors shifting their investment portfolio (from bonds/savings/forex to stocks). You respond by roping in Thailand which has nothing to do with the discussion, remember your initial post "Look at how the STI shot up immediately after the announcement of the cut in corporate tax.".<br><br>Maybe you can explain the mechanics of how the stock market increases can affect capital investment decisions?<br><br><strong>It's so like you, you lose a point, you try to cover up your @ss by introducing new issues which is not relevant to the discussion.</strong><br><br>Enjoy your doggone day!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Food chains will exist regardless.
