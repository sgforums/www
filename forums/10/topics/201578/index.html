            <div class='col-md body'>MY is not messed with religion,racial and poilitics issue.<br>Any group is behind all these activities or all are isolated issues?<br><br>1.Religoion<br><br><blockquote>22 Jul 2006<br>Lau Meisan<br><br>JOHOR BARU, SAT.: A forum organised by the Article 11 Coalition here today was cut short on the advice of the police as some 400 demonstrators gathered outside.<br><br>But this time the organisers are not complaining.<br><br>The "Federal Constitution: Protection for All" forum which was scheduled to run from 9am to 1pm at the Hotel Selesa here, wrapped up at 11.15am following a "friendly recommendation" from the police.<br><br>The protest was the second the coalition has encountered since it started a roadshow on constitutional rights regarding religion. In May, the umbrella group for 13 non-governmental organisations held a similar forum in Penang which also attracted protesters.<br><br>Forum chairman Ramdas Tikamdas, who is also National Human Rights Society (Hakam) exco member, said the decision to cut short the question-and-answer session at the end of the forum was made based on a police recommendation.<br><br>"It was a friendly recommendation, which we also agreed to. This is not a compromise because all our speakers had presented their views and we also had a fairly fruitful discussion with the audience," he said.<br><br>The 167 participants were then escorted out through the hotelÂ’s side doors by police as the main exit through the lobby was virtually blocked by protesters. The demonstrators were seen chanting verses, holding up banners and placards that read "Crush IFC" (Hancur IFC), "We are ready to sacrifice for Islam", "Don't touch on the Sensitivity of Islam" and "Stop Anti-Islam Act".<br><br>The group, which included representatives from PAS Johor, UMNO Pemuda and non-governmental organisations such as Jemaah Islam, gathered at an outdoor carpark as early as 8.30am. About 200 policemen were at the scene.<br><br>At 10.25am, Johor Baru South police chief Roslan Ahmad told the protesters to disperse as they did not have a permit to hold a public gathering. A group spokesman insisted they would only disperse when the forum ended, asking the police to stop the meeting immediately.<br><br>A speaker at the forum, Professor Dr Shad Saleem Faruqi, describing it as a "a trial for democracy", added: Â“We were having a discussion about the Constitution in a civilised manner and we also respect the rights of the people to express their views in the form of a peaceful demonstration."<br><br>Article 11 Coalition secretariat spokesman Ivy Josiah said: "We are satisfied that the forum was conducted peacefully. And we also thank the police for their professional assistance, which helped the forum run smoothly." </blockquote>In May ,the group was also disturbed in Penang.<br><br>2.<strong>Racial relationship</strong><br><blockquote>Educationists, political parties welcome move<br>20 Jul 2006<br>Shamini Darshni<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR: The decision to end the shelf-life of a controversial university guidebook on ethnic relations was roundly welcomed yesterday.<br><br>But the Democratic Action Party (DAP), accused in the book of being the instigators behind the 1969 race riots, was in no mood to let bygones be bygones. It wants the matter investigated by the police as there were seditious elements in the book used by Universiti Putra Malaysia.<br><br>The Cabinet yesterday ordered that the book be withdrawn and decided that a panel of historians would put together a more acceptable alternative for the Ethnic Relations course.<br><br>Educationist and social activist F.R. Bhupalan said: "ItÂ’s great. This shows that our Government has developed a very open, transparent and accountable position, and in future there will be greater attention to the sensitivities of such a book.<br><br>"Whatever text we use must be based on a bedrock of understanding, truth and respect, and the proper enunciation of certain historical facts," she said.<br><br>Bhupalan hoped that the Ethnic Relations course could be broadened to areas such as unity and understanding,<br><br>"If it is only on ethnicity then some may get worried because this can be related to religion. The course must accept that we are multi-religious and multi-cultural," she said.<br><br>DAP national chairman Karpal Singh felt that withdrawing the guidebook was not sufficient.<br><br>"We cannot just sweep it under the carpet after the Cabinet makes a decision. A criminal offence seems to have been committed," he said.<br><br>He noted that the UPM teaching guide had blamed the DAP for the May 13 riots, an allegation which was not factual and clearly seditious.<br><br>The Asian Strategy and Leadership InstituteÂ’s Centre for Public Policy Studies said that in view of the sensitive nature of the course, there should be more consultation before any textbook is published.<br><br>Centre director Dr Lim Teck Ghee said the entire process of preparation and production of guidebooks should be made as transparent as possible,<br><br>"Bias and subjectivity, whether political, racial or religious, should be avoided, with the emphasis placed on relevant and correct factual contents," he said.<br><br>He added that drafts of guidebooks could be posted on the websites of universities and the Higher Education Ministry so that the public could offer feedback.<br><br>He hoped that the Higher Education Ministry and the Education Ministry would learn a valuable lesson from this episode.<br><br>The system, he said, should ensure that the curricula and courses taught in schools and universities were historically accurate, fully reflective of the countryÂ’s evolving multi-racial character and did not contain propagandistic content or narrow analyses which could distort history.<br><br>Dr Zainab Mohd Noor, the dean of the Faculty of Education at Universiti Teknologi Mara, welcomed the move to withdraw the guidebook.<br><br>She said that Ethnic Relations as a subject had been thoroughly discussed and had the palm prints of different stakeholders.<br><br>"As our country matures and other issues come up, we will review the curriculum," she said.<br><br>Zainab said she was all for multi-culturalism, which was the foundation of liberal education for students.<br><br></blockquote>3.<strong>Politics</strong><br><br>Mr M and PM's struggle.</div>
