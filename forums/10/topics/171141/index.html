            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this was actually in response to a particular thread about the Japanese self defence forces in the Military nuts forum, but it has sort of degenerated into a sort of  a japanese bashing thread over there, so I thought to post my response in a  new thread here in the end, also because of the assorted Japanese bashing threads that sprouts out every now and then.....<br><br>gents, gents ....<br><br>Allow me to give a perspective from the other side, the japanese side, my japanese ex-girlfriend taught me a lot of things, (and, I think, I enlightened her about certain unsavoury aspects of her country's history) ...<br><br>the japanese believe that a man's sins in life are erased upon death, that is to say, we all go onto death the same way we are born, blameless, on a clean slate, death is the greatest equalizer, so you have samurai in ancient times committing sepukku to atone for their sins (yes, it's not just for disgrace in battle alone) so, in their eyes, they are perplexed by the strong emotions that runs through east (and some in south-east, perhaps) asia everytime someone important visits that famous shrine.<br><br>Yes, the current Japanese Prime Minister is right of centre, and yes, there is a rightist movement in Japan right now bent on revising history, and perhaps, reviving Japan's past imperial glory, but there is also a very strong pacifist movement in Japan (including my ex's grand-father, from the WWII generation, a member of the Buddhist pacifist movement). FYI, my ex's high-school history textbook did mention  the Nanjing massacre btw.<br><br>I find it ironic that some people think it wrong to judge and generalise a people, a race, or a society but happily go about demonising the Japanese, because of the actions of their goverment, or some right wing old fogeys ... in another thread, someone commented that the goverment is elected by the people, and is thus representative of it, so, do you think that all Americans supported invading Iraq ? ... or that the people of Potong Pasir supports the PAP ? ... perhaps the greatest irony of all was how some PRC chaps in this forum complains about discrimination from Singaporeans (an unjust and unqualified generalization I think) ... and yet happily post derogatory threads about the japanese here ... don't you think it's a kind of racism too ? ... and shouldn't we find it repungent ? ... why is it that when we think of WWII germany, we think it as the fault of Hitler and his Nazi thugs, and WWII Italy, Mussolini and his fascists, but when we think of WWII Japan, we tar an entire people ? ... racism is racism, what ever historical enmity you draw upon ... come to think of it, perhaps many parts of Europe and of course China, should hate the Mongols for their pillages and invasion, eh ? ...<br><br>for me, I shall always be suspicious of the intentions of some east asian goverments in stroking the old fires of history (along with the attendent chest beating rabid nationalism I should add), it simply smacks of political expediency, why now, for example, ... after years of warm and cosy relationship, did China become so bitter about Japan ? ... for me, a lasting new image from the SARS crisis was the name of the hospital designated as the main SARS hospital in Beijing that came out in news reports, anyone remember the "Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital" ? ...<br><br>of course, perhaps some chap shall be cursing and swearing at me for being a japanese "running dog", and some chaps did accused me of having "no humanity" and "not knowing history" in other similar threads, but it doesn't matter ... I just hope that everyone can reflect objectively and draw their own conclusions. Judge people individually for who they are, not for what they represent. Just as some Japanese school children shouldn't totally believe their history texts, we should learn to look at history and current affairs objectively too, eh ? ...<br><br></div>

Urgently</span><br><br></div></blockquote>bro,<br><br>you've missed my point of the post, first, certain japanese perfectuaral school systems do use textbook that attempt to paint a balanced picture of things, their school system  is such that different perfectures have the choice as to what textbooks they want to use, as to the second point, many schools do organize visits to hiroshima, and, contary to what you expect, the emphasis is on the common horror of War, which is why the Majority of the japanese people are commited pacifists today, something which their political scene and goverment system does not reflect very well, and, consequently, some foreign press seldom pick up on,<br><br>as to what exactly constitutes Japanese bashing, I would call it racism, just as my original post read, why is it that we find it replusive to generalize about a race, or a society based on certain traits, or historical events, but are happy to do so to the Japanese ? ... isn't that a kind of racism too ? ... to me it is ...<br><br>Now, this is not about who's right or who's wrong, nor is it about whose side each one of us are on, ALL of us, irrespective of nationality or origin, are "brainwashed" to a certain extent, we all find it hard to see  history from an objective point of view, we were all taught history from tinted lenses. but when we become pawns in a bigger game of realpolitiks ? ... Why do you think National Education in Singapore focuses on the Japanese occupation ? Was it about the Japanese ? ... No, of course not, but to remind us that what happened then can happened again, being invaded by another foreign power that  is, not to be on guard for another Japanese invasion ! (a laughable thought btw) As for the political game in other countries, read my original post about the "sino-japanese friendship hospital again", and draw your own conclusions from there.<br><br>and let's be clear, I'm not being an apologist here, but we must remember that just because the goverment of the day in Japan is right of centre, (and dominated by more than a sprinkling of hawks too, I'd admit), doesn't imply that that is representative of the thinking of the whole people, it certainly doesn't justfiy tarring an entire people ... how many know that each time some right wing hotheads hold some militarist ceremonies at the shrine, some Japanese left wing peace activists will be holding a parallel protest against them outside ? to me, it seems remarkably similar to those terrorist nutters in Iraq who slice off American and British aid worker's heads simply because their goverments invaded Iraq ... can you see the parallel bro ? ...<br><br>When i posted this thread up I expected flak to come in soon after ... but I really do hope that everyone, from all nations involved, can learn to look at history objectively, in context ... and move on to a new chapter ... for I loathe to think what consequences this may bring on in the future, when we all breed such latent hatred in our hearts, and pass them on generation after generation ...<br><br></div>

It is true that the hotheads are a minority and that most Japanese are pacifists. However, if the government does not take steps to root out the extreme right in Japanese society, neighbouring Asian nations will never feel at ease. Why does the Japanese government allow members of the extreme right to deny Japanese atrocities during the war if the governmemt does not share that position?<br><br>One might say that it is the right of an individual to free speech, however objectionable the position might be. If that is true, why do we castigate the Iranian President for anti-Semitic statements? Why do we arrest little-known bloggers for making racist remarks? And isn't it also the right of Islamic fundamentalists to talk about wiping Israel off the map, as long as they do not act upon that threat?<br><br>By not coming down hard on the extremists in any society, it will be seen as acquiescence.</div>

At this level of the political game, historical events doesn't count for much, yes, a political leader must learn from history, but if  he/she allows history to colour his or her decisions, then he doesn't belong to that level of the game. As I've tried  to put across time and time again, leaders of various countries stirs up emotions among their people and use them as a useful political tool .... a very useful political tool ....<br><br>Remember the Flor Contemplacion case ? ... remember how the Philipino opposition, from the minority in the congress, to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, to the Philipines Communist Party, all got into the act, with the last even threatening terrorist actions against Singapore interests in the country ? ... but do you imagine for a moment that the Philipino political leaders, or most of the people for that matter, hates us now ? ... that is an example of domestic political expediency, think back to all the times the chappies to our north, use Singapore as a convenient whipping boy for all their ills ? how everything is our fault ? ... how at every turn, we're insensitive to their feelings, and try to use the "law" to snooker them at every turn ? ... and how they threaten to cut off water all  the time ? ... but would they really do  it ? ... I think not, for both sides know it would mean war ... this is another example of useful domestic and international political expediency.<br><br>No doubt, probably some folk in the country north  of us view us the same way some east asian countries view the Japanese, lots of parallel if you think about it; a tiny island off their coast, with cunning, calculative leaders, still richer than they are and the people come over all the time to screw their women and shit all over their country (almost like that Japanese mass orgy incident in the Qingdao hotel, don't you think ?... only it happens every weekend when local punters head over to johor nightclubs eh ? ), but when it comes to actions and agreements between the two countries, do you see historical baggage operating ? ... by and large, of course not, even for the good Doktor that just retired some years ago ...<br><br>so, since you recognized that the Japanese goverment stirs up nationalism and use that as a political tool ... and after what I've written above, can you not agree that other goverments may do  the same thing too ? ... to steer and influence the thinking of their people for the political leaders' agenda ? ... if this is the case ? shouldn't we re-examine our thoughts and feelings towards each other ? ... and shake of the encumberance of historical baggages, and look at current events in their proper context ? ... or are we content to continue to be a convenient political pawn in a bigger game ? ...<br><br>good evening to you bro.<br><br>(edited a spelling error)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I donÂ’t think anybody pushing for an official Japanese recognition of war atrocities, correcting some historical facts in some Japanese textbooks, speaking against the rise of Japanese militarism, should be accused of Japanese bashing,<br><br>It is obvious that it is the issues here is not against the people. War atrocities happened in the past, distortion of historical facts only appeared in some textbooks recently, not before. Koizumi was the first Japanese PM who persistently visits Yasukuni Shrine, not previous Japanese PM, and threat of Japanese militarism is a fear for the future. It is not just about historical baggage.<br><br>Compared with Chinese bashing, the words used, the issues involved, there is hardly anything  Japanese bashing here, let alone Racism. Chinese bashing is a smear against all Chinese with distinction between nationalism and race, PRC Chinese only appeared recently. Chinese bashing is discriminating because only the black dots were recorded and all colored dots ignored. Chinese bashing is racist because the cynicisms are mainly against the people and the culture which some find offensive. Chinese bashing is generalization because there are 1.3 billions people but opinions about Chinese were formed based on meetings with a few overseas English speaking Chinese from PRC. I am a Chinese Singaporean, and my wife a Chinese Singaporean, no Japanese girl friend or PRC Chinese mistress.<br><br>Much has been discussed comparing how the Germans and the Japanese differ in their repentance for war atrocities in WW2. The Germans are forgiven despite the existence of Nazi party and a few skinheads, why? Germans war criminals were hunted down and executed, full and unconditional apologies by all German heads of states. On the other side, the Japanese put the tablets of the class A war criminals in WW2 in the shrine and respected. Koizumi, as a head of state, choose to pay his respect there. Koizumi went on to say that the peace and prosperity of the modern Japan today has been built upon the valuable sacrifices of those who perished in that war. How do you expect those whose friends and relatives killed by the Jap during WW2 respond. The Germans have indeed done a good job, obviously some Jap politicians should learn a lesson there.<br><br>There is really no need to compare how racist other races are to justify racism for any particular race.  Nowhere in any posts here imply that Japanese are Â“a blood-thirsty and cruel raceÂ”. There was no anti-Japanese fervor in any East Asian countries before. PRC had much more domestic problems before, they have to improve their international image to host Olympics, for WTO; Korea had its fair share of problems with the north, with corrupt politicians, with economic crisis, and both do not need to divert attention, and wiping up anti Japanese sentiment does not help in any way. WW2 issues came up only after Koizumi began making changes, not before.<br><br>All, I said All my Japanese friends had no ideas what the Japanese imperial armies did during WW2. In the same way, All the PRC Chinese youngsters have no idea what happened in China during cultural revolution. I told them the stories and they willingly accepted, the Japanese and the PRC Chinese. Some were grateful they got to know the stories.<br><br>Singaporeans are apathetic to politics but we speak English so we are aware what happens outside. ItÂ’s about time more Japanese speak English, Chinese and Korean to learn what their neighbors think about them. Of course, sales of Toyota and Honda will continueÂ…<br><br>have a good day, a happy long weekend and  blessed year ahead....</div>

But it certainly does not need to debunk one's position by saying its based on impression, implied understanding and worst, apologetic statements. The more u say here, the more its seems to weaken your 1st or 2nd statements etc or what hv u.<br><br>I am pretty sure I had presented clearly to you why this is NOT a sport of race bashing or generalisation of a certain community. In the nutshell, I had provided you with:<br>a) Fact of the history links and pics<br>b) Link to Jap's view on WWII<br>c) Your contradictory statements &amp; innuendo made in another thread.<br><br>As you can see, I had at least "dig" into this issue much deeper than you had credited me for.<br><br>If you getting fed up with my arguments and sources, its okay.<br>If you are standing by your case for the sake of some ex-Jap g/l, its okay with me also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>However, please attempt to understand what other folks like sgdiehard, NuLife &amp; oxford mushroom are sharing hereÂ…and no, Drag is an exception. He/she is just nuisance without any arguments, much less any opinion of one's own. At least u have my vote for that  !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you still remains unconvinced the consequence of a "forgetful" Japan, then try reading a lecture by Japan's Assistant Secretary General, United Nations,  Mr. Yasukuni Akashi: <a href="http://www.csi.ad.jp/ABOMB/Akashi.html" rel="nofollow">"Japan and UN: Their Roles in the 21st Century"</a><br><br>Quote from the passage:<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Japanese people do not face our past seriously....German people have seriously reviewed their past....We have not done this.</span>"<br><br><img src="http://www.bjreview.com.cn/05-08-e/w-2/20021212_135.jpg"><img src="http://www.bjreview.com.cn/05-08-e/w-2/20040101_135.jpg"></span></div></blockquote>well bro,<br><br>to be honest yes, at first I was, because it felt like a personal attack, but from the way you put things now, no, I'm not, as I've stated below, I am aware of the kind of emotions that such a topic will stir up, and of course, you're,  as we all are, entitled to our own opinions. (and if you're wondering if I'm thinking from the smaller "head", because of my lady friend, the answer is no, but nevermind, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)<br><br>but then again, many of us falls into the trap of only seeing and listening to what we want to hear, no ? as I have stated in reply to your earlier post above, I do not doubt the veracity of the pictures, nor the websites, we all knew such atrocities happened.<br><br>I note that the lecturer you quoted was Japanese, a bit ironic isn't it ? ... actually, not to me, actually. As I've said, is it representative of the people of that country ? the answer is no, as I've tried to put across. How many foreign press reports the presence of domestic protest groups everytime Koizumi visits the shrine ? for example ?<br><br>As for a formal apology to the people of Asia, do I think it is lacking ? yes, I  do, do I think it would happen now ? no, it won't, no prime minister can do it and survive politically, he'll have his patron support jerked out from under him so fast he'll still be standing up ... (yes, they have their power elites, their MIW if you may, except they do not all belong to a single party). Are there Japanese yearning for a resolution and an apology ? yes there are, just like the speaker you've quoted.<br><br>so how do I think we should respond ? It is interesting to note that the recent anti-Japanese riots in China recently was widely reported in Japan, is  there a mutual stiffening of attitudes and dislikes from the people of both sides ? yes, is that a good situation ? ... I'll leave that to you. the unfortunate reality is that many people, in any country, would readily respond in the "reaction, versus action" was I have written above. But i shall not continue further along this vein, least I get accused of "working for the other side"<br><br>When I got to know this girl, I had whimsical thoughts of showing her an "alternative" history, the history of the Japanese occupation in WWII, I thought of<br>telling her the stories I've heard from my grand mother, I thought of enlightening her about events like the Nanking massacre, for I thought she would only know about the two atomic bombs. I was wrong. she did knew about it. Infact, in hindsight, I was perhaps a bit naive in thinking that way, in this internet age, can such a thing as the Nanking massacre be erased from history ? ... by the efforts of a few right-wing hawks tweaking highschool texts in a few prefectures along  ? ... those hawks were being very naive of course ... the very websites you've listed above, aren't filtered from japanese eyes you know ... (and yes, many tertiary educated japanese do write good and grammatical english, even if their spoken english is quite koyah sometimes).<br><br>Have some faith in those in Japan that knows the truth, and will do the right thing.<br><br>good evening to you bro.<br><br></div>
