              <p><br>1 )The minimum wage legislation saw huge opposition from big businesses who threatened to layoff workers but the fact is only their profits will be hurt. The minimum wage set at S$5.84 per hour is not high but the victory shows that it is possible in Hong Kong to win against the big businesses there to bring about greater social equity - something we cannot see in Singapore</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I lifted it off the article itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Do you believe me if I were to say its the role of the government and the unions to set policies to help Singaporeans make a living?</p>

              <p>"Michael Chan, chairman of fast-food giant Cafe de Coral - who was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 35th richest man in Hong Kong in 2009 - has said his company might issue a profit warning if the hourly rate proposed by the unions became law. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All Mr Chan cares about is that he is answerable to the board and his shareholders.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>What if they lose their job as flyer distributors? Can't they get another job say as a waiter? And if they get higher pay more power to them if they are a full time flyer distributor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Flyer distribution in general is a cheap form of marketing that has a very low success rate fyi. The reason why it might be viable is because labour is cheap enough to sustain it or it could be an odd job for students.</p>

              <p><br>Sidetracking abit, food and commodities are cheap in both countries, only difference is housing whereby Hong Kong would be generally more expensive (What my parents say never bothered to visit Honk Kong) but i do believe that in terms of the cost of living for the poorer population it is only slightly higher than Singapore. HK $ typically divide by 5. So $1,500,000 HKD should be $310,000++ SGD The prices listed below were 2007. I however do think the builtin would be smaller.</p>

              <p>My opinon? I will be honoured, as a country that emphaize on free market, you want to control wages by setting wage limitation?? than you are not a free market that allow equal opportunity and equal condition. The setting of minium wages hit both disadvantages in term of singapore economy, you set too high or as mini wage become high and economy goes into an recession, you are dead, if you set too low, and when the economy and inflation is increasing, you will have more poor peoples which is detrimental to the country. So let wages be flexible as the Market condition, every year, the govt, labour and employers will sit together to determine and recommend the percentage of wage increases after studying the figure and statistic in the economy such as inflation and disparity datas, they formed a council called NWC, chaired by some neutral professor from University. Read those recommendation guidelines and move your fellow workers or staff pay structure within the guideline provided free, you will not loose out, so are yr workers and staff, this had been going on for many years, a free wage consultant agency, the NWC had served our nation well, so why need a minimum wage??</p>

              What if they lose their job as flyer distributors? Can't they get

              <p> </p>
              <p>Flyer distribution in general is a cheap form of marketing
              that has a very low success rate fyi. The reason why it might be
              viable is because labour is cheap enough to sustain it or it could
              be an odd job for students.</p>

              You totally miss the point.... generally, what this highlights is... people who do jobs that are below $5.84 standard... will still get paid $5.84 under minimum wage law... and employer will simply kill the job since it is not value for money, creating unemployment. From making small money to making no money.
              
              Telling me that flyer has low success rate and they should go be a waiter is totally out of point... Might as well tell the ah ma collecting cardboard to go be waiter too....

              <p>So you're saying that we should keep the jobs that are not sustainable just because they still get some money?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the Ah Ma collecting cardboard for peanuts would be out of job just because of a measly minimum wage than really Singapore should not be bragging about low unemployemnt shouldn't it?</p>

              <p>What safeguard are you talking about when there is already a guard, there will be poor in every country, except that some poor are richer than the other poor, and singapore poor are without doubt, richer and living much better than poors of most countries, our poor still can go tour by air, electricity and water supply, have a roof on top, jobs and surf internet. That is luxury to poors of other countries.

              <p>certainly i am not jealous, why should i be, a free market allow a free socialism.</p>
              <p>what i am try to say here is that alots of people in singapore are not poor, maybe average, but certainly not poor, however, a lots of them make themselves poor by engaging thing that is beyong their mean, some like to gamble, some like to flirt around and drink,,...so end up, you tell the govt or the society that you are poor, need help and look/act pitiful. The most fundamental issue here is not about minimum wages, but rather on financial awareness or financial planing, social well being and certainly good discipline.</p>
              <p>With OT this Uncle can take home $1.8k to 2k net, he have to spend it on his beautiful and young PRC gal, his house, his childrens and his family, so end up he is poor. And that is why i mentioned that most peoples in Singapore make themselve poor thru unethical behavior. Most are matured adult, not kids, you tell them too much, they also said you kaypoh, it is alright to have mistress, drinks, spending lavishly as you like, but ending up saying you are poor, that is too much, these peoples need to do some soul searching.</p>

              <p>I have read some post at the Taxi forum, and my understanding is that there are job opportunity there, people have to strife for a living, you cannot expect spoonfeeding, u can drive taxi with a $100+ income per day, just go take a license, work honestly and work hard on it, everything have it first time, hard time and difficult time, but once this is past, you are a professional of your own careers, it does not mean that being a U or diploma or any other teritiary education make you a professional, my taking is everyone working on his/her work is the best profession of his/her own work.</p>
