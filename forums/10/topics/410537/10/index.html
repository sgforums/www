              <p>Dude, can you read up more on minimum wage first ?</p>
              <p>Minimum wage is good for the economy.</p>
              <p>With our current depressed wages ...and increase in poverty...If you have a local business, how are you going to sell your wares to 10 people who cannot even afford 1 meal ?</p>
              <p>With minimum wage, there will be more people with disposable income that can afford to buy from you.</p>
              <p>Also, minimum wage will level the field between foreign and native job seekers. You look at their ability and pick the one better suited for the job. Min wage helps to shift hiring decision of employers from "who is the cheapest" to who is the "best fit".</p>
              <p>Now how can this be bad ??????</p>

              <p>Minimum wage just means the business owner gets to earn lower profits only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If with minimum wage for the workers, the business owner cannot make any profit, then it's time for him to close the business or think of innovating his business in other ways to make profits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now in Singapore, wages are already so low and the issue of minimum wage is to ensure that people will have a reasonable wage to survive day to day only.  It's not to make our low wage workers millionaires. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>1. You mean if your factory can only operate with minimum of 10 workers (all fully deployed on the control panels), you will employ 8? At the end of the day, your production plant still can't run.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. You mean to say if your pub now runs with 10 workers operating at maximum capacity, you will employ another 2 to reduce your profits? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Remember, i can employ 2 more peoples, but i expanded my business, eg. open a new pub.</p>

I have met some of these country delegates in some int'l seminars, and for the govts, how they wish they can abolish welfare system, and for the boss, how they wish wages can be flexible and set according to market.There is nothing wrong with them, if it works well with them so be it. Singapore had been performing well without a minimium wage for all these years, why need a mini wage to unsettle thing. If mini wage is set at let say $1,200, what is so good about it, and end up NTS workers also getting such paid.</p>
              <p>I can tell you that even around our Asia region, those countries with mini wage system are not practicing it, just across only, you see many indonesian and malaysian are paid below what was set and the laws keep silence over it, cos if not, companies will move out, and those who except paid below the mini wage will get the jobs. On the contrary, company can go into a contractual agreeement with the workers on a contract basis that remove the mini wage condition completely.
