              <p>Don't bullshit lah sista.</p>
              <p>Can you even sleep at night knowing your workers cannot afford to pay their mortgage and eat 1 meal a day, just so you can open one more pub ? For you no problem right.</p>
              <p>Instead of paying a decent pay, you'd rather exploit them with low wages for your personal gain and business expansion hor.</p>
              <p>20 underpaid workers, and 2 pubs, vs 8 min wage workers and 1 pub. Ofcors you will choose to underpay them.</p>
              <p>" GREED".. sista.. I will pray extra hard for you so you can keep your angel wings ok.</p>
              <p>Which country delegate you talked to ? Not all forumers here are xiao di di xiao mei mei, so easily conned by you leh.</p>
              <p>Companies move out ah.. move to where ? You want to open your pub in Malaysia and Indonesia ? Go lor.. how much can you sell your XO and Guinness stout in those countries ?</p>
              <p>Removing mini wage condition ? Well, that's only possible in corrupt countries, because it is illegal ya. Try doing that in 1st world country lah.. you go explain to the judge lor.</p>
              <p>Sista, money can earn.. but earn with a clear conscience. OK ? Good.</p>

It is kind of like you see me good, i see you good, but actually all are in the same shit ya.</p>
              <p>One man or woman have to make his own living, this is a capitalism world we voted and accepted, you can't expect me to go into those kind of communism or socialist way of doing business when your competitors and the rest are waiting to chop you down.</p>
              <p>And dun you worry sista, i have never mistreat or underpaid my workers, employment relationship is important to sustain a business, otherwise, people will jump ship, today, it is a employee world out there, its their call.</p>

              <p>Dude, can you read up more on minimum wage first ?</p>
              <p>Minimum wage is good for the economy.</p>
              <p>With our current depressed wages ...and increase in poverty...If
                      you have a local business, how are you going to sell your wares to
                      10 people who cannot even afford 1 meal ?</p>
              <p>With minimum wage, there will be more people with disposable
                      income that can afford to buy from you.</p>
              <p>Also, minimum wage will level the field between foreign and
                      native job seekers. You look at their ability and pick the one
                      better suited for the job. Min wage helps to shift hiring decision
                      of employers from "who is the cheapest" to who is the "best
                      fit".</p>
              <p>Now how can this be bad ??????</p>
              <p>Harmful you say .. more like you are so ignorant</p>

              <p>I believe we must have an understanding first about the nature of minimum wage, and what the impact would be.</p>
              <p>The basic thing about minimum wage is this.....</p>
              <p>Minimum wage is an externally imposed control, onto the labour market.</p>
              <p>Minimum wage is government regulation.</p>
              <p>It is not supply and demand.</p>
              <p>It is a floor.</p>
              <p>So what happens when that is applied ?</p>
              <p>If that is applied, the ones below the floor would get cut off.</p>
              <p>There are some other negative effects from it.</p>
              <p>But basically, the most noticable effect is that it would actually promote unemployment.</p>
              <p>So those youths working in 7-11 shops, those part-time cleaners, and so on........</p>
              <p>They would get cut.</p>
              <p>It benefits no one.</p>
              <p>A floor or a ceiling ALWAYS introduces distortions and inefficiencies.</p>
              <p>The way to improve people's living standards is by improving business opportunities, improving infrastcuture, education, workforce skills, condusive taxation rule......these are helpful.......if any price floor is imposed.....what good would it bring ? It is superficial and it wont work.</p>
              <p>As to the nature about foreigners / foreign labours depressing wages.....</p>
              <p>Well then..the answer is not really by applying minimum wage, but by having less incoming foreign labour supply. What does it have to do with minimum wage? This is like putting the cart before the horse.</p>
              <p>But this foreign labour thing is another, more complex, issue. I believe there are some politics and strategic issues involved.</p>
              <p>But in any case, minimum wage is suicidal and is harmful to society.</p>

              <p>Why must cost of wages be left to supply and demand ? Why not let EVERYTHING in the market be left to supply and demand ? Abolish all authorities that regulate businesses and let the free hand work the market if you want a 100% free market. Lets get rid of big government in Singapore.....You know this ain't gonna work. Without some form of regulation, the free market will exploit EVERYTHING.</p>
              <p>Do you know the history of union ? Why in the old days, people see the need to form unions ? Study the history please.</p>
              <p>Students and part-timers getting cut? Obviously you don't know how minimum wage works. Get your ignorant ass out of Singapore and see how other countries are doing it.</p>
              <p>"improving
              business opportunities, improving infrastcuture, education,
              workforce skills, condusive taxation rule." - <strong>FAIL</strong>. All these do not contribute to increasing wages. It only gives business owners a more condusive <strong>business</strong> environment.  Does it equate to better salaries ? NO.</p>
              <p>Immigration reform you say, this one yes, it affects demand supply. Now we have an overflow of foreign supply, so the price of wages goes down. Basic Econs. But do we want to stop immigration ? No. As much as I hate to admit, we do need them, but only good quality ones, and the ones we really need.</p>
              <p>We can welcome immigrants with open arms, but let them compete fairly, base on QUALITY instead of Lowest Cost.</p>
              <p>Right now, foreigners has an unfair advantage over the locals, so the best solution is minimum wage.</p>
              <p>You can't have an open immigration policy that is driving up cost of living and yet not control the wage depression.</p>

              <p><br>well sista, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going..aint that sound nice.</p>
              <p>I aint no Gucci or Lavin gal, just a normal gal doing a normal business, and i believe you aint see the stress of running a business such as mine. Cos if there is a mini wage, wages will not become flexible enuf to react against an ever increase fluctuation of economy cyclical action!!! it will hurt both side more than helping it.</p>
              <p>Hotels staffs are headhunted to join RWS and MBS at a remarkable paid, bankers and finanical hub seriously need more staffs, they are recruiting like mad with each competite with each others in paid, benefits and other special terms. A person can now really make a choice of what he/she wants to work for, job hopping and demand for higher remuneration is on the rise. The market is heating, hopefully, not overheated, a mini wage system could wipe out the entire employees call althogether, be it in good times or bad times.</p>

              <p><br> well sista, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going..aint
              that sound nice.</p>
              <p>I aint no Gucci or Lavin gal, just a normal gal doing a normal
              business, and i believe you aint see the stress of running a
              business such as mine. Cos if there is a mini wage, wages
              will not become flexible enuf to react against an ever
              increase fluctuation of economy cyclical action!!! it will
              hurt both side more than helping it.</p>
              <p>Hotels staffs are headhunted to join RWS and MBS at a remarkable
              paid, bankers and finanical hub seriously need more staffs, they
              are recruiting like mad with each competite with each others in
              paid, benefits and other special terms. A person can now really
              make a choice of what he/she wants to work for, job hopping and
              demand for higher remuneration is on the rise. The market is
              heating, hopefully, not overheated, a mini wage system could wipe
              out the entire employees call althogether, be it in good times or
              bad times.</p>

              <p>I think you are confused lah sista. Minimum wage is not maximum wage hor... workers want to job hop to higher pastures no one stopping them ah.</p>
              <p>Besides that, minimum wage is good for your pub/night club leh.</p>
              <p>As disposable income for the general public increases, more can afford to patronise your "entertainment" business yes? Now you driving collola, next year you can drive the Jaguar sports convertible ya.</p>
              <p>Think positive sista, this island is your oyster. Don't forget me when you are rich and famous ok ? Good.</p>

              <p>True, but when the Mini wage set become obsolet, it will be an disadvantage to workers against the market, and if Mini wage is kept adjusting higher and higher, singapore will be less attractive to FDI, which is one of the pillar of growth, which in turn slump us now, peoples going jobless, and i getting less customers etc etc, all will be affected.</p>
              <p>So now, what is the problem with singapore flexi wages system that we need to adhere to a mini wage, because some one or many of them have it, it does not mean that you need to eat rice when most of them are eating rice ya. As long as you are comfortable and stable, what is the deal?</p>

              <p>i dunno if they have it better, but i do know their government needs to pay you if you're a citizen and unemployed (i.e. it's to their advantage to help you get a job)</p>

              <p>The PAP government don't believe in helping her citizens along when they hit a bump, if you cannot find job in Singapore, you are either lazy or trying to leech off the hard working folks. It's never PAP's fault at importing foreigners en masse and causing disequilibrium in Singapore's labour market. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Exactly how many bangalas you need to wash dirty dishes ? 1 to turn on the tap, 1 to rinse the dishes, 1 to dry and 1 to put the cleaned dishes away ? Seriously, are you hiring more than you need becuase they are so cheap anyway ?</p>
              <p>Before the cheap foreign workers invaded our land, employers arn't struggling. Yes labour is tight, yet those with quality survived.</p>
              <p>Now we have stalls sprouting up everywhere, cheap china workers serving our local fare.. the stall owners are shaking their legs elsewhere. The old and poor are collecting cans everywhere !!</p>

              <p>Tho i may take in cheap labours, but for supervisory and management grades I still employ true blue singaporeans, we do expect singaporeans to be better educated, better in management and better in control. However, there are still many singaporeans still stuck within the worker perimeter, and that is sad, because we expect singaporeans to be on top and not under the worker category. And I understand that it is because singapore is moving so fast result in these group of singaporeans unable to catch up, and even by the time they do thru training, reskilling or education, the young ones would had step into the market, and certainly, i will employ the young and youthful one. So, there left this group of singaporeans, in their late middle age and mostly lower than teritary education facing both a structural unemployment and self stubborness to work with the foreigners. Obviously, they still think that they are singaporeans and so they are more superior, but ultimately, they dunno who moved their cheese.</p>

              <p>no where did i imply that staff turnover is dependent on min wages. it is in your figment of imagination and in your course of argument, you got things all mixed up and start confusing things by putting words in my mouth.</p>
              <p>it will be in your interest to argue to the point and succinctly. you can't even talk straight in this case. but of cos, cross-dresser like you are always in two minds, not sure if you should wear a dress or a pant.</p>

              <p>1. Kengkia likes Parn so whatever Parn says Kengkia follows lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Angel basically spews "sai" and spams it too lol. Her modus operandi is to argue out of point so long she posts more "sai" than your post she wins lol. Dun believe me... reply to one of her post... she will reply wif a post of "sai" de... lol. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Parn is basically not even in the working force and not of the age to consider starting a family.... my guess is her age 13-17 max.... to be honest. I also think she has a very bad opinion of guys probably due to some failed relationship. Anyways I hope she grows out of it.</p>
