We have maintain our competitiveness a nos 3 spot behind the swiss and swedish, and the major contributing factors are beside good governance, a good labour management relation and a flexible wage system, stability, harmonious and peace.

              <p>Well, it is long and meaningless post.  Minimum wage =

              <p>Right now, without any hard or fast rule where wage is solely up to the discretionary of the company, they do not have a guideline, thus they would give solely base on the ability.

If you don't understand, I can explain in another way.</p>
              <p>As for people talking. These company would know how to deal with it. Don't need to worry.

              <p>Question u have to ask yrself is that, without a minimum wage system, how come singapore can be so successful, a country without natural resource other than human resources, we did well.</p>
              <p>As said, a lazybone singapore man would had been a beggar crawling the floor begging for food in some poor countries, but in Singapore, he is blessed to ride the wave of success, even if he is a lazy, good for nothing person. And that is the differences we are talking about.</p>
              <p>With a mere 1.8 local workforce, can we handle a market that command a 3 millions workforce from workers to MDs??</p>

              What more can you offer if your skills are equal, the salary you

              <p>Singapore was successful without much foreigner since the early days and the minimum pay then was higher in term of value then comparing to now?<br><br>What comparing sources you base on?  between 2009 and 2010?? Try stretch it bigger.  And again in what capacity and which context you conclude that being lazy still can ride the success of SG?? Where have you been?? within the window of your own toad well??  Why not you quit any source of income and see if you can lazy around and ride on the sucess... When you had done tat then I am convince. If not, prefer you STFU, cos what I'm writing is something that happen you are merely joyriding around.</p>
              <p>Regarding what you mentioned about local 1.8m workforce and the demand of 3M in the market.  So where you get that figures?? From some part of your hair?? To answer you that, if there wasnt any restriction to child birth rate back then, if living expenses wasnt that high now, then we can have 5M work force and could be since 10 yrs ago.  And yes I got the figure from some part of  my hair.</p>
              <p>You did not read my previous post? Cos you have nothing to say that's why you skipped that?  You are just another selective poster. Posting for the purpose of posting. </p>

              <p><br>How is lower staff turnover or higher staff turnover related to this Minimum wages thing?</p>
              <p>Staff turnover rate isn't dependent on work laws or schemes such as Minimum wages, and if you believed that staff turnover rate is going to improve for whatever reasons you believed, kindly share your reasons and scenarios with relations to Minimum wages and staff turnover rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like I've said you are not looking from an employer's perspective, how is staff turnover rate going to affect any employers?</p>
              <p>It's true from your employee's perspective, you can be naive and imagined all the employees walking away from their job and the employers will need to beg these employees to stay. DREAM ON ok? Do you not realised that it is now an employers' market rather than an employees' market? Go ahead and quit your job, I don't think anyone will ever be missed because their job position will be replaced in a flash.</p>

              <p>Min wage =/= starting pay.</p>
              <p>Min wage = least amount you can get. </p>
              <p>Why parn said min wage = max wage is because through an employer point of view, as long as they give let say $1000 (min wage), they would not increase it. As long as they are not breaking the rules, they will continue giving out this $1000.</p>
              <p>Right now, without any hard or fast rule where wage is solely up to the discretionary of the company, they do not have a guideline, thus they would give solely base on the ability. Till then, it would be up to the employee luck to see if he/ she can find a similar job with a higher pay or not, which would not have happened if there is a minimum wage. If you don't understand, I can explain in another way.</p>
              <p>As for people talking. These company would know how to deal with it. Don't need to worry. As long as the company is able to keep its products low, who would bother on how they sack their retired staff or not. E.g. SIA. Have anyone boycott SIA because of their staff retrenchment exercise to cut cost? </p>

              <p><br> How is lower staff turnover or higher staff turnover related to
              this Minimum wages thing?</p>
              <p>Staff turnover rate isn't dependent on work laws or schemes such
              as Minimum wages, and if you believed that staff turnover rate is
              going to improve for whatever reasons you believed, kindly share
              your reasons and scenarios with relations to Minimum wages and
              staff turnover rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like I've said you are not looking from an employer's
              perspective, how is staff turnover rate going to affect any
              employers?</p>
              <p>It's true from your employee's perspective, you can be naive and
              imagined all the employees walking away from their job
              and the employers will need to beg these employees to stay. DREAM
              ON ok? Do you not realised that it is now an employers'
              market rather than an employees' market? Go ahead and
              quit your job, I don't think anyone will ever be missed because
              their job position will be replaced in a flash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am unable to agree with you with the information that I'm
              aware of. But you are still welcome to express your own opinions
              without feeding people with false impression and ideals.

              <p>Identity crisis? Are you complaining that you desired to
              know more about me?</p>

              <p>you really got short memory. you are the one that said that<em><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "</span></em><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">They can always fire you and re-employed someone else on minimum wages."</span></em> . </span>I am telling you that it doesn't work well from an employer's perspective because it is more costly to hire, train, etc.</p>
              <p>no where did i imply that staff turnover is dependent on min wages. it is in your figment of imagination and in your course of argument, you got things all mixed up and start confusing things by putting words in my mouth.</p>
              <p>it will be in your interest to argue to the point and succinctly. you can't even talk straight in this case. but of cos, cross-dresser like you are always in two minds, not sure if you should wear a dress or a pant.</p>
              <p>great minds we have here....i am outta here.</p>
