Charlie Chaplin did not take all these into consideration when quoting MM Lee paid.</p>

              <p>My goodness, whenever i quote something, there is alway salt and pepper added, hahaha...I am not going against that old uncle in anything he did in the public, if he wants to flaunt his money, that is up to him, what I am implying is that at the end of the day, he dun come in and said that he is poor and govt did not help him or whatever this society is unfair to him and all those nonsense. If you are loyal to your family, trying hard to raise a family, not to mention that you did not do well in your study during your young times, so end up doing menial jobs here and there and said that you are poor, I would had agree on it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that Uncle had started to work for us, he is quite good, know where to deliver food to those lorongs for those gals.</p>

              <p><br>This is a relationship between an employer and employees, the right to hire and fire for the former, and the right to work or resign for the latter is a fair equation, employers also understand that if they move the wage beyong competitiveness with their competitor, they loose workers and talents, so ultimately, they set a bit higher wages and benefits inorder to attract people to work for them. The labour market move along the economy market, when labour market is tight, wages goes up, if not inflation set in, just like having a 3% inflation now is a burden to workers, they will surely want higher paid to equalize or so call offset inflation which is the cost of living. Employees who are look for job or asking paid increase in a tight labour market should therefore ask for more, but if the economy is bad, and the jobless rate is increasing, then wages will start to go down. So, for those looking for job now, ask for higher wages so that in bad time, your basic is still strong.</p>

              <p><br>This is a relationship between an employer and employees, the right to hire and fire for the former, and the right to work or resign for the latter is a fair equation, employers also understand that if they move the wage beyong competitiveness with their competitor, they loose workers and talents, so ultimately, they set a bit higher wages and benefits inorder to attract people to work for them. The labour market move along the economy market, when labour market is tight, wages goes up, if not inflation set in, just like having a 3% inflation now is a burden to workers, they will surely want higher paid to equalize or so call offset inflation which is the cost of living. Employees who are look for job or asking paid increase in a tight labour market should therefore ask for more, but if the economy is bad, and the jobless rate is increasing, then wages will start to go down. So, for those looking for job now, ask for higher wages so that in bad time, your basic is still strong.</p>
