              <p>darn, in corporate world, there are lots of unnecessary peoples and yet get higher paid, some even end up with inverted funnel system, the overhead more than the real productive peoples. For me, I mend the finanical, HR, purchasing, managing, logistic, recruiting, sales and marketing and front line servicing all by myself, why need all this stupid line managers for what, imagine every dept pay a manager 5 thousands, how much you lost in wages for nothing and yet get more human politic problem. For me, i just take all these money and paid to workers and staffs as bonus better lor, that is what call cheaper, better and faster. Cheaper in running business, better in bonus and benefit for my workers and faster in making decision within a thin hierrachy of reporting.</p>
              <p>You want something, hv to go thru supervisor, then manager then GM, then HR, then head of HR...then by the time not approve, waste so much time, like me, workers request, on the spot yes or no and give reason, settle and life goes on</p>

              <p><br>Precisely, employers like me are not stupid people who just paid my employees low wages and never want to increase them, if I did that, i would had lost lots of employees and especially those good ones. Today, the labour market is tight, and it is an employees' market, that is why, you can hear MBD employees making noises and many other firm headhunting competitor employees with much higher paid, let the labour wage market adjust itself, if you set a mini wage, which is more toward those 3rd world countries, we would lose a labour wage competitiveness.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely, employers like me are not stupid people who just paid my employees low wages and never want to increase them, if I did that, i would had lost lots of employees and especially those good ones. Today, the labour market is tight, and it is an employees' market, that is why, you can hear MBD employees making noises and many other firm headhunting competitor employees with much higher paid, let the labour wage market adjust itself, if you set a mini wage, which is more toward those 3rd world countries, we would lose a labour wage competitiveness.</p>

              <div>The government leaders have been telling the people that a minimum wage will cause the jobs to be lost. This is only partly true; largely, it is false.<br><br>A minimum wage is necessary to ensure that the worker earns enough to pay for the cost of living by doing a full day's work. If the wage is below the minimum, the worker has to work longer hours. This will cause other people to be unemployed. For a stable society, we need to have most people, who are able and willing to work, to be able to find a job and earn enough enough to raise a family and be a contributing member of society.<br><br>A decent wage, as opposed to a sub-minimum wage, does not cause the loss of jobs. Wages are only one component of the total cost of production. The other components are cost of property (i.e. rental), government taxes and shareholder profits. If wages are too low, more of the cost goes towards rental and profits. The imbalance, between wages and rental, is one factor leading to the high property prices in Singapore.<br><br>Many of the jobs in a country are in the service sector. They are part of the domestic economy. They have to be done in the country and cannot be lost. Examples are education, health, transport and personal services. A minimum wage to these sectors affect all businesse and will be added to the cost of providing the service. It can be kept low, if the other components, such as rental, taxes and profits, are kept at the fair market levels - and are not inflated due to the failure of the market, e.g. if there is a near monopoly.<br><br>Many global businesses come to Singapore to enjoy the low wages contributed by foreign workers who work in Singapore. The social cost of these foreign workers have not been properly factored - i.e. the overcrowding and the strain on the public services (i.e education, health and transport). If these are properly accounted, the strategy of low wages, i.e. no minimum wage, in creating jobs in Singapore is not compelling.<br><br>I believe that it is time for a minimum wage to be introduced in Singapore and for the market in labour to find its new level. I believe that we are among the few developed economies that do not have a minimum wage.<br><br>Tan Kin Lian</div>
              <div><strong>3)</strong> The statistics from the New Paper are taken at face value. I believe it is a common conspiracy theory that the media is sterilised by the government. I don't think I was being bias. You however are being defensive by suggesting that the data from the local paper is wrong. Like I said take it at face value. I believe we both have not the time to do bo liao things such as applying for said jobs just to prove a point in this forum.</div>
              <div><strong>4)</strong> Offer declined. As I stand I'll take the data from the New Paper at face value. You may however volunteer your services<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></div>

              <p><br>1) I don't know who is Michael Chan, but people should be well-educated enough not to be exploited by their employers. On the other hand, you can keep hoping that the Government will step in with policies to help PEOPLE who are probably afraid, lazy, waiting to for help with their own situations? </p>
              <p>2) Tan Kin Lian's main point is already nakedly displayed on his second paragraph "A minimum wage is necessary to ensure that the worker earns enough to pay for the cost of living by doing a full day's work." Cost of living for a day or for a month, which one do you think his minimum wage dream is going to fulfill? How much is the daily cost of living for an average Singaporean? Who doesn't earned more than enough to upkeep their daily cost of living after a full day of work. So Tan Kin Lian's idea of keeping all of your salaries in line with the minimum wage is your supported vision?</p>
              <p>To add on to this, it really doesn't matter what status you are holding in your past society or present society, unless you're trying to prove to me that opinions from an ex-chief executive carries more weight compared to anyone of the forumers in here, then I will still tell you that this kind of status-conscious mindset is terribly outdated and I don't blame you if you have been having this mindset for years.</p>
              <p>3) The news media are bias, you cannot see them being bias because they have provided you with the information which can support your personal opinions. Don't you know anyone who had worked in one of those "lowest paid" jobs which you have mentioned? If you don't, then is this another one of your thin-air imaginations or bias observations?</p>
              <p>4) Not necessary for me to reply since you don't know anyone who had worked one of those "lowest paid" jobs which you have mentioned and supported in your baseless argument. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
