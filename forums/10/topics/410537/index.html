              <p>PAP has 98% seats in Parliament. They thus have the ultimate liberty to pass or not pass any type of Laws, be it minimum wage, freedom of assembly, death penalty laws, election laws and what not laws.<br><br>Hong Kong, despite not being a nation and also more laissez faire, has better democracy and human rights. <br>People also protest freely, with up to 500,000 taking to the streets at one time. <br><br>Even our own DBS paid a good public compensation to their Hong Kong clients who lost their money in the structured notes debacle. However DBS was silent on what was paid to SIngapore clients, as compared to those paid in Hong Kong. Why? <br><br>So can anyone enlighten why Hong Kong is better in these respects than Singapore, besides Minimum wage Laws?<br><br>Are we peasants partly to blame for this state of affairs?<br><br>I say peasants becasue they bore the brunt of the PAP policies, not the elite. <br><br>Or are peasants the minority here, so much so that they are outvoted by the elites at every election?</p>

              <p>Had SIN Leaders came close to the performances of the Hong Kong Legislaters(Cabinet). Me thinks many of the Local Bloggers would not be doing what they are doing in Cyberspace now.<br><br>Probably, many would be vying to be in Parliament to contribute to Society. Or, they may want to spent their times pursuing leisures.<br><br>Even the blinds know the rich are getting richer and the poor are poorer in SIN, they may not see but they never failed to hear the sighings.<br><br>Minimun wage could be meaningless if the costs of livings are raised faster and frequently than a token sum to the present wage. A vicious cycle had been created, restrict foreigners will cause great fall in consumptions. Allow foreigners, Singaporeans get sidelined for jobs and prices of everything goes up. And the ultimate Archilles Heel, the peasai size of the City.<br><br>The Talented Leaders are confident they have all the answers, BUT unfortunately, the People do not have confidence and trust of their Leaderships and there are all the signs that they have given up hopes on them.<br><br>patriot</p>

              <p>Passing of minimum wage laws is only a wayang. There is no point in interfering with prices if the underlying supply and demand is imbalanced. Setting a minimum wage while massively importing foreigners will only increase unemployment for locals at the margin.<br><br>The proper way forward is to address the supply directly (i.e. stop massive importing of foreign labor, and allow wages and overall cost of living to rise).<br><br>Clearly our govt is not interested in doing that.</p>

              <p>Profits are NOT hurt by minimum wage laws.<br><br>The problem lies with management being grossly overpaid. The top leaders of industries in most countries are paid salaries and bonuses at least 30-40 times the annual income of average workers.<br><br>Many workers have problems paying the rent and bills for one home, but the top elites have 3 homes and 4 cars easily.<br><br>Corporate profits will not be hurt by minimum wages, as long as the increased wage bill is borne by the elites.<br><br>For too long, they have enjoyed a fat salary at the expense of low-income workers, who generally do not have a fair share in corporate profits.</p>

              <p>The PAP would rather give free money to businesses in the form of job credits than directly to underpaid workers and the unemployed.

              <p>The difference between HK and Singapore is the political. We have to look past the labels. Having a a GE every 5 years doesn't make one a democratic country. Obviously, the HK government respect's its citizens' rights more. Singapore just views requests from its citizens as nuisance to be ignored and discouraged. They view most citizens too stupid for their own good or smart asses that need to be smacked down and put in their places.</p>

              <p>Dear all, <br><br>I agree with some of what you have shared. Please allow me to share with you a personal experience. This boss told the employees that business was not so good as last year. <br><br>Therefore no bonuses for that year. However unknown to the employees, this same boss in that same year bought a bentley and a Rolls Royce. Total cost is at least $1.8 million. The RR was at least $1 mil and bentley was at least $800k. <br><br>I honestly think that that person should have given the bonus but the company belongs to that person.<br><br>In newspaper or tv, you will read about how minimum wage can increase costs for businesses.<br><br>But what do I see with my own eyes? Have the newspaper and tv ever asked why the whole boss family MUST drive luxury cars??? Even when the child was in poly, the present was a Ferrari! <br><br>Before any rich people cry foul about high costs due to minimum wage, can they at least cut the cost from their own sky high salaries???<br><br>A gini coefficient of higher than 0.5 can lead to riots on the street. Do we really want to see this? We must vote correctly to correct the current imbalance. If not our children will pay a high price for our cowardice.<br><br>Cheers<br>Economist with a heart</p>

              <p>They want to admit 100,000 more foreigners? China and India's economic growth are slowing down, European stock market has tanked, pulling down any hope of US economy recovering with it. SIN is lucky it made 15% growth this year (of course the rich and the govt are the one to benefit most from it). Next year won't be so easy and smooth... we'll be lucky if we grow by 7%, and what happens to those 100,000 foreigners? Not all will leave right away if they lose their jobs - they will compete with locals for their jobs. Siow liao.</p>

              <p>BTW, they have passed a law to have a minimum wage, but the figure hasn't been decided yet.

              <p>The reality of the situation is, most rich or highly paid people are mobile. If employers in Singapore are not willing to pay them what they think they deserve, they can move to another country. Singapore government wants to keep these people so have to give in to their interests.<br><br>Poor or poorly paid people have limited mobility. They are stuck in Singapore even if doing the same jobs in other First World countries pay 3 - 4 times what they are getting in Singapore.<br><br>Given the circumstances and especially the lack of threat to their continuing rule, I don't think anything will change. The poor have no voice, the middle class are either cowed or apathetic and the rich call the shots. Even in low tax country like Singapore, the more tax you pay, the more you are heard.</p>

              <p>The minimum wage has not been set. In fact it will be decided by a group of people selected by the non-elected government.

              <p>In that case, good for them. Go where they are appreciated more. Staying put and hoping the system will change means condeming oneself and one's children to a bleak future. For those who are mobile and find life in Singapore unbearable should consider other countries that give better opportunities. If one is not mobile, one should at least ensure that one's children get the right skills to be mobile.</p>

              <p>Based on the HK minimum wage, every worker doing the jobs listed will earn $1326. Which is more than what they are earning now. Come election time, we should provide this information to every low wage earner and ask him to think twice as his vote pays the Ministers more but not himself</p>

              <p>your post is truly laughable....</p>
              <p>firstly, even for an entry level job, there are different job wage/scale to put the right people into the right job. not everyone starts on a minimum wage level even if it is their first/entry level job. minimum wage protects the basic right of an employee from exploitation. even for a road sweeper, there are subtle wage differences that you and i may not be aware of.  </p>
              <p>and in the real world, a policy of employee retention is a much more viable &amp; profitable business model, other factors not withstanding. no company in their right mind will hire and fire employees summarily over wage. employees are released due mainly to performances or their cost structure in running the business is unsustainable. the cost of rehiring, retraining and disruption to the business is much higher. business continuity is a lot more cost effective.</p>
              <p>&amp; i cannot see the co-relation between min wage and high income level and what it has to do with talent. care to elaborate?</p>
              <p>i only get your first sentence when you say with you, the topic is gonna DRAG....you're a fag after all!</p>

              <p><br>Sadly, you are only looking from the perspective of an employee.</p>
              <p>And I must say these opinions of yours aren't exactly wrong if you are only looking from the perspective of an employee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you believe me if I were to crush your employee's dream by telling you that employers do not think or react to minimum wages from an employee's perspective?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fags and laughable aside, you can only voice your opinions like that because you only see yourself as the bigger picture in this topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can only understand the perspective of an employer only if you are one or know one yourself. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, minimum wages are not meant to protect like you have mentioned. It's only because you have hopes to seek some form of protection from minimum wages, and you have decided to view it in that manner. Minimum wages are unfortunately meant to protect businesses and investments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you really think any Government would pass any laws that were meant to dent the businesses and investments in their countries?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I disagree with the law. </p>
              <p>To clarify first, I do not know what are the minimum wage that has been set. So what I'm going to reason on is base on Singapore current wage system. </p>
              <p>1. E.g. If the min. wage for the service staff in the F&amp;B industry is $3.50/ hr as what our current Fast Food is giving out now, it means that it will be applied across the industry. Hence, if an employee wants to argue on the basis that he or she has XX years of experience and should be commanding a higher pay, the company has the right to reject as they have followed the law giving a $3.50/ hr wage. </p>
              <p>This would in turn burst the bubble of increasing wage in the long run as majority of the companies aim is to cut cost. Thus, they would keep it to the minimum as much as possible. </p>
              <p>2. It is indeed good business sense to increase an employee's pay slightly so as to retain that person. But if this employee can threaten to leave the company because of that pay, can this company trust this person to be loyal to the company? </p>
              <p>Only real talents gets the pay which is higher than the minimum wage. Employees should really ask themselves this questions. Are they replaceable? If they are, then I think minimum wage is the best you can ask for. Why should the company find the trouble to deal with you arguing with them every day when they can easily bring in another person to replace you? All they need to do is to advertise and employ. Not happy? Employ again. A news paper adv is cost nothing to the company as compared to the anguish and amount that a disgrunted employee can cost. </p>
              <p>3. By passing minimum wage, it means that everyone is equal. What more can you offer if your skills are equal, the salary you are asking for is equal. Then all the boss need to do is close his eyes, stretch his hands out and pick the resume he have chosen. Tadah! That would be the person for the job. Not up to it? Change new one. After all, everyone cost the same! </p>
              <p>4. HK cost of living is very high. If the minimum wage is not able to cover the basic cost of living, what is the use? It is almost near impossible to increase the minimum wage through the basis of experience, and as I said, unless you possess very beneficial skills and talent till the company cannot do without you. </p>
