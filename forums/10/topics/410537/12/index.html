              <p><br>Many singaporeans, especially the 45yo and above are the last survivor of the baby boomer period, most are hard working people, but lack the direction and the knowledge to adapt to new society such as globalisation and IT age. This group of people, given upgrading, they are more reluctant as they do not like going back to classroom. Even if they have a diploma or degree, it is consider out of date, should go back and refresh it.</p>
              <p>Our govt had given up on childbirth policy, it already said by PM during the national day rally, if you all dun give birth, we have to take peoples from outside, therefore, there are more and more foreigners, mostly from our surrounding third world entering our country to work and easily get PR or citzenship status. So, it is no more an issue for the govt. But it will be an issue to the locals who will have to struggle and compete with them.</p>
              <p>And as peoples flock in not in a generation gap, but within two to three years, the demanding for housing is high, ultimately, that jack up the prices which contradict what former PM Goh said, "We promise all singaporeans that there will be a roof on top of their head, we will built affordable flat to cater to all singaporeans" today, Mah is trying desparately to stick to this motto said in the 90s, but he alway end up saying the wrong things. With that motto broken, peoples unable to have a roof on top, but instead have tent on top at beaches, i think the govt have to do some soul searching.</p>
              <p>As I have repeated many times, mini wage is not conducive for Singapore, it is not that i support the govt, by setting mini wage, you may create a lower wage for singaporeans</p>
