              <p>I have read some post at the Taxi forum, and my understanding is that there are job opportunity there, people have to strife for a living, you cannot expect spoonfeeding, u can drive taxi with a $100+ income per day, just go take a license, work honestly and work hard on it, everything have it first time, hard time and difficult time, but once this is past, you are a professional of your own careers, it does not mean that being a U or diploma or any other teritiary education make you a professional, my taking is everyone working on his/her work is the best profession of his/her own work.</p>

              <p>certainly i am not jealous, why should i be, a free market allow a free socialism.</p>
              <p>what i am try to say here is that alots of people in singapore are not poor, maybe average, but certainly not poor, however, a lots of them make themselves poor by engaging thing that is beyong their mean, some like to gamble, some like to flirt around and drink,,...so end up, you tell the govt or the society that you are poor, need help and look/act pitiful. The most fundamental issue here is not about minimum wages, but rather on financial awareness or financial planing, social well being and certainly good discipline.</p>
              <p>With OT this Uncle can take home $1.8k to 2k net, he have to spend it on his beautiful and young PRC gal, his house, his childrens and his family, so end up he is poor. And that is why i mentioned that most peoples in Singapore make themselve poor thru unethical behavior. Most are matured adult, not kids, you tell them too much, they also said you kaypoh, it is alright to have mistress, drinks, spending lavishly as you like, but ending up saying you are poor, that is too much, these peoples need to do some soul searching.</p>

              <p><br>I think this is a wrong statistic, cleaners can go training at e2i and get an increment, notice those cleaner using equipment to wash floor and plates, they are well trained, and get above $1k per month, plus employer CPF, will be abt $1200k. Even tho this is a median paid, most would had been on the higher end.</p>
              <p>What govt wants is to train singapore to be supervisor or team leader, and the rest be FW, but singaporeans are not forthcoming, most have that fix mindset, refuse to change way of working, and refuse to learn IT way of working. But we cannot blame them, after years of working as operators, spend unwisely, did not care much about childrens ending them growing up less educated or simply cannot afford to paid them monthly or unfilial piety childrens. However, some older workers are not physical strong anymore and some actually have filial piety childrens to take care of them, but they simply want to live a labourer life which is what they like most, I know a few cardboard and cans collectors in joo chiat plying their trade at waterloo street, morning their sons/daughters drive big car sent them there, and evening, send them back, in this way, their life is less boring. So, you have to do a real statistic on the ground, dun depend on data too much, even MP roam the ground ya.</p>

              <p>Hi Eagle,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for pointing that out I was not even aware of this scheme. I think its similar to a minimum wage as far as general direction is concerned except that it only takes effect at age 35 and at 75% effectiveness. Age 45 and above get the full benefit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I'm confused as to why not just go ahead and implement a minimum wage of $1500 across the board age 21 and above?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the intention is good as the gahmen I think wants the younger generation to not take it for granted however I have a feeling companies that exploit cheap labour for profits would simply hire workers below 35 to dodge the system. This would also aggravate Singaporeans with the mindset that its harder to find jobs as you grow older.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The scheme will only apply if you are employed therefore if you are age 35 and above but can't find a job you are not entitled to the scheme.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Ahh.... the gahmen pays the difference so it makes no difference to the companies .... yes that would solve the problem with the additional deterrant for the younger generation to not become lazy.

              <p><br>1 )The minimum wage legislation saw huge opposition from big businesses who threatened to layoff workers but the fact is only their profits will be hurt. The minimum wage set at S$5.84 per hour is not high but the victory shows that it is possible in Hong Kong to win against the big businesses there to bring about greater social equity - something we cannot see in Singapore</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I lifted it off the article itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Do you believe me if I were to say its the role of the government and the unions to set policies to help Singaporeans make a living?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Here's the big picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Michael Chan, chairman of fast-food giant Cafe de Coral - who was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 35th richest man in Hong Kong in 2009 - has said his company might issue a profit warning if the hourly rate proposed by the unions became law. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All Mr Chan cares about is that he is answerable to the board and his shareholders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now what about these guys... again lifted from the article.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Lowest paid jobs in Singapore*<br><br>1. Office cleaner $600 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(My Secondary School Pocket $ also more than him)<br></span>2. Manufacturing labourer and related worker $760<br>3. Kitchen assistant $991<br>4. Plastic product machine operator $994<br>5. Hospital attendant $1,000<br>6. Travel agency and related clerk $1,016<br>7. Waiter $1,080<br>8. Pre-primary education teachers $1,100<br>9. Lorry attendant $1,102<br>10. Pest exterminator $1,106<br>* Based on median starting salary ...data from The New Paper</em></p>
              <p>So tell me.... Is Michael Chan exploiting cheap labour (Costs) to attain higher profits.... so that his board and shareholders is happy and gives him a big fat bonus so he can climb higher in Forbes magazine?</p>
              <p><br>Kind Regards</p>

              <p><br>IF Michael Chan is not doing whatever he can to attain higher profits for the company, then he is not doing his job.</p>
              <p>Lifted from articles which were derived from innocent-looking SURVEY.... My goodness, this is the kind of subjective articles that present itself as the perfect tools for biased people to influence the public's opinions.</p>
              <p>There's always another articles that tells you another story.</p>
              <p>And by the way, your statistics from The New Paper is terribly outdated and incorrect.</p>
              <p>Do you need to look for an updated one? How about applying for the above "lowest paid" jobs in Singapore and unveil the lies for yourself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It looks good enough for foreign workers who don't fall under the minimum wages scheme or have any wages rights.</p>
              <p>Go find out for yourself that the rates are going to be terribly different for Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <div class="post-body entry-content">The government leaders have been telling the people that a minimum wage will cause the jobs to be lost. This is only partly true; largely, it is false.<br><br>A minimum wage is necessary to ensure that the worker earns enough to pay for the cost of living by doing a full day's work. If the wage is below the minimum, the worker has to work longer hours. This will cause other people to be unemployed. For a stable society, we need to have most people, who are able and willing to work, to be able to find a job and earn enough enough to raise a family and be a contributing member of society.<br><br>A decent wage, as opposed to a sub-minimum wage, does not cause the loss of jobs. Wages are only one component of the total cost of production. The other components are cost of property (i.e. rental), government taxes and shareholder profits. If wages are too low, more of the cost goes towards rental and profits. The imbalance, between wages and rental, is one factor leading to the high property prices in Singapore.<br><br>Many of the jobs in a country are in the service sector. They are part of the domestic economy. They have to be done in the country and cannot be lost. Examples are education, health, transport and personal services. A minimum wage to these sectors affect all businesse and will be added to the cost of providing the service. It can be kept low, if the other components, such as rental, taxes and profits, are kept at the fair market levels - and are not inflated due to the failure of the market, e.g. if there is a near monopoly.<br><br>Many global businesses come to Singapore to enjoy the low wages contributed by foreign workers who work in Singapore. The social cost of these foreign workers have not been properly factored - i.e. the overcrowding and the strain on the public services (i.e education, health and transport). If these are properly accounted, the strategy of low wages, i.e. no minimum wage, in creating jobs in Singapore is not compelling.<br><br>I believe that it is time for a minimum wage to be introduced in Singapore and for the market in labour to find its new level. I believe that we are among the few developed economies that do not have a minimum wage.<br><br>Tan Kin Lian</div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><strong>3)</strong> The statistics from the New Paper are taken at face value. I believe it is a common conspiracy theory that the media is sterilised by the government. I don't think I was being bias. You however are being defensive by suggesting that the data from the local paper is wrong. Like I said take it at face value. I believe we both have not the time to do bo liao things such as applying for said jobs just to prove a point in this forum.</div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><strong>4)</strong> Offer declined. As I stand I'll take the data from the New Paper at face value. You may however volunteer your services<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></div>

              <p>the recent news report that sgreans do not want to do manual jobs and prefer pmet jobs and so 80percent if sgreans hired as pmets are totally wrong! i can nem you all the companiesi have worked for and the companies i have visited in sg in my employment life and i can tell you besied managers, up to engineers level a lot are occupied by floot traps and they are everywhere. technicians!. just go to any industrial estastes and if you can go in and see their production floor! all floot traps! up to engineers! as a result there is no place for sgreans in the construction and manufacturing sectors anymore!</p>
