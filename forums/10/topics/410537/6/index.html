              <p>Govment should implement minimum wage AND workfare.</p>
              <p>Minimum wage says " Pay the lowly educated so they can sustain a reasonable standard of living".</p>
              <p>Workfare says" An incentive to keep the old in the workforce, and push employers to make CPF contribution". To the old and uneducated , it's " Meagre income is betta than no income". Eat bread never mind as long as you have a job and pays into CPF.</p>
              <p>Many low income elderlies who are paid in cash/self employed are bypassing CPF contribution. This hole is leaking and it's just another feeble attempt to plug it.</p>
              <p>Minimum wage does not reduce jobs, it increases disposable income for more people. Which in turn helps the economy. A business man cannot sell panties to a poor beggar woman with no money.</p>
              <p>Workfare is only paid TWICE a year. The amount is "UP TO" $800cash per YEAR. ( Not per month).. that is about $66 per month. $2000 goes into CPF ( which is subject to minimum sum, making it UNTOUCHABLE for most low income earner anyway).</p>
              <p>Why the govment don't want to implement Minimum wage ? I guess horrrr... depressed wages in the lower income jobs BENEFITS the middle-higher income workers. Gahmen people are which level ? You know I know lah. .. OK ? Good.</p>
              <p>I am self-serving you see.</p>

              <p>A job scope that includes serving and cleaning tables ? Sure, it's call multi tasking dude, nothing new FYI. You drop the food on one table, then use the empty tray to collect empty cup and bowls from the next table.That's what a lot of waiters/waitresses do anyway.. any better examples ?</p>
              <p>Minimum wage can be hourly or daily or per month. Depends on the type of job requirements and labour needs.</p>
              <p>Labour intensive jobs that's traditionally foreign labour intensive  need not be included in minimum wage law. Eg. Constructions/farmers/domestic helpers.</p>
              <p>The criteria to determine minimum wage is based on cost of living in the country. Cost of basic housing, transportation, food and utilities expenses are same across the board. Doesn't matter if you are a cleaner or a computer technician or teacher or taxi driver.</p>
              <p>FYI minimum wage is not a guideline, much like detering illegal workers, it's meant to deter exploitations and wage depression that increases our poverty population.</p>
              <p>Unlike other first world countries where they practice collective bargaining, Singapore needs a viable protective policy for our low income workers. And this minimum wage is it.</p>

              <p>Hi genie,</p>
              <p>Workfare is a smoke bomb. Check out the CPF website, only households with housing of annual housing value of $<strong>11,000 and below are eligible.</strong> <strong>Based on that value, almost ALL Singaporeans living in HDB flats are disqualified from workfare. </strong>The other condition is the requirement to contribute to CPF and medisave. These low wage workers already do not have enough for living expenses, would they want their employer to contribute CPF? They rather strike a deal with their employer not to contribute CPF to get the full pay. An MP should ask in parliament how many Singaporeans are on workfare..</p>
              <p>Kind Regards</p>

              <p>Hi genie,</p>
              <p><strong>Workfare is a smoke bomb. Check out the CPF website, only households with housing of annual housing value of $11,000 and below are eligible. </strong><strong><strong>Based on that value, almost ALL Singaporeans living in HDB flats are disqualified from workfare</strong>.</strong> The other condition is the requirement to contribute to CPF and medisave. These low wage workers already do not have enough for living expenses, would they want their employer to contribute CPF? They rather strike a deal with their employer not to contribute CPF to get the full pay. An MP should ask in parliament how many Singaporeans are on workfare..</p>

              <p>I see... so you're saying that MM might be earning more than 3 million annually and if that's true than charlize is factually wrong and therefore her question is moot?</p>

              <p>What if charlize were to comment "Can explain why MM earns $3 million <strong>more or less</strong> annually even though he has doesn't really have any official duties?  <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Back to square one, do we did a minimum wage? Dun compare with other countries, just singapore alone, do we really need a minimum wage to run this country wage issue? My take is no, I have alway a free market with a free float on wages.</p>
