              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The unemployment rate for Singapore residents hit 5.9 per cent in June this year, up from 4 per cent a year ago.</p>
              <p>The rise was felt across all occupations and industries, according to the Labour Force Survey carried out in mid-2009 by the Ministry of Manpower’s Research and Statistics Department, which released the key findings on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>For some strange reasons, the Ministry has grouped citizens and PRs together under the “resident” category meaning that the figures for unemployment rate among Singapore citizens remains a mystery.</p>
              <p>According to Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng, there were over 20,000 new citizens and 90,000 PRs last year.</p>
              <p>In total, there are about 530,000 PRs in Singapore. It is not known if the inclusion of PRs in the “resident” category has helped to depress the unemployment figures to make it more “respectable”.</p>
              <p>If PRs are taken out of the equation, the unemployment rate among Singapore citizens may be higher than 5.9 per cent.</p>
              <p>The survey also found that among those in employment, the median income stabilised after rising significantly over the preceding two years.</p>
              <p>It was not revealed the if the income of the high or low income group had risen the most.</p>
              <p>Singapore has the highest income gap among developed countries after Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>While the median wages of ordinary Singaporeans have not increased by much, the cost of living has sky-rocketed in the last few years, particularly that of public housing.</p>
              <p>The price of HDB resale flats hit a record high in June this year, fueled partly by the influx of PRs into the market. An Indonesian PR forked out $653,000 for a 4-room HDB flat in Queenstown when he could have easily afforded a condominium.</p>
              <p>The Manpower Ministry said the employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 remained at the record high of 57.2 per cent reached in 2008.</p>
              <p>This may be attributed to the fact that many Singaporeans have to continue working beyond their retirement age in order to support themselves.</p>
              <p>The government has provided few social welfare benefits for Singaporeans on the ground that it will create a “crutch” mentality.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are encouraged to work for as long as their health permits and to start their families young so that they will have children to take care of them when the grow old.</p>
              <p>For those who are unable to work and have no children or relatives to support them, they are put on “Public Assistance” scheme which pay them a monthly living allowance of $330 a month.</p>
              <p>When asked by PAP MP Dr Lily Neo a few years ago to increase the allowance which is then only $290 a month, Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian retorted:</p>
              <p><em>“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”</em></p>
              <p>Dr Vivian has recently unveiled a $10-million dollars mega Community Integration Fund to make the new citizens feel “welcomed” in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Ministry should consider breaking down the national unemployment rate into three categories: locals, new citizens and PRs to better reflect the situation on the ground.</p>
              <p>Only then will Singaporeans know if PRs and new citizens are indeed “snatching” away their “rice-bowls” as is widely perceived.</p>

              <p>While i think giving 800 per month is excessive for the unemployed, i wouldn't mind seeing it go to the <strong>elderly </strong>(60+) unemployed. They've devoted their youth to Singapore, i don't see what's wrong with letting them indulge in the "crutch" mentality for what remains of their years.</p>

              <p>It was not revealed the if the income of the high or low income group had risen the most.</p>
              <p>Singapore has the highest income gap among developed countries after Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>While the median wages of ordinary Singaporeans have not increased by much, the cost of living has sky-rocketed in the last few years, particularly that of public housing.</p>
              <p>The price of HDB resale flats hit a record high in June this year, fueled partly by the influx of PRs into the market. An Indonesian PR forked out $653,000 for a 4-room HDB flat in Queenstown when he could have easily afforded a condominium.</p>
              <p>The Manpower Ministry said the employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 remained at the record high of 57.2 per cent reached in 2008.</p>
              <p>This may be attributed to the fact that many Singaporeans have to continue working beyond their retirement age in order to support themselves.</p>
              <p>The government has provided few social welfare benefits for Singaporeans on the ground that it will create a “crutch” mentality.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are encouraged to work for as long as their health permits and to start their families young so that they will have children to take care of them when the grow old.</p>
              <p>For those who are unable to work and have no children or relatives to support them, they are put on “Public Assistance” scheme which pay them a monthly living allowance of $330 a month.</p>
              <p>When asked by PAP MP Dr Lily Neo a few years ago to increase the allowance which is then only $290 a month, Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian retorted:</p>
              <p><em>“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”</em></p>
              <p>Dr Vivian has recently unveiled a $10-million dollars mega Community Integration Fund to make the new citizens feel “welcomed” in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Ministry should consider breaking down the national unemployment rate into three categories: locals, new citizens and PRs to better reflect the situation on the ground.</p>
              <p>Only then will Singaporeans know if PRs and new citizens are indeed “snatching” away their “rice-bowls” as is widely perceived.</p>

              <p>1. what is really meant by '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintaining high job rate'</span> ? Can it also mean lower employment rate for older workers but still classifiable as high rate?</p>
              <p>2. what is really meant by '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">overall decline in employment</span>'? Assuming older workers employment rate is unchanged , based on what is reported that overall went down, can i deduce that employment rate for younger workers went down?</p>
              <p>IF SO, would it be clearer a news heading if  the ST Journalists phrase it as "</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Breaking News: </em></span></span><br>The Democratic Party of Japan has won a landslide victory in the country’s general elections, ousting the Liberal Democrats which had ruled the country for most of the last 54 years. (</strong><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/30/japan-election.html"><strong><span style="color: #990000;">CBC News</span></strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></p>
              <p>When the question was last asked in parliament as to the rejection rate for applications for the Public Assistance  scheme, the answer was that about 50 per cent  were  rejected.</p>
              <p>As there are only about 3,000 Singaporeans receiving public assistance, the question that needs to be raised is whether the criteria to qualify is too strict?</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports’ (MCYS) <a href="http://www.mcys.gov.sg/web/serv_E_PA.html"><span style="color: #990000;">website </span></a>says:</p>
              <p>“If you are unable to work owing to old age, illness or disability and have no means of subsistence and have little or no family support you may seek help under the PA scheme”.</p>
              <p>Thus in Madam Chung’s case, where she appears to be able to “work”, she may not qualify for PA.</p>
              <p>The tens of thousands of elderly toilet cleaners, food court cleaners, used drink cans and used cardboard collectors, etc, I believe may also fail to meet the PA scheme criteria.</p>
              <p>If the elderly lady earns more than $12 a day, she may be actually better of being a rubbish scavenger, as recepients of the PA scheme are not allowed to work.</p>
              <p>I also understand that if you own a flat, or have working children, it is also very difficult to qualify. Would you prefer to stay in your own home – instead of having to sell it and use up the proceeds, in order to get $360?</p>
              <p>Medifund I understand cannot be used for polyclinic out-patient treatment. I spoke to a 81 year-old toilet cleaner who earns just $600 a month, and she told me that her biggest worry is that everytime she goes to a polyclinic about every three months, she has to pay about $98 for her three-months medicine and consultation.</p>
              <p>As I understand it, the criteria to qualify for Medifund is confidential. As far as I am able to find out, the patient and family members must all have nothing in their Medisave, very little in their bank accounts, hardly any extra monthly disposable income, in order to get Medifund subsidy. Also, getting Medifund does not mean free, it may just be a subsidy for part of the medical cost.</p>
              <p>I also understand that about 20 per cent of Medifund applications are rejected.</p>
              <p>Members of parliament should know what are the rejection rates for Public Assistance, Financial Assistance and Medifund in their own constituencies. I suggest that these statistics be made public.</p>
              <p>Compare Singapore to any developed country, and the number of only 3,000 public assistance recipients against the total citizen population, may be the lowest “welfare per capita” in the world.</p>
              <p>To get the whole picture, perhaps what we need are the statistics. For example, according to the latest Department of Statistics data available, the bottom ten percentile of employed households have a  per capita monthly income of only $360.  What about unemployed households and retiree households?  How many of the 116,600 unemployed as at June 2009 have zero or very low per capita income?</p>
              <p>How many Singaporeans  earn less than $800?  The latest data say that 292,800 residents (Singaporeans and PRs) earn less than $1,200,  and about  126,800 work part-time for a median income of $600 which has remain unchanged from 1999 to 2008.</p>
