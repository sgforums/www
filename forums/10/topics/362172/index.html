              <p>Chris Johnston<br>May 19, 2007<br><br>MELBOURNE'S new underclass lives in substandard housing with often high rents. Increasingly, its members are the victims of violent, racial crime. By night, they work in menial jobs where exploitation by employers is common.<br><br>By day, they study. The number of Indian students in Melbourne has tripled in the past three years. It is believed there are now up to 18,000 at universities, colleges and TAFEs.<br><br>After Chinese students, they are the state's fastest-growing demographic.<br><br>Last year, international education was worth $2.9 billion to Victoria.<br><br>Many do well. They live well, have good part-time jobs, feel safe. They succeed. But many struggle.<br><br>"Students in trouble will not speak up," said Gautam Gupta, from the Federation of Indian Students of Australia, an ad hoc, unfunded body.<br><br>"We have had people suffering badly at work but they won't even tell us where they work. That is our culture.<br><br>"We don't discuss things unless we are very proud of them. And many students are ashamed."<br><br>The Age reported two weeks ago that the City of Melbourne, the State Government and Melbourne University were grappling with the explosion in city apartment blocks populated almost entirely by South-East Asian students, mostly from China.<br><br>Research warned that the $300-a-week apartments were fostering racial segregation and the students were cut off from the wider Melbourne community.<br><br>There is no such concern for Indian students, however. Most attend cheaper tertiary institutions and live out of the city, in the cheaper western and northern suburbs. They "suffer in silence", according to Mr Gupta.<br><br>A community meeting is being held today at Victoria University in St Albans to begin to sort through the issues.<br><br>It will be attended by the Multicultural Commission of Victoria and Victoria Police.<br><br>Superintendent Inghard Ehrenberg, of Victoria Police's community and cultural division, said there had been a rise in racially motivated crimes — including assaults and thefts with weapons — on Indian students, particularly at western and northern suburban railway stations. Many went unreported.<br><br>"We need to ensure they aren't targets just because they look different and speak different," he said. "They are a vulnerable group."<br><br>In one attack, two Indian students were each hit on the head with a bat at Tottenham station in March. The youths who attacked them taunted them racially.<br><br>"This happens a lot now," said Mr Gupta. "People say 'bin Laden' or something like that. They think we look odd.<br><br>"They see our brown skin and maybe some headgear, a turban, and they say things. What can we do? That is why we stick together."<br><br>Housing is the biggest problem many Indian students face. Several real estate agents in the western suburbs now refuse to rent properties to them.<br><br>"Agents tell me that they have closed their books on Indian students because they say, through their experiences, they can have 10 or 12 people living in the place," said Ok Chang, a student housing officer at Victoria University.<br><br>Rebecca Harrison, from the Tenants Union of Victoria, said there was a perception among property managers that Indian students were more likely to damage property or leave a mess.<br><br>"It's a strange, discriminatory prejudice," she said. "But this is what they are generally faced with."<br><br>The tenants' union campaigned last year against a company called Victoria Student Housing, run by former heads of the failed Melbourne University Student Union, Benjamin Cass and Darren Ray. The tenants' union claimed they were renting inferior properties to Indian students. The company is no longer operating.<br><br>Ms Chang said unlicensed boarding houses in central Footscray — in which a run-down house is partitioned into separate bed-sits, costing about $120 per week to rent — were now popular with Indian students. Rip-offs involving bond payments and evictions are common.<br><br>International students can work only 20 hours a week under the terms of their visa. Many Indian students in Melbourne are night cleaners in city office blocks, emptying rubbish, wiping kitchenettes, vacuuming floors and scrubbing toilets.<br><br>The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union estimates that up to 1000 Indians and Sri Lankans, plus some South Americans, are CBD night cleaners.<br><br>The union's assistant secretary, Jess Walsh, calls them an "invisible army".<br><br>"They go in when everyone else has left," she said.<br><br>"No one would know they even exist. Invisibility in the community is a very real issue here."<br><br>The students are paid reasonably well — about $18 an hour — but the union claims cleaning firms are increasingly exploiting staff by making them do the same amount of work in reduced hours, and not paying overtime.<br><br>Vijay, 22, from Mumbai, has cleaned office blocks for the entire four years of his studies. He would not give his full name, nor where he studied, for fear of jeopardising his degree, his visa or his job.<br><br>Vijay said it was common for him to be told to clean 60 kitchenettes in four hours, or an entire toilet block in 15 minutes.<br><br>"They don't give a damn about the person," he said. "For $18 an hour, you cannot have the blood of a cleaner."<br><br>Aditi Gupta, 20, from Ambala in the north of India, has worked from 11pm until 7am at a McDonald's in Collingwood for eight months.<br><br>She studies hospitality management at Carrick Institute of Education in Bourke Street.<br><br>Aditi has had her troubles, at work and at college. It was hard to fit in. But she said, in a way, it was good.<br><br>"Living in Melbourne," she said, "has taught me how to struggle through life."</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>Melbourne (IANS): Australian Foreign
                  Minister Stephen Smith has termed the attacks on Indian students a
                  "problem" and assured that the government would do everything to
                  prevent further assaults. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>"We have a particular current problem with Indian students," Smith told Network Ten. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>"We're doing everything that we can,
                  both with the Indian community in Australia and India itself ... but
                  also working very closely with the relevant state authorities," he
                  said. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>Smith's comments came amid outrage and
                  concern in India at the wave of allegedly racist attacks on Indian
                  students, the Sydney Herald reported. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>The issue has been discussed at the
                  diplomatic level with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh speaking to
                  his Australian counterpart Kevin Rudd and urging him to take all
                  possible steps to ensure the security of Indians in Australia. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>The Australian government has assured
                  India that a slew of steps, including increased patrolling and setting
                  up of a hotline, have been taken to ensure the safety of over 80,000
                  Indian students in the country. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>Smith said Australia was trying to bring the attackers to justice and ensure a safe environment for all international students. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>"Australia generally has low crime and violence rates," he said. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>Four attacks have taken place on Indian
                  students. While a petrol bomb was thrown at an Indian student in Sydney
                  last Sunday, three attacks took place in Melbourne. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span>One student, Sravan Kumar Theerthala,
                  who was attacked in Melbourne last Sunday with a screwdriver, is

                  Baljinder Singh was stabbed outside a railway station. He is
                  recuperating at home. A third student, Sourabh Sharma, was viciously
                  assaulted in a train May 9. </span></p>

              <p><span>An
              Indian community leader has claimed that over 20 incidents of "curry
              bashing" have taken place in Sydney in the past 30 days, and said there
              is an urgent need to address the issue as most students are reluctant
              to lodge any complaint out of fear. </span></p>
              <p><span>Yadu Singh, the
              head of a committee that has been formed to address concerns about the
              welfare of Indian students in Australia, also revealed that more than
              100 attacks on Indian youths were feared to have taken place in the
              last 12 months. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singh, a
              Sydney-based cardiologist, said the attacks had grown over the last
              four years and there was an urgent need to address the issue. "There is
              a term 'curry bashing' for such incidents... and it is used as 'lets go
              curry bashing'." </span></p>
              <p><span>"They (the
              attacks) are not random at all, the people are targeting them. They
              know these students are easy targets," Singh said. </span></p>

              the Deputy Commissioner of Victoria Police, Kieran Walshe spoke exclusively to
              TIMES NOW and attempted to ward off the blame put on them by branding Indians as<span style="color: #ff0000;"> soft targets. </span><br><br> He said, "Indian students are very quiet natured and
              very passive sort of people. They study very hard, do their work and they tend
              to travel late at night because of work or because of study. They carry valuable
              items like iPod, mobile phones and laptops etc. Generally they travel on their
              own and that makes them vulnerable to people whoa re out there to take the
              opportunistic stance of stealing property."
              <br><br> However, in a bid to
              provide assurance that steps are being taken to ensure safety of people in the
              city, he went on to add, "We have a special task force in the suburbs, which has
              done some great work in identifying the offenders. There has been a rise in this
              type of crime and has been a concern for Victoria for a period of time. But we
              have taken a lot of action for this. This kind of behaviour is disgusting and it
              does not matter which race, age etc one belongs to, every person should have the
              right to do their work without being harrassed."

Doctors tending to him are not very optimistic about his chances of recovery. <br>An organisation of Indian students in Australia has claimed that miscreants broke into the houses of four students, who faced an apparent racist attack and completely emptied the apartments. <br><br>Federation of Indian Students Association (FISA) said that the four students, who are in hospital have nothing left in their houses, adding all Indian students were feeling unsafe. <br>Other Articles by  Mineguruji <br>Lahore blast: 30 dead and still counting <br>Wacom launches Intuos4 digital pen <br>SC says divorce can not be granted hearing one side <br>Supreme Court grants bail to Dr Binayak Sen <br>Obama congratulates Dr Singh, invites to Washington DC <br>more &gt;&gt; <br><br><br>The burglaries are being linked to the same group of teenagers, who attacked the four Indian students in Melbourne on weekends. <br><br>Although the police has not confirmed the alleged burglaries but FISA alleged that this was the handiwork of the same racist group, which attacked them. <br><br>In the aftermath of the attacks, Indian government has asked its Australian counterparts to take punitive action and also ensure the safety and security of the students. <br><br>“We will impress upon the Australian authorities that such attacks should not be permitted," foreign minister SM Krisha said in a statement.<br><br>Indian High Commissioner Sujatha Singh also rushed to Melbourne to take stock of the situation emerging after the racist attack. <br><br>The attackers comprising Aussie teenagers had attacked these students over the weekend, which left Kumar seriously injured.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Despite India's prime minister taking to the Aussie PM, they havent even accepted that the attacks were racist, so its unlikely that we can expect anything concrete to be done by the Australians to protect the Indians out there.The Aussie police in an interview tells that Indians must not stay alone or travel alone at night and keep a low profile, not to keep more than 20$ in pocket, not to carry gadgets like laptops, cellphones etc instead of accepting that a crime has been committed and taking steps to curb such incidences in the future.In such a case. a few steps that India could take in case Australians doesn't wake up to the horror:1. Issue travel advisory to Australia warning people of racist attacks and a threat to their lives.2. Sanctions on imports of all Australian products.Australian police officer is to travel to India to brief prospective students on avoiding street violence in Australia - "safety strategy tips" that Robb would give his own daughter if she was going overseas"Well, let a few Aussies get bashed up in India and then we too will send some officials to teach the Australians to avid street violence? Is this what they want?Instead of owing up to the mistake and apologizing, they are supporting racism outrightly. Its disgraceful. They must rather support with all they can and provide security to Indians out there and make sure that such an incident doesn't occur again.</p></div>
