You say the House of Lord decision supports compensation in all aquittals and cases successful on appeal when actually it is just the opposite. You claim the House of Lords, being the premium institution of the land, supported compensation in all such cases by overturning the decision by the Court of Appeal.

It involves the House of Lords' decision <strong>NOT to compensate </strong>someone whose conviction was quashed on appeal:<br><br>"The House of Lords upheld the Secretary of StateÂ’s right <strong>to deny compensation </strong>under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the ex gratia scheme to Mullen, whose conviction for conspiracy to cause explosions had been quashed by the Court of Appeal..."<br><br>Lord Steyn in the House of Lords decided that it should NOT be entirely a decision of the courts to decide whether to determine compensation, ie. The Secretary of State has the right to decide NOT to compensate:<br><br>"Lord Steyn was clear that the legal system has the monopoly on the decision whether someone is guilty of a crime for the purposes of inflicting legal punishment. <strong>But he could see no need to maintain this monopoly for the purposes of determining whether a person should be compensated following a successful appeal</strong>. He accepted (and believed that the signatories to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Seventh Protocol had also intended) that <strong>decisions by appeal courts to quash convictions could be reassessed by politicians </strong>to see whether those convictions had been quashed for reasons that would appear to the general public as Â‘technicalÂ’ rather than indicating that the appellant was actually innocent of the crime."<br><br>In a criminal case, the prosecution attempts to prove a defendant guilty. Failure to find guilt does not mean the defendant is innocent. All it means is that the evidence is not sufficient to find the defendant guilty. The court has not found him guilty is <strong>NOT THE SAME </strong>as the court finding him innocent. To link compensation exclusively to proof of innocence would mean the claimant will not be able to claim compensation, because the legal system fails to prove that he is innocent.<br><br>Lord Schiemann in the Court of Appeal decision had actually supported the claim for compensation by saying it is impossible to prove innocence through the legal system:<br><br>"In the Court of Appeal, Lord Schiemann had argued that proof of innocence could not be a prerequisite to compensation, as the UK legal system, along with many others, has no procedure whereby proof of innocence, either at trial, or on appeal, can be determined."<br>In other words, he is arguing for a more liberal view towards compensation, ie. the failure to establish guilt rather than the need to prove innocence.<br><br>This was denied by the House of Lords. Lord Steyn pointed out there are rare instances where innocence can be proven by the courts, such as a third party admitting to a murder. But these are very rare instances, as the authors of the article pointed out:<br><br>" But such cases are comparatively rare. <strong>This interpretation leaves no enforceable right to compensation in cases where the new facts merely throw doubt upon the factual accuracy of the conviction, or even in cases where the circumstances of the appeal clearly indicate innocence but the Home Secretary wishes to rely on evidence or allegations that are not in the public domain</strong>."<br><br>The second Law Lord in the case also believes there is <strong>NO automatic right to compensation</strong> in such cases, unless there was no fair trial or due process of law:<br><br>"<strong>Lord Bingham, like Lord Steyn, is NOT CONVINCED that a successful appeal re-establishes a presumption of innocence that entitles Mullen to claim compensation</strong>. For Lord Bingham, a quashed conviction could only ground such an entitlement where it goes to the Â‘meritsÂ’ of the conviction...Â‘meritsÂ’ here does not refer only to matters that show defendants to be innocent, or even matters that raise reasonable doubts as to their guilt, but include irregularities that amount to a denial of their right to a fair trial, which includes breaches of rules going to the fairness of the proceedings."<br><br>The third law lord, Lord Scott, thinks that in practice the positions of the two other law lords make little difference.<br><br>The authors make scholarly remarks about the merits and weaknesses of each law lord's arguments, but the point is, as the law stands in the UK, an acquittal or successful appeal does not automatically mean compensation, In fact, following the first law lord in this case, Lord Steyn's argument, those instances would be very rare indeed.<br><br></div>

I think recently there have been changes such that Masters Graduates can stay for one year to try and find a job. But I have to say that chances of you securing a job will be difficult at best.<br><br>The problem is that under EC and UK law, a employer who wants to emply a non-EEA national will have to show, inter alia, that 1)There is a genuine vacancy and 2) no EEA national can do the job. What that entails is, AFAIK, basically, the employer has to advertise the position for a certain period and try to justify why they decided to choose you instead. The result is that no employer will bother. That is the hurdle that most people will fall at. If you are a fresh graduate and you are not exceptional, I think it would be very difficult fro employers to justify hiring you instead of an EEA national.<br><br>While it is true that commonwealth nationals have an advantage, that addvantage is, imo, very very tenuous. Basically, commonwealth nationals are able to apply for most civil service positions. However, that is only the case if you have PR (They call it 'Indefinite Leave to Remain'). To get PR, the normal way would be to live and work in the UK for 5 years. To live and Work here, you need a work permit. I have already detailed the difficulties in getting a work permit here.<br><br>Re HSMP, if you are merely a fresh graduate with no working experience,  then you have very very little chance of qualifying, unless you have an MBA from an approved Unviersity.<br><br>In short, do not come here thinking that you can get a job after you graduate. It is not impossible but unless you can get very good grades, I would advise you to have a backup plan.<br><br>Re what I do and where I stay, I will go no further than say that I am doing my degree in the UK.<br><br></div>
