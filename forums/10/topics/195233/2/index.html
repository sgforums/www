Persons who have grounds for an action for unlawful arrest or malicious prosecution have a remedy in the civil courts against the person or authority responsible.

"There may be exceptional circumstances that justify compensation in cases outside these categories. In particular, facts may emerge at trial or on appeal within time, that completely exonerate the accused person. I am prepared, in principle, to pay compensation to people who have spent a period in custody or have been imprisoned in cases such as this. <strong>I will not, however, be prepared to pay compensation simply because at the trial or an appeal the prosecution was unable to sustain the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the specific charge that was brought</strong>."<br><br>Don't simply accept the words of some libertarians in the ThinkCentre website claiming to be a lawyer.

The thread is about barristers doing criminal cases. What I meant was that criminal law does not pay well compared to other branches of law.

The threadstarter is arguing for compensation for persons found innocent in criminal trials and ways to reduce costs in criminal trials. The former is not provided for in common law jurisdictions unless the defendant can prove negligence on the part of the police and prosecuting authorities. The only way to provide compensation in these cases would be from the taxpayer. <strong>As usual, Atobe and the like advocate compensation without a clue as to where the money will come from.</strong> </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">It is already bad enough when the Public Prosecutor accuses a Citizen and cannot prove his guilt as a Defendant, and bring a Citizen's reputation into question and under intense public scrutiny, with the resulting adverse publicity.<br><br>Should the plight of the Citizen be made worse by also imposing a financial burden for the high costs of a trial caused by a false accusation from the Law Enforcers ?<br><br>If you are a Doctor - as you have claimed to be - we can probably forgive your handicap in not being able to grasp the obvious <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>clue</strong></span> about available Public Finance to compensate Singaporeans in such cases.<br><br>Is the Singapore Government so poor as to be unable to have a Justice Compensation Fund ?<br><br>This Fund can serve as a useful benchmark to gauge the performance of the Judiciary System, as the depletion of this fund will clearly show that - either the standard of Law Enforcing has been due to flippant and baseless accusations and charges, resulting in high incidence of acquttal; or that the Law Enforcers are not as professional as they are made out to be in their preliminary investigative work and prosecution preparation.<br></span><br><blockquote><br>As for the latter, defence costs in criminal prosecution relate to mainly the costs of his own defence lawyers. To reduce the legal costs for the defendant, we would have to lower the fee of criminal lawyers, which as I have said, are probably cheaper than the highly-paid corporate lawyers. If we force the fees of criminal lawyers down (by bringing in cheaper FT or other means), we will force more talented lawyers to go into corporate law or civil litigation instead.</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">As a self-proclaimed Doctor, are you being a realistist or an alarmist ?<br><br>Fortunately, there are other Professionals who have higher morals and are not as money driven as reflected in your postings.<br><br>Some of the best Criminal Lawyer was the late David Marshall, and he has represented some of the accused Singaporeans who can hardly afford his services under normal circumstances; and yet this Gentleman Lawyer is none the worse in his modesty, lifestyle nor standard of living.</span><br><br></div>
