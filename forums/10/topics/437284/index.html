              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A senior staff member of Singapore's largest newspaper admits there's "significant pressure" on its editors to follow the government line, according to a <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AjSU2LzCzX46Dy2b4G70FLvnKeN_;_ylu=X3oDMTFpNGh2cjBkBG1pdANCbG9nIFBvc3QgQm9keQRwb3MDMQRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nQm9keUFzc2VtYmx5;_ylg=X3oDMTMyN2ViYjAyBGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDZWIyYWRhNzgtNzlhNS0zYzYzLWFiMTItYWQ2ZTRmZDc4OGRjBHBzdGNhdANzaW5nYXBvcmUEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdlBHRlc3QD;_ylv=0/SIG=12951jblp/EXP=1316178795/**http%3A//wikileaks.org/cable/2009/01/09SINGAPORE61.html">newly-released WikiLeaks documen</a>t.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">As a result, reporters within the paper are "increasingly frustrated" with the restrictions on what they can report and often seek overseas postings where restrictions are fewer.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The document, which appears to be written minutes taken in 2009 at the Singapore Embassy, highlighted the private views of two Straits Times journalists and a then-journalism student.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Chua Chin Hon, who is currently the paper's US bureau chief, was quoted as saying that reporters have to be careful in their coverage of local news, as Singapore's leaders will "likely come down hard" on anyone who reports negatively about the government or its leadership.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Without naming names, he also recounted how several ministers at the time "routinely call editors" to ensure that media coverage of an issue "comes out the way they want it."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Chua also said that ST editors had been vetted to ensure their "pro-government leanings" and that while local reporters are "eager to produce more investigative and critical reporting... they are stifled by editors who have been groomed to tow the line."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In the WikiLeaks cable, Chua pointed out how there is extensive media coverage before the government intends to push out a certain policy, adding that some articles read like "Public Service Announcements".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">He cited how during the 2008 collapse of Lehman brothers, there was a spate of articles writing about the retirees who lost money in the mini-bonds in a sympathetic manner, and this was followed by the government's decision to assist those retirees.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Another reporter, Lynn Lee, who is currently the paper's Indonesian bureau chief, confirmed the restrictions on local media, highlighting the internal editorial debate over the covering of the opposition in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">An example she gave was the conflict over the amount of coverage that the paper would dedicate to opposition icon J.B. Jeyaretnam (JBJ) following his death in September 2008, saying that while editors agreed with reporters' demand for extensive coverage of his funeral, they rejected reporters' suggestions to limit the amount of coverage devoted to eulogies provided by Singapore's leaders.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In the end, the leaders' statements took up a significant portion of the allotted space, Lee said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In addition, Lee revealed that self-censorship was a common practice for reporters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">She said that she would never write about any racially sensitive issues, citing the case of a journalist in Malaysia who was arrested for reprinting a politician's racially charged comments.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In contrast to the limitations imposed on local reports, Chua said that the paper's reporters are more free to write about international events. Chua said he enjoyed a great deal of freedom during his stint as China Bureau Chief.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The leaked cable also contained the views of then-journalism student Chong Zi Liang, who said he could see himself working locally for one or two years before going off somewhere else, because he thought it was too "stifling" to remain in the country.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The document is part of a collection of 251,000 unedited and confidential US diplomatic cables that can be found on the whistle-blowing WikiLeaks website, founded by Julian Assange.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In the latest batch released online, several more can be found about Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">One talks about the <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AoX5F24wYFguN45hldMPWvrnKeN_;_ylu=X3oDMTFpOGpyZm1sBG1pdANCbG9nIFBvc3QgQm9keQRwb3MDMgRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nQm9keUFzc2VtYmx5;_ylg=X3oDMTMyN2ViYjAyBGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDZWIyYWRhNzgtNzlhNS0zYzYzLWFiMTItYWQ2ZTRmZDc4OGRjBHBzdGNhdANzaW5nYXBvcmUEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdlBHRlc3QD;_ylv=0/SIG=12b42k87v/EXP=1316178795/**http%3A//wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html">state of Singapore's opposition</a> in 2004 and another on how the government actively co-opts<a style="color: #005790;" href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AuJUYIT4qGuQVuJjF8syYG_nKeN_;_ylu=X3oDMTFpaGJ0OHNsBG1pdANCbG9nIFBvc3QgQm9keQRwb3MDMwRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nQm9keUFzc2VtYmx5;_ylg=X3oDMTMyN2ViYjAyBGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDZWIyYWRhNzgtNzlhNS0zYzYzLWFiMTItYWQ2ZTRmZDc4OGRjBHBzdGNhdANzaW5nYXBvcmUEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdlBHRlc3QD;_ylv=0/SIG=12al64lbi/EXP=1316178795/**http%3A//wikileaks.org/cable/2005/02/05SINGAPORE312.html"> talented Muslims to become Members of Parliament</a>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Last year, WikiLeaks revealed what key Singapore diplomats thought of neighbouring Asian leaders as well as what former leader Lee Kuan Yew thinks about North Korea.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Former <em>Today </em>chief editor P N Balji, who has spent 35 years in Singapore journalism and is now a media consultant, said the leaks "tell an old story", and there is a need now to study how the old media is trying to meet the challenges of the new media.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"There is enough evidence to show how the old media is forced to come out of its comfort zone and publish stories which broke in the online world. Something we never saw, say five years ago," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"A new relationship is developing between the government and media. The biggest loser, if <em>The Straits Times</em> continues to lose eyeballs, is the government. Then it will be without a pervasive platform to get across its message," he pointed out.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"How this relationship will play out will depend a lot on whether editors can make the big switch to the new normal in Singapore journalism and how the government will respond to such efforts," he added.</p>

              is disunited, dispirited, and incapable of offering a 
              credible alternative to the ruling People's Action Party 
              (PAP).  Along with the internal problems and institutional 
              obstacles that have stunted its development, the opposition 
              has also been consistently outmaneuvered by the PAP's 
              pragmatism, which has made it difficult to develop a coherent 
              ideological critique of its policies.  There are few rewards 
              for joining the opposition and the PAP has successfully 
              co-opted some of its brightest critics.  While the PAP has 
              the ineffective opposition it wants, Singapore's sterile 
              political culture has also robbed it of the risk-taking, 
              creativity and entrepreneurship that the PAP recognizes 
              Singapore will need if it is to continue to thrive.  End 
              Summary and Comment. 
               
              The Few, the Unhappy Few 
              ------------------------ 
               
              <a id="par2" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par2">Â¶</a>2. (C) Singapore's political opposition is disunited, 
              dispirited, and incapable of offering a credible alternative 
              to the ruling People Action Party (PAP), which has utterly 
              dominated the political scene for almost four decades.  Along 
              with a host of minor parties, there are four main opposition 
              parties: the Workers' Party, the Singapore People's Party, 
              the National Solidarity Party, and the Singapore Democratic 
              Party.  In the last general election in 2001, the opposition 
              won 2 seats out of 84 and 25 percent of the popular vote in 
              the districts it contested.  In fact, in most of the 
              multi-member electoral districts, the opposition didn't field 
              any candidates at all.  (Note: There are nine single member 
              districts and 14 multi-member districts.  End Note.)  The 
              opposition parties only contested 29 seats as part of a 
              deliberate strategy of trying not to challenge the PAP's 
              eventual victory.  The logic was that more people would be 
              willing to vote for a select few opposition candidates if 
              they were assured that the PAP would still be in power. 
               
              <a id="par3" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par3">Â¶</a>3. (SBU) Opposition parties are small in size and have 
              limited financial resources.  For example, the Workers' Party 
              has only about 500 members, according to its Chairman Sylvia 
              Lim.  It has no permanent staff and must rely on volunteers, 
              who cover a variety of issues and don't have the depth to 
              specialize.  The party relies on dues (USD 2 per year), small 
              donations, and the sale of its newspaper "The Hammer." 
              Despite its name, the Workers' Party has limited contacts 
              with Singapore's trade unions.  The National Trades Union 
              Congress is closely allied with the PAP.  In fact, the NTUC 
              website actually trumpets the "benefits of symbiotic ties" 
              between the PAP and NTUC.  In December 2002, a union 
              affiliated with the NTUC sacked and expelled a branch 
              chairman because he had taken a leadership position in an 
              opposition party (reftel).  Opposition parties have made 
              little, if any, headway with other social organizations in 
              Singapore.

              <a id="par4" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par4">Â¶</a>4. (C) The biggest challenge to the development of the 
              opposition in Singapore is the PAP's highly successful track 
              record.  It has consistently delivered peace, stability, and 
              rapid economic growth for four decades, while avoiding 
              corruption and mainly avoiding cronyism.  It maintains close 
              contacts with all levels of Singapore society and seeks 
              feedback -- on its terms -- on how government policies are 
              working.  Besides active constituency contacts by MPs and 
              other politicians, the PAP and the government also rely on a 
              very extensive grassroots intelligence network which provides 
              "very complete, analytical and frank assessments of the 
              public's thinking about government policies," according to a 
              senior ethnic Malay leader.  Even without the checks that a 
              vibrant press or opposition would provide, the PAP has also 
              been able to avoid the pitfalls of corruption, which would 
              tarnish its reputation.  Furthermore, in a small city state 
              susceptible to external shocks and surrounded by much larger 
              neighbors, few people are willing to trade the able and 
              experienced hands of the PAP for the untested opposition. 
               
              <a id="par5" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par5">Â¶</a>5. (C) Given its bleak prospects, what makes someone join the 
              opposition?  Singapore People's Party MP Chiam See Tong 
              observed that most members join because they have been hurt 
              by some PAP policy.  Examples include people dissatisfied 
              with the compensation awarded them for land expropriated by 
              the government or those who have been forced to pay 
              government fines.  (Comment: The PAP is sometimes derisively 
              said to stand for "Pay and Pay."  End Comment.)  Others, such 
              as Sylvia Lim, find something intrinsically wrong with the 
              PAP's domination of the political scene.  Academics and 
              opposition figures note that university students are hardly 
              bastions of idealism or critical views, though.  Most 
              students are focused on launching their careers rather than 
              on political protest.  The opposition doesn't seek power and 
              doesn't consider itself a credible alternative to the PAP. 
              Its goal is to serve as a modest check on the PAP's power, to 
              prevent corruption. 
               
              The Silent Treatment 
              -------------------- 
               
              <a id="par6" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par6">Â¶</a>6. (C) Limited coverage by the mass media, which carefully 
              hews to the government line, frustrates opposition figures. 
              The press occasionally runs an article noting opposition 
              criticism of a government policy or an angry letter to the 
              editor, but these are few and far between.  (Comment: The 
              docile press even draws the scorn of some members of the 
              elite.  One senior MFA official reportedly threatened to 
              demote any official he found reading the Straits Times.  End 
              Comment.)  Long time opposition stalwart Joshua Benjamin 
              Jeyaretnam ("JBJ") told us that friends often ask him why he 
              has been so quiet recently.  He tells them he has been 
              active, but the media just doesn't cover it.  Due to this 
              limited media coverage, the Workers' Party sends its 
              volunteers door to door to meet voters and its one MP holds 
              weekly sessions with his constituents. 
               
              Friendly Fire 
              ------------- 
               
              <a id="par7" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par7">Â¶</a>7. (C) While the PAP is extremely disciplined and presents a 
              common front to the outside, the opposition is divided and 
              sometimes feckless.  As one opposition MP noted, they have 
              too many leaders and not enough followers.  Some of the 
              parties have authoritarian streaks and revolve around a 
              single personality, several academics observed.  At the same 
              time, the media is eager to jump on the foibles and missteps 
              of the opposition.  Steve Chia, a young Non-Constituency MP 
              (NMP) from the National Solidarity Party, was publicly 
              embarrassed last December after his wife revealed that he had 
              taken photographs of their maid topless. 
               
              <a id="par8" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par8">Â¶</a>8. (C) The PAP prevails by its pragmatism and ruthless 
              pouncing on misstatements by opposition members by suing them 
              for defamation.  This tactic has forced several figures into 
              bankruptcy and prevented them from running for public office. 
               For example, during the 2001 election, opposition figure Dr. 
              Chee Soon Juan followed then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 
              around at campaign events using a bullhorn to ask him about 
              an alleged $17 billion loan to Indonesia.  The courts 
              subsequently ruled he defamed Goh.  Damages haven't been 
              awarded yet as Chee has drawn out the judicial process -- he 
              missed one hearing scheduled some six months in advance 
              because he reportedly was visiting relatives in Taiwan. 
               
              Ideology?  Not in Singapore 
              --------------------------- 
               
              <a id="par9" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par9">Â¶</a>9. (SBU) A unique aspect of the Singapore political system is 
              the almost complete absence of ideology.  Seemingly 
              controversial issues such as free trade, the death penalty, 
              and military service are not issues here.  Rational 
              pragmatism reigns supreme and the PAP has done a masterful 
              job of adopting any ideas or policies that it thinks will 
              work for Singapore, even if the ideas come from the 
              opposition.  MP Chiam See Tong told us he spent years pushing 
              for smaller class sizes in schools and longer compulsory 
              education, which the PAP eventually adopted without 
              attributing it to Chiam.  This environment has made it 
              difficult for the opposition to launch any sustained 
              critiques of government policy and has created a parallel 
              lack of ideology in the opposition itself. 
               
              Taboo Subjects 
              -------------- 
               
              <a id="par10" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par10">Â¶</a>10. (C) Even though Singaporean society is an amalgam of 
              Chinese, Malay and Indian groups, ethnic and religious 
              cleavages have not been used to foment political activity. 
              The PAP has worked hard to prevent this possibility from 
              becoming a reality.  Citing race riots in Singapore in the 
              1960's, the PAP has decreed any political discussion of race 
              or religion to be out of bounds, or "OB" in Singapore's 
              political parlance.  For example, in August, PM Lee Hsien 
              Long announced an easing of the requirement for police 
              permits for indoor gatherings, unless they touched on 
              sensitive issues such as race and religion.  The PAP uses 
              government housing policy to discourage the development of 
              minority districts by setting racial quotas for each block of 
              apartments. 
               
              Stacking the Deck 
              ----------------- 
               
              <a id="par11" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par11">Â¶</a>11. (C) The PAP makes full use of the powers of incumbency to 
              hamper the opposition.  In 2001, it called a snap election 
              with only 16 days notice and at the same time announced a new 
              electoral map which had been extensively gerrymandered.  The 
              PAP has also consolidated most single member districts -- the 
              opposition has had some success in the past in knocking off 
              weak individual PAP candidates -- into five- or six-member 
              Group Representative Constituencies (GRCs).  (Note: Parties 
              have to field teams of five or six candidates, which is much 
              more difficult for the opposition.  The PAP justifies the 
              GRCs on the grounds that they promote minority participation 
              in parliament since every GRC slate must include at least one 
              ethnic Malay or Indian.  End Note.)  As noted above, the 
              ruling party also keeps a close hold on the media and uses 
              defamation suits to batter opposition members.  The PAP uses 
              an array of carrots and sticks for the voters.  The PAP has 
              offered subsidized housing upgrades to opposition wards that 
              switched to the PAP and threatened to leave new subway stops 
              in opposition districts closed. 
               
              If You Can't Beat Them ... 
              -------------------------- 
               
              <a id="par12" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par12">Â¶</a>12. (C) The PAP has co-opted some of the government's best 
              and brightest critics, using an array of scholarships, 
              positions and sinecures at its disposal.  For example, 
              Raymond Lim founded the Roundtable, a civic policy discussion 
              group.  The PAP later recruited him to run for parliament in 
              2001 and he is now the Acting Second Minister for Finance and 
              Second Minister of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
               An opposition figure commented that the PAP's successful 
              co-optation strategy has fomented mistrust in the opposition 
              camp by causing them to suspect each other's motives.  The 
              PAP has also used Non-Constituency MPs (NMPs) to bring in 
              fresh views and specialized talent into the parliament. 
              (Note: NMPs are chosen by a special government committee, 
              serve for two and a half years and have restricted voting 
              rights.  End Note.)  The NMPs give representation to various 
              social groups in Singapore and can critique government 
              policies.  They also have the effect of crowding out the 
              elected opposition by taking on some of its legitimate role 
              in the political process. 
               
              Creativity by Fiat 
              ------------------ 
               
              <a id="par13" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par13">Â¶</a>13. (C) Recognition is growing here that Singapore's 
              continued economic competitiveness and prosperity will be 
              hampered by its lack of risk-taking entrepreneurs and 
              creative industries.  At an intellectual level, the PAP 
              recognizes this is a problem.  It is unclear, however, if it 
              will loosen its tight grip on the levers of economic and 
              political control to create a more hospitable environment for 
              creativity.  On the one hand, PM Lee has publicly been 
              exhorting Singaporeans to be more daring and to speak up.  On 
              the other, government officials express their disdain for the 
              "messy" style of democracy in the West or Taiwan.  At the 
              same time, PM Lee has said the government will not subsidize 
              start-up ventures (which have little access to venture 
              capital much less bank financing), while the government 
              investment holding company, Temasek, continues to use its 
              vast financial resources to gobble up major Singaporean 
              companies.  (Note: Temasek is run by Ho Ching, wife of PM 
              Lee.  End Note.) 
               
              Comment 
              ------- 
               
              <a id="par14" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par14">Â¶</a>14. (C) In contrast to the PAP's phalanx of bright ministers 
              and MPs, the opposition lacks dynamic figures adept at 
              working the system or winning over public opinion. 
              Opposition figures appear more interested in bemoaning their 
              fate than planning how to build viable organizations. 
              Furthermore, the opposition makes careless mistakes with the 
              facts and uses tactics that backfire badly.  There are 
              undercurrents of dissatisfaction in Singaporean society -- 
              such as among older workers concerned about job security. 
              However, they haven't reached a critical level beyond the 
              PAP's ability to handle or that the opposition could exploit. 
               
              <a id="par15" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par15">Â¶</a>15. (C) Without a charismatic leader to galvanize the 
              opposition or a sustained economic slump that would shake 
              people's trust in the PAP, the opposition is unlikely to make 
              progress toward becoming a credible alternative.  Entering 
              opposition politics offers few rewards and many possible 
              problems.  One opposition figure compared Singapore to the 
              movie The Matrix -- though everything looks fine on the 
              surface, serious problems lurk beneath.  The PAP has exactly 
              the isolated and ineffective opposition that it wants.  What 
              the PAP fails to grasp, however, is that Singapore's lack of 
              risk-taking and its dearth of creativity and entrepreneurship 
              are in fact the logical results of its sterile political 
              culture.

              is disunited, dispirited, and incapable of offering a 
              credible alternative to the ruling People's Action Party 
              (PAP).  Along with the internal problems and institutional 
              obstacles that have stunted its development, the opposition 
              has also been consistently outmaneuvered by the PAP's 
              pragmatism, which has made it difficult to develop a coherent 
              ideological critique of its policies.  There are few rewards 
              for joining the opposition and the PAP has successfully 
              co-opted some of its brightest critics.  While the PAP has 
              the ineffective opposition it wants, Singapore's sterile 
              political culture has also robbed it of the risk-taking, 
              creativity and entrepreneurship that the PAP recognizes 
              Singapore will need if it is to continue to thrive.  End 
              Summary and Comment. 
               
              The Few, the Unhappy Few 
              ------------------------ 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par2">Â¶</a>2. (C) Singapore's political opposition is disunited, 
              dispirited, and incapable of offering a credible alternative 
              to the ruling People Action Party (PAP), which has utterly 
              dominated the political scene for almost four decades.  Along 
              with a host of minor parties, there are four main opposition 
              parties: the Workers' Party, the Singapore People's Party, 
              the National Solidarity Party, and the Singapore Democratic 
              Party.  In the last general election in 2001, the opposition 
              won 2 seats out of 84 and 25 percent of the popular vote in 
              the districts it contested.  In fact, in most of the 
              multi-member electoral districts, the opposition didn't field 
              any candidates at all.  (Note: There are nine single member 
              districts and 14 multi-member districts.  End Note.)  The 
              opposition parties only contested 29 seats as part of a 
              deliberate strategy of trying not to challenge the PAP's 
              eventual victory.  The logic was that more people would be 
              willing to vote for a select few opposition candidates if 
              they were assured that the PAP would still be in power. 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par3">Â¶</a>3. (SBU) Opposition parties are small in size and have 
              limited financial resources.  For example, the Workers' Party 
              has only about 500 members, according to its Chairman Sylvia 
              Lim.  It has no permanent staff and must rely on volunteers, 
              who cover a variety of issues and don't have the depth to 
              specialize.  The party relies on dues (USD 2 per year), small 
              donations, and the sale of its newspaper "The Hammer." 
              Despite its name, the Workers' Party has limited contacts 
              with Singapore's trade unions.  The National Trades Union 
              Congress is closely allied with the PAP.  In fact, the NTUC 
              website actually trumpets the "benefits of symbiotic ties" 
              between the PAP and NTUC.  In December 2002, a union 
              affiliated with the NTUC sacked and expelled a branch 
              chairman because he had taken a leadership position in an 
              opposition party (reftel).  Opposition parties have made 
              little, if any, headway with other social organizations in 
              Singapore. 
               
              Who Will Take Up the Challenge? 
              ------------------------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par4">Â¶</a>4. (C) The biggest challenge to the development of the 
              opposition in Singapore is the PAP's highly successful track 
              record.  It has consistently delivered peace, stability, and 
              rapid economic growth for four decades, while avoiding 
              corruption and mainly avoiding cronyism.  It maintains close 
              contacts with all levels of Singapore society and seeks 
              feedback -- on its terms -- on how government policies are 
              working.  Besides active constituency contacts by MPs and 
              other politicians, the PAP and the government also rely on a 
              very extensive grassroots intelligence network which provides 
              "very complete, analytical and frank assessments of the 
              public's thinking about government policies," according to a 
              senior ethnic Malay leader.  Even without the checks that a 
              vibrant press or opposition would provide, the PAP has also 
              been able to avoid the pitfalls of corruption, which would 
              tarnish its reputation.  Furthermore, in a small city state 
              susceptible to external shocks and surrounded by much larger 
              neighbors, few people are willing to trade the able and 
              experienced hands of the PAP for the untested opposition. 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par5">Â¶</a>5. (C) Given its bleak prospects, what makes someone join the 
              opposition?  Singapore People's Party MP Chiam See Tong 
              observed that most members join because they have been hurt 
              by some PAP policy.  Examples include people dissatisfied 
              with the compensation awarded them for land expropriated by 
              the government or those who have been forced to pay 
              government fines.  (Comment: The PAP is sometimes derisively 
              said to stand for "Pay and Pay."  End Comment.)  Others, such 
              as Sylvia Lim, find something intrinsically wrong with the 
              PAP's domination of the political scene.  Academics and 
              opposition figures note that university students are hardly 
              bastions of idealism or critical views, though.  Most 
              students are focused on launching their careers rather than 
              on political protest.  The opposition doesn't seek power and 
              doesn't consider itself a credible alternative to the PAP. 
              Its goal is to serve as a modest check on the PAP's power, to 
              prevent corruption. 
               
              The Silent Treatment 
              -------------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par6">Â¶</a>6. (C) Limited coverage by the mass media, which carefully 
              hews to the government line, frustrates opposition figures. 
              The press occasionally runs an article noting opposition 
              criticism of a government policy or an angry letter to the 
              editor, but these are few and far between.  (Comment: The 
              docile press even draws the scorn of some members of the 
              elite.  One senior MFA official reportedly threatened to 
              demote any official he found reading the Straits Times.  End 
              Comment.)  Long time opposition stalwart Joshua Benjamin 
              Jeyaretnam ("JBJ") told us that friends often ask him why he 
              has been so quiet recently.  He tells them he has been 
              active, but the media just doesn't cover it.  Due to this 
              limited media coverage, the Workers' Party sends its 
              volunteers door to door to meet voters and its one MP holds 
              weekly sessions with his constituents. 
               
              Friendly Fire 
              ------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par7">Â¶</a>7. (C) While the PAP is extremely disciplined and presents a 
              common front to the outside, the opposition is divided and 
              sometimes feckless.  As one opposition MP noted, they have 
              too many leaders and not enough followers.  Some of the 
              parties have authoritarian streaks and revolve around a 
              single personality, several academics observed.  At the same 
              time, the media is eager to jump on the foibles and missteps 
              of the opposition.  Steve Chia, a young Non-Constituency MP 
              (NMP) from the National Solidarity Party, was publicly 
              embarrassed last December after his wife revealed that he had 
              taken photographs of their maid topless. 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par8">Â¶</a>8. (C) The PAP prevails by its pragmatism and ruthless 
              pouncing on misstatements by opposition members by suing them 
              for defamation.  This tactic has forced several figures into 
              bankruptcy and prevented them from running for public office. 
               For example, during the 2001 election, opposition figure Dr. 
              Chee Soon Juan followed then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 
              around at campaign events using a bullhorn to ask him about 
              an alleged $17 billion loan to Indonesia.  The courts 
              subsequently ruled he defamed Goh.  Damages haven't been 
              awarded yet as Chee has drawn out the judicial process -- he 
              missed one hearing scheduled some six months in advance 
              because he reportedly was visiting relatives in Taiwan. 
               
              Ideology?  Not in Singapore 
              --------------------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par9">Â¶</a>9. (SBU) A unique aspect of the Singapore political system is 
              the almost complete absence of ideology.  Seemingly 
              controversial issues such as free trade, the death penalty, 
              and military service are not issues here.  Rational 
              pragmatism reigns supreme and the PAP has done a masterful 
              job of adopting any ideas or policies that it thinks will 
              work for Singapore, even if the ideas come from the 
              opposition.  MP Chiam See Tong told us he spent years pushing 
              for smaller class sizes in schools and longer compulsory 
              education, which the PAP eventually adopted without 
              attributing it to Chiam.  This environment has made it 
              difficult for the opposition to launch any sustained 
              critiques of government policy and has created a parallel 
              lack of ideology in the opposition itself. 
               
              Taboo Subjects 
              -------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par10">Â¶</a>10. (C) Even though Singaporean society is an amalgam of 
              Chinese, Malay and Indian groups, ethnic and religious 
              cleavages have not been used to foment political activity. 
              The PAP has worked hard to prevent this possibility from 
              becoming a reality.  Citing race riots in Singapore in the 
              1960's, the PAP has decreed any political discussion of race 
              or religion to be out of bounds, or "OB" in Singapore's 
              political parlance.  For example, in August, PM Lee Hsien 
              Long announced an easing of the requirement for police 
              permits for indoor gatherings, unless they touched on 
              sensitive issues such as race and religion.  The PAP uses 
              government housing policy to discourage the development of 
              minority districts by setting racial quotas for each block of 
              apartments. 
               
              Stacking the Deck 
              ----------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par11">Â¶</a>11. (C) The PAP makes full use of the powers of incumbency to 
              hamper the opposition.  In 2001, it called a snap election 
              with only 16 days notice and at the same time announced a new 
              electoral map which had been extensively gerrymandered.  The 
              PAP has also consolidated most single member districts -- the 
              opposition has had some success in the past in knocking off 
              weak individual PAP candidates -- into five- or six-member 
              Group Representative Constituencies (GRCs).  (Note: Parties 
              have to field teams of five or six candidates, which is much 
              more difficult for the opposition.  The PAP justifies the 
              GRCs on the grounds that they promote minority participation 
              in parliament since every GRC slate must include at least one 
              ethnic Malay or Indian.  End Note.)  As noted above, the 
              ruling party also keeps a close hold on the media and uses 
              defamation suits to batter opposition members.  The PAP uses 
              an array of carrots and sticks for the voters.  The PAP has 
              offered subsidized housing upgrades to opposition wards that 
              switched to the PAP and threatened to leave new subway stops 
              in opposition districts closed. 
               
              If You Can't Beat Them ... 
              -------------------------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par12">Â¶</a>12. (C) The PAP has co-opted some of the government's best 
              and brightest critics, using an array of scholarships, 
              positions and sinecures at its disposal.  For example, 
              Raymond Lim founded the Roundtable, a civic policy discussion 
              group.  The PAP later recruited him to run for parliament in 
              2001 and he is now the Acting Second Minister for Finance and 
              Second Minister of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
               An opposition figure commented that the PAP's successful 
              co-optation strategy has fomented mistrust in the opposition 
              camp by causing them to suspect each other's motives.  The 
              PAP has also used Non-Constituency MPs (NMPs) to bring in 
              fresh views and specialized talent into the parliament. 
              (Note: NMPs are chosen by a special government committee, 
              serve for two and a half years and have restricted voting 
              rights.  End Note.)  The NMPs give representation to various 
              social groups in Singapore and can critique government 
              policies.  They also have the effect of crowding out the 
              elected opposition by taking on some of its legitimate role 
              in the political process. 
               
              Creativity by Fiat 
              ------------------ 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par13">Â¶</a>13. (C) Recognition is growing here that Singapore's 
              continued economic competitiveness and prosperity will be 
              hampered by its lack of risk-taking entrepreneurs and 
              creative industries.  At an intellectual level, the PAP 
              recognizes this is a problem.  It is unclear, however, if it 
              will loosen its tight grip on the levers of economic and 
              political control to create a more hospitable environment for 
              creativity.  On the one hand, PM Lee has publicly been 
              exhorting Singaporeans to be more daring and to speak up.  On 
              the other, government officials express their disdain for the 
              "messy" style of democracy in the West or Taiwan.  At the 
              same time, PM Lee has said the government will not subsidize 
              start-up ventures (which have little access to venture 
              capital much less bank financing), while the government 
              investment holding company, Temasek, continues to use its 
              vast financial resources to gobble up major Singaporean 
              companies.  (Note: Temasek is run by Ho Ching, wife of PM 
              Lee.  End Note.) 
               
              Comment 
              ------- 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par14">Â¶</a>14. (C) In contrast to the PAP's phalanx of bright ministers 
              and MPs, the opposition lacks dynamic figures adept at 
              working the system or winning over public opinion. 
              Opposition figures appear more interested in bemoaning their 
              fate than planning how to build viable organizations. 
              Furthermore, the opposition makes careless mistakes with the 
              facts and uses tactics that backfire badly.  There are 
              undercurrents of dissatisfaction in Singaporean society -- 
              such as among older workers concerned about job security. 
              However, they haven't reached a critical level beyond the 
              PAP's ability to handle or that the opposition could exploit. 
               
              <a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/10/04SINGAPORE3001.html#par15">Â¶</a>15. (C) Without a charismatic leader to galvanize the 
              opposition or a sustained economic slump that would shake 
              people's trust in the PAP, the opposition is unlikely to make 
              progress toward becoming a credible alternative.  Entering 
              opposition politics offers few rewards and many possible 
              problems.  One opposition figure compared Singapore to the 
              movie The Matrix -- though everything looks fine on the 
              surface, serious problems lurk beneath.  The PAP has exactly 
              the isolated and ineffective opposition that it wants.  What 
              the PAP fails to grasp, however, is that Singapore's lack of 
              risk-taking and its dearth of creativity and entrepreneurship 
              are in fact the logical results of its sterile political 
              culture.

He said:<br><br></div>
              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology.<strong>Today’s generation has no culture and averse to taking political risk.</strong> Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future. But I cannot blame the present generations, <strong>because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.</strong><br><br>So the result is that <strong>we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative.</strong> It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business. Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that makes society.”</p>
