              <p>Someone in another forum asked: Why is foreign minister George Yeo sending his grassroot leaders and families to Karimum.</p>
              <p>The answer is very simple: It is probably because PAP now realized its fundamental mistakes in
                  conducting its foreign policies with the neighboring countries like
                  Malaysia and Indonesia which in the past was full of arrogance and holier-than-thous
                  attitude and legalistic approach which always incur the
                  misunderstanding and tit-for-tat response from the neighboring people
                  and their politicians.<br> <br> The confrontational approach in foreign policy was so bad that at one
                  time Mahathir was agitating the Malaysians against MM Lee for every
                  utterance he was making including threatening to cut off the water
                  supply.</p>
              <p>With his own people he can play power and legalistic maneuvring
                  to get his way as always but with bigger fishes he could hardly call the shot.</p>
              <p>Look at how
                  MM Lee had to apologise to Malaysia over remarks made about its
                  crime-infested Johor or China's Suzhou local authority. <br> <br> I have pointed out this flaw in such a foreign policies many times in
                  my past posting in the Feedback Unit as well as even in the personal blog of
                  Minister George Yeo's friend.</p>
              <p>I suggested that the pillar of our
                  foreign policy should be changed to that of people-to-people
                  relationship instead of confrontation and challenging the neighbours.</p>
              <p>The Russians have lost their superpower supremacy all because of one
                  careless mistake - in throwing its weight around the Afganistan regions by engaging in field conflict which got it drawn into a long-drawn out struggles
                  which it could not win.<br> <br> If a kungfu master has the substance he will not throw a single punch or use his kungfu power or move
                  but keep such power as deterrent with unknown hidden potential to win over allies which will give hims the total
                  power to triumph or hold sway over potential enemies.<br> <br> So I won't be surprised that Minister Yeo is now wised up to conduct
                  foreign relations with the neighboring countries based on
                  people-to-people friendship and cultural exchange programs hence his bringing his grassroot people to Karimun.<br> <br> Of course as usual, PAP will never admit such policy errors being too
                  proud and arrogant to receive people's suggestions just like the
                  popularization of Polytechnics and ITEs as the core of our education
                  system in order to promote practical mass knowledge application in
                  every field in later years as strongly suggested by my posting since
                  the early part of 2001.<br> <br> Only now did PAP realise its past academic education system has set
                  back the whole economy for many years and there is a need now to
                  promote broad-based practical education which will be relevant to the
                  economy.</p>
