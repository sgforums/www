              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><em>Singapore's</em><br> <strong>New Culture</strong><br> Emerging: A sub-community of cynical, restive youths who 
                                    engage each other and paying scant interest in what the 
                                    government says. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> Sep 27, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">YEARS 
                                    of top-down government has produced a sub-culture among 
                                    people who interact mostly with each other and pay little 
                                    interest to what the government says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    part of Singapore’s new diverse world, but to the 
                                    ruling party, which is used to getting things its way, they 
                                    are like the proverbial lost flock that has wandered afield.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    sub-community, however, doesn’t see itself as society’s 
                                    outsider, but as part of a new force working with the Internet 
                                    for social and political change.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    relatively small, but its influence extends far beyond its 
                                    numbers, and it is expanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Concerned 
                                    political leaders have been striving — without much 
                                    success — to bring them back to the mainstream by 
                                    gradually relaxing controls on social life and public expression.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">These 
                                    young Singaporeans — restive, sophisticated and cynical 
                                    — feel disenchanted about the current political system 
                                    and of being left out of nation-building decisions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“They 
                                    feel they don’t have a say; the press has no space 
                                    for them, and the government often talks down to them, so 
                                    they work with the only channel available to them — 
                                    the Internet — and among each other,” explained 
                                    a media consultant.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    sub-community meets on the Net, paying little attention 
                                    to the government’s exhortations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">And 
                                    as more unpopular policies come into force, their postings 
                                    attract more people into their fold.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">However, 
                                    it lacks the power to change the system since it doesn’t 
                                    reach the non-English speaking heartland masses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    success of the digital activists lies in their ability to 
                                    draw in — albeit slowly — apathetic professionals 
                                    and students, who now begin to talk the same language.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Over 
                                    time, they have switched off on government statements, and 
                                    don’t care much about Cabinet changes and Parliament 
                                    proceedings — unless these impact on their personal 
                                    lives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    don’t know the names of their constituency Members 
                                    of Parliament or even Cabinet ministers. Instead, they hanker 
                                    after the unreported news about opposition figures and activities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore 
                                    is beginning to look like two distinct communities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                                    is the large mainstream, which relies on the government 
                                    and the traditional media to provide them the news and direction, 
                                    and a small virtual sub-group of unhappy Singaporeans who 
                                    get their information through interaction with each other.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    perception that Singapore’s newspapers are too controlled 
                                    to be credible may have driven more young Singaporeans towards 
                                    the Web.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Other 
                                    democratic countries, too, are experiencing this division 
                                    but less severely than here because of the perception that 
                                    there is too much “government propaganda” in 
                                    the Singapore media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Unlike 
                                    governments that crack down on Internet dissidents or close 
                                    down websites, the PAP government is — as it usually 
                                    does — adopting a middle line.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It’s 
                                    a policy of joining what one cannot beat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Prime 
                                    Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently took steps to “give 
                                    Singaporeans space to let off steam”, including lifting 
                                    a ban on public demonstrations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Our 
                                    old rules are way, way out of date. It means we have to 
                                    change to new rules, liberalise to allow people to participate 
                                    more actively and flexibly,” Lee said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Speakers 
                                    Corner at Hong Lim Park, an ineffective critics’ area 
                                    for speech-making (loudspeakers not allowed), could now 
                                    be used to hold protests. Only race and religion are forbidden.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Since 
                                    Sept 1, it has been the scene of half a dozen small and 
                                    well managed protests, including one organised by Singapore’s 
                                    known bloggers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Participants 
                                    need not apply for a permit from the police, only from the 
                                    National Parks Board, to indicate its non-controlled nature.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    Prime Minister also lifted some restrictions on political 
                                    dissent in cyberspace.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Several 
                                    banned political films have been released; in future such 
                                    films will not be automatically banned but subject to general 
                                    censorship, where the criteria are easier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In addition, 
                                    a ban on political blogging during the nine-day election 
                                    campaign period has been lifted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">These 
                                    signal the ruling People’s Action Party’s intention 
                                    to move into multimedia — including use of weblogs, 
                                    podcasts and vodcasts — to fight its battles and, 
                                    if possible, to win back some of the disenchanted Netizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    survival of the PAP, which has ruled Singapore since independence 
                                    43 years ago, depends on its winning the hearts and minds 
                                    of the post-65 tech-savvy generation, which can’t 
                                    be done with arrests and censorship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore’s 
                                    renowned author Catherine Lim appears doubtful it will truly 
                                    open up the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Such 
                                    a unique development, as close to a political renaissance 
                                    as is possible in Singapore, should have elicited no less 
                                    a response than jubilation from the people,” she commented.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“But 
                                    so far, oddly, there is none. So far, there is no enthusiastic 
                                    welcoming of the winds of change, no eager looking forward 
                                    to a new political future.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Penang-born 
                                    Lim sees it as a shrewd balancing act, both to reassure 
                                    the people and to warn off the critics who stray beyond 
                                    the boundaries set.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Her 
                                    views find ready support in blogosphere. The SS wrote: “This 
                                    ‘lightening up’ is nothing more than throwing 
                                    scraps to the citizenry to nibble upon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“They 
                                    will not change their model of governance, if at all, at 
                                    least until after the grand old man (Minister Mentor Lee 
                                    Kuan Yew) is gone.”</span></p>

                                    said: “The PAP is definitely smarter. Instead of arresting 
                                    bloggers under the Internal Security Act, it plants moles 
                                    in cyberspace to have a voice there.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The

              <p>I beleive the concept of  Social anarchism taking root in singapore.</p>
              <p>ISocial anarchism, socialist anarchism,[1] anarcho-socialism, anarchist socialism[2] or communitarian anarchism,[3](sometimes used interchangeably with libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism[4] or left-anarchism[5] ) is an umbrella term used to differentiate two broad categories of anarchism, this one being the collectivist, with the other being individualist anarchism. Where individualist forms of anarchism emphasize personal autonomy and the rational nature of human beings, social anarchism sees "individual freedom as conceptually connected with social equality and emphasize community and mutual aid."[6] Social anarchism is used to specifically describe anarchist tendencies within anarchism that have an emphasis on the communitarian and cooperative aspects of anarchist theory and practice. Social anarchism includes (but is not limited to) anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, some forms of libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism and social ecology.</p>
