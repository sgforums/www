            <div class='col-md body'>Can Mr. George Yeo explain these big mistakesÂ….<br><br>WeÂ’ve seen Mr. George Yeo demand Mr. Low, Ms. Lim, and Mr. Gomez to explain the simple human mistake of form submission,  and accuse the accountability of the whole workers party.<br><br>So may we request Mr. Yeo also explain these cases:<br><br>1:  ''Rain'' At The Esplanade<br><br>When PAP government talk about the Esplanade, it is often  attributed to Mr. YeoÂ’s good job.  We really thanks Mr. Yeo for this first class project,  but unfortunately, there is also a first class mistake here,  while Mr. Yeo proudly take in all the praise of this 600 millions project,  can he please also take a few minutes to clarify that this is not a mistake under his leadership?<br>http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200211/12002327.html<br>Singapore - Were they singing in the rain at the Esplanade during Sunday's massive downpour? It must be some sort of omen -- a good omen we hope -- as the first Western musical to play at the S$600 million building isSingin' In The Rain, which opens tomorrow, November 13.The leak at the Esplanade - Theatres On The Bay led to water dripping onto the floor of the Concourse, an open area in the center of the building on Sunday. As this state-of-the-art arts center, nicknamed The Durian because of its spiky exterior, had barely opened for a month, the leak made the news here in the media. A press release by The Esplanade said that the building has withstood many severe storms without any problems so far but, that day, the"improperly installed drainage system"failed.The statement yesterday added:"As a new building, latent defects invariably will surface over time with usage."While the authorities at the Esplanade are fixing the leakage problem, the production crew ofSingin' In The Rainhas been busy putting the musical together since Sunday, November 3.Last Thursday, the media was taken on a backstage tour of the production. Over 60 tons of equipment -- including sets, props costumes, audio and lights -- has been transported from Hong Kong where the musical was last staged. Five thousand liters of water will be used for each performance of the show along with 65 wigs and 300 costumes. Rest assured that the water -- a precious commodity in Singapore -- is recycled thanks to a clever stage design that gathers the water"rained"down into tanks below the set and pumped back into the water cylinders.If you're a fan of the 1952 classicSingin' In The Rainmovie, which starred Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, you're most probably going to enjoy this stage production that is closely adapted from the film. This Aussie production ofSingin' In The Rainhas recently finished a sold-out tour in Hong Kong and a 15-month tour of Australia.Ticketing InfoSeason: November 13 - December 8, 2002<br><br>2:  Why Escape from Paradise is Banned in Singapore?<br><br>http://www.escapefromparadise.com/NewFiles/bc.html<br><br>3:  Why Casino, not Disneyland?<br><br>PM praised Mr. Yeo is very capable in dealing with international business negotiation,  much better than WP candidates. So may we ask why Singapore lost the Disneyland project to Hong Kong?  Now we see Hong Kong Disneyland business is booming,  creating thousands of jobs for Hongkongnese. And for Singaporean,  had to accept a substitute  proposal with Casino.  IsnÂ’t the Disneyland plan much less controversial than the casino plan?<br><br></div>
