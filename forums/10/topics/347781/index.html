              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/news2/singaporebusiness.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="200" align="right"><em>Saudi Gazette</em><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Falling
                  profits, a weakened currency and decreased international travel</strong></span> all
                  plagued Singarpore from its largest airline to its telecom company and
                  its sovereign wealth fund.<br><br>The sovereign wealth fund Temasek
                  Holdings, which helped bail out Wall Street icon Merrill Lynch,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> fell 31
                  percent </strong></span>over eight months last year, a minister said Tuesday, according
                  to local radio.</p>
              <p><br>Senior Minister of State for Finance <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lim Hwee Hua told parliament
                  that Temasek’s portfolio of investments fell to $84.7 billion, 31
                  percent down from $185 billion, in the eight months to the end of
                  November.</strong></span><br><br>But Lim said the fall in Temasek’s portfolio value was
                  less than declines in two stock indices, including the MSCI Singapore
                  Index, which she said dropped 44 percent in Singapore dollar terms over
                  the same period, the report said.<br><br>Last August Temasek announced
                  that in the year to March its portfolio rose in value to 185 billion
                  dollars, up 13 percent from 164 billion dollars the previous year.<br><br>GIC,
                  one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, in September said
                  its nominal rate of return over the past 20 years was 7.8 percent in US
                  dollar terms.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It said it managed well over $100 billion in investments.</strong></span><br><br>Singapore
                  Airlines (SIA) said its net profit came in to $225 million, from $590
                  million, on revenue of $4.16 billion, which was down 2.6 percent year
                  on year, the airline said in a statement, Tuesday<br><br>SIA, one of
                  Asia’s major airlines, blamed the decreased earnings on decreasing
                  numbers of international passengers which it said were down 4.2 percent
                  to 4.8 million from the October to December period the year before.<br><br>It also said it was carrying 14 percent less freight during the quarter.<br><br>“Demand for air transportation is expected to remain weak for much of 2009,” SIA warned.<br><br>Last
                  month SIA announced the suspension of some international flights,
                  saying it did not want to fly half-empty planes around the world.
                  Flights to India, Southeast Asia, the United States and Europe were
                  among those affected.<br><br>Southeast Asia’s largest telecom company
                  was also in trouble, reporting a 16 percent fall in third-quarter net
                  profit blaming it on a depreciating currency which weighed heavily on
                  earnings. SingTel said its performance was strong in Singapore and
                  Australia, but some of its regional mobile associates in Indonesia, the
                  Philippines and Pakistan were weaker.<br><br>“The global economic slowdown has started to impact the group,” added the company, which is majority-owned by Temasek Holdings.<br><br>Net
                  profit in the three months to December 31 was 799 million Singapore
                  dollars (532.7 million US), down from 952 million during the same
                  quarter a year earlier, the company said.<br><br>The net profit was better than the $774 million forecast in a poll of analysts by Dow Jones Newswires.<br><br>Operating
                  revenue fell by 3.2 percent to 3.7 billion dollars but would have risen
                  by 14 percent if the Australian dollar - which dropped 23 percent
                  against the Singapore currency - had remained stable, SingTel said. <br><br><a href="http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009021128952"><em>http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009021128952</em></a></p>
