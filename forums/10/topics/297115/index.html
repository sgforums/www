'Those teams did not arrive.'<br><br>Marines have to be prepared to perform those tasks in future conflicts, he said.<br><br>But the right answer is to fund agencies 'that we know are going to be players with this soft power (so) that they could develop sort of an expeditionary mentality and people who are anxious to get overseas and get their hands dirty', Mr Conway said.<br><br>The State Department is seeking funding for a deployable corps of civilian experts.<br><br>But it is the military that has taken the lead in thinking about ways to harness civilian expertise to create security, raising fears in some quarters of a more militarised foreign policy.<br><br>The model is a new Africa Command that the Pentagon is establishing to help strengthen security in a troubled continent.<br><br>It is supposed to have a senior State Department official as its deputy and components from other civilian agencies.<br><br>'The risk is that it may end up being overly military and not enough of the others in part because of money and bodies. State for example is very worried about it for that reason,' said Mr Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).<br><br>The military wants civilian agencies to do more to prevent wars, but is not waiting for them to get their act together, analysts say.<br><br>Instead, it has stepped up thinking and planning for what it calls 'phase zero', military jargon for conflict prevention.<br><br>'I think they've come to the conclusion that insurgencies are really hard to fight. And so it would be better if they could not have the conflict in the first place,' said Mr Robert Perito, an expert at the US Institute of Peace.<br><br>'In conflict prevention, of course, there is very little military component to that. It mostly all political and economic. That's the other thing that is going on,' he said. -- AFP<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/World/STIStory_186367.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/World/STIStory_186367.html</a></div>
