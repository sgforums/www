              <p>It is a good opportunity for Singapore to have two major parties to alternate among themselves to safeguard our democracy and people-centred government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>JBJ should cease his past policy of being to individualistic and welcome all good people with good ideas even the pap ex-members to join the party and if necessary create a program of succession to renew the party. Only when there is such a program and major reform agendas of such nature will the Reform be real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ex-PAP members or top civil servants who have positive or even critical alternative policies or philosophy should join the Reform Party to help in arriving at such a worthwhile goal for change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise under the existing PAP authoritarian rule which is extremely anti-progress and anti-people, we will have no future.</p>

              <p>Do not despair as many people do. Be confident about democracy.</p>
              <p>It is the best form of government. Authoritarian rule we are being compelled to live with is experiencing much difficulty which we can readily see in the way ministers are refusing to accept for failures like Mas Selamat or Shin Corp.</p>
              <p>Authoritarian is unable to sustain itself much longer and people are asking questions why we have so many ministers being protected by the authoritarians without working for the people but only for themselves like a cult.</p>
              <p>Authoritarianism has proven to be a system which on the face looks good but on closer examination is only benefiting the elites and their connections and the rich. It is worse than communism.</p>
              <p>We are still a young democracy. No matter how the authoritarians try to brainwash the people, the simple truth is democracy offers greater choice for all, more options and greater opportunities and more level playing field for the majority.</p>
              <p>We have seen that at the end of 40 plus years of authoritarianism people are suffering from dropping standard of living and are losing their retirements and all the basic services of government.</p>
              <p>It is only through democracy can we have more level playing field, justice and equity and shared prosperity for all. If in democracy, we the citizens remain poor at least we still have choice and do not have to fear all the oppressions and deprivations like losses of our retirements or facing an ever rising cost of living.</p>
              <p>Only through democracy can people stop the self-praises and hypocrisy of a few elites and their connections. Only through democracy can people prevent despotism and protectionism of elites and their connections.</p>
              <p>Citizens must not be confused by the past propaganda of the authoritarians which were purveyed daily in the media to protect interests of people who are benefiting who are now laughing all the way to the banks.</p>
              <p>These elites do not have any feeling of empathy for the people. They are enjoying every opportunity in career and business at the expense of the ordinary citizens.</p>
              <p>Reform Party must understand the major issues and problems faced by the people.</p>
              <p>It will be achieving its purpose if Reform Party attracts all the cross sections of society to support it to further the democracy and not backslide into authoritarians for that will create inequities and chaos.</p>
              <p>I applaud all who will take the first step in openly asking people to support reform for that will surely be the key to bringing about a maturing of our hisitant democracy.</p>
              <p>Now for citizens who are at a cross road because of very persistent past government anti-democracy propaganda, I am asking them to think again. Stand up for your values and not be a victim of all the propaganda. That will be a duty of citizen. You can play a small yet significant part in supporting reform.</p>
              <p>Reform Party can introduce a program to educate the citizens to undo all the past fear about democracy and bring the people to support continuing maturing of our present authoritarian rule in the guise of democracy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To be honest, the opposition parties in singapore are a joke. In the other parties, only Chiam can claim to be a politician of substance. His work done for his ward is clearly a success. The other person i really respect is JBJ. He has my utmost respect for his ideals and his willingness to go all out for what he believed in. People can question his integrity etc but all I see is a man who gave up almost everything (and i believe he is willing to give his life too) to better the lives of Singaporeans. He is not perfect. Sometimes he seems to be nitpicking cos finding faults are afterall easier than doing the right things. But only with people like JBJ and Chiam, can we have quality sparring with the government and ensuring that PAP is kept on their toes. I wish the opposition have more people like them.</p></div>
