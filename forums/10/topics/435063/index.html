              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>After arresting and detaining hundreds of his political opponents in the 1960s and 1970s on the flimsy charge of being ‘communist sympathizers’, PAP supreme leader Lee Kuan Yew now made a shocking U-turn by publicly proclaiming and endorsing the ‘fraternal ties’ between the PAP and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
              <p>In an interview with China’s CCTV, Lee lashed out at Western criticisms of the repressive systems of government in Singapore and China and ‘advised’ the Chinese to ignore them:</p>
              <p><strong>‘If I were the Chinese I would ignore (their criticisms) and carry on with what I have been doing and make progress, maintain peace and stability and discipline and improve the lives of my people,’ </strong>he said.</p>
              <p>Confirming the suspicions of many that he is still in charge of Singapore, Lee added that the West’s criticism of Singapore does not carry weight so long he is around:</p>
              <p><strong>‘I just let the critics say what they like. I do what I know I have to do and I have every day proved to them their criticism does not carry weight, that I am still here, the system is still working and the people are thriving. That’s the answer to them.’</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee then made the shocking statement that the PAP and CCP have ‘comparable cultural backgrounds’ and both countries work on the basis of pragmatism, not dogmatism.</span></p>
              <p>Though the CCP is a communist party, it has more intra-party politics and democracy than the PAP which is controlled by a single man for more than 50 years.</p>
              <p>There are a few competing factions within the CCP such as those from the Communist Youth League and the ‘Princeling’ faction which help to provide a sort of checks and balances on one another.</p>
              <p>The CCP renews its senior leadership every two terms and has no leaders above the age of 70 on its highest decision-making body – the Politburo.</p>
              <p>In China and even within the CCP itself, there is increasing talk on democractization to make the government more accountable and transparent to the people.</p>
              <p>At 88 years of age, Lee Kuan Yew is the world’s oldest living MP. Though he does not hold any official positions in the Cabinet, he still has five full-time and part-time private and personal secretaries working under him from the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>

              <p>Ya. CCP and PAP are the same.  They both suppress our dialects and do not allow it to be taught at schools.  They set it into the law.  They are both aiming to eliminate our original mother tongues and impose <strong>Mandarin</strong> is the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fake</span> </span>imposter mother tongue as our language.</p>
              <p>What is better is that at least in China, there are regional TVs that broadcast in our real mother tongues which you do not need to pay (as they survive on advertisement revenues).  In Singapore, even you have money and want to set up a regional TV, the law says you can't.  One must subscribe to cable TV to watch programmes in our real mother tongues.</p>

              CCP and PAP are very good at media control. They are equally good.
              
              But CCP wont pass their throne to their son.
              
              Only Kim Legacy in North Korea does that.

              <p>Welcome to my second home PRC. Now we have something similiar that admited in public. Singapore is communist. It has been talks about amongst the local and expatriate Singaporean that PAP and Singapore are more communist than CCP. It was only until the last election that we shut the Chinese press up with our vote. The news media now look at Singapore and Singaporean differently and indeed, singing praise for the new democracy Singaporean demostrated. It was a nice feeling reading the many news reports by Chinese press after the GE, NOW!!!!!! LKY say we are also communist......</p>
              <p>Fortunately, this news is not widely reported, otherwise, no face....to speak with the local</p>

              <p>ok , girl,  sorry,  I thought you know mah.</p>
              <p>Just take note, I had made a mistake in the posting above,   I type terbalik the last 2 character:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">kh'ong kh'a kh'iau =</strong> <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">ç©º</strong></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">éª¹</strong></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">ç¿¹</strong></span></p>
              <p>The original meaning is table or chair, got one leg long another leg short,  the table /chair will collapse.   Then the meaning extend to people who don't walk carefully will slip and fall down.   Then finally the meaning extended to mean "<strong>die / dead</strong>".</p>

              <p>Welcome to my second home PRC. Now we have something similiar that admited in public. Singapore is communist. It has been talks about amongst the local and expatriate Singaporean that PAP and Singapore are more communist than CCP. It was only until the last election that we shut the Chinese press up with our vote. The news media now look at Singapore and Singaporean differently and indeed, singing praise for the new democracy Singaporean demostrated. It was a nice feeling reading the many news reports by Chinese press after the GE, NOW!!!!!! LKY say we are also communist......</p>
              <p>Fortunately, this news is not widely reported, otherwise, no face....to speak with the local</p>
