You really cannot expect much from the Government now . They are already reacting to it - the wheels are in motion .<br><br>For those of you not familiar with study of diseases, the epidemiological triad comes into play - environment, host , agent.<br><br>The dengue (agent) epidemic is based on the Aedes Aegypti mosquito vector.  Singapore's high density population and living conditions does not make it easier to control dengue. Dengue can also be imported easily, if you look at how busy Changi Airport,causeway and shipping ports. Environment, host and agents - Singapore has all the essential ingredients for a huge epidemic, not only Dengue (aka Flaviviruses) but also for influenza and SARS.<br><br>You can't shut down the airport,causeway or ports because it affects the economic structure of the country. You can't create a no entry zone around them because Singapore is too small and land is scarce. You can't fog the whole Singapore at all.<br><br>What they can only do is educate the public and hope it that the public listens- that is the cheapest form . The other alternative is to start active sentinel surveillance which is too expensive. Not sure if they use spatial syndromic surveillance. I know that research is going on in that aspect in USA and Australia - tag certain group of symptoms and  track it all out.<br><br>So really , I think effectiveness is majorly based on the grassroots response - whether they want to listen or not . Threatening them with legal repercussions under the 1998 Control of Vectors and Pesticide Act doesn't help at all. The <span style="font-style: italic;">kiasee </span>attitude will kick in as an advantage when everyone finally realises the impact.   The case of SARs is one fine example.<br><br>Dengue and any communicable diseases can only be controlled effectively if  all parties working together - not against each other ( or resentfully silent against the other).  Now is not the time for complaining, it is more the time of working together. Complain later. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
