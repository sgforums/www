              <p>Yes, almost EVERY western-style restaurant here has chicken wings on their appetiser section.</p>
              <p>KFC recently created their spicy hot wings, which is ACTUAL chicken wings (complete with bones). It's easily one of the best I have eaten, the meat is well marinated and the spice has lot of flavors (not just pure spice).</p>
              <p>It's actually very popular now over here.</p>
              <p>As I said, some person doesn't seemed to know stuff, and continue talking rubbish here. There are people who like breast meat, there are those who like chicken wings over here. It's a mixture, not like what that person is saying</p>

              <p>Don't eat chicken wings - Ladies especially!</p>
              <p>This is a true story! I am very concerned about the health of the people out there especially the women!</p>
              <p>A friend of mine recently had a growth in her womb and she underwent an operation to remove the cyst. The cyst removed was filled with a dark coloured blood.</p>
              <p>She thought that she would be recovered after the surgery but she was terribly wrong. A relapse occurred just a few months later. Distressed, she rushed down to her gynecologist for a consultation. During her consultation, her doctor asked her a question that puzzled her. He ask if she was a frequent consumer of chicken wings and she replied yes wondering as to how, he knew of her eating habits.</p>
              <p>You see, the truth is in this modern day and age, chickens are injected with steroids to accelerate their growth so that the needs of this society can be met. This need is none other then the need for food. Chickens that are injected with steroids are usually given the shot at the neck or the wings. Therefore, it is in this places that the highest concentration of steroids exist.</p>
              <p>These steroids have terrifying effects on the body as it accelerates growth. It has an even more dangerous effect in the presence of female hormones, this leads to women being more prone to the growth of a cyst in the womb.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I advise the people out there to watch their diets and to lower their frequency of consuming chicken wings! People who receive this email, please forward it to your friends and loved ones. I am sure no one wants to see him or her suffer!</p>

                              the people out there especially the women!</p>
              <p>A friend of mine recently had a growth in her womb and she
                              underwent an operation to remove the cyst. The cyst removed was
                              filled with a dark coloured blood.</p>
              <p>She thought that she would be recovered after the surgery but
                              she was terribly wrong. A relapse occurred just a few months later.
                              Distressed, she rushed down to her gynecologist for a consultation.
                              During her consultation, her doctor asked her a question that
                              puzzled her. He ask if she was a frequent consumer of chicken wings
                              and she replied yes wondering as to how, he knew of her eating
                              habits.</p>
              <p>You see, the truth is in this modern day and age, chickens are
                              injected with steroids to accelerate their growth so that the needs
                              of this society can be met. This need is none other then the need
                              for food. Chickens that are injected with steroids are usually
                              given the shot at the neck or the wings. Therefore, it is in this
                              places that the highest concentration of steroids exist.</p>
              <p>These steroids have terrifying effects on the body as it
                              accelerates growth. It has an even more dangerous effect in the
                              presence of female hormones, this leads to women being more prone
                              to the growth of a cyst in the womb.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I advise the people out there to watch their diets
                              and to lower their frequency of consuming chicken wings! People who
                              receive this email, please forward it to your friends and loved
                              ones. I am sure no one wants to see him or her suffer!</p>

              <p>As many would have read in the article I posted, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">there are some farms in parts of the world that still practise the use of steroids, but</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">they would put the steroids into the feed.

              <p>Why can't someone like angel7030, who has been caught numerous times for lying, just be brave enough to acknowledge its mistake, and learn how to be a better person? Instead, it chooses to put up lie, after lie, after lie.</p>
              <p>No wonder this stupid forumer supports the PAP, because they are from the same category, a group who makes mistakes and refuse to acknowledge and apologize</p>
              <p>Is this forumer still human?</p>

              <p>KFC recently created their spicy hot wings, which is ACTUAL

              <p><br>There are only 2 possibilities to your case (where you ARE wrong in putting up misleading information on injection to the chickens)</p>
              <p>1) You are lying. Putting up an article that is long exposed as a scam, and then start claiming about visiting chicken farms</p>
              <p>2) You are plain stupid. Stupid for not checking the facts correctly before putting up a scam article.</p>
              <p>If you are not lying, then the obvious answer is that you are (2).</p>
              <p>And now, you start bringing in an art film to give evidence that this exists, never mind that an art film is almost always NEVER about reality anyway.</p>
              <p>It's that simple. Either you are lying, or you are downright stupid for putting up fake articles exposed a long time ago in the internet.</p>

              <p>Don't eat chicken wings - Ladies especially!</p>
              <p>This is a true story! I am very concerned about the health of
              the people out there especially the women!</p>
              <p>A friend of mine recently had a growth in her womb and she
              underwent an operation to remove the cyst. The cyst removed was
              filled with a dark coloured blood.</p>
              <p>She thought that she would be recovered after the surgery but
              she was terribly wrong. A relapse occurred just a few months later.
              Distressed, she rushed down to her gynecologist for a consultation.
              During her consultation, her doctor asked her a question that
              puzzled her. He ask if she was a frequent consumer of chicken wings
              and she replied yes wondering as to how, he knew of her eating
              habits.</p>
              <p>You see, the truth is in this modern day and age, chickens are
              injected with steroids to accelerate their growth so that the needs
              of this society can be met. This need is none other then the need
              for food. Chickens that are injected with steroids are usually
              given the shot at the neck or the wings. Therefore, it is in this
              places that the highest concentration of steroids exist.</p>
              <p>These steroids have terrifying effects on the body as it
              accelerates growth. It has an even more dangerous effect in the
              presence of female hormones, this leads to women being more prone
              to the growth of a cyst in the womb.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I advise the people out there to watch their diets
              and to lower their frequency of consuming chicken wings! People who
              receive this email, please forward it to your friends and loved
              ones. I am sure no one wants to see him or her suffer!</p>

              <p>sista angel, chicken wings is not the only food that is polluting a woman's body.</p>
              <p>The stuffs you put on your SKIN can be harmful to your health too.</p>
              <p>The items in your home are made with toxic materials. You live in an already polluted environment.</p>
              <p>Blood tests shows our babies are pre-polluted.</p>

              <p>eh??chicken wings are bad for health??me eats canned fish.....or seafood from clean clear waters somewhere far away from populace.</p>
              <p>but productivity is based on how much robots and technology each workplace or factory in singapore has!!with each robot working non-stop 24hrs/day 7 day a week.that enables the entire factory to work at that same pace too.i was fortunate to have worked in those factories that are so high tech until u can switch off the lights and they could still be producing thousands of products in less time to finish a meal.and best of all......no one was ever  present in the production line when it made $$$$.</p>
              <p>so far in singapore they lack industries to design amd build this type of special machines. i have worked for years in this type of no nonsense high tech $$$$ making plants .....i do know how and what was used to make the whole system work from start to end....from the conveyor belts that bring in the raw parts thats assembled stage by stage to laser imprinting all by robots with no humans ever touching any product from start to end.......then to next stage for id of all parts to be assembled and quality checks by robots which is 0.5  seconds and to 0.1mm tolerance by lasers......assembling and encapsulation ....further tests on all assembled parts.....stacking into containers neatly by another robot.....further container placement onto a crate with otherfully stacked containers......all these done by robots and extremely fast...24hrs/7 days a week.humans are only there to  turn them on for safety purpose.....i assure all of u this is the way its to be done as i have been in that industries for many years....and from way it looks i might the only one in here in forum who has seen every single software to hardware to enable a factory that werks like better,cheaper and faster.but the salary should be increased as most manpower has been taken over by cheap robots.im only there to do software alterations.</p>

              <p>sista angel, chicken wings is not the only food that is polluting a woman's body.</p>
              <p>The stuffs you put on your SKIN can be harmful to your health too.</p>
              <p>The items in your home are made with toxic materials. You live in an already polluted environment.</p>
              <p>Blood tests shows our babies are pre-polluted.</p>
              <p>Go to your cabinet and read what kind of ingredients are listed on your favourite lotion and cleaning supplies..then do a search on what kind of damage each individual ingredients do to you and the environment.</p>
