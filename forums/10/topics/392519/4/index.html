              <p>looking at the graph of Productivity vs FT only, i am curious to know did anyone raised the concern since 2004 where Productivity has clearly been going downhill till today?</p>
              <p>This trend is about 6 years already. Did Opposition monitored this trend since 2004 at least? Did the gonmin let the people know since that long ago?</p>
              <p>For me, i only know about this productivity decline when they release the news to us and this graph i saw on TR.</p>
              <p>Would it not have been better and more pro-active if they raised the concern a few years ago?</p>
              <p>Can we have the election in june 2010?</p>

              <p>There is  productivity in the last 6 years or more, but you cannot find it in the economy scale,  it had been curbed by low cost foreign labour intake. With it, which company would want to waste time, effort and cost on intiating productivity when you can just lower your cost by getting cheap labour that is nearly 3 to 4 times cheaper than local. Ironically, the opening of gate for the influx of cheap labour during the last few years had make companies here handicapped to innovative, create and be productive.</p>
              <p>As a director, why should i train my staff, why should i redesign my work, why should i spend time and money to streamline my processes??? when all these can be settle by just employing cheap labour pluck from the cheap labour market. And the underlying of productivity is that if you input less, and get more output that is productivity, so bosses pay less and get still get more output....it is productivity, but not recorded.</p>
              <p>The Govt has up to now then realize the impact because, firstly, citizens are migrating out, 2ndly, election is coming and thirdly, they realized that they cannot depend on cheap foreign labour forever.

              <p>u use generator and they still bill you???did u wire seperately???best u get another circuit breaker and wire fridge lights and aircon seperately as the power turn off would be too dangerous.</p>
              <p>u need to seperate the mains by getting licensed people to disconnect mains power of PUB line to yer house.once that is done then u can connect your generator to your circuit breaker power lines.if u have been taught how in school..... then u can do it on yer own although its illegal once they catch u after u have been electrocuted .</p>
              <p>why use candles when u got a generator or solar powered lights!!all my lights are solar powered and wired to my lights and they last till the next morning.just order some solar pwered lamps from ebay.....modify the lights and wiring....u dun need to use candle anymore!</p>

              <p><br>I am not interested in looking intelligent (because I already am, and<span style="color: #0000ff;"> I am confident of what I can do, and what I cannot do</span> (bet you cannot even comprehend this sentence))</p>
              <p>I am interested in meaningful debates. Never mind its sgdiehard, or xtreyier, which sometimes we argue till the cows come home. The point being, this forum is for us to debate, not to fill it with (1) rude remarks (2) stupid remarks (3) lies. 1, 2, 3 are all fulfilled by you.</p>
              <p>If you have nothing to contribute, just shut up. Sometimes, opening one's mouth too much makes one look real stupid (like what you did with the chicken wing article). It only shows how fake you are, that you have not travelled the world, your knowledge is myopic, and you are nothing but just a little insignificant bug living in a make-shift world of pubs and prostitutes.</p>
              <p>you want to believe you are successful, but my profiling of you, is that you are just a little insignificant person in life, who then comes to this forum to spread lies of how successful you are, in the hopes of impressing others (but sadly, making a fool of yourself)</p>
              <p>And by the way, there is no way you can make me look like a fool, because I am way more intelligent, and much more successful than you.</p>
              <p>I suggest you think carefully what exactly you are in life, and what you want to be in the future, rather than wasting your life (and other people's time) in this forum.</p>
              <p>PS: And stop calling others uncle, auntie, sis, bro. no one wants to be associated with a rude, obnoxious failure like you.</p>

              <p>The facts that they only used 1 person it allow the company to capture broader region. Expand more trucks. The driver also command a much higher wages.    </p>

              <p>Trash collector...</p>
              <p>In Singapore 1980 the minimum make up of a trash truck is 3 person. Namely 1 driver, 2 collectors. Today 2010 it is still 3 person of course they are from china.</p>
              <p>In California single houses there is only 1 person Who is the Driver that collect Trash. Reason they managed to attach a fork by the side of the trash Truck and it gets to fork the bin and flipped the trash bin over and pour the Trash into the Truck....</p>
              <p>The facts that they only used 1 person it allow the company to capture broader region. Expand more trucks. The person also command a much higher wages.    </p>
              <p>See the different.....cheaper Faster better continue....singapore way vs US private enterprise.</p>

              <p>It's the same for the mindset of human beings</p>
              <p>When not controlled, a human being tends to find the easiest way out.</p>
              <p>It's so much easier to just replace labour with cheaper labour, and continue doing the SAME thing. Innovation is so much more difficult, coz it requires THINKING.</p>
              <p>That's why I said, our businesses continue to remain non-competitive in the international arena, because innovation has given way to the easiest way out (getting cheap stuff). Where is the quality? While China is making pains to try to improve quality, we are taking the easiest way out, and in doing so, our quality is dropping real fast.</p>
              <p>In the past, Made in Singapore is considered good. Now, I am sure we are compared with Made in Malaysia, or Made in China.</p>
              <p>As I stressed, shut off the liberal policy of foreign imports, force the businesses to think. People like Adam Khoo will start to shut up and be forced to innovation in order for his business to thrive.</p>
