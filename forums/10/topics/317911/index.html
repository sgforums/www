              <p>The editor said, poreans need to welcome talents since your great / grand fudder is also migrant.</p>
              <p>1. Did he in anyway defined the meaning of TALENT? I see many labelled as FT with salaries 2.5k .  Is this talent or is a talent valued at 25K ? Without clear definition I find the article very general and not detail enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  By welcoming immigrants of all types, with or without jobs (dependents), does this not mean dilution of pore's culture?  lets say half the population is new immigrants? no dilution right?</p>
              <p>3.  EP , as I understand, is employment pass for professionals that is market valued from 2.5K  .   The main thing to note about EP is that there is no quota set for this category.  Correct me if I am wrong.  Why is this policy in place? What is the rationale for this policy? Is there any impact on your salary? No? For same skill and experience, is asian paid more than european? So, why ? why no impact ?</p>
              <p>4. The editor gives me the impression that he is writing to encourage us to welcome them but did not define is an EP holder of market value 2.5K a real talent, I can only say what he is saying is agreeable to an extent only as he does not define the meaning of Talent. If so, all earning &gt;=  $2.5k are talents. If so, why is there still a shortage? </p>
              <p>5. Did he define how many is allowed to come in or did he say there is NO LIMIT? Imagine, no limit in a company which, for the same position, for every position keeps inviting new applications for the same position. The better qualified ones keep replacing the incumbent. This is called no limit. Is there a limit? He did not discuss about this situation in the article. thus, again, a pitty.</p>
              <p>6. He quoted from 1 of the available polls in the world to substantiate what he is saying . The poll was about what is in the minds of most people and it is found to be 'Good jobs'. I beg to differ. To me, and many, I am confident it should be 'No need of any Good jobs' as in no need to work. So, to me , what is in the minds of most people is no need to work . Why did he not take this as a poll to illustrate his point? If strike rich, no need a good job. Where a job is still a kind of slogging - taking up most part of your life by the time you die. Thus , in the minds of most people, to me, would be no need to work after striking it rich.  And the article did not define what is meant by a good job. 3 million a year shaking legs? 120k a month constantly put under pressure and stress to perform or be sacked? 1.2million of the same as a private sector CEO who is ACCOUNTABLE for things under his watch? Or as a non-fiction writer shaking leg by the poolside imagining what his boss wants to hear and writes these for personal gains?</p>
              <p>7. Last but not least,  every topic is debatable or arguable. I wonder what makes this writer tick and why he writes what he is writing?  He appears to be speaking from a PROPOSITION perspective. If he can write his views, why is there no other writer who writes another view or perspective? I mean, would there be pluralism in our news in this case? Should news consumers accept 100% what is published as the only perspective to accept? Given that there is only 1 such newspaper? I must say, yes I accept 100%. u no believe of the me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Examples of true talents:</p>
              <p>1. Rare, skilled, intellectuals : Scientists with proven works. Won international prizes.  So many hundred millions in the world are IT workers. Are they rare? Are they real talents ? If so, the world does not lack talents. If a simple qualification entitles one to be a talent, all graduates are talent no matter if they just passed or repeated and passed after a lot help and tution given to them. moreover, studying is just a game of passing an exam. Memorise, regurjitate. 10 year series and get tips and bang on a few topics. some copy.</p>

              <p><br>147th out of ????  but everyday, so many still fork out their hardearned money and pay and pay for it what. imagine, rain or shine, they do this ritual. Surely, these lot are not bothered by the 147th? Surely, they buy and also 'buy' the news? Its like they do not feel good for the whole day if they do not use their eye balls and concentrate on the words written for them to absorb and go into their brains. Go into their brains means they use their brain then can read.</p>
              <p>Surely, these lot do not believe that it is ranked 147th?</p>
              <p>I read the news from a public library. Its free. I read it actually not for da news but for job ads. and happen to come across the article by the schoolarstico bombastico.</p>
              <p>I also like you do not buy the news. Not that I do not like or do not believe in it. Contrary, I must say I like and believe in it. I must say, u know ? I do not buy it because I have to save money for parking and ERP.</p>
