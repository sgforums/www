            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Unlikely to happen here, but Â…<br>P N Balji<br>Editorial Director</strong><br><br>THE thought must have struck every concerned Singaporean, not just the Indian Singaporean: Can the boiling over of years of pent-up emotions, anger and frustration of the ethnic Indian community in Kuala Lumpur happen here?<br>.<br>The instantaneous answer I got from the 10 people I spoke to since that Sunday street march: Very unlikely.<br>.<br>The reasons went something like this: The community is not doing as badly, the firm arm of the law will not allow such a march to take place, the well-off Indian Singaporeans will not fight for their less well-off brothers and, most importantly, Singapore doesn't have a policy similar to Malaysia's bumiputera policy.<br>.<br>But as the conversations went a little deeper, not everyone was convinced that everything is fine with the community. Top of the list is the view that a social and income divide is becoming pronounced and this gap is under-reported because for every failure there is a success to shout about.<br>.<br>Whether it is in the Cabinet or in the very visible professions like law and journalism, the Indian community's achievements cannot be disputed.<br>.<br>Similarly, the entry of high-calibre Indians from outside Singapore into top-end jobs in private banking and hedge funds has turned the attention away from the plight of the less well-off.<br>.<br>Two recent experiences are enough to reveal the palpable sense of impact the entry of these expatriates is bringing about here.<br>.<br>At a reception held recently, I was introduced to a roomful of expat Indians. And, oh boy, was I surprised! There was the macro economist from JP Morgan, another from Morgan Stanley, and yet another from BNP Paribas. But the most memorable introduction was to this entrepreneur who owns four banks in India and has a stake in a sovereign wealth fund-linked company.<br>.<br>They came across as articulate, bright and extremely confident of themselves and what they can bring to the table.<br>.<br>It seems the presence of these high-calibre Indians is being felt in our upmarket shops, restaurants, condos, movie theatres and tourism destinations like Sentosa and the Night Safari, all of which are on a charm offensive to get a slice of their business.<br>.<br>The next example should show the extent of this group's reach.<br>.<br>An Indian Singaporean woman related this incident of how she was pleasantly surprised by the royal attention she got from a salesgirl at Tangs. She understood the reason an hour later, when the salesgirl asked: Are you an expat?<br>.<br>Such stories can unwittingly screen from the public domain the struggle of the one- and two-roomers. Yes, there are similar struggles among the Chinese and the Malays. But what sets the Indian community apart is its inherent divides.<br>.<br>Unlike the Chinese and Malays, the Indians are not bonded by a common language, religion or even a common colour. Of the three, the biggest hindrance in having a good fix of the problems of the less well-off is language. The Malay professionals will tell you how important language is in breaking the ice with the one- and two-roomers in their community.<br>.<br>Language is a leveller. It helps not just to communicate but to also gain the confidence and trust of the people you deal with.<br>.<br>That, plus the fact that two of Singapore's closest neighbours are mainly Muslims, have helped to focus national attention on the Malays. And the progress the community has made is there for all to see.<br>.<br>For the lower segment of the Indian community to get that kind of attention, we need more concerned Indian professionals, both local and expatriate, who can speak the language, understand the undercurrents and have an acute empathy for their plight to come out and articulate openly and responsibly the real problems this section of the community faces.<br>.<br>And, if necessary, roll up their sleeves and come together, like the Association of Muslim Professionals did as a parallel group to Mendaki, 16 years ago.<br>.<br>The 10 Singaporeans are correct. An Indian street march like the one that took place in KL is very unlikely to take place here. It is unnecessary, too.<br>.<br>But that doesn't mean the not-so-well-off in the community don't need more help.<br>.<br>The community, and Singapore as a society, can only benefit with more hands being stretched out to make sure that no one misses the boat of prosperity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>errrmm..'Yes' to which option? I'll answer the division among all the races for now...I think it has to do with people not having common ground upon which to discuss grievances due, once again, to language and the racial discrimination that is passed down from generation to generation. I had an upstairs neighbour who thought that it was fine to teach his daughter to call an indian a 'keling' (and probably other more derogatory words).</div>

My family has experienced first hand, many times, being conned in business by our own people. How to do business and build trust when you can't even adhere to the common goal of building and sustaining a business? The other argument is the difference in languages and practices, as  well as the stereotypes held by some indian communities about other indian communities (like sikhs love anal sex and use ghee as a lubricant OR that tamils beat their wives and drink alot). The ways we get married, to use another example, differs from culture to culture as well.</div>
