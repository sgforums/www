Its about paying bills. Do u noe how expensive izzit to study here? After grad, they gotta pay back the loan every mth. If undergrads earn less than 1k a mth wat are they gonna freaking live on? Mind u the interest rate now is 6.5% per mth. Some parents out of pity or to help out their kids try to give them a sum of 'pocket money' to offset their loan but of course there are others who are rich enough to bum around until they feel like working. Those are the lucky ones. The majority have to work their ass of juz to pay off their loan. Then the issue of getting married and getting a place to live as well. If they dun earn much, how the heck are they going to pay for all these?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reading some of the comments and incorrect thinking... I am not surprised... the younger generation is really having it good...<br><br>recently I heard someone telling his parents that it is their job to take care of grand-children. Some people might ask what is wrong with this statement.. But see if you like your own kids to tell you its you job to make sure his life is easy by taking care of his responsibilities.<br><br>If people think they need to earn 8K - 10K before they move out and be independent, then they failed miserably to manage their finances. I had a friend who got by on 1.3K and she had to pay her own school fees with Infomatics as well as handle her rental, food and spending money. I too rent a room in the past and now a house and I know I can get by on 2-2.5k. Plus I used to pay for my own MBA while renting a whole house on my own.  So I still think people have it too good and never learn to be independent.</div>
