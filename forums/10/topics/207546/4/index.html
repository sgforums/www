Some parents out of pity or to help out their kids try to give them a sum of 'pocket money' to offset their loan but of course there are others who are rich enough to bum around until they feel like working.

Stop complaining about the low pay, everyone starts out like that. Just work hard in the day and chill out with your buddies at night. Life not really that bad la. Its just how u see it.<br><br>Some might say they have to work OT almost everyday, they see it as "No life", but at the end of the month, your pay will be fatter than those who dun work a single hour of OT.

I myself was faced with this situation. Of course I was being sarcastic about it. It seems like everyone likes to slam graduates for "being picky" and "not wanting to get their hands dirty". These same people do not weight the opportunity cost of taking up those jobs and of course throwing your career into a ditch by getting such a low pay.<br><br>When I first graduated, I was faced with the prospect of remaining unemployed or getting a low pay. Of course I rejected the diploma pay as my degree is expensive and I actually have to pay back my parents and also make ends meet. I finally succumb to a low pay and right now, I have problem finding jobs. Interviewers ask me why I chose to work for such low pay and there is just no satisfactory answer. Also, being so cheap, it will be a long time before I am able to even reach my peers' starting pay, which by then, they will no longer be drawing a starting entry level pay.<br><br>So its not always about being picky. Its about pragmatism. If I choose to start with a low pay, how long will it take for me to rise back to a reasonable (not high, mind you, average only) pay?<br><br>Right now I'm stuck wondering how long will I take for my career to take off after accepting such a low pay.</div></blockquote></div>

I have a degree which cost me approx $25k SGD (after govt subsidy). If I earn $1.6k SGD, after CPF that would be $1.28k (approx). After giving to my parents, say $500, I am left with $780. Assume MRT fare $10 per week, I am left with $740.<br><br>What about food? lunch will cost $3 and dinner $5, that would be $160 per month, not counting weekends (eat free with parents). That leaves $580.<br><br>Have not counted in rent, electrical, pub (because living with parents). With $580 to spend on clothes (needed for work) and insurance, what kind of spending power will I have? Since I am in the IT line, I actually need to spend on courses and certifications, $580 won't even get me a basic certification.<br><br>Now convert this $580 SGD into rupees, renminbi or ringgit. See how much more spending power the foreign workers get? And I assume they spend the same as us, which is not exactly true. Many of them are willing to share a room, with 6-7 of them squeezed into a tiny flat, thus saving on their rent. Also, they buy their clothes and other necessities from their home countries (which doesn't amount to much anyway, so it doesn't really count). After 2-3 years, they bring their SGD savings back to their home countries and live a good life.<br><br>Most singaporeans do not have a problem with foreign workers, they do have a bone to pick, however, with foreign talents who come to singapore to do the same jobs as locals.</div></blockquote>Why should the employer care how much you have spent on your education?
