              <p>Having gone through this CCA system myself, I feel that it's a retarded move.

              <p>agree 100%.</p>
              <p>If what they really want to achieve is people who are both street and book smart, time should be dedicated for students to work towards those aspects. Having at least 6 hours cut off per week just for some shit that students have absolutely no interest in is taxing to the student mentally and physically, and might be exhausting to a certain extent. We do understand the rationale behind the CCA system, but they are doing it wrongly, with an impractical and as you suggested, retarded method.</p>

              <p>Read carefully. I didn't say that CCAs are retarded, I said that the idea of making CCAs compulsory is retarded.</p>
              <p>I might not have been very busy outside of school life but how is that wrong? Doesn't a student have the rights to enjoy his childhood and adolescence, spend time on a hobby, spend time with his family, seeking experiences outside of school,etc.</p>
              <p>You might argue that CCAs don't take up so much time that students are completely left without the time to engage in the above activities but if CCAs don't serve their purposes well and on top of it is a torment, then it is more a waste of time than any other actitivities a normal youth can do.</p>

              <p>CCA is fun, only if you are really interested in it.</p>
              <p>i agree with TS that some CCAs, especially the uniform groups, are a complete waste of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't see the point in having wad NCC, NPCC, scouts, Girl Guide etc. at least CCA like St. Johns has practical use. NCC is totally useless. and forcing people who are not interested at all about uniform groups to join these CCAs is plain dumb. it is a waste of their time, and the school's resources, since these students are more likely to play truant during CCA sessions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not as if getting into NCC, NPCC etc will get you into the respective services when guys are doing their NS. and most likely, these ppl would have to relearn most of the stuff when they are actually serving NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after students graduate from their sec sch, it would be quite some time before guys enlist for NS. for JC, 2 yrs, for poly, 3 yrs. 2-3 yrs is more than enough for ppl to forget all they have learnt during their NCC etc days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for girls, they would most likely never use "knowledge" gained from their stint in the cca uniform groups ever again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i want to stress that not all CCAs are a waste of time. popular sports CCAs like bball and soccer are still applicable even after one graduate. the less popular ccas such as floorball and hockey are less relevant after you leave school. (how do you plan to play hockey in public? there's not many facilities and players around)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for clubs and societies, it depends on the nature of the CCA. AVA is practical, i guess.</p>

              <p>Which is why I can safely say that anything which is compulsory sucks. It might be good for you, but simply the fact of it being compulsory puts the activity in a negative light, and causes people to harbor resentment towards it.</p>
              <p>Like yea, national service is good, where boys become men...But who likes NS?</p>
              <p>And CCA would be more fun if it was ECA, and if students were given the liberty of choice to choose what they would like.</p>
              <p>Dammit, we work hard in school, and endure boring lessons, and even after that, most (subjective) of us have to attend trainings in which we have no interest in, and we cannot even be phantom...</p>
              <p>And deathmaster...you're right, its precisely the point that I want to make: uniformed groups (I'm not being biased here simply because I'm in UG) is just plain stupid. It comes as no surprise that students will quit attending trainings from time to time. Pushed in class, pushed even more after class I would say. This is a waste of time for students and future owners of the country, and puts more stress on the already messed-up-enough-emo-teenager.</p>
              <p>So, what is MOE thinking? And grading of CCA through the LEAP programme? What the fuck?</p>

              <p>Thinking back I wish I put more effort into my CCA in secondary
              school instead of feeling all sorry for myself like TS <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"> </p>

              <p>and JC cca was a blast! I could relive JC just for CCA!</p>

              <p>CCA was fun to make friends, keep fit, and learn new things~ And
              since when did some people get the impression that "doctors do not
              use math"? Math is the purest physical science from which physics
              is derived, chemistry is derived from physics and</p>
              <p>biology is derived from chemisty...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At University level all the branches of physical sciences are
              closely inter-linked and you really cannot isolate what you are
              studying into 'chem', 'math' etc..</p>

              <p>I don't think I am learning anything by attending UG trainings other than enduring the temptation to smash my fist into the teacher in charge. Sure I made friends, but at what cost? I would be more than happy if I were allowed to choose a CCA that I have interest in, and would definitely work really hard and put in effort for it.</p>
              <p>Honestly, the prerequisites for university admission is plain crap, trust me when I say medicine does not make use of mathematics etc. of secondary level and above. Unless you are really mentally disadvantaged, I believe every person should know that you shouldn't touch a scapel blade with your bare hands, and wash your hands with soap after being in contact with a patient.Etc, etc, the list goes on. Unless you are working in more specialised brances like a researcher in A.Star, then you obviously must have a good grasp of biology, since you cant expect a person to achieve without even building up the basics.</p>
