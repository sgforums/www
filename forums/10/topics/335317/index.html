              <p class="MsoNormal">What’s the use of having CCAs in school? MOE believes in
                  students getting a holistic and well rounded education, but many like myself
                  think otherwise.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In primary schools, having CCAs after school is fun. I agree.
                  But what about secondary school students who have more than enough workload,
                  not to mention attending CCAs? Another thing about CCA is that a student might
                  not be assigned to a group that he/she does not like. An example would be
                  uniformed groups. Deemed as the “rubbish bin”, students with no talent in other
                  fields are dumped into those groups that neither provide them chances to win
                  competitions (except for those more or less retarded games day), nor give them
                  the chance to grow as a person. Yes yes, physical training…campcraft and the
                  rest for the respective groups. But what the fuck? Can’t physical training be
                  achieved by the NAPFA assessment? Most students would definitely want to excel
                  in the NAPFA just for the sake of “face”, or to show off. If MOE is unable to
                  save all, at least save some. Not every single person is as ambitious or a
                  high-flyer as his/her peers, right?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But, that’s beside the point. What I am trying to say here
                  is that CCA is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. This is especially so when time is of
                  the essence for the young growing adolescents. I can say confidently that at
                  least 95% of students do not take pride in CCA trainings as compared to students
                  elsewhere. However, many students would go for the trainings reluctantly just
                  for the sake of getting nice testimonials, which is indeed important in the
                  context of Singapore’s
                  working world.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This resentment towards CCA is further worsened by the
                  compulsory nature, especially when it is carried out in mainstream schools as
                  points can be deducted from their “O” level scores. It is appears to me
                  personally that this compulsory nature is just to console the higher ups of MOE
                  themselves into thinking that “I did all I could to give the students the best
                  education”. Some even consider it as a violation of personal liberties such as
                  the right of choosing what they want and not want.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If they had really wanted talents to be nurtured, why not
                  make it a non-compulsory thing? In order for a person to excel in a field, I strongly
                  believe that both the heart and body has to be involved. The person has to like
                  what he is doing in order to expect the commitment required to develop his
                  talent and abilities to the fullest.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">All in all, such attempts would be futile. Singapore
                  has a naturally small population and therefore a smaller talent pool. What they
                  are doing right now is as good as wishing an ostrich could fly by forcibly “nurturing”
                  talents.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Kindly share your thoughts and opinions here.</p>

              <p>the purpose of the school is not to teach you 100% the academic stuff. but more of the learn the social stuff, like mix around with people, so when you go out to work, won't be totally lost. or else your social circle will be quite small.</p>
              <p>the academic stuff also help to identify the future scientists, engineers, so it's also sort of useful that way.</p>

              <p>Part of the intent behind CCA program is probably to socialise the students and to occupy their free time, make them busy, so they can't make trouble elsewhere.</p>
              <p>But I do not think that it is correct for schools to monopolise the time of young people from age of 13-16.</p>

              <p>I believe I had made my stand very clear. I am against the idea of CCAs actually being compulsory. Sure, it helps people to get a bigger social circle, but at what cost? It gets even more irritating when we decide that enough is enough, and that actually going for something seemingly boring to a tortourous extent. This is not adding in the fact that not many people actually get what they like, especially so in more renowned schools like RI, HCI, ACSI. Students have to take tests to see if they are even able to excel at the area before being given a chance at doing something they actually like. For the rest, they are dumped mercilessly somewhere else where they are expected to be enthusiastic and active. Ridiculous isn't it?</p>
              <p>Yes, education is there to educate people (duh), to prepare them for the problems and hardships that they would face in life, but how are we going to use logarithms to solve a problem, say a family crisis? Since the employment pre-requisites usually involve that damned sheet of paper (diploma, degree w/e), it is neccessary for us to be educated to obtain a job. This is even more important if we work in a sector that say, involve mathematics and the sciences. Obviously the level of education and proficiency in the subject would reflect on a person's ability and merit and therefore worthiness to be employed for te particular position/job. On the other hand, jobs like cleaning require merely a PSLE or slightly higher level of education, because scientific knowledge and mathematical skills is irrelavant.</p>
              <p>Being a doctor in Singapore does not make use of maths. Neither does it make use of sciences. Even people who I've known in the medicine faculty admits that whatever they had learnt when they were younger were either all forgotten or unused. Such is the side of irrelavance in schools. Education as a person, of character and maturity is definitely important, there is no debate about that.</p>
              <p>And fishbuff1, I have no choice but to "swallow it hook, line and sinker" like a fish since there is nothing I can do about such a major segment of education in Singapore. I am merely a student who is trying to understand the need for CCAs. Thanks.</p>
