              <li>Discrimination and harassment are illegal. </li>
              <li>All Queensland public sector agencies must develop and implement EEO 
              management plans that will enable target groups members to compete for 
              recruitment, selection, promotion and transfer in the agency and within other 
              agencies and pursue careers in the agency and other agencies as effectively as 
              non target group members and eliminate unlawful discrimination by the agency or 
              its employees against target group members with respect to employment. </li>
              <li>Agencies must report to the Public Service Commissioner on progress achieved 
              by their EEO Management Plans. </li>
              <li>Discrimination legislation exposes agencies and government employees to the 
              risk of vicarious liability. This is a legal principle that holds a person or 
              organisation responsible for the wrongful actions of another: If any of a 
              person's workers or agents contravenes the Act in the course of work or while 
              acting as agent, both the person and the worker or agent, as the case may be, 
              are jointly and severally civilly liable for the contravention, and a proceeding 
              under the Act may be taken against either or both. <em><br>(Anti-Discrimination 
              Act 1991, section 133(1))</em> </li>

              <p>Employment equity activities in the Queensland public sector are governed by

              <p>I agree that there is discrimination in Singapore but legislation may not be an answer. How do you know if an employer discriminates based on race/sex/religion ?</p>

              <p>but bottomline; the sporeans in singapore arent accustomed to be aware of their civil and employment rights. usually think for the top management instead of ourselves and in the end, shortchanged ourselves even without realizing it.

              Correct, Singaporeans don't know their rights. We didn't know that by making it mandatory for us to use our CPF money to buy annuity the gahmen is encroaching into our inalienable rights to property. This right is protected against coercion from whatever source - state, church or society, in all 1st world democratic countries.

              <li>Discrimination and harassment are illegal.</li>
              <li>All Queensland public sector agencies must develop and implement EEO management plans that will enable target groups members to compete for recruitment, selection, promotion and transfer in the agency and within other agencies and pursue careers in the agency and other agencies as effectively as non target group members and eliminate unlawful discrimination by the agency or its employees against target group members with respect to employment.</li>
              <li>Agencies must report to the Public Service Commissioner on progress achieved by their EEO Management Plans.</li>
              <li>Discrimination legislation exposes agencies and government employees to the risk of vicarious liability. This is a legal principle that holds a person or organisation responsible for the wrongful actions of another: If any of a person's workers or agents contravenes the Act in the course of work or while acting as agent, both the person and the worker or agent, as the case may be, are jointly and severally civilly liable for the contravention, and a proceeding under the Act may be taken against either or both. <em><br> (Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, section 133(1))</em></li>

              <p>What u are giving is the the bright side, but try to give the dark side too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australia`s  law system is that of the developed world unlike singapore's immature system and is  even more complicated  than singapore</p>
              <p>Things in Aus work similar to what u expereinced in NS. someone has to be the scapegoat and doesnt come down the line like in singapore, it goes up eventually to the employer</p>
              <p>yeah all these sound policies are in place but there is always an equal and opposite  to everything to ensure the golden balance in the grand scheme of things, and when something goes wrong, lawsuits start flying and do u know that in certain industries in aus, if u are sued, the employer and employee have to bear 50%-50% of the amount of money they had to pay for in damages?</p>
              <p>Its also one of the main reason why there is a severe shortage of skilled workers in the food industry eg, chef as this is one of the industries venerable to  problems such as food poisoning ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess in singapore, u are just fined and let off for food poisoning...</p>
              <p>also in Aus , workplace safety is througly checked upoun when an accident or death occurs in the workplace....The employer has a big headache in the event when an accident or death takes place...</p>
              <p> In this aspect working in singapore is kind of better because everything has been predetermined and mandated by the goverment and is tied in to a centralised law system which governs almost everything. Singapore due to the nature of its economy and workforce will not afford to have the system that is found in Aus. The downside to the Singapore law system is that its vague and general in nature and thus can be be made into anything u want it to be...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all governments in the world will try to paint a rosy picture but beneath the closet lies the ugly truth</p>
