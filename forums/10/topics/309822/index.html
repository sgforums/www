              <blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">1-40          We have successfully balanced between economic growth, energy security and environmental sustainability considerations in the past. For instance, through the greater use of efficient combined-cycle generation technology, overall power generation efficiency has increased from 37% to 44% from 2000 to 2007.  In addition, the proportion of electricity generated by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">natural gas</span> in Singapore increased from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">19% to 79%</span> over the same period.  These contributed significantly to the reduction in carbon intensity or CO2 per dollar GDP in 2006, to about 30% below 1990 levels.</span>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A total of 401 cases of the mosquito-borne disease were reported last week in the Southeast Asian city-state, according to Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA). It is the highest weekly level reported this year, breaching the 378 cases in a week that the Health Ministry has set as the level to declare an epidemic. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Other regional nations such as Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia are also battling a surge in dengue cases this year due to warmer weather and rising rainfall, leading some experts to warn that 2007 may be the worst year on record. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A total of 2,868 dengue cases have been reported in Singapore since the beginning of this year, compared to 4,580 cases in the same period in 2005 when the island was hit by its worst dengue outbreak. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The epidemic level indicates that the number of dengue cases reported in the last week were significantly higher than the average weekly number of cases reported in the past five years, according to the Health Ministry. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Associate Professor Leo Yee Sin, clinical director of the Communicable Disease Centre in Singapore, was quoted as saying in the local Straits Times newspaper on Wednesday that the number of dengue cases in Singapore could rise further to a peak in mid-August or September due to changes in the virus strain. </span></p>

              <p>will polution rise if oil refineary and industrires get attacked by terrorists?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now that JI escape still no found! it might be happen!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">INTERPOL, which has issued a worldwide security following the escape of the Islamic terror leader from a Singapore detention centre, said authorities have 'no trail for the moment' on the fugitive who has been on the run for almost four days. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Interpol's executive director of police services, Mr Jean-Michel Louboutin, told The Associated Press that the escaped Mas Selamat Kastari, 47, who headed the Singapore Jemaah Islamiah (JI) militant network, is 'someone who presents a potential physical danger to others, but also a potential danger by organising future bombings'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The international police organisation on Friday put out an 'Orange Notice' for the JI terrorist, who has been linked to Al-Qaeda and a sensational plot to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's Changi airport. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Interpol notice, together with Mas Selamat's photograph and fingerprints, were issued to the group's 186 national member bureaus following a request by Singapore on Thursday, the agency said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'When it comes to escapes, the first hours are crucial,' said Mr Louboutin. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'The state of Singapore has put into operation everything that's needed to be done. It's a small country, so it's easy to cross and leave.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng told Parliament on Thursday that Mas Selamat escaped because of a 'security lapse' at the detention centre. He had been taken from his cell to a visitors room where he was waiting for his family to make a scheduled visit. He escaped after being granted permission to visit the washroom, authorities said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporean authorities have launched a nationwide manhunt for the man they say walks with a limp. Police and military personnel set up a blockade around the detention centre, while security was tightened at land, air and sea entry ports. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Analysts said Mas Selamat, who is 1.6m tall and weighs 63 kg, would try to flee to Indonesia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Sutarman, chief of police of Riau Islands province, which shares a sea border with Singapore, told Indonesia's state-run Antara news agency on Thursday that Singapore 'sent us an urgent notice requesting intensified patrols to prevent the terrorist from entering Indonesia'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He said Mas Selamat 'possesses good knowledge' about entering Indonesia illegally. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Indonesian police chief Sutanto told reporters in Jakarta that his force would help Singapore if the JI militant makes it to Indonesia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'It's our common obligation, as terrorism is a threat to any country,' he said, adding: 'We've taken all important measures,' without elaborating. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Authorities have blamed JI for a string of regional attacks including the 2002 bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, which killed 202 people, mostly tourists. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Security breaches are virtually unheard of in Singapore. Among its security services' biggest successes were foiling alleged plots to bomb the US Embassy, the American Club and government buildings in 2001 - schemes in which Mas Selamat allegedly had a hand. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mas Selamat fled Singapore in December 2001 following an Internal Security Department operation against JI. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was arrested on the Indonesian island of Bintan near Singapore in 2003, reportedly for carrying false identification, and was jailed for 18 months. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was later released but rearrested in Indonesia in January 2006 before being handed over to Singapore, where he was held under the Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without trial. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The 2001 security operation in Singapore led to 15 people being arrested, 13 of whom were suspected JI members who allegedly planned to attack a bus full of Americans. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Sidney Jones, who has extensively studied JI for the International Crisis Group of analysts, said Mas Selamat was a hardliner but now had little power in the group, whose Indonesian leadership now rejects 'Al-Qaeda tactics' targeting foreigners. -- AP, AFP. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A survey of 4,000 students in primary and secondary schools in </span><a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/singapore.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"> showed that some 95 percent of them have experienced bullying at school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">According to Channel NewsAsia report on Tuesday, the majority of the respondents have been bullied verbally such as being teased while more than 2,800 cases of physical bullying like being kicked, hit or pushed were reported.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In primary schools, 46 percent of bullies occurred in canteens and 42 percent in the school field, while in secondary schools, 38 percent of bullying cases happened in classrooms, 35 percent in canteens and 23 percent in toilets, according to the survey.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It also found that students having been bullies felt angry, sad and depressed, which experts said could lead to low self-esteem and a "tendency to enter a criminal career."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unfortunately, a majority of victims and bystanders were found too scared to speak up, which made many teachers unaware of the actual bullying situation, the report said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It quoted the Education Ministry as saying that bullying in schools is regarded as a serious matter in the city state, and the ministry has been taking appropriate disciplinary measures on bullies and carrying out counseling and other preventive actions as well.</span></p>
