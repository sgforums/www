            <div class='col-md body'>Updated from Reuters.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>Singaporean shuts blog after libel threat<br>1 dy 9 hr 56 min ago<br><br>By Geert De Clercq<br><br>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore student said on Monday he has shut down his blog and apologized unreservedly after a government agency threatened to sue for defamation. Chen Jiahao, a 23-year-old graduate student in the United States, told Reuters he closed down his personal Web site after A*STAR, a Singapore government agency focusing on science and research, threatened legal action for what the agency said were untrue and serious accusations.<br><br>International freedom of speech and media advocates criticized the agency's methods.<br><br>Chen said he had removed all material from his site and posted an apology on April 26 after receiving e-mails from the agency's chief. He added that the agency told him last week his apology was insincere and that they wanted a new apology.<br><br>On Sunday he posted the new apology on his "Caustic Soda" blog, saying "I unreservedly apologize to A*STAR, its Chairman Mr. Philip Yeo, and its executive officers for the distress and embarrassment caused to them."<br><br>"They sent me an e-mail with these words," Chen told Reuters on Monday by telephone from the United States, where he studies chemical physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br><br>An A*STAR spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment on the new apology. The agency told Singapore media on Friday it wanted the student to apologize unreservedly by May 8.<br><br>Paris-based Reporters without Borders said the case highlighted the lack of free expression in Singapore, which is among the 20 lowest-scoring countries in the organization's worldwide press freedom index.<br><br>"Chen criticized some of A*Star's policies but there was nothing defamatory in what he wrote," Julien Pain, head of Reporters without Borders' Internet freedom desk, told Reuters.<br><br>A*STAR said in a statement last week that it recognized the value of a diversity of views and welcomed that in all media. "But the particular public blog had statements which went way beyond fair comment." It did not elaborate.<br><br>Bloggers are generally not journalists, but some of the thousands of private online blogs -- short for Web logs -- on the Internet have gained political relevance. The campaign for the May 5 election in Britain saw an explosion of blogs, much like in last year's U.S. presidential election.<br><br>The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists said last week it was alarmed that the threat of defamation lawsuits was being used to inhibit criticism of the government in cyberspace, much as it has in Singapore's traditional media.<br><br>"We are troubled that the government has raised the spectre of costly legal action to chill commentary on the Internet," Executive Director Ann Cooper was quoted on a CPJ Web site as saying.<br><br>Singapore-based politicians as well as international media organizations have paid large amounts of damages in libel cases brought by senior government figures.<br><br>Singapore leaders have defended their use of defamation lawsuits, saying that such actions are necessary to safeguard their reputation.</div>

The rest, I give to the A-level girls at 19 years old.<br><br>'I don't want whining Singapore boys. They are not mature even though they have national service and are over 22 years old when they take up undergraduate studies. They give me so much trouble and waste our precious time,' he said.<br><br>But behind these strong words is a man who clearly has a soft spot for his scholars.<br><br>Despite his busy schedule, including travels abroad 'to chase investment money', he spends a lot of time e-mailing his scholars.<br><br>He banters and jokes with them, and hosts lunches and dinners whenever he is in the vicinity of their overseas universities.<br><br>He says he has a '4D' list.<br><br>But '4D' in this case refers to the group of top A*star scholars who obtain the prefect straight-A scores of 4 in their US university's grade-point average (GPA).<br><br>As of last month, 117 of its BSc scholars have obtained their final examinations grades. About 82 per cent, or 96 scholars, have attained a GPA of 3.8 and above. Thirty-six of the 96 even made it to the A*star Chairman's Honours List for achieving the perfect score.<br><br>'Of my top scholars, 23 are girls and 13 boys. Four of the girls and four of the boys are non-Singaporeans. As can be seen, the Singapore girls outperform the Singapore boys.'<br><br>Mr Yeo also made posters of his '4D list', which he advertised in the newspapers, on the Internet and in various parts of the Biopolis.<br><br>He defended criticism from former government scholars that his minimum requirement of 3.8 GPA for overseas scholars is unduly strict. That score requires them to get combined grades of at least an equal mix of A (4.0) and A minus (3.67).<br><br>He said: 'The scholarship money is from my research institutes. This is not your Ah Kong's money. So you jolly well make sure you study hard and excel.<br><br>'My scholars can do it. Why are you complaining and b itching about 3.8? If you don't like, don't take it!'<br><br>When he is not travelling, he spends part of his time reading his scholars' files. 'I know all their backgrounds. I have spoken to scholars who scored below 3.8. Did I turn them away?<br><br>'You think I am so cruel? Sometimes people get lower scores because something has gone wrong with a few papers. I understand that.<br><br>'But I am not going to lower the standard. How low do you want to go? You think this is limbo rock?'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can understand why the student concerned is angwee.  after reading Mr Yeo's side of the story posted by Tuatau, i can understand some of his rationales too.<br><br>i just want to add a few points.<br><br>the best male scholars have already been taken by the SAF, Police and perhaps even Temasek, GIC, SIA, Shell, OCBC ... in any case, it's silly to compare the best with the best ... they are all talents no doubt be it 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 or 4.0.<br><br>although the concerned male scholars had reservations at the age of 22, they probably made the decision of their lives at the same age as their female counterparts, just after the 'A' levels that is.  at such a young age, it's hard for anyone who has always been cacooned in the school environment to know the real world out there and where he should fit in.  furthermore, no matter how informed a decision is, there will always be uncertainties that can only be realised upon experience.<br><br>furthermore, i wonder how many of the males scholars are overseas scholars and how many of the female scholars are local scholars.  doesn't matter whether you're male or female, if you're local, then probably there's not much else better around.  but if you're in the US, be it guy or gal, then you have a lot more choices.</div>

Then only you will get a better catch of this debate.</blockquote>If we could rely on witness statements, many bloggers who have read Chen's blog didn't think Chen was making any false defamatory statements. From the letter written by Chen to CNA journalist Valerie Tan regarding his alleged defamatory statements, he didn't sound like he made any malicious comment to defame A*STAR either. It sounded more like the blog just contained his opinions about the grade requirement system. However, since the blog has been taken down, it is impossible to verify if the contents were indeed defamatory.<br><br>Anyway, just came across this open letter by Chen Jiahao's friend to Philip Yeo on one of the Singapore blogs. According to the blog site, the open letter was copied to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Straits Times, and TODAY as well. For the sake of interested readers, I'm reproducing it without the author's permission, but it is an open letter, anyway, so I hope he wouldn't mind. Apologies to Ng Yong Kuan if he is reading this.<br><br>-----cover-----<br><br>Dear Mr. Yeo,<br><br>Please find attached an open letter to yourself.<br><br>In this letter, I express my disappointment at A*Star's handling of the Acidflask saga.<br><br>Please regard it as comment and feedback.<br><br>This open letter is carbon-copied to the PMO, Straits Times forum, Today and a small number of online journals I consider to be less reactive about the issue.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>NG Yong Kuan<br><br>-----actual letter-----<br><br>To: Mr. Philip Yeo, Chairman A*Star<br>Date: 5/16/2005 9:30 AM (EDT -0400)<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>In recent weeks, A*Star has threatened legal action against Mr. Chen Jiahao over remarks on his blog that are allegedly defamatory to yourself and A*Star. A result has been obtained: Mr. Chen has apologised and retracted the remarks; but it is the ugliness and ease with which A*Star threatened to sue that is causing much furore on the Internet.<br><br>As A*Star and yourself have not specified the allegedly defamatory remarks in question (upon the legal advice you received), I cannot comment on this aspect of the drama.<br><br>However, I can comment on the manner in which A*Star handled the matter. I personally believe that A*Star and yourself have acted with integrity in performing necessary and important work for the benefit of Singapore. When A*Star discovered the allegedly defamatory material in Mr. Chen blog, it could have tried to convince Mr. Chen that his remarks were untrue and hence correct his blog, or refuted the remarks in a public forum. Either course of action could have scored A*Star a public relations coup by assuring the world of its integrity, performance and human touch.<br><br>Instead, A*Star and yourself as Chairman of A*Star, threatened legal action in order to obtain a retraction and to remove the remarks from the Internet and any other media. This action to limit discourse to A*Star's terms is unsavoury and unbecoming of the public institution A*Star aspires to be.<br><br>Mr. Yeo, this heavy-handed approach may have quickly settled the matter to your satisfaction, but it appears to have bought much bad press and ill-feeling in the local internet community. A*Star has placed itself in a bad light, appearing to be quick to pull out the legal stick to silence criticism. Such an image cannot help A*Star attract research talent who challenge assumptions and question critically. In the bigger picture, you have also reinforced the mentality that is is better to play it safe and hide in the crowd, to be the grey man who takes no action so that he draws no attention to himself. Such a mentality will be a millstone around all our necks as we compete internationally in whatever field we choose.<br><br>Mr. Yeo, you have been quick and firm in upholding the reputation of A*Star, but the conduct of it may hurt Singapore for years. Substance is important, but so is style.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>NG Yong Kuan, Singaporean<br><br>-----end-----<br><br><span class="small">Source: <a href="http://singaporeangle.blogspot.com/2005/05/open-letter-to-mr-philip-yeo.html" rel="nofollow">"From A Singapore Angle"</a> blog</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ng Yong Kuan sure has a point. Philip Yeo could have done better and put his PR machine to good use. Unfortunately, he chose to act in a heavy-handed manner typical of a despot. After all the unpleasantries, I will never trust A*Star anymore. Sadly, I doubt the PM office will take this letter seriously. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
