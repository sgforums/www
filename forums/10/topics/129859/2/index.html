            <div class='col-md body'>This particular incident is only the tip of the iceberg don't you see?<br><br>If this Chua scholar case has been highlighted 39 years ago, and the highly promoted meritocratic assumption that scholars will solve all our problems could perhaps have critically debated in parliament, some of the problems we are currently struggling with could have been avoided.<br><br>The principal assumption of our leaders is our various scholars or madarins are the highly educated elites or scholars and will solve our problems on the sole judgmental belief by our one-man leader of their possession of a piece of paper or academic grades.<br><br>Had there been an thorough debate on meritocracy, Singaporeans could have uncovered such talent or leadership assumption as rubbish and too narrow-minded placing the future of the judgmental fate of one man or a few scholars.<br><br>Many of the current problems were easily traced to this narrow judgmental approach of over-relying on scholars which at the end may be to serve the political agenda or interests of the incumbent party in power.<br><br>If Chua has assumed position of importance without being checked in time now, we may end up having our future decision makers of his like causing future racism conflagration and conflicts.<br><br>Our many scholars are being employed at high costs but as witnessed in the Asian financial crisis and last two recessions, they were helpless and unable to do anything except to wait out the world economic downturn to save our jobs.<br><br>It is clearly proven that our scholars have yet to come up with cohesive national master economic plan aimed at providing coordination and guidance to all including university researches, investments incentivisation and upgrading our economic competitiveness. Look at the 20 problems of autocracy as posted in another thread.<br><br>They have totally failed to solve the problems among others such as bureaucracy, non-implementation of growth triangles and non-implementation of value-adding economic plans .<br><br>Singapore has run up the whole civil service wage costs to three times of what it used to be. Just compare civil service's direct costs with the outsourced costs in recent tenders, and it will be very clear that civil service has been over-blown to sky-high prices and costs beyond imagination. But everything is hush-hush as no figures will be released on such comparisons.<br><br>Everything in terms of salary administration and exclusive remuneration and reward schemes for scholars appeared to be conducted in an irrational manner against established pricniples or industry practice.<br><br>Many of you will probably remember ministers telling the people back in the 1980s that pensionable civil servants were outdated practice and therefore pension schemes for civil servants were abolished and converted to CPF schemes to lower costs and increase competitiveness.<br><br>However, irrationally and within a short time after abolishing this civil service pension scheme, in a 180 degree about-turn a pension scheme out of the blue was introduced to pay ministers at 2/3 of last drawn salaries for life after two terms of office on the ground that this will induce good people to come forward to stand for election and become ministers as if the ministers did not know that they were at the same time trying to GRC to stop potential candidates to stand for election or to serve the country.<br><br>MM Lee still believed in the old theory that scholars and high pays to ministers and senior civil servants will solve all our problems. He went around recently to tell the Malaysian ministers that it is better to pay MPs and Ministers high salaries to avoid corruption.<br><br>The facts speak for themselves that benchmarking the ministers' pays to the highest earning boss-worker category based on some pre-conceived and the about-turn in re-introducing the outdated pension schemes to pay the retired ministers and MPs for life, were major mistakes of his presumptuous leadership.<br><br>Consequently the golden handshakes to the ministers and MPs would be a big burden on the economy as it would be costing national coffer some S$1,000,000,000.00 as posted earlier in relevant thread.<br><br>Assumptions or judgementsl governance is clearly without accountability and devoid of transparent processes. Such a governance has caused Singapore dearly with complete sheet of wool pulled over citizens' very eyes. The decision on casino was also made on one-sided presentation of job creations without giving corresponding job and investment losses due to negative impacts as posted in the relevant thread. This kind of leadership assumption is based on the over-simplistic that "without casino the economy will be worse off".<br><br>No wonder the Nalaysian PM Badawi was quick to rebut MM Lee's presumptuousness that Malaysians don't believe in the crap about high salaries as a means to check or prevent corruption. He said integrity is the most important factor and that is what counts in Malaysia.<br><br>So it is clear that our leaders have totally forgotten such factor or quality as integrity and have told the world that in our system ministers are vulnerable to corruptions.<br><br>Perhaps it is the people having no opinions which is at the end the primary cause of our system. They have unthinkingly allowed our presumptuous leadership leaders to make all kinds of policies or decisions without the rightful checks or accountability to the people.<br><br>No wonder Rmmul's Law says that a government is most likely to murder its own citizens offering the least resistance ...Think about the risk of accepting the cure-all meritocratic assumptions that has already brought us the high costs of the whole government. Can citizens be so easy any more to allow this kind of assumptions without opinions. How to save its future from such assumptions and solve our many problems ..if there is still a future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> (Chen JiaHao corrected to Chua, mistake regretted)</div>

Yes you are right. The UK's system is hardly free for all and imo it works very well in striking a balance btw free speech and protection of an individuals reputation.  SIngapore has long departed from that system.<br><br>2. I would. Because i am human and i tend to be emotional about such things. Luckily for ppl, the law prevents me from suppressing free speech unreasonably simply because i have the money to hire lawyers to fire off letters filled with legal speak.</div>

There is a need for the Public Service Commission to evaluate their scholar selection system. Grades are no longer a good yardstick by which to judge the quality of scholars. People who tend to focus on grades tend to be result-oriented with high IQ and hence are usually not people-oriented with high EQ as well. And as those among us who have had working experience may have noticed, it is usually the people with higher EQ who tend to make better leaders.</div>

I expect the person invovled to state its view openly in a public forum. If the person concerned feels that the blogger is spreading malicious falsehoods, then say why he thinks the allegations are false,  and which allegations he thinks are false. He should then give the Blogger a chance to retract his statements.<br><br>If you read the blogs, it would appear that The person concerned did not reply to the blogger's request for more information on the allegation of defamation; The blogger doesn't know specifically how he has been defamatory.<br><br>And yes, i agree with you that there is nothing wrong with a person taking legal action to seek redress. However, i know that Singapore's defamation laws are cr ap. There is therefore the danger that the blogger would not get what a normal person would call a fair trial.<br><br></div>
