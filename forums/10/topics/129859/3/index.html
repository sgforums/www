As such i expect higher standards from him! Also, i personally feel that a citizen should be able to have an open dialogue about the way his country/country's institutions are run. Some would argue that when a person spends all his time defending himself, he has no time to do his job. That is true, but the leaders of the UK certainly do not spend all their time defending themselves. So why can't we have the same level of openess?<br><br>I really do not have the answer to that.</div>

Freedom of speech is alive and well in the UK. It is not unrestricted of course, but imo it is alive and well.<br><br>I agree with you to a certian extent. But like i said, there has to be a balance.

I expect the person invovled to state its view openly in a public forum. If the person concerned feels that the blogger is spreading malicious falsehoods, then say why he thinks the allegations are false,  and which allegations he thinks are false. He should then give the Blogger a chance to retract his statements.<br><br>If you read the blogs, it would appear that The person concerned did not reply to the blogger's request for more information on the allegation of defamation; The blogger doesn't know specifically how he has been defamatory.<br><br>And yes, i agree with you that there is nothing wrong with a person taking legal action to seek redress. However, i know that Singapore's defamation laws are cr ap. There is therefore the danger that the blogger would not get what a normal person would call a fair trial.<br></div></blockquote>We are talking about an individual's response to another individual's opinion, which is why I cannot see the link towards a general environment of Freedom of Speech.<br><br>It is no different from one forumite calling another forumite names and the latter gets p-issed.
