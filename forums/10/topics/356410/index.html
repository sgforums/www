              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A critical view of MP Ms Irene Ng’s advice</strong></span><br> By Kelvin Teo ⋅ April 18, 2009 <br> <br> SINGAPORE - <span style="color: red;"><strong>I</strong><strong>n an article published
              April 14th in The New Paper, MP Miss Irene Ng exhorted broke
              professionals out there who dreamt of writing a book to transform it
              into a reality.</strong></span> Miss Ng cited the success story of JK
              Rowling, then a single, struggling mother who finished her first novel
              when she was out of a job. The rest, they say is the stuff of legends.<br> <br> Thus, the article’s title says it all:”During hard times, write”. I
              find there is nothing wrong with that advice because I believe in the
              freedom of creative expression. In fact, creative expression shouldn’t
              be limited to writing books alone. One can set up a web publication
              site like this one for instance. Even I write too, but that is for
              hobby purposes rather than a source of income.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>There is no doubt that Miss Ng is trying to give
              her two cents worth in suggesting to Singaporeans a particular way of
              coping with the hard times. Given her background as a writer, I wasn’t
              surprised at her suggestion. While she has genuinely good intentions
              behind her suggestion, I find it lacking in substance.<br> </strong></span> <br> From a pragmatic standpoint, <span style="color: red;"><strong>a
              jobless professional would prefer to work in temporary positions for
              the short-term as opposed to writing a book. If the latter’s long-term
              goal is to land another permanent job, working in temporary positions
              would make more sense</strong></span>. A prospective employee who has proven
              his analytical and management skills in addition to an ability to
              integrate into a team in the temporary positions he has held would be
              more attractive in the eyes of an employer than someone who merely
              spent his days of unemployment writing a book. The employer would be
              more confident of the former who has demonstrated transferable skills
              in his temporary positions.<br> <br> The obvious advantage of working in temporary positions is that the employee is at least guaranteed a source of income. <span style="color: red;"><strong>The
              writer does not have any source of income whilst working on his
              manuscripts. His income will only come in after his published works hit
              the market. And for that to happen, he has to find a publisher in the
              first place. Another barrier to overcome is the public’s reception to
              the book, i.e. whether the book can sell.</strong></span><br> <br> What Miss Ng had also left out was elaborate details regarding
              publishing practices which may be informative to any budding writers
              out there. Any written work initially begins with the conceptualization
              phase. This may involve the author alone, or in certain cases, the
              editors at the publishers’ end might play a part too. The next stage
              would be the writing phase. This part can be very intensive and
              time-consuming, as the writers are required to research for relevant
              information and write their manuscripts at the same time.<br> <br> What many budding writers take for granted is the role of the editors
              during the authoring phase. Good editors are are able to come up with
              positive suggestions on how to better improve the manuscript so that
              the final written work will appeal to the general audience. Of course,
              there are editors who go on an overkill, chopping and changing large
              chunks of a writer’s work until the whole piece becomes unfamiliar to
              the latter. Most of the time, this will not go down well among the
              writers especially if the modified piece is a huge deviation away from
              the latter’s original contribution. Needless to say, the good editors
              are the ones who are able to exercise a fine balance between modifying
              the writer’s work and preserving the original contribution. It’s an
              editorial art to modify a piece of written work to appeal to the
              audience whilst preserving the original contribution by the writer. The
              role of an editor is under-estimated, but the latter can make a
              difference between the success or failure of a book.<br> <br> It is a common publishing practice for writers to be issued what is
              known as “false deadlines” by their publishers. The “false deadline” is
              usually on an earlier date before the actual deadline. The main worry
              about “false dealines” is that writers have less time to write or
              correct the manuscripts. Less allocated time to work on the manuscripts
              will generally have negative effects on their quality. Thus, the onus
              is on the writers to negotiate with the publishers a series of
              deadlines that will not compromise the quality of the manuscripts.<br> <br> Last, but not least, is a matter of paramount concern to the writer -
              renumeration. Writers are usually paid by royalties from the sales of
              their books. And this will only happen after their books have hit the
              market. Thus, before a budding writer decides to work on a book, he
              would have to keep careful track of his personal finances. He has to
              ensure that he has enough to sustain himself and his family during the
              time he is working on the book up till the day when it is finally
              released in the market.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Whilst it is good to encourage budding writers out
              there to fulfill their dreams of publishing their own books in the name
              of promoting freedom of creative expression, the latter should also be
              armed with detailed knowledge of the venture he is about to undertake.</strong></span><br> <br> <em>A note about the writer:<br> He has worked as an editor at one major publishing house, seeing six
              books from conceptualization to print, and as a freelance writer for
              another major publishing house. He was also a contributing author for a
              book aimed at junior level students, and sole author for two electronic
              learning resources.<br> <br> </em>----------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest news update at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
