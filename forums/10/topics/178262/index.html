            <div class='col-md body'>There is a way. You can consider leasing you flat out and live in a country with a lower cost of living like Thailand of Philippines. This option is increasing attractive for many retirees who want to have a better life on a shoe string budget. I believe you can get by very comfortably at $300 a month. The prices of air tickets have fallen too, so even if you need to come back and visit your relatives it would not be costly. Healthcare is also more affordable too.<br><br>If you need info you can drop me a mail, i can tell you what ever limited info i have.</div>

He just bought a house in Pekan Nanas in Johor for R$170,000.  This house is for his retirement in future. He is only 40.<br><br>He once told me he cant afford to retire here because the cost of living will get worst in 20 years time.  His wife is from Pontian.<br><br>I checked out rentals in Ipoh, I have a close friend who lives there.   It is only R$800 for a 3 room house.

You grow up and got older in an era when things appreciated like there is no tomorrow. Government has been asking ppl to upgrade, in their  plan taxis drivers should be able to buy executive condo, not that such condo would be priced lower but they expected taxi drivers income would increase. Their tone changed when costs of business become too high due to high rental and high labour costs.<br><br>When you buy an HDB flat you actually paid much more because of the interest. Nobody realized the impact because you did not pay in cash. Before we paid up for the first flat, many upgraded by moving to a bigger flat, taking up more loans and paying more interests. Can you now sell the flat and get back all the money, principal plus interest?? This may be too late to realise, but few ppl realise the problem we got ourselves in when it was automatic in singapore for everybody to buy a flat, whether we need it or not. You are not alone for many singaporeans are in the same shoes, not much of a consolation for you, but at the appropriate time, through the appropriate channels, let your voices add up, its time for the government to take note.<br><br>Retiring overseas is a good option to stretch your retirement money. malaysia is an option, outskirt of KL is a good option if you don't want to go to a small town or village. South China is also an option, outskirt of Xiamen is a good option when the lifestyle is very similar and much more affordable, just be careful if you allow a local woman into your life, cheaper but ... or unless she truely wants to retire with you also.<br><br>In all these areas, medical care is an important issue. You can use local GP for cough and cold but surgery and hospitalization are expensive for foreigner. Buy a travel insurance that provide repatriation to singapore during emergency.<br><br>If you have a better option, pls let us know. good luck.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As it stands now, CPF Retirement Fund is useless.<br><br>Apart from using it to pay for a HDB flat, it will do no good in retirement with rising healthcare, and general cost of living.<br><br>Doesn't mean that people who have children will get financial support from their children. I mean, look at the current number of people in the Bankrupt Listings in ST, and then, mostly are just able to get by hand-to-mouth, or are heavily committed in living their lifestyles.<br><br>WTF, the government should just do away with this retirement fund thing as it makes no difference; people are still seeking help even when receiving $300 per month. If you have Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, a heart condition, $300 can't pay for squat the monthly medical costs!!! Even if you don't eat rice, and just buy medication, it isn't ENOUGH!<br><br>I urge the government to GET REAL MAN!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the problem faced by the thread starter is faced by millions of retirees all over the world. in america and england the ability to afford retirements is even far worst than in singapore.  however the good thing in those countries is that chances are the property value of their freehold homes would continue to rise whereas in singapore the value of HDB flats will continue to fall in real terms. Couple of reasons, people in singapore do not technically own their homes. I never understood the logic of buying a 99 year lease on a HDB flat. HDB owners pay the government above market value rents, disguised as mortgages, for the first 25-30years. As time goes by the lesser the number of years left on your lease the lower the value of the HDB flat is going to be in the future. The worst part about owning a HDB flat is the mountain of conditions each flat owner faces when it comes to selling or even buying. I also never understood the idea of not being able to raise financing on ones own HDB property. there is plenty of locked up equity in HDB flats. The best bet for the trend setter would be to sell his flat and buy another property in malaysia. retire in malaysia! Its the cheapest thing to do and plus its close proximity to singapore makes it more attractive. the truth is singapore 10-15 years down the road is going to be a rich mans play ground. the Swiss standard of living is for the rich, unfortunately not for the asset poor.</div>

The only concern there is the weather, sometimes changes are drastic, need to get used to and be prepared.<br><br>Security wise, as long as you don't show off your money, it is safer to stay in many cities in china than JB or some parts of KL.<br><br>Thailand is cheap and the people are nice there, but you really must speak Thai and enjoy everything Thai, which bring us to a key question, what do we do in our retirement? every day play golf, go massage? My parents decided to stay put here, to be with the grandchildren, that is their joy (and I really appreciate that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). It is not an easy decision to make.<br><br></div>
