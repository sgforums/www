              <p><strong>At Last, 'The End Of History' </strong></p>
              <p>14 March, 2009, 19:51</p>
              <p>The world is experiencing a paradigm shift that will fundamentally
              change how we think and live. Conventional wisdoms, some held in the
              West since the end of World War II and others dating from the end of
              the Cold War, are not only being challenged, but swept into the dustbin
              of history.</p>
              <p>In 1992, Francis Fukuyama published his book ‘The End of History and
              the Last Man’. At the time, Fukuyama's thesis seemed obvious for the
              Western world: "What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the
              Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but
              the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's
              ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal
              democracy as the final form of human government."</p>
              <p>Today these words appear out of place, if not simply gibberish. With
              the exception of a few neoconservatives, a growing number of people in
              the West and the vast majority of the world are questioning what was
              unquestionable in the Western mainstream, for example: the role of the
              state in the economy, how the global economy should be run, and whether
              there should be engagement with groups now labeled as ‘terrorists’.</p>
              <p>The global financial slump is destroying not only economies, but
              also the foundations of the West's worldview. Examples abound. Over the
              last 20 years, the Western world dangerously deregulated sectors of the
              economy to the point of privatizing what have been traditionally state
              services, including the military. Those who questioned the wisdom of
              doing so were called ‘socialist’, a word that in American political
              discourse is akin to an expletive. The hard reality today is that the
              state must also be an active economic player to ensure we don't repeat
              the follies that have brought the world to its knees.</p>
              <p>To date, the world's economy has been dominated by a small group of
              Western countries, a legacy of the post-World War II era called the
              Bretton Woods arrangement. However, the global economic order has not
              kept up with the times. What are known as the BRIC countries (Brazil,
              Russia, India, and China) remain almost invisible when it comes to the
              World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. When the G20 countries,
              which includes the BRIC, meet in London next month, this grouping
              should replace the Group of Eight and meet twice a year until the worst
              of the slump has been overcome, when it should become institutionalized.</p>
              <p>The issue of ‘Western liberal democracy’ has been monopolized by the
              West, particularly the United States. The idea of democracy has been so
              badly abused over the past 20 years that it has been rendered almost
              useless and nothing more than an ideological weapon of mass destruction
              by the West.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Dictated Democracy</h3>
              <p>Since the end of the Cold War, democracy has come to mean one thing:
              the promotion of Washington's foreign-policy agenda. Rarely do we hear
              anything about the democratization of the global economic order. Russia
              and China continue to be viewed with suspicion, and the concept of
              ‘fair trade’ with the rest of the world has been superceded by
              one-sided policies under the rubric of ‘free trade’ that only and
              always favor Western economies.</p>
              <p>In the area of international security the same applies. Where is
              "Western liberal democracy" in this sphere? NATO claims that Russia has
              no right to dictate which country can enter the alliance. Fair enough.
              However, what right does NATO have to threaten a country, specifically
              Russia, with its continued expansion? What is democratic about that?</p>
              <p>Then there is the issue of democratic elections. The West
              wholeheartedly supported elections in Ukraine and Georgia (the
              so-called ‘Orange’ and ‘Rose’ revolutions respectively). Washington
              gloated, but longer-term results in these so-called democracies have
              created many doubts about the continued political development of
              Ukraine and Georgia. Nonetheless, Washington congratulated itself on
              its ability to fast-forward history: ending history all together, as
              Fukuyama prophesied.</p>
              <p>What is the result? Both Ukraine and Georgia are becoming, or have
              already become, failed states, and the security consequences for Russia
              of that collapse are profound. Washington's misguided and ideologically
              driven hubris has resulted in Russia being left to pick up the pieces –
              being branded an authoritarian and a regional hegemon in the process.
              And lest we forget, Hamas was democratically elected, but ‘Western
              liberal democracy’ continues to reject election results elsewhere in
              the world it does not like. This is simply hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>We all face new vistas. For the majority of the world it won't be
              easy, but the changes we face will be very hard for the West so
              accustomed to its ‘special place in history’. That place in history is
              changing, and in the most dramatic way. The rest of the world has
              funded Western prosperity for decades, making the United States the
              greatest debtor state in history. As we can see today, this was a
              failed model and ideology. Now everyone must pay and be rewarded
              equally an idea the West abandoned long ago.</p>
              <p>In a strange way, Fukuyama was right in his ‘The End of History and
              the Last Man’. History never ends, but bankrupt ideologies do. The
              Communist Party of the Soviet Union was buried two decades ago. In
              light of recent history, Fukuyama's ‘Western liberal democracy’ should
              now be preparing for its own burial ceremony. I won't weep at the
              funeral - nor will most of the world.</p>
