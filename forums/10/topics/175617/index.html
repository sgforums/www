            <div class='col-md body'>Sg official in UN was abused again!!<br><strong>1.Letter from the official </strong><br>Start of quote<br><br>24/01/2006   Pub: Strait Times               Page: H6<br>Headline: S'porean UN official puzzled by probe<br><br>Page Heading: Forum<br>Type: Letter<br><br>I REFER to the article, 'UN suspends high-ranking S'porean<br>official in probe' (The Sunday Times, Jan 22). I would like<br>to place the matter in its proper context.<br><br>Four members of my office (the Office of Central<br>Support Services or OCSS), including myself as head,<br>and four staff members from the Department of<br>Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) were placed on<br>special leave with pay from Jan<br>16. This followed the restricted release of a draft<br>report by the Office of Internal Oversight Services<br>(OIOS) entitled 'Comprehensive review of DPKO<br>peacekeeping procurement' dated Dec 30, 2005.<br><br>It was stated by United Nations management that<br>placement on special leave with pay is not a disciplinary<br>action and was taken 'in the best interest of<br>the organisation' to permit further investigations.<br><br>Although administrative action was taken on the<br>basis of the draft report,the staff of my office and<br>I have not been provided with a copy of the document<br>to this day. Furthermore, I was not interviewed by<br>OIOS in the preparation of<br>its report. I was, however, permitted to read<br>the report after its limited<br>release last week and to take notes.<br><br>The report contained a litany of observations<br>involving wrongdoings, including fraud in procurement<br>activities in various peacekeeping missions and<br>the requisitioning of items not required in field operations.<br><br>Peacekeeping operations and all associated staff<br>are under the exclusive management responsibility<br>of the Assistant Secretary-General and the<br>Under-Secretary-General of the DPKO. My office does<br>not determine what is needed or not needed in<br>field operations or for the management of their staff<br>or their inventory.<br><br>Furthermore, since the mid-1990s (prior to my<br>arrival at the United Nations in New York), DPKO<br>had been given delegated authority to conduct procurement<br>activities in the field up to a pre-determined dollar<br>value. Requisitions for materials beyond the threshold<br>are authorised and certified by DPKO management<br>in UN Headquarters as bona fide mission requirements<br>before they are submitted<br>to UNPS for international competitive bidding.<br><br>Therefore, the question my colleagues in OCSS and<br>I have been asking so far<br>without any response from our management is why<br>we were singled out to account<br>for activities beyond our management purview.<br><br>What is more disturbing is the fact that no senior<br>managers in DPKO were<br>held accountable for the activities of their personnel<br>and the missions they directly supervise, as observed<br>in the OIOS draft report. The highest-ranking<br>DPKO official placed on special leave was a chief<br>administrative officer of a field mission.<br><br>As Assistant Secretary-General, I am therefore the<br>highest-ranking official subjected to this administrative<br>action, although I have no control whatsoever<br>over the staff and activities of peacekeeping missions.<br>It also remains a mystery as to how the removal of my<br>colleagues and I in OCSS from duties for the duration<br>of further investigations into peacekeeping-mission<br>activities, while leaving the senior managers in DPKO to<br>continue their direct management of these missions,<br>is construed to be 'in the best interest of the organisation'.<br><br>Surely, any attempts to foil investigations will be<br>carried out by those involved rather than those<br>who are not.   <strong> Whether nationality plays a part<br>in this crude discriminatory practice as<br>reported in some quarters is a matter of speculation<br>at this stage although this sort of treatment of<br>Singaporeans in the UN is not without precedence.<br><br></strong> Having served the UN faithfully and honestly for over<br>25 years with a number of unique achievements on<br>record, it pains me to wash our proverbial dirty<br>linen in public.<br>But given the blatant discriminatory nature of<br>the event, and as the first career person from Singapore<br>to have reached this level of seniority in the UN,<br>I have every intention to continue to fight for the<br>truth to prevail and to restore the good name of<br>Singapore and Singaporeans.<br>Many fellow citizens and my colleagues have called<br>me to render moral support for which I am grateful<br>and I shall not fail them.<br><br>Andrew Toh<br>Assistant Secretary-General<br>Office for Central Support Services<br>United Nations, New York---end of quote<br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sga847.doc.htm" rel="nofollow">Resume of Andrew Toh</a></strong><br><br>3.<strong><a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2005/051206_Burnham.doc.htm" rel="nofollow"><br>Already hinted in Dec 2005</a></strong><br><blockquote> Needed within a corporate entity were a culture of ethics <strong>Â“from the topÂ”, </strong>internal and external audit, training and up-to-date systems.<br></blockquote>4.<strong>This is Second Sg official abused in UN.Is an official in OIOS<br>(Sg's CPID)was accused recently? </strong><br>Pl share here.Pl read next post.<br><br>5.<strong><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6617739" rel="nofollow">Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was unaware his son received $30,000 a year for over five years from a Swiss-based company under investigation in connection with suspected corruption in the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq.--Nov. 30, 2004</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>The United Nations previously said Kojo Annan stopped receiving monthly payments from Cotecna at the end of 1999.

Mr<br>Tan himself told investigators that the programme accounted for only 5 per cent<br>to 10 per cent of his time.<br>The IIC noted that hiring a special assistant with US$260,000 of<br>oil-for-food money but not having him focus on that programme was a 'misuse' of<br>funds that 'violates' staff regulations.<br>'Given Mr Nair's oversight responsibilities within the organisation, he must<br>be held to the highest standards of conduct,' it noted.<br>Mr Nair said the criticism was 'nitpicking' and unfair.<br>He said Mr Tan was not hired exclusively for the oil-for-food programme and<br>he had made this clear in his communications with UN Human Resources and the UN<br>Financial Controller.<br>'This is certainly not misconduct,' he told The Straits Times late Tuesday.<br>'I did what I told the controller I was going to do. The elements are there.<br>I didn't misrepresent anything.'<br>In fact, Mr Tan was hired to create an overdue risk-assessment strategy and<br>similar management programmes, which would be introduced in the Iraq<br>humanitarian effort and then applied to other departments as well, he said.<br>Mr Nair, former managing director of the Development Bank of Singapore,<br>agreed that Mr Tan spent little time on Iraq-specific tasks and said his<br>responsibilities were, in fact, connected but much larger.<br>The systems developed for the oil-for-food programme would be used on other<br>high-risk efforts, he said, noting that nothing like that existed in the UN.<br>Mr Tan, now head of the Singapore International Foundation, was not<br>available for comment yesterday.<br>The IIC's criticisms pale beside its other findings, such as the attempts by<br>Mr Kojo Annan, the son of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to use his influence<br>to steer a lucrative contract to his employer.<br>But it is clear that senior UN management has run out of patience with Mr<br>Nair, whose non-renewable five-year term ends on April 20.<br>'The question is whether there will be disciplinary action against Mr Nair,'<br>said Mr Mark Malloch Brown, the UN Secretary-General's chief of staff. 'The<br>answer is: inevitably.'<br>To Mr Nair, who watched Mr Malloch Brown's press conference on television in<br>his office, such an unexpected and public reproach is 'a violation of my due<br>process, and just wrong'.----end of quote<br><br>4.<strong><a href="http://www.un.org/News/ossg/hilites/hilites_arch_view.asp?HighID=324" rel="nofollow"><br>Positions on 17.06.2005--BY STEPHANE DUJARRIC,<br>ASSOCIATE SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECRETARY-GENERAL<br><br>UN HEADQUARTERS,  NEW YORK</a></strong><br><blockquote>INVESTIGATION TO PROCEED IN DILEEP NAIRÂ’S CASE<br><br>*      In response to questions asked in recent days about former Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services Dileep Nair, the Spokesman said that, following a review by a third party of the allegations regarding OIOS management, the Secretary-General has decided to proceed with an investigation.<br>*<br><br>The initial review was carried out by Jerome Ackerman, a former President of the UN Administrative Tribunal.<br>*<br><br>The Secretary-General has asked Ackerman to conduct the investigation with haste, and to complete it within 30-45 days.<br>*<br><br>Asked what Ackerman is to investigate, the Spokesman said that he would look into the hiring of people in NairÂ’s office, as well as general management issues within OIOS.<br>*<br><br>The Spokesman added that the Secretary-General had earlier this year received more information about those issues by the Staff Union, and he decided to turn to a third party to see if there was enough information to proceed with an investigation.<br>*<br><br>Asked what would be the consequences of this investigation, given that Nair has retired from the United Nations, Dujarric said that it would give Nair a chance to clear his name, and would give the staff members closure. For the United Nations, it would provide lessons in how to improve management within OIOS.<br>*<br><br>Asked whether NairÂ’s pension could be affected, the Spokesman said that pensions as a matter of policy belong to the staff members. </blockquote>5.<strong><a href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg/internet/" rel="nofollow">Response from Sg MFA<br>ON 30.03.2005</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>MFA Spokesman's Comments - Reference to Dileep Nair by the Independent Inquiry Committee led by Paul Volcker<br><br>MFA SPOKESMAN'S COMMENTS<br><br>REFERENCE TO DILEEP NAIR BY THE<br>INDEPENDENT INQUIRY COMMITTEE LED BY PAUL VOLCKER<br><br>In response to media queries, the MFA Spokesman said:<br><br>"It is difficult to understand what the fuss is about.<br><br>The Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) claims that Mr Dileep Nair had misrepresented the duties to be performed by his former Special Assistant, Mr Tan Tay Keong, to obtain funding for the post from the Oil for Food Programme (OFFP). But Mr Nair's point that Mr Tan's work "did benefit the [OFFP] Programme" is not disputed by the IIC. And Mr Nair's 30 July 2001 note to the UN's Financial Controller made it clear that Mr Tan would be performing many duties, including but not limited to OFFP work. The decision to fund Mr Tan's post from the OFFP was not made by Mr Nair but by UN's Financial Controller with full knowledge of the facts.<br><br>The IIC was set up to look into allegations that billions of dollars had been mismanaged or siphoned off from OFFP. It is baffling that the IIC has chosen to nit pick on a trivial difference of interpretation of one official's job scope, something for which Mr Nair was not responsible."<br></blockquote>6.I remember that Sg has said she will not send official to UN .<br>Pl share the latest info here.<br><br></div>

Secretary-General Kofi Annan, will pay back import duties improperly waived by Ghana for the purchase of a luxury car in his father's name, Kojo Annan's lawyer said on Tuesday.<br><br>By using his father's name in buying the Mercedes Benz car and importing it to Ghana in 1998, Kojo received a $6,541 discount from Mercedes and saved $14,103 in import duties, a U.N.-appointed commission reported last September.<br><br><strong>Both price breaks were granted on grounds the car was said to be intended for an international diplomat's personal use.<br><br></strong>Investigators from the panel, led by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, stumbling on the transaction, initially suspected the car may have been a payoff to Kofi Annan by Swiss firm Cotecna S.A. -- which had employed Kojo -- for granting a multimillion-dollar U.N. contract under the oil-for-food program for Iraq.<br><br>But they dropped the matter after finding no evidence of any improper benefit to Kofi Annan, who assured them he had no idea his son had bought the car in his name.<br><br>Following their report, the United Nations clamped a lid of secrecy on the details of the transaction, refusing to say where it had ended up or who actually owned it, prompting weeks of bitter exchanges between journalists and U.N. spokesmen at the world body's daily media briefings.<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>The dispute peaked last month when the secretary-general lost his diplomatic cool at his annual year-end news conference, calling a reporter who raised a question about the lingering mystery an "overgrown schoolboy" and "an embarrassment ... to your profession."<br><br>U.N. officials continued turning away questions on the subject for another month.<br><br>Then on Tuesday, Kojo Annan's attorney, William Taylor, released a letter to the Ghanaian Customs authorities stating that he wanted to pay back the waived import duties.<br><br>"The automobile was not for the secretary-general's personal use and therefore the exemption was not justified," Taylor wrote.<br><br>Kojo paid $39,056 for the car in Geneva in November 1998, according to Volcker's report. It was then shipped to Ghana, Kofi and Kojo Annan's birthplace.<br><br>Taylor told Reuters the green station wagon had effectively been owned by Kojo Annan all along and had been kept at his home in Lagos, Nigeria. He said he believed the car was no longer in use after being involved recently in a bad accident.<br><br>But Kojo Annan's reimbursement offer did not extend to the diplomatic discount granted due to his father's U.N. position, Taylor said. "Mercedes doesn't need the money," he said.  </blockquote>2.This was a pure cheat to save tax The money should be returned to Mercedec without told to do so,Mr Senior and Junior Annan!!<br><br>The Secretary General shall reprimand his son publicly and<br>make a apology to the world.<br><br>What would happen to Sg official if they committed this crime.<br>Sure he would be fired by UN and pension forfeited.<br><br><strong>But the law do not apply to the INSIDERS,especially the Secretary<br>General ......and his son.</strong><br><br></div>
