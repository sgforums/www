            <div class='col-md body'>FIVE men infected with the HIV virus were brought before a district court yesterday for allegedly lying about their sexual history in questionnaires they completed before donating blood.<br><br>Their blood, none of which ever found its way to patients, tested positive for HIV.<br><br>Four of the five men are alleged to have lied when they declared on the form that they had never had sex with other men. Facing a single charge each under the Infectious Diseases Act are Ng Choon Siong, 21; Suhaidi Abas, 37; and Tan Yee Wee, 30.<br><br>The fourth man, 22-year-old Wong Shimin, faces two charges for making false declarations on two occasions, once in 2003 and once last year.It is understood that he did not test positive for the virus at that time.<br><br>The fifth man, Lua Bu Chung, 37, is accused of lying about his sexual history on one occasion. He is said to have lied when he declared that he had not had sex with more than one partner. In the same form, he also allegedly claimed in the previous year he had not had sex with anyone he had known for less than six months...<br><br>(Straits Times, 10 Nov)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Might it not be an honest mistake? IE They wanted to donate blood out of goodwill, and told a couple of white lies because they knew their blood would be tested anyway, and therefore thought that it didn't really matter. I am sure they are not the only ones to do that. After all sexual promiscuity still carries with it a stigma in Singapore.<br><br>My dad was a regular blood donator. I dunno how prmiscuous he is, but i am sure my mum would not be too happy to see him declare that he is a very promiscuous individual. He probably ticked the "only one sexual partner" box.<br><br>Edit: Just read the yawning bread article. The writer put it in words better than i ever could have.<br><br></div>

That is the first i have heard of that. In any case, this is not about duress. This is about blameworthiness. Is someone who tells a white lie in a situation such as the one we are discussing so blameworthy that the criminal law must be weilded to censure him?<br><br>I think not.<br><br>Someone made the point about the virus being undetectable for a certain period after infection. Lets say for eg that the period is sevesral weeks. If so, why not hold the samples in quarantine for several months? Surely it is illogical and irresponsible to rely on people telling the truth in order to weed out such cases?<br><br>IE Virus may remain undetectable for weeks. - We quarantine the samples for months. -&gt; Hence it is moot whether the doner lied about his sexual history.</div>
