I said I was at home, in singapore. "you don't see soldiers on the streets?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2) My american colleague's wife is a british, both living in singpapore. When news broke out that the natives were chopping off heads of christians somewhere in Sulawesi, her mother called up and asked if she had found a way to evaluate.<br><br>3) Headoffice sent a crew from US to collect info for company's newsletter, featuring Asia. They came with an itinerary to cover singapore, taipei, phnom penh and shanghai in one week, starting from Philidelphia and leave for home within the same week. Reason? 'cause "we could cover london, paris, and koln (in Germany) in one week, and we thought singapore, Taipei and Shanghai are just nearby", (actually direct flight between shanghai and taipei should take only an hour).<br><br>I laughed cause I knew the geography. If I don't, I wonder how others would be laughing at me.<br><br></div>

If they knew they were HIV infected and did not decare it, then they would very probably have committed a criminal offence. It would then be up to the state to prove that they were guilty. The starting point must be a presumption of innocence.<br><br>Again, many cogent reasons have been given for them lying on the forms. I do not wish to rehash that. Imo, these little lies in this context should not be enough to result in criminal liabilites.<br><br></div>

My statement was " ..NOT a criminal offence to donate blood, NOT knowing that you are HIV+. ." This is in relation to what you said about the donors not knowing they were HIV+. It's true, they donated blood not knowing they were HIV+ and that's not the reason they were charged. They were charged for falsely declaring that they were not indulging in high-risk activities, such as being a homosexual or have multiple sex partners.<br><br></div>
