              <p>And if you'd like an example of how he was derailing all the topics by spamming, here is just a small sample of what he did to other wall posts, other than flooding them out as shown above.</p>
              <p>He was not banned due to differing views but instead he was banned as he did not abide by the rules of online engagement present in all forums, including this one. He advertised other websites, he used vulgarities and spammed. He prevented others from having a serious discussion by flooding the topics with uncalled for remarks. For a period of time he pretended to be someone else called Utopia InterpretSg and went on the facebook page asking why others were talking to "Alex" who didn't exist.</p>
              <p>While it is perfectly fine to have differing views when it comes to politics, I believe what we can all agree on is that there are some rules of online engagement we must follow so that we can communicate effectively and responsibly using this platform. </p>
