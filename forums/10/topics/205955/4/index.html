Today, it employs over 1,200 people and has a turnover of some $400 million.<br><br>Citing Mr Mustaq's success, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: 'You get the right foreigner here, he creates thousands of jobs for Singaporeans, like Mr Mustaq. And you need to get more people like him.'<br><br>Asked yesterday for his response, Mr Mustaq, who became a citizen 15 years ago and has four grown-up children, said: 'I was pleasantly surprised that PM mentioned me. There are many promising companies here with similar roots.'<br><br>On his decision to settle in Singapore, he said: 'I was brought up here and I like to stay here. For one, you can walk around anywhere at any time without a sense of fear.<br><br>'The business opportunities are also plentiful.'<br><br>He also responded passionately to Mr Lee's call to broaden the definition of foreign talent that Singapore should welcome to its shores....."<br><br>Straits Times 21 Aug)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It must be one of the best speech given by our beloved leader lee hisen loong last night. The numerous point that he highlighted was spot on. There's no doubt we need foreign talents on our shore due to the lack of babies and to attract them over, how can we demand them to serve NS? Its ridiculous.<br><br>As the world is fast changing, we need to be focus and constantly be on our toes due to our lack of natural resources. The change from swiss living to Paris by our MM is indeed refreshing. Paris being a far more exciting place than Switzerland is needed in monotonous singapore.<br><br>Singaporeans as usual jumps to the gun and criticise Lee hisen loong when he mistakenly says added hum in local malay food mee siam. I am very sure many of you don't know that Mr lee hisen loong is so popular with our malays that whenever he order mee siam, the owner will give the extra ingredients, in this case, hum to him.<br><br>It was such a good speech and knowingly we are in the right direction. In a spontaneous mood, my friend and I head off to a KTV and sang HOME by chen jie yi, Where I Belong - 2001 Theme Song and A Place In My Heart - 2003 Theme Song. The mood in the hall was so emotional and inspiring that many patrons join in and sing with us.</div>

At a time when the Internet is full of rumours, the government here, as well as round the world needs the local media such as newspapers 2 counter whatever is said in the Internet. Newspapers have no place for half-truths or distorts of facts, and obviously, Brown's views had been viewed 2 be full of rubbish.<br><br>This has nothing 2 do with talent. Brown has a talent for making podcast. But that talent wasn't used when he wrote that column that got him the rebuttal<br><br></div>

Bcos of the ever growing and ever burgeoning population of PRCians coming to Singapore each year, they are starting to be a "force to be reckon with here" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> . Just take a look, which group is specially mentioned by the PM? They are now a new "race" in Singapore!! With Singaporeans slowly turning into the minority, why would they bother to assimilate into our society? Furthermore, being coined the term FT, they think they have achieve god-like status, and are above them all. From wad I noe, these FTs are her to escape the fierce competition back in their homeland and the really 'zai' one already in USA. They are mainly here to milk the maximum benefits provided by our "carrot head" government.<br><br>One day someday, Singapore can only be introduced to others as a "Rich Hotel for under-rated talents!!"</div>

The numerous point that he highlighted was spot on. There's no doubt we need foreign talents on our shore due to the lack of babies and to attract them over, how can we demand them to serve NS? Its ridiculous.<br><br>As the world is fast changing, we need to be focus and constantly be on our toes due to our lack of natural resources. The change from swiss living to Paris by our MM is indeed refreshing. Paris being a far more exciting place than Switzerland is needed in monotonous singapore.<br><br>Singaporeans as usual jumps to the gun and criticise Lee hisen loong when he mistakenly says added hum in local malay food mee siam. I am very sure many of you don't know that Mr lee hisen loong is so popular with our malays that whenever he order mee siam, the owner will give the extra ingredients, in this case, hum to him.<br><br>It was such a good speech and knowingly we are in the right direction. In a spontaneous mood, my friend and I head off to a KTV and sang HOME by chen jie yi, Where I Belong - 2001 Theme Song and A Place In My Heart - 2003 Theme Song. The mood in the hall was so emotional and inspiring that many patrons join in and sing with us.</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
