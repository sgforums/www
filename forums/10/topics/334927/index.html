              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Asspots run countries are like that. Luckily for Singapore bank customers, the Hong Kong people refused to let DBS get away with dishonorable behavior and camped outside their premises until they paid.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Apparently this is already happening but I was wondering what people were sold, you know,  like funds, and which fund is going under and whether people can get out fast with some money before the fund collapses and they end up with nothing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Funds are not "bonds" like Lehman bonds. Funds are like stocks and shares. There is no way you can get compensation if a fund collapses. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is better to identify those at risks of collapsing for you will not read warnings in the propaganda press, like how it was clear that Lehman was collapsing but Singaporeans were taken by surprise.</span><br></span></p>

              <p>Facts can always be twisted anytime and by anyone. Truths can be twisted to become lies and with equal measure, lies be twisted to truth. It only needs a little bit of reality, mixed up the facts a bit, and then add a few lies insidously and voila! Suckers made - hook, line and sinker.</p>
              <p><br>More so during crisis times, where despicable opportunists and conmen/conwomen are out in full force.</p>
              <p> <br>People are suffering, in confusion and what better time than now to push blame on someone else, twist facts, create hopelessness, despair, anger, rage and hate and then gain a following?</p>
              <p><br>Thus, each and everyone of us must always remind ourselves that we have to take responsiblity for our own actions, actions which are either motivated by greed or altrusic reasons, for good or for bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our actions will reflect the kind of society we want to live in -  unfettered freedom such as the example that led to the meltdown of the current market or some form of control so than unknown impacts will not damage our society much.</p>
              <p><br>No one knew Lehman could collapse except for lehman itself and fund managers. There can be no transparency in biz operations for it will only destroy competitiveness.</p>
              <p> Example, if coke or KFC were to be transparent, they would not be MNCs, just simply another mom and pop shop.</p>
              <p><br>Thus no one, not even an einstien, without actual hard facts, would have known the lehman debacle. Investors cannot rely on rumours to invest their hard-earned savings. Lehman and fund bosses should be hanged for cheating others' LIFE savings and abusing the freedom the free market policies offered!</p>
              <p><br>And at these confusing times, those with rabid agendas, would stoop at nothing to despicably use anyone - the foolish ones, the confused ones, the emotional ones, the poor ones, etc to either gain political power or financial wealth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crocodiles tears galore, but in the end, stable society, lives and solutions mean nothing to these animals - power,  domineering control, or wealth is absolute. An ultimate justification for means employed, but only for themselves and not for the majority.</p>
              <p><br>Beware!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Destruction is easy, but lives will be lost. Rebuilding takes time. We have yet to find a perfect system, we human ourselves are not models of perfection anyway, thus there is no perfect system of governance anywhere in this world, but only one which we must adopt a system of 'give and take'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is actually a complaint of 'giving' by taxpayers to governments and 'taking' by the authorities is nothing more than the sharing and creation of wealth for our society. Our giving is not to a private enterprise, but to the representatives of our society - the govt, to help social spending for all, if possible, and to the needy, whom we must never abandon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At times, being imperfect, we citizens too make mistakes. There would be no need to be overly harsh to us by our sociey, which can be found in leniency and pragmatism by our courts, for those whom are genuinely mislead or express remorse, but not to those stubborn old fools who habitually invite scorn and revilement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone else who claim they have the perfect system is either an immortal or a nutcase. Worse if he/she only knows how to condemn and destroy but not provide practical solutions.</p>

              <h1><strong><span><strong>Scenes From the Global Class War</strong></span></strong></h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #990000; font-size: small;">O</span><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">n
              Friday, October 24, the pound sterling dropped to just $1.58 (down from
              $1.73 earlier in the week, an enormous plunge by foreign-exchange
              standards), and the euro sunk to just $1.26, while Japan’s yen soared
              by 10 per cent. These shifts threatened to disrupt export markets and
              hence industrial sales patterns.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Global stock markets plunged from 5 to
              9 per cent abroad, and there was talk of closing the New York market if
              stocks fell more than 1,000 points. Pre-opening trading saw the Dow
              Jones Industrial Average down the maximum limit of 550 points (largely
              on foreign selling) before bounding back to lose “only” 312 points as
              the dollar soared against European currencies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Friday’s
              currency turmoil and stock market plunge was a case of the chickens
              coming home to roost from the class-war policies being waged by
              European and Asian industry and banking squeezing their domestic
              consumer markets – that is, labor’s living standards – in favor of
              export production to the United States. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The internal contradiction in
              this industrial and financial class warfare is now clear: <em>To the extent that it succeeds in depressing labor’s income, it stifles the domestic consumer-goods market</em>.
              This disrupts Say’s Law – the principle that “production creates its
              own demand,” based on the assumption that employees will (or must) be
              paid enough to buy what they produce.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This
              has not been true for many years in Europe and Asia. But production has
              been able to continue without faltering because of an international <em>deus ex machina</em>: consumer demand in the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This
              is not to say that no class warfare is being fought in the United
              States. Indeed, living standards for most wage earners today are down
              from the “golden age” of the late 1970s. But the U.S. economy had its
              own financial <em>deus ex machina</em> to soften the blow: Alan
              Greenspan’s asset-price inflation that flooded the banks with credit,
              which was lent out to homebuyers and stock market raiders. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Rising home
              prices were applauded as “wealth creation” as if they were a pure
              asset, much like dividends suddenly being awarded to one’s savings
              account. Homebuyers were encouraged to “cash out” on the rising
              “equity” margin, the (temporarily) rising market price of their homes
              over and above their (permanent) mortgage debt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So while most mortgage
              money was used to bid up the price of home ownership, about a quarter
              of new lending was reported to be spent on consumption goods. Credit
              card debt also soared. In the face of a paycheck squeeze, U.S.
              consumers were maintaining their living standards by running further
              and further into debt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This
              could not go on for very long. It never has. Debt-financed bubbles
              can’t last for more than a few years, even when fueled by a
              self-feeding inflation of asset prices in which households and
              corporate industry borrow more and more against the rising price of
              their collateral. But once the housing bubble burst the game was up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
              game was up was up not only for the U.S. economy,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but also for foreign
              economies that had geared their industrial production to serve the U.S.
              market rather than their own home markets. </span></strong>A global industrial slowdown
              is now threatened, and must continue until foreign domestic markets are
              nurtured – just the opposite trend from the recent generation of
              neoliberal anti-labor policies...</span></p>
