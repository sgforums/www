              <p><br>they bear dividends, can be 3mths, 6mths or anytime payout once it is declared. The dividends should be much higher than fix interest, but it varies in accordance to the fund managers investment, all bonds are stated clearly on what investment they are putting the money into, just like lehman bonds was be tied to Subprime markets in US, which promised good profits and high returns at the time of buying. </p>
              <p>Other option is that you are can plough yr dividend back into the bonds at a discount or higher value. And that is what most singaporeans do as they hv gained much on paper and plough back to increase the stake as most of them have enuf money to spend and take the bonds as saving plan.</p>

              <p>The minibonds aren't even defective. Please tell me how are they defective? Are all investment losses due to defects? Clearly not. In this case, when you choose to buy high risk bonds, and if the companies fails, you only have yourself to blame. Every investments has risk. The higher the risk, the higher the returns. The 'old and msinformed' let greed dictate their thinking. That was their folly. I mean seriously if you afford to fork out 100K for investments (already ignoring the fact that you should only invest spare cash), I dont see why you can't afford to spent a few hundred dollars to get advice from a financial advisor to explain the terms to you.</p>

              <p><br>Thats why they should ahve gone to a financial advisor to explain the situation to them. But they didn't as they were blinded by the dizzy thoughts of high returns. High returns = high risk.</p>
              <p>They should just bought some SGS bonds and Treasury bills. But it didn't cross their minds cos of the low interest I presume.</p>

              <p><br>That is certainly possible. They might skip certain facts or paint a rosy picture. But which salesperson dont? Moreover, the seller in question even provided a honest assesement of the minibonds in its prospectus. Ultimately, the bank/seller's official stand on that particular product lies in its prospectus where it clearly states the nature of the bonds and the risk of default. As such, how could the people be misinformed when they are clutching the prospectus. If they couldn't understand, then they should have consulted a financial advisor. Ultimately, their naivety and greed burnt a hole in their pocket.</p>

              <p><strong>To:  Chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir,
                  <br> <br> We have invested in the credit linked securities, including Mini bonds,
                  High Notes, Pinnacle Notes and Jubilee Notes, on the misrepresentation
                  by the sales representatives working for the financial institutions.
                  <br> <br> The misrepresentations include, among others, some or all of the following:</p>
              <p><br> a) That the funds are invested in the bonds of the reference entitles
                  <br> b) That all of the reference entitles have to fail, before we lose our entire principal
                  <br> c)  That our principal is protected, if we keep the investment to the maturity date
                  <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We were not told that our monies were invested in other underlying
                  poorer quality assets</span> and that credit default swaps were transacted
                  that could wipe out our entire capital in the event of a credit event
                  involving only one of these reference entities. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The prospectus and
                  sales materials do not explain the actual nature and risks
                  transparently. </span><br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we were correctly informed, we would have avoided the structured
                  product, as we are risk adverse investors. </span>Previously, we have invested
                  our monies in fixed deposits of finance institutions in Singapore.
                  <br> <br>We were misled by the assurances and explanations given by the
                  sales representatives, which have now turned out to be wrong. These
                  statements were, in most cases, made verbally to us. We believed these
                  statements as they came from the financial institutions that we had
                  trusted for many years.
                  <br> <br>We petition the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to review the
                  sales training and marketing processes of the financial institutions,
                  in particular, on the following areas:
                  <br> <br>a) Did the financial institutions provide adequate training to
                  their sales representatives, on the actual nature and risks of the
                  structured products? In particular, were the representatives trained on
                  the contents of the prospectus? Were they tested on their knowledge of
                  the contents? If not, why? <br> <br> b) Did the financial institutions target fixed deposit holders to
                  market these products? Was this targeting done in a systematic way? Was
                  it done with the knowledge and approval of senior management? Did the
                  senior management consider these structured products to be a reasonable
                  alternative to fixed deposits: to be sold to a conservative, risk
                  adverse investor? <br> <br> c) Did the financial institutions have systems to monitor the conduct
                  of sales representative to ensure that the products were sold to the
                  appropriate people, based on their risk profile and preference? Was a
                  higher incentive given to sell this risky product? Was there pressure
                  to move the product?
                  <br> <br> d)         Were the sales materials appropriate in explaining the riskiness of the product?
                  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>We believe that many sales representatives were unaware about the
                  actual nature and risk of the products. </span>Consequently, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they gave the
                  wrong information and advice to the retail investors.</span> This has caused
                  us to lose large sums of money on our investments.
                  <br> <br>If the investigation by MAS confirms that the sales representatives
                  were not properly trained and monitored; we appeal to MAS to help us to
                  obtain appropriate compensation for our financial loss. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><br> Our appeal is for MAS to act in accordance with the objectives or
                  desired outcomes of its supervisory activities: transparent and
                  fair-dealing intermediaries and offerors and well-informed and
                  empowered consumers. </span></p>

              they did actually going by the news are reporting. i went to the bank(posb) a few times in the past 2 years and they kept offering plans which would earn money instead of leaving my money in a bank account.
              same thing happened at DBS when i tried to open a new account.

              <p> </p>
              <p>First, there is no proof that the said product was not explained properly, there is simply a private seller and a buyer conversation that was not recorded in any way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, as a sales person plying his/her trade, the objectives is to sell his/her products as the job required. And at the time of selling, our professionalism require us to promote the products, and as the buyers claimed to be adversed investor, they should be able to balance the pros n cons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, we did not give the wrong advices and in any one time we had questioned the buyers if he/she got any doubts, please ask, however most happily agreed to the terms and conditions stipulated in the contracts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fourthly, we are transparent, we do work professionally with open door concepts accepting all inquiries, be it selling or buying, we do our business as per any other business, we hv good record and alway align ourselves to the laws and fiscal policies of the republic of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, the turn of events is unpredicatable, no one wanted it to be this way, but we had to accept a global capital malfunction that is not within our sole control. We should all learn from it.</p>

              <p>The minibonds aren't even defective. Please tell me how are they
              defective? Are all investment losses due to defects? Clearly not.
              In this case, when you choose to buy high risk bonds, and if the

              <p>Witness: Yes sir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prosecutor: What products did they offer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Witness: I don't know them even as the relationship manager tried to explain to me. She told me i could get 6 to 10% returns on my life savings for my $25,000 life savings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prosecutor: Why were you not attracted to better returns, afterall the banks only offer 1 to 2% interest returns?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Witness: I may be low educated, <strong>but i am not stupid</strong>. If anyone offers better returns than what bank gives means there will be risks. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Money where got so easy to make one.<br></span> <br>They will use my money to make more money for themselves than pass a bit to me. I rather save at home, but i scared kena rob. So put in bank and get 1% also nevermind. If i want risk, i buy soccer bets better. At least win or lose, i am responsible, no one else.</p>

              <p>If you wanna call people stupid, ignorant and brainwashed, then
              don't bother coming here for information, you chose what you want
              to see, even if people make sense you simply dismiss their
              arguements as "PAP propaganda". Now you know why the
              Lee's always win lawsuits, its cuz of idiots like
              you who make lots of accusations without solid evidence.
              Difference is, CSJ and co have the balls to post them in the
              papers, you don't, which makes you a typical sg uncle, sit behind

              <p><br> That is certainly possible. They might skip certain facts or paint
                          a rosy picture. But which salesperson dont? Moreover, the seller in
                          question even provided a honest assesement of the minibonds in its
                          prospectus. Ultimately, the bank/seller's official stand on that
                          particular product lies in its prospectus where it clearly states
                          the nature of the bonds and the risk of default. As such, how could
                          the people be misinformed when they are clutching the prospectus.
                          If they couldn't understand, then <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>they should have consulted a
                          financial advisor</strong></span>. Ultimately, their naivety and greed burnt a hole

              <p><br>Precisely what I mean. You won't like someone calling you a dishonourable despot won't you? And because you don't have solid evidence, you get sued for publishing these kind of things. My point is, people here give you their opinions, don't be so quick to label them as "brainwashed". Or else, don't bother posting here at all</p>
