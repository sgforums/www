But it is a cruel joke in a way different to what u imagine it to be.</div>

There is an agreement between Mindef and the courts that if a case is of sufficient public interest, the case can be brought to civil court.  In the media barrage, the Defence Minister said, "We will get to the bottom of this" publicly, creating the opening for said clause to be exercised.</div></blockquote>With so much cover up can the Singapore judicial system still be trusted ?</div>
