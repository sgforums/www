            <div class='col-md body'>Oh boy, here we go again.<br><br>Okay, just as a quick run over what's been said here and in other threads:<br><br>Those who suspect that making the sentences heavier would open up a whole new can of worms are pretty much spot-on.  I will not confirm the rumour that other people were actually involved here, but from open source data, two interesting points arise:<br><br>- what about the safety officer who wasn't at his post?<br>- what about the MO who approved sending a PES B man to a PES A course?<br><br>Just these two points alone should indicate that the coverage of the case was woefully inadequate, and I will leave it up to your individual judgement to work out if there were any more angles to this case that were conveniently left out.<br><br>For what it's worth, I can't make a reasonable argument that the two LTAs do not deserve their sentences.  Note that this does not extend to saying that they do deserve those sentences.  On the other hand, Pandiaraj and Balakrishnan were quite clearly scapegoated.<br><br>Someone asked why the case made it to civil court.  There is an agreement between Mindef and the courts that if a case is of sufficient public interest, the case can be brought to civil court.  In the media barrage, the Defence Minister said, "We will get to the bottom of this" publicly, creating the opening for said clause to be exercised.</div>
