They've already suffered, and if they have any conscience (which I sincerely hope is the case) they're all going to be haunted at the thought of having taken a good man's life for the rest of their lives. That's already punishing enough, and no further punishment would bring the victim back to life.<br><br>I just hope that his family can find peace after this.</div>
