This word should be something you won't forget and that won't come up in any other way. Many people use "Green-Yellow-Red:" Green means "everything's fine," Yellow means "Don't stop, but don't do anything harder than that," Red means "Stop everything right now."<br></blockquote>Hai... you see...we need to consult the professionals more often.<br><br>-------End Off-topic-------<br><br>Btw, SAF personnel feel free to put this in WITS or SMSS(?).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
