I admit that I did that too. I still don't view signing on as a viable career option unless yor really have no choice.<br><br>When I did my NS, it was really my first oppurtunity to be with people who were genuinely less fortunate than me. For me, signing on is just one of several choices, for them, it may be the only choice. It is rather unfortunate for them, but one lesson that can be learnt from the many who have becomed disillusioned is this, before you sign on, have a goal. Use your time and money during your bond/contract to work towards that goal. Use regular service as a stepping stone rather than as the main focal point of your career.<br><br>Let's face it, only a few actually can be promoted due to merit. My 1st CSM during my NS days was one such person. Army mad, high-flying EOD guy who devoted his whole life to the army. Last I heard was that his wife divorced him. He's now pretty young for a 2WO, but is it really worth it?<br><br>And yes, command positions in such forces are not viewed as relevant work experience by the private sector. Even some government organizations don't view it as such. One RAdm made a huge mess of SMRT, because he kept pulling rank. Remember, always think thrice before signing on.</div></blockquote>Corrections. The one u mean is not Radm but COA right? A BG who quit SMRT. The Radm u talking about is Kwek Siew Jin ( correct spelling?) He is a good CEO at that time.<br><br></div>
