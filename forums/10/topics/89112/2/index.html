            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, this move was predictable since the policy and the way Sg govt conducts business is pretty standard with a clear "Standard Operating Procedure." I thought they could have formalized and written everything down into a manual or handbook for minister wannabes -- "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Governing."<br><br>Why I say so is the first creative use of creating post for accomodating MM Lee was done for the Senior Minister post. So it's likely that they'll repeat the trick again when everyone get shifted up 1 slot for this change of PM.<br><br>In my opinion, SM Goh was forced to hang around after his "retirement" as PM. I think he could have happily handed everything over to PM Lee and went home to look after his grandkids and enjoy family life -- politic was never his goal and passion. In fact, lots of ministers are headhunted and more or less "forced" into public service. The only one person who is still so enamoured with politic is MM. The reason why he has to stay is to provide legitimacy to MM. If he doesn't, then tongues will surely wag about MM being too power obsessive to give up power and position up and hanging around the government. So with SM Goh staying, then it "seems" the trend and culture in Singapore government for ex-PMs to hang around after their service and this will provide less ammunition for people to gossip.<br><br>Actually I was guessing something like "Assistant Senior Minister" or "Vice Senior Minister" like corporate world does, but apparently there is more creativity in the labeling than I had expected. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, the whole process is like playing musical chairs; it has always been the same few faces, except the chairs (positions) they sit on are different. Why don't we have a reality TV shows like "The Apprentice" for ministers and MM Lee as Donald Trump firing people each week...That would be a great show. So the great talk about "rejuvenation" and "changing of guards" may be nothing more than some fancy labeling cooked up by the media.<br><br>Nothing has changed in fact.</div>

I don't foresee another changing of guard soon. SM Goh era lasted 14 years, so the earliest our currently new PM batch will be probably get phased out will be at least 10 years later, and who knows if MM is still around by then? If he does, then probably another round of this labeling trick will solve the problem.<br><br>I think somehow it's an irony that no matter how powerful or influential a person can be, he's still a mortal who is subject to the ravage of time and can in no way challenge or defy nature.
