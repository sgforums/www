            <div class='col-md body'>Leaders are fumbling a lot since 1970s because they forgot that what were taught in universities cannot be applied without graduating from the practical immersions in another real univesity - the university of hard-knocks.<br><br>This graduation or test by fire is acquired from practical exposure for a number of years until a person sees and realizes all the connectivity between assumptions and practical results through motivating people and masses.<br><br>It is important that leaders now learn after all the fumblings to begin from below the ivory tower ..from the steps below their high-powered policies and decisions.<br><br>Those steps have to be arranged in easily connected integrated work steps and processes that begin from implementation level. If leaders cannot see these implementation steps and processes they would be groping in the morass of unknown human interactions between tasks and results.<br><br>Read more about such Objective-Steps connectivity and processes in<br><a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is leadership? What are leaders supposed to accmplish ? Are they supposed to be forceful, pragmatic, or full of good presentations, rhetorics, concepts and assumptions ?<br><br>In this topic, we will examine the unique qualities, abilities or attributes that leaders should possess in order to solve diverse problems, set direction and unite people into taking collective actions to strive for maximum good of the maximum number.<br><br>In my personal opinion, the following are some qualities or criteria required of the leaders:-<br><br>(1) Passion,<br>(2) Ability to Motivate followers,<br>(3) Ability to get people to work with coordination and apply knowledge.<br>(4) Ability to Translate goals and objectives into implementation processes to accomplish goals e.g. bring about competitiveness, technology start-ups and jobs etc.<br>(5) Invest monies and perform tasks with Accountability and Transparency<br>(6) Collective leadership by core team to make major decisions,<br>(7) Sense of integrity to avoid self-centred assumptions or controls that stifle mass participation in knowledge application.<br><br>In whatever actions he takes, a leader must serve the followers with reliability, or sense of justice, empathy with the poor or concern with social and economic wellbeing of all.<br><br>A leader should be honourable, possess the highest integrity and not engage in artful arguments or fallacies or rhetorics or empty promises.<br><br>He should understand that the need to strive for social and cultural progress to sustain conditions for economic vibrancy and competitiveness of people in their respective fields and would unleash their skills and talents.<br><br>He should practise broad-based practical education for his people which will lead to widespread application of technology and knowledge.<br><br>In the fast-paced technological age of internet, people need empowerments of participative processes and facilitation to compete together as a team. Only when a government is collective and empowering the people will it lead to development of creative, entrepreneurial and proactive and practical applications of knowledge by all in every field.<br><br>Leaders who have spent to much of energy in controls and regulations, or taxing and recovering of costs to the full market values will cause hardship.<br><br>Today's leaders should recognise people are the true partners of business or enterprise so that the masses could be totally involved in decision making and working towards results together as a team.<br><br>In this way they can then leverage the many resources at work and mobilise the people to realize technologicial start-ups and value-add economic competitiveness which currently could only be talked about.<br><br>Today's leaders should be collective open and consultative possessing the total functional abililites and total scope and radar range to cover the whole spheres of social culture and economic exchanges and leveling up of competitiveness. They should level up to objective management to avoid self-interests and obsessive controls which are not consonent with the majoirity's vibrancy and growth.<br><br>Process management lays out duties and responsibilities of the whole team to enable and empower the team to sustain efficiency and productivity and entrepreneurship with coordination and application of knowledge at all level to attain results to attain the movement's objectives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If our leaders are prepared to exercise their leadership and talent for the people, there will be no high costs, competitions against people for business by governent and its agencies, promotions of highest pays and bonuses for themselves and putting out of controls and regulations to keep themselves in power.<br><br>In the spirit of Christmas and New Year, our leaders should learn from the NKF revelations and make corrections to all their shortcomings for a better year.<br><br>Don't just manage or govern the whole country legalistically but morally and with a sense of care for people's welfare and wellbeings. This is the ultimate message people are sending to the government before the next election in the NKF case.</div>
