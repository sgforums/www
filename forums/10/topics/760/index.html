            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost, its not EVERYBODY... its only those who get to vote... when was the last time YOU voted? In fact, when was the last time I voted? (presidential elections don't count...)<br><br>And the people who voted PAP do it 'cos they don't wanna vote for Chee the Clown. (I sometimes think that the PAP pays him to make the opposition look stupid... Nobody can be THAT stupid without trying REAL hard...)<br><br>Not that its the oppositions' fault for not bucking up, but the PAP has consistently practiced a policy of marginalising the political opposition since 1959. And of course, since the commies walked out of parliament, the opposition basically never recovered from that...<br><br>So here's my answer: No credible alternative.  If one came up, I have no doubt that they'll still win, but they  would certainly lose the 2/3 majority... then they'll REALLY have to vote in legislations and debate policies instead of just bulldozing it through and pay lips service to democracy...<br><br>------------------<br>I never saw a wild thing<br>sorry for itself.<br>A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough<br>without ever having felt sorry for itself.<br><br>D.

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple. Elections are about voting in the best person or government to represent your voice and the country. Or the cynical might say, the party or people who'll do the least damage to the country.<br><br>Why vote the PAP? Well, have you considered that its because the majority of the people feel the PAP and its representatives fulfil the above criteria?<br><br>Well, for all their imperfections, I'd say they're way better than people like Chee "I'm on hunger strike but I can drink milk and glucose solution" Soon Juan or Ling "duh" How Doong.<br><br>Why do Mr Low Thia Kiang and Mr Chiam See Tong stay in their wards repeatedly despite the PAP's best efforts while Ling gets booted after 1 term and Chee "WHERES MY MONEY??!!" Soon Juan never gets in?<br><br>Maybe...just maybe...could it be the last 2 are not good enough, while the first 2 are, and most Singaporeans are smart enough to see that?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ipowersia, now you see why? The two reasons you now encountered are :<br><br>(1) Those who had learned never get to vote.<br>(2) Those who never learn keep feeling complacent and hence keep voting PAP.<br><br>Other reasons:<br><br>(3) Apathetic lots who see only current situation and not into future.<br><br>Well, the ways for changes to happen i guess are:<br><br>(1) Wait - wait until current problems (e.g. greying population, inflation, heavy hidden taxes and cost e.g COE, HDB flat, poor become poorer etc) in singapore escalate until it became too apparent for those who never learn to finally grab what's wrong with the system where a single party is trying to be 'king' to do whatever it likes.<br><br>(2) Wait - wait until singapore become too expensive for everyone to treat it a comfortable home to spent, to live and to breed the next generation but to treat it just as a working place to earn and benefit from currency advantage while spenting elsewhere. i.e. when Blue IC cost lots more than the Pink IC in black market.<br><br>(3) Still wait - wait until the local population diminished among the foreign crowd to shock those who never learn to finally know what's wrong.<br><br>(4) Wait again - wait until someone die.

            <div class='col-md body'>yes i do agree Viper52 but with no opposition around all those descision is made by the government and they able to change to situition within a short period like increasing of GST to 5% next yr.. whereas if got opposition, those opposition may voice out their problem hence will slower down the changing but in the end i alway know that government will win anyway. if government want to change something, by hook or by crook they sure change it. As you can see this year election.. before the election, there are already 40+ PAP members get the seat and they are in the win win situition..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't mean to sound like I'm flaming but this is a really not news. The PAP has always been doing stuff like this and it'll be foolhardy for anyone to think they'll stop behaving like this anytime soon.<br><br>The PAP is probably just making an example of Potong Pasir. And did I hear democracy? Come on man....the voting we do is just to pay lip service to our own empty promise of "building a democratic society, based on justice and equality." Most foreign observers consider our government a very friendly dictatorship. I can't remember who told me that or where I read that so that might not be true. But if it is true, I wouldn't be surprised at all, and neither should any of you be.<br><br>Most Singaporeons just blindly vote for the PAP, just for the sake of security. When I say security, I mean things like economic stability, low crime rates, etc. Complain as much as we may, we're still much, much better off than a lot of other countries in terms of those factors.<br><br>In a way, Singaporeons are willing to trade off some of our freedoms and other niceties in return for the kind of security the PAP gives us. Granted, for all we know the SDP might actually do a better job but because of the political non-competition in Singapore, no one will know for sure; Being as kiasu as we are, we'd rather play safe and stick with the PAP.<br><br>Ever heard of "give an inch, and they'll take a foot?" Same goes for the PAP. They give a bit of room for political competition, and before they know it the opposition would use the slack that the PAP cut them, to choke the PAP. Once they let the ball start rolling, it will be near impossible in a political context for them to stop it, and they'll be out of office before they know it. In a way, the PAP is just as kiasu like the rest of us Singaporeons, and would also rather play safe.<br><br>With the current hullabooboo about more free speech and political competition, the PAP is just letting opposition have a go at it just for show. In reality, the opposition is nothing more than cannon fodder to the PAP. As a side note, the General Elections is more or less the PAP's turf, so what makes the opposition think they could win a fight in the PAP's own backyard? If any of you have noticed, most of the opposition candidates are those that probably have been deemed as non-threatening by the government. Those that did pose a threat have all been jailed, sued to bankruptcy, or been given free air-conditioned rooms at you-know-where.<br><br>I guess you could say the recent General Elections was just one big successful PR stunt the PAP managed to pull off, and the people living in Potong Pasir were none the wiser. Lets just hope those constituencies that voted for the opposition learn their lesson in time for the next General Elections, and don't repeat the same mistake.<br><br>That is, if they're still allowed to vote. Since the PAP has the mentality that not voting for them is grounds for the revoking of "privileges" like the upgrading of HDB flats, building of MRT lines, etc, considering not voting for them as grounds for not being granted the "privilege" (anyone remember that one?) to vote isn't really that far-off, is it? The consequences are all the same anyway; vote for PAP or...actually you don't really have a choice. You just have to vote for them.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Food for thought, anyone?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 14 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a sidenote, I still believe that the PAP used the idea of democracy as a clever, albeit obvious way to fob off discontent in the working class when they first started out. It is possible their motives could have been more true then, but I doubt so, even more so for the PAP of today.</div>

Singapore will be like countries like Taiwan and Malaysia.. people support different parties and will cause a lot of disputes..<br><br>2. when a country is juz recovering from a economic crisis.. if there is a sudden change in political parties will cause a country's economic to get worse..<br><br>3. PAP although has not been very up to expectations.. but our country is still under good management.. and if all these years PAP had been a good governing party.. why not vote them again..??<br><br>the main reason why people dun vote for other parties is most probably they are not sure how the other parties will manage Singapore.. it maybe good, it maybe bad.. but who knows..<br><br>so everybody play safe.. vote PAP again..</strong><br><br>these are juz some of my personal views.. and some are discussed during the election with one of my property manager..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's nice to see that the budget has been debated more strongly this year. All mainly because of the GST increase, which is seriously not keeping everyone satisfied, can't even think of who would be happy with it.<br><br>Having Mr Tan and Mr Singh to spell out the woes of the increase that will bring to our society, it is even greater pleasure that they are speaking with response from a 'measure' brought up by their own party.(But whether it is for show, we wouldn't know) I, for one is not a observer of local politics, and wouldn't know who's the MP for which district. But it would be nice to see the outcome of the debate, whether the govt is as democratic as it claims. Our DPM is not known to bow down to opposition, it would be interesting to see how he reacts to all this rebuff by fellow politicans.<br><br>What I really hate is this quote by him "We had an off-Budget package last year, we said $11.3 billion, no one blinked an eyelid... No other government can make an offset package 6 or 7 per cent of GDP, $11.3 billion, and you don't need to worry where the money has come from."<br><br>What does he mean we don't need to worry where it comes from? Off-package or not, i'm sure the money don't come from the sea around us! Does that give us a right to know anything at all? Comments?</div>

Why is such an overwhelming majority necessary unless they're a paranoid and conservative bunch?<br><br>And some here seem to feel that coalition governments are inherently unstable. Thats bullshit. We only get to see Japan, Indonesia and the worst of every cases but does anyone know that Switzerland has been under the same coalition government for decades.<br><br>I fully agree than monolithic political parties can fragment into 2 or more parties and end the current PAP monopoly. If that happens, GOOD!<br><br>The nation needs more diverse views to develop. What is important is that politicians must see that they are merely the means to an end and not an end unto itself. THEY don't own the country, WE do!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Because we got no other major party to vote for. Don't vote against PAP for the sake of opposing them. Might as well cast a void/null vote... this speaks more about the confidence we have in them.<br><br>Within PAP there are people who are willing to speak for the people, itÂ’s just that they are a minority.<br>As minority, you will get to be sent to the lower rungs of the party and become disillusioned after a while.<br>Then maybe if one stay contented at those position, the benefits may still come in. Else leave PAP?<br>If we got more people like Ong Teng Cheong within PAP, they may be still hope for Singapore.<br>SM Lee and some of the older ministers were visionaries.<br>The newer generation only cares about the monetary bottom line.<br>Where is the humanity?<br>The social divide is getting wider.
