              <p>CONDOLENCE LETTER FROM PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG ON<br> DEMISE OF JB JEYARETNAM<br> 30 September 2008</p>
              <p>Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam<br> Mr Philip Jeyaretnam</p>
              <p>Dear Kenneth and Philip Jeyaretnam</p>
              <p>I was sad to learn that your father, Mr Joshua Benjamin
              Jeyaretnam, has passed away. Mr JB Jeyaretnam was a Member of
              Parliament for Anson constituency from 1981 till 1986, and a
              Non-Constituency Member of Parliament from 1997 till 2001. He used
              to engage in heated debates in the House. Perhaps it was because he
              and the PAP never saw eye to eye on any major political issue and
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">he sought by all means to demolish
              the PAP and our system of government.</span> Unfortunately, this
              helped neither to build up a constructive opposition nor our
              Parliamentary tradition. Nevertheless, one had to respect Mr JB
              Jeyaretnam¡¯s dogged tenacity to be active in politics at his
              age.</p>
              <p>However, our differences were not personal. In 1993, one of you
              (Kenneth) wrote to Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Prime Minister,
              to say that you found employers in Singapore reluctant to offer you
              a job, and your only explanation was that the employers felt the
              authorities would not welcome your employment because of your name.
              Mr Goh replied with a letter which could be shown to prospective
              employers, to say that the government did not hold anything against
              you, and that employers should evaluate you fairly on your own
              merits, like any other candidate, because Singapore needed every
              talented person that it could find. Mr Goh had previously made the
              same point to your brother Philip, whom he had invited to lunch. I
              am therefore happy that both of you have established yourselves in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Please accept my deepest condolences.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong</p>
              <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong, JBJ is a much more respectable man compared to
              you.     There will be fewer people speaking
              well of you when you die in the future.     You
              have recovered from cancer but never have repented unlike other
              former cancer patients. We are ashame to have you as our
              PM.</p>

              <p>How come I don't see people like you all going up to give him a
              HUG when he was distributing pre-election pamphlets at MRT

              <p>It's the ultimate insult to the deceased if the condolences are

              <p>If you really respect him and want to honor him, please do so

              <p>CONDOLENCE LETTER FROM PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG ON<br>DEMISE OF JB JEYARETNAM<br>30 September 2008</p>
              <p>Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam<br>Mr Philip Jeyaretnam</p>
              <p>Dear Kenneth and Philip Jeyaretnam</p>
              <p>I was sad to learn that your father, Mr Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, has passed away. Mr JB Jeyaretnam was a Member of Parliament for Anson constituency from 1981 till 1986, and a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament from 1997 till 2001. He used to engage in heated debates in the House. Perhaps it was because he and the PAP never saw eye to eye on any major political issue and <span style="color: #ff0000;">he sought by all means to demolish the PAP and our system of government.</span> Unfortunately, this helped neither to build up a constructive opposition nor our Parliamentary tradition. Nevertheless, one had to respect Mr JB Jeyaretnam¡¯s dogged tenacity to be active in politics at his age.</p>
              <p>However, our differences were not personal. In 1993, one of you (Kenneth) wrote to Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Prime Minister, to say that you found employers in Singapore reluctant to offer you a job, and your only explanation was that the employers felt the authorities would not welcome your employment because of your name. Mr Goh replied with a letter which could be shown to prospective employers, to say that the government did not hold anything against you, and that employers should evaluate you fairly on your own merits, like any other candidate, because Singapore needed every talented person that it could find. Mr Goh had previously made the same point to your brother Philip, whom he had invited to lunch. I am therefore happy that both of you have established yourselves in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Please accept my deepest condolences.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong</p>
              <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong, JBJ is a much more respectable man compared to you.     There will be fewer people speaking well of you when you die in the future.     You have recovered from cancer but never have repented unlike other former cancer patients. We are ashame to have you as our PM.</p>
              </div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know what kind of condolence letter was that, he tried to put in his last word against a dead person. Branded him as someone who wanted to destroy the government, a system of governance based on belittling democracy so that they can retain totalitarian power.</p>
              <p>He also indirectly implied something with words such as "dogged", then discredit his inability to find employment as a consequence of his inability rather than political persecutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What a compassionate PM we have in LHL? Well, at least now he will have one less opposition to "fix", so he can devote all his time to increasing the GDP of Singapore by raising prices of necessities.</p>

              <p><strong>PM Lee, if you are unwilling to write a sincere condolence message, why bother to write?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 01 October 2008</strong></p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday wrote a condolence letter
              on the demise of JBJ, addressed to JBJ’s sons Kenneth and Philip
              Jeyaretnam.</p>
              <p>However, I find PM Lee’s condolence letter insincere and unbefitting of his stature as head of Government and the ruling party.</p>
              <p>PM Lee wrote that JBJ “<strong>used to engage in heated debates</strong>” in Parliament probably because “<strong>he
              and the PAP never saw eye to eye on any major political issue and he
              sought by all means to demolish the PAP and our system of government</strong>“.</p>
              <p>PM Lee said that this “<strong>helped neither to build up a constructive opposition nor our Parliamentary tradition</strong>“.</p>
              <p>I am deeply saddened that PM Lee has used the sorrowful passing of a
              great Opposition stalwart to make a personal attack on the late JBJ in
              an obvious attempt to press home a biased political message on behalf
              of the PAP.</p>
              <p>The people will be the judge as to whether JBJ really sought to
              demolish the PAP and Singapore’s system of Government, or whether JBJ
              sought to provide a constructive and credible alternative to the PAP
              and reform our political system for the better.</p>
              <p>At an election rally in 1988, JBJ challenged the PAP’s claim of
              being an open and transparent government, and asked whether any
              investigation had been conducted as to how the late Minister for
              National Development, Teh Cheang Wan, had obtained the tablets with
              which he had committed suicide, in the midst of being investigated for
              corruption.</p>
              <p>For this, JBJ was sued by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and
              ordered to pay damages of SGD 260,000, together with interest on the
              amount and costs.</p>
              <p>JBJ was sued twice for libel over an article he wrote in The Hammer,
              the Workers’ Party newspaper, in 1995, resulting in total damages of
              SGD 465,000 and SGD 250,000 in court costs.</p>
              <p>Eleven defamation suits were also filed against JBJ over remarks he
              made at an election rally in 1997 concerning Mr Tang Liang Hong.</p>
              <p>I wonder how PM Lee Hsien Loong can claim that JBJ had failed to
              work towards a constructive Opposition when in fact JBJ was financially
              crippled by numerous defamation suits brought against him by PAP
              leaders in an obvious attempt at keeping him out of Parliament and
              destroying his political career.</p>
              <p>PM Lee also mentioned in his condolence letter than their differences were “<strong>not personal</strong>“.</p>
              <p>Has PM Lee forgotten that after JBJ won the Anson seat in 1981,
              President Devan Nair recounted Lee Kuan Yew as telling him: “Jeyaretnam
              can’t win the infighting. I’ll tell you why. WE are in charge. Every
              government ministry and department is under our control. And in the
              infighting, he will go down for the count every time … … I will make
              him crawl on his bended knees, and beg for mercy.”</p>
              <p>Does this sound personal or impersonal?</p>
              <p>PM Lee also mentioned that Goh Chok Tong had previously helped JBJ’s
              son, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, find employment in Singapore by writing a
              letter explaining that the Government did not hold anything against him.</p>
              <p>I am saddened that PM Lee has used his condolence message to glorify
              his own colleague, Goh Chok Tong. Worse still, Goh Chok Tong’s actions
              of writing a letter urging employers to evaluate Kenneth Jeyaretnam on
              his own merits only goes to illustrate the pervasive climate of fear
              generated by the dictatorial PAP.</p>
              <p>PM Lee should not have used this sad event to drive home such a
              lop-sided political message. If PM Lee is unwilling to write a sincere
              condolence message for JBJ and keep party politics out of the equation,
              perhaps he should not have bothered to write.</p>
