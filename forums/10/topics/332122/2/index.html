              <p><strong>Singapore Goes After Dow Jones Again</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em> The island
                      republic’s attorney general files contempt charges against the
                      Wall Street Journal Asia for unfavorable editorials</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In January
                      of 1984, JB Jeyaretnam, Singapore’s then-lone opposition member
                      of parliament, and mortal enemy of then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew,
                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was acquitted by Senior District Judge Michael Khoo in a Singapore
                      court of making a false declaration about the accounts of his
                      Workers’ Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Shortly
                      after that, Senior District Judge Khoo lost his job and was
                      unceremoniously moved to the attorney-general's chambers, widely
                      considered to be a much lower posting. </span>The Jeyaretnam episode is the
                      last time on record that a high-profile case ever went against any
                      members of Singapore’s ruling Lee family or the government.</p>
              <p>Given this
                      unbroken record of legal victories, the Singapore government looks
                      set to attempt to improve on it, filing contempt of court charges
                      against the Wall Street Journal Asia for three articles published in
                      June and July that “impugn the impartiality, integrity and
                      independence of the Singapore judiciary,” according to the
                      complaint. “These allegations and insinuations are
                      unwarranted.”</p>
              <p>One of the
                      editorials concerned a 72-page report by the International Bar
                      Association that has become an embarrassment both to the government
                      and the Lee family. In a court case against the embattled opposition
                      leader Chee Soon Juan, Lee Kuan Yew testified under oath that the
                      Singapore Law Society had received a laudatory letter from the
                      association, praising Singapore’s judicial system.  Instead,
                      the 72-page report, titled “Prosperity versus individual
                      rights? Human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Singapore,”
                      makes 18 recommendations which the association urges the Singapore
                      government to implement as a matter of priority. </p>
              <p>Singapore’s
                      government, the report continues, “is currently failing to meet
                      established international standards in these areas.” Reports of
                      opposition candidates being targeted for criticizing the government,
                      it says, “are of significant concern and threaten democracy and
                      the rule of law in Singapore.” It describes an “apparent
                      climate of fear and self-censorship surrounding the press in
                      Singapore,” and that the “increasing tendency for high
                      profile and respected publications to pay large out-of-court
                      settlements to avoid litigation with PAP officials and the continued
                      run of success within in-court claims is worrying.”</p>
              <p>The
                      Journal’s editorial called the report a 'good primer' on
                      Singapore's use of defamation suits against opposition politicians
                      and the foreign press.</p>
              <p>Christine
                      Glancey, the managing editor of the newspaper, now owned by Rupert
                      Murdoch’s News Corp., said she would have no comment and
                      referred all questions to Robert Christie, Dow Jones corporate
                      spokesman in New York. The contempt charges, and another case hanging
                      fire in Singapore against the Far Eastern Economic Review, another
                      Dow Jones publication, are rapidly becoming a test of News Corp’s
                      nerve. It is the first time News Corp, which in the past has shown
                      little stomach for taking on governments, has come up against the
                      immovable object that is the Singapore regime, as other publishers
                      have, usually to their sorrow.</p>
              <p>The
                      decision to file contempt charges comes a few days after another
                      Singapore judge, Justice Woo Bih Li encouraged lawyers for the Prime
                      Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan
                      Yew, to amend their defamation petition against the Far Eastern
                      Economic Review to make sure they included Woo’s own more
                      defamatory reading of an article about the two ministers.  Woo’s
                      ruling, two years after the filing of the original charges, appeared
                      to be unprecedented.</p>
              <p>Singapore
                      and the Lee family have long been famous for suing journalists, both
                      foreign and domestic – and they have never lost a suit in
                      Singapore. The Far Eastern Economic Review was a favorite target. The
                      media watchdog organization Reporters Without Borders ranks Singapore
                      140th out of 167 countries surveyed in terms of freedom of the press.
                      The country has been kicking foreign journalists out for writing
                      critical articles about the republic since the early 1970s.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> An
                      official enquiry requested by Jeyaretnam into allegations of
                      executive interference in judiciary appointments in the wake of
                      Khoo’s demotion found that there was no truth to the claims.</span></p>
              <p>In
                      fact, Justice T S Sinnathuray, the sole commissioner who examined the
                      case, said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"The wholly unfounded allegations of Mr Jeyaretnam
                      (of executive interference) were scandalous statements that should
                      never have been made."</span></p>

              A man who stood by his beliefs, never backing away or compromising the values
              he believed in. Even in the face of relentless persecution. He will be revered
