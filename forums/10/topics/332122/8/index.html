              <p><br>of course u cannot compare SG and MYm lah, Mynamar is a matter of shortage of jobs and deprive citizen of foods by increasing price tremedously, in other words, their citizens especially the kampong side will be starve to death..it is a matter of life and death, whether to protest or not to protest, still hv to die, might as well protest and hope for the best.</p>

              <p>Unlike Singapore, MacDonalds, Kuay teow me, meepok, laksa, durians, jack place, crystal palace, etc etc etc..no food problem, plenty of jobs..good life..or at least better life than most other third world countries that even our bread can talk</p>

              <p>But unfortunately, I have to admit I have not done anything for this great man. I never had the chance to vote for him as I was not eligible to vote when he was running in the GE last time. Whether or not you like the man or not, it is there for all to see that the man had guts and backbone and was willing to fight for his beliefs. Can't really say the same about most of the MPs and ministers in parliament these days.</p>

              have the same type of hypocrisy condolences as JBJ when they are
              DEAD in the future.</p>
              <p>You should open your eyes and start to see people for who they
              are instead of all the wayang actions that they do to express their
              unsincere righteousness. It's call detecting hypocrites. Can you
              even detect any hypocrites in here?</p>
              <p>No you can't, cos you're too blind.</p>

              <p>Which is why the more I admire JBJ for his courage and commitment to Singapore.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Jeyaretnam,<br> <br> I visited you one last time on Tuesday. I've never seen you so
                                      peaceful and contented.<br> <br> This is such a change from all the years that we've been working
                                      together. I remember how bitter we felt sitting in your rented
                                      apartment at Orange Grove Road after the 1997 elections. The place
                                      has since been turned into swank, upscale serviced-apartments. We
                                      were drafting a letter to the United Nations to ask for the
                                      monitoring of future elections here.<br> <br> It was a tedious job recounting everything that had happened: the
                                      hounding of Tang Liang Hong, the threats made against voters, and
                                      the gatecrashing of polling stations by ministers. The task was
                                      made lighter only with the delightful combination of the savoury
                                      Indian <em>vadai</em> and Earl Grey you served.<br> <br> I remember also asking you about the copy of <em>Long Walk to
                                      Freedom</em> by Nelson Mandela sitting on your coffee table. You
                                      said that once in a long while, there comes a man who achieves
                                      greatness without having to cause the suffering of others.<br> <br> On another occasion, my wife and I visited you at another rented
                                      house. From the outside, we could see a few of your shirts hanging
                                      by the window ledge on the upper floor. Mei said that she felt
                                      sorry that you had to do your own laundry at your age without
                                      anyone sharing those chores with you.<br> <br> This reminds me of the time when we were driving along Serangoon
                                      Road and you wanted to stop by to pick up a bunch of flowers. I had
                                      asked you what the occasion was. You said it was your wedding
                                      anniversary and that your late wife, Margaret, would have liked the
                                      bouquet.<br> <br> Then there was the time when we visited New York City. I was
                                      surprised when you mentioned that that was the first time you had
                                      set foot in the US. We had checked into this small hotel and
                                      struggled with our luggage along the narrow and dingy corridor. And
                                      as I fumbled for the key to open the door, I heard you mutter to
                                      yourself: "Oh Ben, what have you gotten yourself into?"<br> <br> My heart sank when I heard you say that. I was feeling a little
                                      depressed myself and I was hoping to get some cheer from you.
                                      Seeing you so despondent made my own morale wobble.<br> <br> But I knew that you were feeling depressed and anxious because of
                                      yet another lawsuit. As we put our weary heads on the emaciated
                                      pillows, you said that they didn't just want to win politically but
                                      were determined to also crush us personally.<br> <br> We made a pact that night that while we may not yet be able to beat
                                      them politically, we would not allow them to defeat us on the
                                      personal front. They may take away all our possessions, but they
                                      will never take away our will to speak up. And then you said that
                                      we needed to rest as “tomorrow's another day that we have to
                                      fight.”<br> <br> The next morning I came out from the shower and saw you reading the
                                      Bible. We talked a little about the Book of Ecclesiastes. Then you
                                      knelt down by the bed to say a prayer and I joined you. We prayed
                                      for strength and sustenance.<br> <br> Rejuvenated, we went down to what New Yorkers call a “deli” for
                                      breakfast. I remember you asking me what a bagel was and I said
                                      that it was the American version of the <em>vadai</em>. You
                                      chortled and we mouthed down a couple of Ham and Cheeses. Actually,
                                      I did. You found the bagels a little too hard.<br> <br> During breakfast we talked about setting up an NGO to advocate
                                      transparency and democracy in Singapore. When we came back, we had
                                      a bit of a laugh seeing how the gentleman at the Registry of
                                      Companies squirmed as he tried to handle our application for the
                                      "Open Singapore Foundation".<br> <br> After rejecting the term "Foundation", "Institute" and a couple of
                                      others, the ROC finally allowed the use of "Centre". Thus was born
                                      the first human rights NGO in Singapore.<br> <br> We left New York and you headed south to Florida to visit your son.
                                      When you returned, you bought my daughter a little pink teddy bear.
                                      It squeaks when you press its tummy. When she was a little older,
                                      we told her who bought it for her. She named it “JB Bear" because
                                      she couldn't quite pronounce your name.<br> <br> My wife said that it was funny to think of this cute little pink
                                      bear and picture you at the same time, a big elderly man with bushy
                                      hair and your trademark "mutton chops". You always made her jump a
                                      little whenever your voice boomed through the phone: "Is that you,
                                      Mei?"<br> <br> Several months later, your worst nightmare came true. You were
                                      found guilty of defamation again and you now had to vacate your
                                      seat in Parliament for the second time. I remember talking to you
                                      on the phone after your appeal was rejected. You sounded so
                                      crestfallen.<br> <br> I had asked you if you wanted to talk, but you said that you just
                                      wanted to be "alone for a while." The next day we met for lunch
                                      near your office at North Bridge Road. We got into a heated
                                      argument. I had asked you not to continue paying the money and
                                      playing into the hands of Lee and his people.<br> <br> I knew you were angry at me for saying so, but I also knew that you
                                      wanted me to be honest with you. Through the years, we have had our
                                      clashes and disagreements. But we always knew that we were locked
                                      in spirit and that we would always remain true to each other and to
                                      what we believed in. No matter how serious our disagreements, we
                                      always stood on the same side.<br> <br> As you lay down to rest, democracy is not yet at hand. But don't
                                      you ever believe those who say that your fight on earth was
                                      irrelevant and personal. Nothing could be further from the truth.
                                      You have inspired an entire generation of Singaporeans and we will
                                      keep the fight going.<br> <br> We will keep on reaching for that star in the black sky, that
                                      shimmering distant star of liberty. If we are closer to touching
                                      it, it is because we stand on your shoulders.<br> <br> Your legacy and walk on earth will not only remain but it will
                                      grow. You have left a void that cannot be filled.<br> <br> I think of that night in New York when we pledged not to let them
                                      defeat our persons. You've kept your end of the pact. They may
                                      still have the power but, boy, you sure showed them what a fighter
                                      for truth is. You leave us with honour and dignity, no one could
                                      buy you over and no one did. And even though you did not possess
                                      millions in your bank account, the treasure which you have stored
                                      is with you today and forever.<br> <br> Goodbye, Ben, I will miss you.<br> <br> But even as I mourn your death, I celebrate your life because it
                                      has touched mine. You have fought the good fight and now you have
                                      been called home to rest. They cannot hurt you anymore. Until we
                                      meet again, dear friend, I will always remain<br> <br> Yours in Justice and Freedom,<br> <br> Soon Juan</p>

The task was made lighter only with the delightful combination of the savoury Indian <em>vadai</em> and Earl Grey you served.<br><br>I remember also asking you about the copy of <em>Long Walk to Freedom</em> by Nelson Mandela sitting on your coffee table. You said that once in a long while, there comes a man who achieves greatness without having to cause the suffering of others.<br><br>On another occasion, my wife and I visited you at another rented house. From the outside, we could see a few of your shirts hanging by the window ledge on the upper floor. Mei said that she felt sorry that you had to do your own laundry at your age without anyone sharing those chores with you.<br><br>This reminds me of the time when we were driving along Serangoon Road and you wanted to stop by to pick up a bunch of flowers. I had asked you what the occasion was. You said it was your wedding anniversary and that your late wife, Margaret, would have liked the bouquet.<br><br>Then there was the time when we visited New York City. I was surprised when you mentioned that that was the first time you had set foot in the US. We had checked into this small hotel and struggled with our luggage along the narrow and dingy corridor. And as I fumbled for the key to open the door, I heard you mutter to yourself: "Oh Ben, what have you gotten yourself into?"<br><br>My heart sank when I heard you say that. I was feeling a little depressed myself and I was hoping to get some cheer from you. Seeing you so despondent made my own morale wobble.<br><br>But I knew that you were feeling depressed and anxious because of yet another lawsuit. As we put our weary heads on the emaciated pillows, you said that they didn't just want to win politically but were determined to also crush us personally.<br><br>We made a pact that night that while we may not yet be able to beat them politically, we would not allow them to defeat us on the personal front. They may take away all our possessions, but they will never take away our will to speak up. And then you said that we needed to rest as “tomorrow's another day that we have to fight.”<br><br>The next morning I came out from the shower and saw you reading the Bible. We talked a little about the Book of Ecclesiastes. Then you knelt down by the bed to say a prayer and I joined you. We prayed for strength and sustenance.<br><br>Rejuvenated, we went down to what New Yorkers call a “deli” for breakfast. I remember you asking me what a bagel was and I said that it was the American version of the <em>vadai</em>. You chortled and we mouthed down a couple of Ham and Cheeses. Actually, I did. You found the bagels a little too hard.<br><br>During breakfast we talked about setting up an NGO to advocate transparency and democracy in Singapore. When we came back, we had a bit of a laugh seeing how the gentleman at the Registry of Companies squirmed as he tried to handle our application for the "Open Singapore Foundation".<br><br>After rejecting the term "Foundation", "Institute" and a couple of others, the ROC finally allowed the use of "Centre". Thus was born the first human rights NGO in Singapore.<br><br>We left New York and you headed south to Florida to visit your son. When you returned, you bought my daughter a little pink teddy bear. It squeaks when you press its tummy. When she was a little older, we told her who bought it for her. She named it “JB Bear" because she couldn't quite pronounce your name.<br><br>My wife said that it was funny to think of this cute little pink bear and picture you at the same time, a big elderly man with bushy hair and your trademark "mutton chops". You always made her jump a little whenever your voice boomed through the phone: "Is that you, Mei?"<br><br>Several months later, your worst nightmare came true. You were found guilty of defamation again and you now had to vacate your seat in Parliament for the second time. I remember talking to you on the phone after your appeal was rejected. You sounded so crestfallen.<br><br>I had asked you if you wanted to talk, but you said that you just wanted to be "alone for a while." The next day we met for lunch near your office at North Bridge Road. We got into a heated argument. I had asked you not to continue paying the money and playing into the hands of Lee and his people.<br><br>I knew you were angry at me for saying so, but I also knew that you wanted me to be honest with you. Through the years, we have had our clashes and disagreements. But we always knew that we were locked in spirit and that we would always remain true to each other and to what we believed in. No matter how serious our disagreements, we always stood on the same side.<br><br>As you lay down to rest, democracy is not yet at hand. But don't you ever believe those who say that your fight on earth was irrelevant and personal. Nothing could be further from the truth. You have inspired an entire generation of Singaporeans and we will keep the fight going.<br><br>We will keep on reaching for that star in the black sky, that shimmering distant star of liberty. If we are closer to touching it, it is because we stand on your shoulders.<br><br>Your legacy and walk on earth will not only remain but it will grow. You have left a void that cannot be filled.<br><br>I think of that night in New York when we pledged not to let them defeat our persons. You've kept your end of the pact. They may still have the power but, boy, you sure showed them what a fighter for truth is. You leave us with honour and dignity, no one could buy you over and no one did. And even though you did not possess millions in your bank account, the treasure which you have stored is with you today and forever.<br><br>Goodbye, Ben, I will miss you.<br><br>But even as I mourn your death, I celebrate your life because it has touched mine. You have fought the good fight and now you have been called home to rest. They cannot hurt you anymore.

              <p>Posted by admin on 
              				October 3, 2008</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive04/jbj4.jpg" alt="" align="right"></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 03 October 2008</strong></p>
              <p>My very first encounter with Mr Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam (JBJ) was at a small coffeeshop along Peck Seah Street in May 2007.</p>
              <p>JBJ had rallied friends, supporters, and other interested parties to
              come together to discuss the formation of a new political party.</p>
              <p>He spoke in great earnest, making sure everyone understood the urgent need to press on with the Opposition Cause.</p>
              <p>JBJ looked at me in the eye and told me with a voice filled with
              conviction what needed to be done to reform Singapore’s political
              system. He carefully explained why he wanted to campaign for power to
              be restored to the people, why the concentration of unbridled power in
              the Executive was detrimental to Singapore.</p>
              <p>That first encounter with JBJ was to become one of several, and each
              time I met him and each time he spoke at in-door seminars, I tried my
              best to learn something from him. His wisdom and his great many years
              of experience never failed to touch me every time I heard him speak.</p>
              <p>Over time, I realized that my previous impressions of JBJ that I had
              garnered from the mainstream media were quite distorted, and the
              mainstream media never quite conveyed to the public the real values
              that JBJ stood for.</p>
              <p>In real life, JBJ was a passionate man who was filled with purpose
              and conviction, and he believed greatly in human rights, democracy, and
              civil rights for all Singaporeans. He believed in the need for
              independent trade unions, a free and independent media, and an
              independent Electoral Commission. JBJ also believed in the need for a
              independent judicial commission which would have the power to appoint
              judges, and that this power should be taken away from the prime
              minister.</p>
              <p>In June this year, the Reform Party was officially registered, and
              the inauguration dinner was held on 11 July 08. The turnout at the
              dinner was very impressive, and all Opposition parties took part in the
              joy and the festivities. It was the most spectacular show of Opposition
              unity in a long time.</p>
              <p>Now, with JBJ’s passing, the Opposition must continue to strengthen
              itself and make that unity shown at the inauguration dinner become a
              reality and a permanent fixture in our political landscape.</p>
              <p>The Opposition should work hand-in-hand with NGOs to foster greater
              awareness of social, economic and political issues amongst the masses,
              and work to break the gridlock of fear generated by decades of
              high-handed PAP rule.</p>
              <p>The Opposition should also develop the competency to address
              national issues and formulate effective, workable alternative policies
              to replace the policies of the Government that pay scant attention to
              the needs of the working class.</p>
              <p>While JBJ has passed on to a better world, his work must continue.
              The legacy that he has left us will forever be an inspiration to us, a
              call for us to embrace the movement, to preserve and honour what has
              been done, and to finish what has been left uncompleted.</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><br> 30 September 2008</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><br> Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam<br> Mr Philip Jeyaretnam</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><br> Dear Kenneth and Philip Jeyaretnam</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><br> I was sad to learn that your father, Mr Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, has passed away.<br> Mr JB Jeyaretnam was a Member of Parliament for Anson constituency from
                  1981 till 1986, and a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament from 1997
                  till 2001. He used to engage in heated debates in the House.<strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Perhaps
                  it was because he and the PAP never saw eye to eye on any major
                  political issue and he sought by all means to demolish the PAP and our
                  system of government. Unfortunately, this helped neither to build up a
                  constructive opposition nor our Parliamentary tradition.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> Nevertheless, one had to respect Mr JB Jeyaretnam’s dogged tenacity to be active in politics at his age.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">However, our differences were not personal. <strong>In
                  1993, one of you (Kenneth) wrote to Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then
                  Prime Minister, to say that you found employers in Singapore reluctant
                  to offer you a job, and your only explanation was that the employers
                  felt the authorities would not welcome your employment because of your
                  name. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>Mr Goh replied with a letter which could be shown to prospective
                  employers, to say that the government did not hold anything against
                  you, and that employers should evaluate you fairly on your own merits,
                  like any other candidate, because Singapore needed every talented
                  person that it could find.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> Mr Goh had previously made the same
                  point to your brother Philip, whom he had invited to lunch. I am
                  therefore happy that both of you have established yourselves in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Please accept my deepest condolences.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Never on a bended knee: a tribute to JBJ</strong></p>
              <p class="Intro_Text">by James Gomez</p>
              <p>To
                  be a genuine democrat in Singapore is to have been touched by JB
                  Jeyaretnam. Whether as an individual, member of a civil society group
                  or an opposition party one way or another we would all have come across
                  or had some direct contact with JBJ. That`s why his loss in so personal
                  to us and that`s why we feel his absence very directly.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0mm 0mm 0pt;"> <span lang="EN-GB">My
                  first direct contact with JBJ was in 1988 when as President, of the
                  Philosophy Society and a first year undergraduate at NUS, I invited him
                  to speak on Political Freedoms in Singapore on campus. You can only
                  imagine what kind of university red tape and nay saying I had to face
                  from fellow undergraduates in organising that talk. Nevertheless we
                  succeeded, and he spoke to a full house at Lecture Hall 11. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0mm 0mm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0mm 0mm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">In
                  2001, I had the opportunity to organise with others the Save JBJ Rally.
                  More red tape again but again the organisers prevailed and we managed
                  to pull the event off. Later in 2003, it was my pleasure and privilege

                  and this is something we need to build on. More importantly the tone of
                  the struggle needs to be borne in mind. If you want to take on the PAP,
                  it should never be on a bended knee. That much I have learnt from JBJ.</p>

              <p><strong>OPEN LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS CABINET</strong><br><br>30 September 2008<br><br>Dear Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet Members<br><br>By all accounts, we have lost a figure of uncommon strength and conviction in Mr JB Jeyaretnam.<br><br>No
              matter which side of the political fence we stand, it is undeniable
              that Mr JBJ, as he will be fondly remembered, has fought long and hard
              for what he believed was good for Singapore and, good for Singaporeans.<br><br>Mr
              JBJ did all he could with all he could. In staying the course, he has
              undoubtedly performed a public duty as a citizen of Singapore and,
              amply demonstrated the public spirit, the commitment to country and,
              the "nation before self" maxim that the government has sought to
              propagate.<br><br>As Singaporeans we are proud that such a man as Mr
              JBJ walked among us. We appreciate the sacrifices Mr JBJ has made for
              his beliefs in serving the people of Singapore . We are equally proud
              that the government, in spite of its political differences, has
              acknowledged the same resilience and service to nation in Mr JBJ.<br><br>Mr
              JBJ is an icon - an individual who stood up to serve the country and
              who stood tall for his beliefs and principles. As citizens of Singapore
              , we hope that Mr JBJ's public spiritedness and love of the law can be
              preserved in the following manner:<br><br>1) a professorial chair in
              the name of Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam be created in the Faculty of
              Law, National University of Singapore and,<br><br>2) A scholarship fund
              in the name of Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam for graduate studies in
              political science and/or constitutional law and/or civil society
              studies.<br><br>We also humbly ask the government to further
              demonstrate its commitment to public spiritedness and active citizenry
              by taking the lead to provide the seed fund for the above honours for
              others to follow.<br><br>We look forward to your encouragement as we mourn the loss of one of Singapore's better sons.<br><br><br>Yours in good faith,<br><br>Dana Lam Yoke Kiew (SXXXXXXXH)<br>Braema Mathi (SXXXXXXXG)<br>Siew Kum Hong (SXXXXXXXE)<br>Au Wai Pang (SXXXXXXXJ)<br>Manohar P Sabnani (SXXXXXXXA)<br>Teri Teo Shiwen (SXXXXXXXI)<br>Constance Singam (SXXXXXXXE)<br>Cheng U Wen, Lena (SXXXXXXXD)<br>Lim Siew Wai, William (SXXXXXXXD)<br>Benedict Jacob-Thambiah (SXXXXXXXI)<br>T Sasitharan (SXXXXXXXZ)<br>Stephanie Chok (SXXXXXXXB)<br>Heng Hiang Khng (SXXXXXXXE)<br>Jacqueline Tan (SXXXXXXXC)<br>Serene Yap (SXXXXXXXG)</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Jeyaretnam,<br> <br> I visited you one last time on Tuesday. I've never seen you so
              peaceful and contented.<br> <br> This is such a change from all the years that we've been working
              together. I remember how bitter we felt sitting in your rented
              apartment at Orange Grove Road after the 1997 elections. The place
              has since been turned into swank, upscale serviced-apartments. We
              were drafting a letter to the United Nations to ask for the
              monitoring of future elections here.<br> <br> It was a tedious job recounting everything that had happened: the
              hounding of Tang Liang Hong, the threats made against voters, and
              the gatecrashing of polling stations by ministers. The task was
              made lighter only with the delightful combination of the savoury
              Indian <em>vadai</em> and Earl Grey you served.<br> <br> I remember also asking you about the copy of <em>Long Walk to
              Freedom</em> by Nelson Mandela sitting on your coffee table. You
              said that once in a long while, there comes a man who achieves
              greatness without having to cause the suffering of others.<br> <br> On another occasion, my wife and I visited you at another rented
              house. From the outside, we could see a few of your shirts hanging
              by the window ledge on the upper floor. Mei said that she felt
              sorry that you had to do your own laundry at your age without
              anyone sharing those chores with you.<br> <br> This reminds me of the time when we were driving along Serangoon
              Road and you wanted to stop by to pick up a bunch of flowers. I had
              asked you what the occasion was. You said it was your wedding
              anniversary and that your late wife, Margaret, would have liked the
              bouquet.<br> <br> Then there was the time when we visited New York City. I was
              surprised when you mentioned that that was the first time you had
              set foot in the US. We had checked into this small hotel and
              struggled with our luggage along the narrow and dingy corridor. And
              as I fumbled for the key to open the door, I heard you mutter to
              yourself: "Oh Ben, what have you gotten yourself into?"<br> <br> My heart sank when I heard you say that. I was feeling a little
              depressed myself and I was hoping to get some cheer from you.
              Seeing you so despondent made my own morale wobble.<br> <br> But I knew that you were feeling depressed and anxious because of
              yet another lawsuit. As we put our weary heads on the emaciated
              pillows, you said that they didn't just want to win politically but
              were determined to also crush us personally.<br> <br> We made a pact that night that while we may not yet be able to beat
              them politically, we would not allow them to defeat us on the
              personal front. They may take away all our possessions, but they
              will never take away our will to speak up. And then you said that
              we needed to rest as “tomorrow's another day that we have to
              fight.”<br> <br> The next morning I came out from the shower and saw you reading the
              Bible. We talked a little about the Book of Ecclesiastes. Then you
              knelt down by the bed to say a prayer and I joined you. We prayed
              for strength and sustenance.<br> <br> Rejuvenated, we went down to what New Yorkers call a “deli” for
              breakfast. I remember you asking me what a bagel was and I said
              that it was the American version of the <em>vadai</em>. You
              chortled and we mouthed down a couple of Ham and Cheeses. Actually,
              I did. You found the bagels a little too hard.<br> <br> During breakfast we talked about setting up an NGO to advocate
              transparency and democracy in Singapore. When we came back, we had
              a bit of a laugh seeing how the gentleman at the Registry of
              Companies squirmed as he tried to handle our application for the
              "Open Singapore Foundation".<br> <br> After rejecting the term "Foundation", "Institute" and a couple of
              others, the ROC finally allowed the use of "Centre". Thus was born
              the first human rights NGO in Singapore.<br> <br> We left New York and you headed south to Florida to visit your son.
              When you returned, you bought my daughter a little pink teddy bear.
              It squeaks when you press its tummy. When she was a little older,
              we told her who bought it for her. She named it “JB Bear" because
              she couldn't quite pronounce your name.<br> <br> My wife said that it was funny to think of this cute little pink
              bear and picture you at the same time, a big elderly man with bushy
              hair and your trademark "mutton chops". You always made her jump a
              little whenever your voice boomed through the phone: "Is that you,
              Mei?"<br> <br> Several months later, your worst nightmare came true. You were
              found guilty of defamation again and you now had to vacate your
              seat in Parliament for the second time. I remember talking to you
              on the phone after your appeal was rejected. You sounded so
              crestfallen.<br> <br> I had asked you if you wanted to talk, but you said that you just
              wanted to be "alone for a while." The next day we met for lunch
              near your office at North Bridge Road. We got into a heated
              argument. I had asked you not to continue paying the money and
              playing into the hands of Lee and his people.<br> <br> I knew you were angry at me for saying so, but I also knew that you
              wanted me to be honest with you. Through the years, we have had our
              clashes and disagreements. But we always knew that we were locked
              in spirit and that we would always remain true to each other and to
              what we believed in. No matter how serious our disagreements, we
              always stood on the same side.<br> <br> As you lay down to rest, democracy is not yet at hand. But don't
              you ever believe those who say that your fight on earth was
              irrelevant and personal. Nothing could be further from the truth.
              You have inspired an entire generation of Singaporeans and we will
              keep the fight going.<br> <br> We will keep on reaching for that star in the black sky, that
              shimmering distant star of liberty. If we are closer to touching
              it, it is because we stand on your shoulders.<br> <br> Your legacy and walk on earth will not only remain but it will
              grow. You have left a void that cannot be filled.<br> <br> I think of that night in New York when we pledged not to let them
              defeat our persons. You've kept your end of the pact. They may
              still have the power but, boy, you sure showed them what a fighter
              for truth is. You leave us with honour and dignity, no one could
              buy you over and no one did. And even though you did not possess
              millions in your bank account, the treasure which you have stored
              is with you today and forever.<br> <br> Goodbye, Ben, I will miss you.<br> <br> But even as I mourn your death, I celebrate your life because it
              has touched mine. You have fought the good fight and now you have
              been called home to rest. They cannot hurt you anymore. Until we
              meet again, dear friend, I will always remain<br> <br> Yours in Justice and Freedom,<br> <br> Soon Juan</p>
