              <p>It is shameless that only on the passing of JBJ, he was finally given air-time on ChannelnewsAsia which never failed to put in some good words for the PAP.</p>
              <p>CNA repeated broadcast had explained PM LHL's words of condolence without second thoughts to the words used; while SM GCT was given particular prominence for his personal efforts - when as PM, he had given letters to JBJ's sons clearly stating that the Government do not persecute the sons and that it is safe for them to be employed.</p>
              <p>Truly, PAP's governance must be recognised for bringing Singapore's politics - in a supposedly sophisticated and developed First World environment - to need such letters for the family members of the Opposition Parties to be employed.</p>
              <p>While the citizens of the First World enjoy values as a matter of Citizens' Rights,  Singaporeans only get it as it is dispense with the courtesy of the Political Leaders.</p>
              <p>This is uniquely Singapore, where the leaders enjoy salaries better then the First World Leaders, while Singaporean Citizens struggle to make ends meet, and look for the tightly controlled space to cry out.</p>
              <p>Before Barak Obama popularise the word "CHANGE" in his 2008 Presidential Campaign, our Singapore JBJ had already recognised Singaporean's hunger for "CHANGE" in his electoral campaigns in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>It was the PAP abusing the privileges of Government - by changing laws that have bastardised the original spirit of the Singapore Constitution - to keep themselves in a stronger position, and mobilising their ability to monopolise all print and broadcast media to have a better grip on the amount of information that reaches Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With better educated Singaporeans able to think on their feet, and more aware of the changing economic circumstances that the PAP cannot control despite all the Singaporean sacrifices and tolerance given to the PAP abuses to the Rights guaranteed by the Singapore Constitution - "CHANGE" may happen.</p>

              <p>Regards to condolence letters from PM and SM:</p>
              <p>"Mr JB Jeyaretnam was a Member of Parliament for Anson constituency from
                  1981 till 1986, and a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament from 1997
                  till 2001. He used to engage in heated debates in the House. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perhaps it
                  was because he and the PAP never saw eye to eye on any major political
                  issue and he sought by all means to demolish the PAP and our system of
                  government.</span> Unfortunately, this helped neither to build up a
                  constructive opposition nor our Parliamentary tradition.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Nevertheless,
                  one had to respect Mr JB Jeyaretnam’s <strong>dogged</strong> tenacity to be active in
                  politics at his age.</span>" --PM Lee</p>
              <p>"What do I remember or respect most about Mr J B Jeyaretnam? Even though I did not agree with his political cause, I respect his fighting sprit to advance it and <strong>his willingness to pay a price for it</strong>." --SM Goh</p>
