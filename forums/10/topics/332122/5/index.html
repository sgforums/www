              <p><strong>PM Lee, if you are unwilling to write a sincere condolence message, why bother to write?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br>01 October 2008</strong></p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday wrote a condolence letter on the demise of JBJ, addressed to JBJ’s sons Kenneth and Philip Jeyaretnam.</p>
              <p>However, I find PM Lee’s condolence letter insincere and unbefitting of his stature as head of Government and the ruling party.</p>
              <p>PM Lee wrote that JBJ “<strong>used to engage in heated debates</strong>” in Parliament probably because “<strong>he and the PAP never saw eye to eye on any major political issue and he sought by all means to demolish the PAP and our system of government</strong>“.</p>
              <p>PM Lee said that this “<strong>helped neither to build up a constructive opposition nor our Parliamentary tradition</strong>“.</p>
              <p>I am deeply saddened that PM Lee has used the sorrowful passing of a great Opposition stalwart to make a personal attack on the late JBJ in an obvious attempt to press home a biased political message on behalf of the PAP.</p>
              <p>The people will be the judge as to whether JBJ really sought to demolish the PAP and Singapore’s system of Government, or whether JBJ sought to provide a constructive and credible alternative to the PAP and reform our political system for the better.</p>
              <p>At an election rally in 1988, JBJ challenged the PAP’s claim of being an open and transparent government, and asked whether any investigation had been conducted as to how the late Minister for National Development, Teh Cheang Wan, had obtained the tablets with which he had committed suicide, in the midst of being investigated for corruption.</p>
              <p>For this, JBJ was sued by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and ordered to pay damages of SGD 260,000, together with interest on the amount and costs.</p>
              <p>JBJ was sued twice for libel over an article he wrote in The Hammer, the Workers’ Party newspaper, in 1995, resulting in total damages of SGD 465,000 and SGD 250,000 in court costs.</p>
              <p>Eleven defamation suits were also filed against JBJ over remarks he made at an election rally in 1997 concerning Mr Tang Liang Hong.</p>
              <p>I wonder how PM Lee Hsien Loong can claim that JBJ had failed to work towards a constructive Opposition when in fact JBJ was financially crippled by numerous defamation suits brought against him by PAP leaders in an obvious attempt at keeping him out of Parliament and destroying his political career.</p>
              <p>PM Lee also mentioned in his condolence letter than their differences were “<strong>not personal</strong>“.</p>
              <p>Has PM Lee forgotten that after JBJ won the Anson seat in 1981, President Devan Nair recounted Lee Kuan Yew as telling him: “Jeyaretnam can’t win the infighting. I’ll tell you why. WE are in charge. Every government ministry and department is under our control. And in the infighting, he will go down for the count every time … … I will make him crawl on his bended knees, and beg for mercy.”</p>
              <p>Does this sound personal or impersonal?</p>
              <p>PM Lee also mentioned that Goh Chok Tong had previously helped JBJ’s son, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, find employment in Singapore by writing a letter explaining that the Government did not hold anything against him.</p>
              <p>I am saddened that PM Lee has used his condolence message to glorify his own colleague, Goh Chok Tong. Worse still, Goh Chok Tong’s actions of writing a letter urging employers to evaluate Kenneth Jeyaretnam on his own merits only goes to illustrate the pervasive climate of fear generated by the dictatorial PAP.</p>
              <p>PM Lee should not have used this sad event to drive home such a lop-sided political message. If PM Lee is unwilling to write a sincere condolence message for JBJ and keep party politics out of the equation, perhaps he should not have bothered to write.</p>

Then he gave my Dad a newspaper to read, my Dad never really read it, so i read it in our car while munching on kitkat, and from then on that changed my political view of Singapore. And also i started eating kitkat.</p>

              <p>I don't know what kind of condolence letter was that, he tried to put in his last word against a dead person. Branded him as someone who wanted to destroy the government, a system of governance based on belittling democracy so that they can retain totalitarian power.</p>
              <p>He also indirectly implied something with words such as "dogged", then discredit his inability to find employment as a consequence of his inability rather than political persecutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What a compassionate PM we have in LHL? Well, at least now he will have one less opposition to "fix", so he can devote all his time to increasing the GDP of Singapore by raising prices of necessities.</p>
