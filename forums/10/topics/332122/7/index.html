              <p><br>When JBJ first started butting his head at LKY and the PAP during the late 1970s through the 1980s - he was lampooned and derided by LKY and the PAP supporters, in the same manner that CSJ is being treated since he entered politics in the 1990s.</p>
              <p>The methods of JBJ and CSJ are no different - with both attempting to change the political ground rules that have been moulded by the Ruling Party, to give the obvious advantage for themselves, and putting Singaporeans in a political vacuum - out of the reach of any Alternative Views and Politics generated by the Alternative Parties.</p>
              <p>As much as JBJ was laughed at and ridiculed - by LKY and the PAP machinery - for all his personal efforts, CSJ is given the same treatment by some fence-sitting Singaporeans adopting the same PAP thoughtlessness - and believe that they know better then these Politicians in "how to face and challenge the PAP based on rules created by the PAP for the PAP".</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should remember JBJ's contribution over the last twenty odd years, and remember to place squarely the -</p>
              <p>Shame on LKY for tormenting JBJ - when being the pre-eminent Political Leader of a country that LKY had hoped to mould into First World Status - LKY could have behaved in politically less churlish ways towards JBJ.</p>
              <p>Shame on LKY for not keeping to his words - when he challenged JBJ to appeal to the Privy Council for the conviction in the Singapore High Courts - promising JBJ that he would personally seek a Presidential Pardon if the Privy Council should find the High Court rulings to be erroneous.</p>
              <p>** (The Privy Council did find that JBJ have been wronged by the Singapore High Court, and that the District Court Judge Michael Khoo was correct in not ruling against JBJ - and Michael Khoo was himself demoted as a District Court Judge for absolving JBJ and to be a Public Prosecutor in the Attorney-General's Chambers.)</p>
              <p>Shame on LKY for lying to Singaporeans that Singaporeans are living in comparable standards that are equal to the First World, when the Ethics of Political Life and the Economic Conditions for Singaporeans are no better then Third World standards.</p>

              <p>6 months ago, I saw JBJ selling book outside the MRT. Most people just walk past him like he never existed. When he needed help to get out of bankruptcy, where were all the people? When the govt jail him, nobody protested everyone was silent. When he spoke up, he was put down by the press the Stratits Times as a dangerous man of bad ideas. <br><br>Yet when he died, there was an outpouring of grief. The word hero was used - people said he is respected. The Straits Times called him a man of integrity. Even PAP MPs called him a great fighter. Bloggers wrote great tributes to a great man...... <br><br>I've never seen so much hippocrisy in my life. Men who crushed him, destroyed him then turned around to say they respect him. The Singaporeans who were silent when he was unjustly jailed, suddenly speak of him as a great man whom they respect and loved. Where were all of you when he was bankrupted and jailed by this regime. <br><br>Its not about politics. it was about universal humanity. JBJ did not fail. He was indeed a great man .....<strong>failed and</strong> <strong>betrayed</strong> by the people of Singapore.</p>
