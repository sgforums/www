            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee is now looking for the best time for the next election. I bet that ruling party will still win, but how strong the mandate will be highly dependent on the timing to throw the elction.<br><br>Nov - Dec 2005: Ok timing. Strong stock market performance. Jobless rate down a bit. Expected no more mosquito problem - too cold to breed. US market may still be ok. Property market is building up its pace, stockmarket expected to hover around 2300 til Nov 2005 at least.<br><br>Jan - Jun 2006: A bad timing. Uncertainity in the global finance market due to the new US fed chief. Traditional data indicated that new fed chief = uncertainties eg stock market crashes or interest "Great Leap Forward". Now the "US Property Bubbles",  "Inflation" would be boiling in the cookpot.<br><br>Jun -Dec 2006: Global economies should be recovering over the soft patch in early 2006. Sg stockmarket expected to attract serious attention and go for the next leap in 2nd half of 2006. Good timing as well.</div>

How many of the people in our society get these astronomical amounts of chances, it is extremely few, or u can state it as negligble. It's very selfish of Singaporeans that they've this mindset that it's not their business!!!<br>Singaporeans r capable of better things rather then siding with the ruling party blindly. We've to fight for our own happiness, &amp; nobody is responsible for that. We're responsible for our own happiness.<br><br>"THE ONLY NECESSARY FOR EVIL TO FLOURISH IS FOR GOOD MEN TO DO NOTHING" - EDMUND BURKE<br><br>I SINCERELY URGE THE PEOPLE TO CAST OFF THIS "IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS" MINDSET &amp; "FEAR" ITSELF.
