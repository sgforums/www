And she's telling me that she hopes I find a gf soon...though I'm just 20 and am obviously enjoying many things in life.

But she tells me what if in another 20years? They have no one to turn to in their old age. Doesn't this clearly show that people get married so they have company in their old age and also that they have kids to look after them in their old age?

            <div class='col-md body'>i have seen how an AMK neighbour couple split over $$$ issue. husband was a devoted husband and father, didnt have much ambition and easily contented. wife was frustrated with the overpriced HDB that they bought and the lack of $$$ to pay for it monthly. wife keeps harping on her past of how many suitors had chased her before and repeatedly saying how she regretted marrying to this poor chap. btw, she doesnt look appealing at all. in the end, wife called it quit and divorced him even when he pleaded with her tearfully. The main sufferers from this broken marriage are the kids and separating the father away from the kids is just too painful for him to bare. I can only wish him well and hope he didnt get any suicide ideas.</div>
