I will waste time, money and ultimately end up with nothing. On top of that, given her character, she will definitely badmouth me and I will end up being the brat that took everything from her and left her with nothing. I would rather be the guy that has every characteristic a female wants and desires in her guy, but am unable to get, only for that lucky one girl. Besides, I make it a point to pay back what ever amount I swipe off the card though my parents are still concerned if I have enough money to spend. Its simply a principle...being given the card is a privilege and not an entitlement. So I won't take advantage of it by busting a big hole in it.</div>

I mean...come to think of it, not that I'm being a total MCP, but is it just me? Or is it that we men never succumb to peer pressure of the above variety. And yes...to girls out there whom think that just because your friends have luxurious overseas trips, LV bags, big ass diamond ring etc.etc...do think of the fact that have guys ever complain that you look horrible, ugly, say that you're fat?<br><br>Anyway...this problem will only get worse...it won't improve because society is driven by money. In school it may be the kid with the highest grades that speak loudest, but at the end of the day, in life its the one with the biggest bank account and the biggest spending power that speak the loudest.<br><br>So yes...let's just face it...man is selfish,but society just aids the process of us showing our true colours.<br><br>On a side note, this particular Mr.X's plan on Graduate's Mother's scheme...isn't that no different from what some German guy tried to during WW2?

I mean...come to think of it, not that I'm being a total MCP, but is it just me? Or is it that we men never succumb to peer pressure of the above variety. And yes...to girls out there whom think that just because your friends have luxurious overseas trips, LV bags, big ass diamond ring etc.etc...do think of the fact that have guys ever complain that you look horrible, ugly, say that you're fat?<br><br>Anyway...this problem will only get worse...it won't improve because society is driven by money. In school it may be the kid with the highest grades that speak loudest, but at the end of the day, in life its the one with the biggest bank account and the biggest spending power that speak the loudest.<br><br>So yes...let's just face it...man is selfish,but society just aids the process of us showing our true colours.<br><br>On a side note, this particular Mr.X's plan on Graduate's Mother's scheme...<span style="color: red;">isn't that no different from what some German guy tried to during WW2? To purify the world by having a pure Aryan race</span>?</div></blockquote>in the end he gets pawned. mother nature is diverse creature...<br>look at the ecosystem: there are many plants and animals whic are so different with one another yet so similar and they contribute in a similar fashion to the survival of the ecosystem. ...trying to make them the same in all aspects will just backfire cos in the end its this diversity which drives nature's ecosystem and its a safeguard to prevent a particular species from gaing power to control everything else.<br><br>Mother nature is brilliant.
