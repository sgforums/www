              <p>That aside,</p>
              <p>I was thinking that these quantity of drugs aren't immediately lethal to anyone, but yet we dish out the death sentence to people who are involved in these drugs. So far, our mandatory death sentence have been very effective in curtailing the influence of drugs in our society, as compared to countries such as the US, Australia, where death sentence is not given out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why not do the same for gang-related and assault-with-weapons cases? it will totally eliminated all gang presence in the country.</p>
              <p>just like for drug trafficking, we should be firm in giving out death sentences, and not relent in downgrading them to assault, manslaughter etc. All serious assault cases should be classified as murder or intent to murder, and given a <strong>mandatory </strong>death sentence.</p>
              <p>that is, we spare only the occasional fistfights, bar fights, but give the death sentence to those guilty of involvment in gang-fights, be there fatality or not.</p>
              <p>in addition, those involved in gang-related activities should too be given the death sentence. activities include loansharking, prostitution, drug dealing, protection racket, illegal gambling etc.</p>
              <p>by imposing a death penalty for such crimes, we can wipe out gangsterism once and for all, and no one would ever dare get involved in gang activities ever again.</p>
              <p>by eliminating the scum of society out of this world, the country will be a better and safer place to live in.</p>
              <p>and dun worry about population issues. singapore has too many people nowadays, and anyway, the government will import in additional citizens when required. :)</p>

              <p>You kill someone, you have to pay with you life.</p>
              <p>We must not let those young punks roam around freely and when they feel like it, they will chop pple. We dont want this in Spore.</p>
              <p>If the recent cases verdict comes out and is death for the hacking, then it will make those young punks think real hard whether they dare to chop pple or not.</p>

              <p>Gangs in Sinkapore have always been around, only now maybe, they are able to recruit frustrated young people who has seen scholarships given to foreign trash, teachers who are either PRs which don't give a hoot or so tired with massive worload that they couldn't care, a school system that is only interested in "brainwashing" young people to think that PAPist is the be all end all thing which really is disgusting, parents who felt great pressure at work, unable to care for their kids, while the kids saw how hard and hopeless life is in Sinkapore, that all those anger and resentment has played into the hands of those gangs who offered solace from all these seeming hopeless situation.</p>
              <p>Right now the police have no problem in arresting all those young offenders as they "squealed" easily when interrogated but after spending years in dentention, they will come out and see that nothing has changed, no chances for them, foreigners still living it up in Sinkapore, that's when they will toughen up to be real hardcore criminals. As expected of me, I blamed the PAPist for destroying our young people while linning up their own pockets with gold exchanged with our forsaken future.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>That aside,</p>
              <p>I was thinking that these quantity of drugs aren't immediately lethal to anyone, but yet we dish out the death sentence to people who are involved in these drugs. So far, our mandatory death sentence have been very effective in curtailing the influence of drugs in our society, as compared to countries such as the US, Australia, where death sentence is not given out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why not do the same for gang-related and assault-with-weapons cases? it will totally eliminated all gang presence in the country.</p>
              <p>just like for drug trafficking, we should be firm in giving out death sentences, and not relent in downgrading them to assault, manslaughter etc. All serious assault cases should be classified as murder or intent to murder, and given a <strong>mandatory</strong> death sentence.</p>
              <p>that is, we spare only the occasional fistfights, bar fights, but give the death sentence to those guilty of involvment in gang-fights, be there fatality or not.</p>
              <p>in addition, those involved in gang-related activities should too be given the death sentence. activities include loansharking, prostitution, drug dealing, protection racket, illegal gambling etc.</p>
              <p>by imposing a death penalty for such crimes, we can wipe out gangsterism once and for all, and no one would ever dare get involved in gang activities ever again.</p>
              <p>by eliminating the scum of society out of this world, the country will be a better and safer place to live in.</p>
              <p>and dun worry about population issues. singapore has too many people nowadays, and anyway, the government will import in additional citizens when required. :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>for people who opposes the death penalty for assault, yet approve death sentence for drug traffickers, i find it rather ironic.</p>
              <p>for drug traffickers, they are involved in influencing the mind of only the addict, the one who consume drugs, and his or her immediate family and friends.</p>
              <p>but for gangsters, they have more far-reaching influences which affects everyone in the society.</p>
              <p>e.g. 1) Drug syndicates are usually run by gangsters, which i should not mention further.</p>
              <p>2) Illegal moneylending has lead to many broken homes, by providing easy credit to gambling addicts. this has lead to many tragic stories of people commit suicides, prostitute their wives or daughters etc.</p>
              <p>3) Illegal prostitution is one of the root cause of rising STD and HIV infections. Many illegal brothels are also ran by gangs.</p>
              <p>4) Underground gambling syndicates, often work in tandem with loansharks.</p>
              <p>5) Turf wars. fighting between gangsters, often lethal. But ordinary folks dun give a damn as long as it doesn't concern them.</p>
              <p>6) Slashing of innocent civilians. for the downtown east incident, im not so sure that the victim is innocent. but for the bukit panjang gang slashing, it is ridiculous for a gang of 7 to go around slashing 20 innocent street-soccer players in broad daylight, in the HDB heartland. You might be the one getting slash at tomorrow, no one knows for sure.</p>
              <p>___</p>
              <p>yes, we always perceive drug addicts and dealers to be unproductive to the society, but how about gangsters?</p>
              <p>Unless you acknowledge the "underground GDP" that they generate from their illegal activities, they are also essentially unproductive members of society. And it is more difficult, if not impossible to quit gang than to quit drugs.</p>
              <p>to quit a gang, you must go through a terrible beating by fellow gangsters (sometimes lethal). Not to mention that feuds might still exist even after one has quitted on a gang, and gangster seeking revenge for past misdeeds can still hunt you down even after quitting.</p>
              <p>therefore, i think that gangsterism is a more serious social ill than drugs, and therefore should have harsher sentences to deter people.</p>
              <p>but this seems not to be the case. as reported in the Newpaper 1-2 weeks back, there were past incidents involving multiple gangsters ganging up on individuals, with weapons. People were killed, maimed or rendered permanently disabled, but the aggressors had in the end been charge with the lesser charge of manslaughter, 20yrs in prison. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some of the accomplices have even gotten off with 6years sentences.</span></p>
              <p>6 years prison for 1 life. how ridiculously lenient our laws are, while innocent drug mules caught transporting a few grams of drugs are sentence to death... its a joke out there.</p>

Before Macao's handover the triad garbage was running amok being a problem for everyone but after they got sorted out Macao  became a paradise. Macao is now one of the greatest places on earth. One simply has to give China credit for the superb job they did in Macao in dealing with this triad problem.
