              <p>I feel that there are 2 types of gangsters. The smart ones, and the stupid ones. But unfortunately, gangsters here seems to fall predominantly in the latter group.</p>
              <p>the smart gangsters create illegal gambling syndicates, legal investments, legal and illegal moneylending.</p>
              <p>but the dumb ones just only know how to take orders from the smart ones, without thinking of the consequences. e.g. the back alley gang fights, pimps, drug trafficker, small-time loanshark. These pawns are often the ones getting caught, and the ones who paid for their crimes, while their smart gang chiefs live rich off these disposable pawns.</p>
              <p>and often, these pawns are lowly educated people, or people who are lazy to make a honest living, or worse, a combination of both.</p>
              <p>often, you can read of school-dropouts being arrested for working as runners for loansharks, or people who want to make easy money. $50 to pour paint at a debtor's house, as oppose to working 8hrs distributing flyers (also $50).</p>
              <p>this group of people are the scourge of society, not contributing, and yet making life hard for others.</p>
              <p>to cut down on the appeal of gangsterism, it is necessary to impose very harsh penalties, to disuade the potential group of people from even having the thought of joining a gang.</p>
              <p>one case study we can use is the negligible number of singaporean drug mules.</p>
              <p>Since singapore imposed a mandatory death sentence for those caught of trafficking drugs, we rarely see singaporean (even drug addicts), risking their life to bring in drugs. Most of the traffickers caught are foreigners.</p>
              <p>following this train of thought, if we impose very harsh penalties on gang-joining, people who reconsider the risk, and we would see a decrease in gang-related activities, since the number of people involved in the gang circle would be smaller.</p>

              <p><br>However, today gangsterism take a different look, we are mostly the rich or middle class kids who got the $$ and time to form a gang anytime, and today, we also have the Computer games and icommunication to influence us, unlike your time, whereby gangs were formed to earn a living and most were poor kids.</p>

              <p>i don't deny that everyone fight with someone else at some point in life.</p>
              <p>but there's different kind of fighting, and that you must acknowledge.</p>
              <p>1) Verbal fight.</p>
              <p>2) fistfight. non-lethal in nature.</p>
              <p>3) fighting with parang and other lethal weapons.</p>
              <p>normal people fight yes, but they sure don't go around slashing people with knife, and that is btw, definitely not a minor offence.</p>
              <p>just 2 days ago, a retiree was slashed in the throat with a penknife, as reported in the Newpaper. the attack was unprovoked, random with no motive. the victim was not rob at all.</p>

              However, today gangsterism take a different look, we are mostly
              the rich or middle class kids who got the $$ and time to form
              a gang anytime, and today, we also
              have the Computer games and icommunication to influence
              us, unlike your time, whereby gangs were formed to earn a living
              and most were poor kids.</p>

              <p><br>Let pull the handbrake here, now, who is responsible for up bringing the youngs in singapore, the parents, the govt, the teachers and other related adults in their lifes.</p>
              <p>When we condemn our youngs, we tends to look at ourselves and ask questions about why today youngs, given so much $$ and good living, end up forming gangs of no direction??</p>
              <p>The Govt, parents, teachers, adult citizens are actually the one that created these problem, eg, the stress the govt and parent give on study and meritocracy, the adults bad habits and careless attitude do play cruial roles for our youngs. Peoples always thot that we kids, given nice room, good bed, best of the best study room, money and fashion clothing should be able to grow up like prince and princess. But peoples forget about love, relationship and alway ignore our views</p>

              <p>From young, parents are responsible for bring up their children.</p>
              <p>Then go primary school, teachers need to teach them to be good. So as their parents that constantly need to talk to their children.</p>
              <p>Then go seconday school,teachers and parents must ensure children study hard and not lead to gangsterism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not to say young punks are wrong though. Parents and teachers do have to share the responsibility too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if young punks dont want to listen to all (parents / teachers) crap, they will still become a young 'number' gang.</p>

              <p>ya, therefore the upbringing is very important, the way we nurture the young could be wrong, let take the example of high cost of living,</p>
              <p>Govt increase cost of living, both parents have to work, leaving child at home doing nothing and go out play, mix up with those other childrens and form a gang, From monday to friday, go around disturb people, smoke, drink and bully the weaker kids, then on sat and sun, go out with parents, act guai guai, parents feeling guilty over neglecting him, buy whatever he wants, spoil him with good foods, fashion clothing, electronic goods etc etc...in hoping to show their affection to him, but they do not know the inside of him, cos they never ask, and for adults, the weak point is that they alway think they are right, like to boost about their last time life, so end up, they do not really know what he really wants, and he also get fed up of telling them, just eat, wears, plays and wish for monday to come again and join his gang. Now, who started all these, the govt or the kids</p>

              <p>   Everybody likes to play the blame game. Maybe they should take responsiblity for their own actions. They are pathetic boring individuals who fun and interesting people don't want to spend their time with. Many of them couldn't even hold down a job in Mcdonalds. They want power because they have low self esteem. They aren't interesting because they haven't read any non fiction books on any interesting topics therefor they don't know anything, they haven't been anywhere interesting,,don't anything interesting,etc.... and their pathetic sense of humour if they have one at all is very spiteful. In short they are pathetic lazy losers who have themselves to blame. If they don't like being so pathetic then they should get down to the library</p>
