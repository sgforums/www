              <p><br>Basically, for a gambler, it is no more a matter of losing, but a matter of entertaining to them, for them, to loose $10k just to have fun in betting here and there is better than going for a tour.</p>
              <p>You must understand human weakness, the greed, the forever challenging mindset and the joy of betting each other out is a total heaven to them. Given such weakness, casinos are opened just to suck them in. It is place why they thot they can outwit the casinos. Moreover, those who won, which is few, would alway booast their wining stories, and those who lost, keep quiet, walk away and come back another day.

              <p>even loan shark runners get to hit $3k/month leh. not profitable.</p>
              <p>and quite alot of gang members stay in private properties, as you can see from newspaper. everytime police conduct raid on gambling dens, syndicates, their base of operations is located in some private condo estate with security guard, or some landed property.</p>
              <p>if their "office" already cost so much already, i can't imagine how much their homes actually cost.</p>
              <p>IMO, it is profitable, provided that you have the guts.</p>

              <p>if not profitable, banks would had long close down liao, banks are also loan shark, more of the legal loan shark, they also go after u, if you do not paid in time. Just like Singapore Pool, a legal betting organisation, you dun even need to come out with cash or a product to make profit, just the Qs and the betting alone is already a very lucratives monopoly business. So, if you are a illegal 4D collectors, do you think the govt dun go after you??</p>
              <p>Gangsters dun just do loanshark loaning business, they also will go into house racing bet, 4D , football, investment etc etc,...profits and lost can be switch here and there, now, why people go for loanshark and not bank, cos, loan shark will give you money faster than any banks in singapore, and you can return anytime..unlike the bank that stipulate a time frame for you....with interest tho.</p>
