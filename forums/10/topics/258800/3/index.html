Pride goes before a fall!  They have more than once told Singaporeans donÂ’t depend on the govt.  This is like slapping their own face.  They have planned things in their agenda for the nation, and on the other hand asked the people donÂ’t depend on them.   They are voted by the people to take care of the nation, yet told the people of Singaporeans donÂ’t depend on them, what a fool!!!  They make themselves laughing stock!  They want the nation not to depend on them, then the govt should not depend on the nation to increase birth rate, donÂ’t depend on us, depend on the FTs to increase birth rate!<br><br>Just find that Singapore needs new blood in the political scene, letÂ’s all vote for other party for the coming election.

Think you bear grudge against me is it?  I find other moderators more pleasant than you.  I am just letting people know to check if they are short paid, so is this a problem to you?  Answer my question!!! As a moderator, the way you treat me is really uncalled for!!!</div>
