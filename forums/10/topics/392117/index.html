              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 9pt;">Amidst rising concerns about the recent surge in the number of foreign workers in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 9pt;">, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted on Sep. 15 the government’s assurances that “the interest of citizens will always come first.”<br><br>Lee told a crowd of over 1,500 people at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Ministerial Forum 2009 there would be a clearer and sharper distinction between citizens, permanent residents (PRs) and non-residents in terms of the benefits afforded to each group.<br><br>“Our immigration policy is to benefit Singaporeans, not foreigners,” said Lee.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 9pt;">However, Jonathan Lee, a fourth year NTU sociology undergraduate, feels this may result in a situation whereby foreigners and PRs take up citizenship to gain access to these benefits, only to leave a few years later without repaying Singapore.<br><br>“People may simply choose to take up citizenship for the citizen benefits, and leave before repaying the country, such as when it is time to do National Service,” he told the Observer.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee gave a tongue-in-cheek example of this during his 45-minute speech when he related a recent exchange with a PR who was seeking his help to attain citizenship. He asked the elderly woman during a Meet the People session why she wanted citizenship at her advanced age.<br><br>The reply, in Mandarin, Lee said was “Get citizenship, got money.”<br><br>Audrey Ong, a third year NUS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences undergraduate, is not overly worried about this issue though.<br><br>“Before these foreign talents can become citizens, they would have been here for some time and thus already contributed in some way to Singapore,” she said.<br><br>Ong agreed that there needs to be a clear distinction between the groups, deeming that “there is no point in being a citizen otherwise if the benefits for both are the same.”<br><br>The topic of distinctions between citizens and non-citizens surfaced during the question and answer session when a doctoral student, who is a Chinese national and Singapore PR, asked Lee if the current rules on new HDB flat purchase could be relaxed for PRs like him.<br><br>Lee replied, “One PR, cannot buy flat. Two PRs, can buy resale flat. One PR and one citizen, can buy new (HDB) flat.”<br><br>This difference between the privileges afforded citizens and PRs in the purchase of government-subsidized housing, known as HDB – or housing development board – flats, reflects the “responsibilities and privileges of citizenship,” Lee said.<br><br>Singapore admits more than 100,000 immigrants per year, and has more than a million foreigners working here, taking jobs that “Singaporeans do not want” and to help “make up for (Singapore’s) low birth rates,” Lee said.<br><br>Karen Lee, a first-year NTU mathematics undergraduate, welcomes this move by the government to put Singaporeans first, and acknowledges the need for quality foreigners in Singapore.<br><br>“Singapore cannot do without these foreign talents and workers as they contribute greatly to our economy. However, the government has to screen these people carefully and choose only those with the quality to improve us even further,” she said.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Why Singapore’s future in the next ten years is a bleak one</strong></p>
              <p>In a speech made to Tanjong Pagar residents recently, Singapore’s strongman Lee Kuan Yew said Singapore’s future over the next five to 10 years is an “optimistic” one.</p>
              <p>Lee did not elaborate on the reasons behind him thinking so, but he appeared to bank his hopes on the tourism industry spear-headed by the two IRs drawing in the necessary number of visitors to give Singapore’s domestic economy a boost.</p>
              <p>Though the state media has been busy of late trying to generate positive publicity for the IRs, external observers are not too optimistic about their success.</p>
              <p>An <strong>analyst from Citicorp Anil Daswani</strong> expressed doubts about the profitability of Singapore’s two integrated resorts in September last year.</p>
              <p>In a report on the prospects of Las Vegas Sands (LVS), which owns Marina Bay Sands (MBS) here, Citi said that <strong>assuming MBS contributes 20 per cent of LVS’s total Ebitdar in its first full year, every eligible Singaporean will have to go to the casino five times a year and spend more then the average visitor to Macau.</strong></p>
              <p>However, a hefty entry fee of $100 is likely to put off some Singaporeans. Furthermore, unlike Las Vegas or Melbourne, Singapore has a small population of only 5 million people.</p>
              <p><strong>Ronnie Chan, chairman of Hang Lung Properties Ltd., Hong Kong’s fifth-biggest developer by market value</strong>, said recently in a Bloomberg Forum in Hong Kong that the two casino-resorts in Singapore will fail because they won’t be able to attract high-rollers:</p>
              <p><strong>“The big rollers are what make money in casinos, they will never come to Singapore, it’s a family entertainment” location. You think big-rollers will go to Singapore where they have teeth and fangs coming out sideways? There are too many rules</strong>. I was in Sentosa island, I really think that it’s going to be a flop…..The whole integrated entertainment industry, I’m worried for them. The good thing about Singapore is that if you flop, you’re given a second chance,” he said.</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore cannot depend on the IRs to spur economic growth. Neither can attracting MNCs to set up manufacturing plants in Singapore do so as our workers are becoming more expensive compared to our neighbors.</strong></p>
              <p>The key to a nation’s success lies largely in growing the personal wealth of the middle class which forms the bulk of the population and to ensure that the lower income group do not fall further behind.</p>
              <p>The seeds of Singapore’s decline and eventual failure have already been planted a few years back by the ruling party which is running fast out of viable ideas to lead Singapore into the next phase of development.</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore’s economic growth in the last few years has been fueled by the easy availability of cheap foreign workers which boost GDP figures by keeping labor costs down.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>However, Singapore cannot depend on cheap labor forever to gain an edge over its competitors and we may already have crossed the limits.</strong></p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreigners has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>While the rich has become richer, the middle class and the poor has become poorer as a result.</p>
              <p><strong>The negligible increase in the wages has been offset by sky-rocketing property prices which plunge Singaporeans into ever greater debts and wiping off their retirement savings.</strong></p>
              <p>The lack of a comprehensive social safety net for the vulnerable and needy in the community has perpetuated a vicious never-ending cycle of poverty.</p>
              <p>Only the rich elites and foreigners have benefitted from Singapore’s economic boom, but a nation cannot survive solely on these small group of people.</p>
              <p>The ruling party’s recent U-turn in its economic policies to place more emphasis on productivity is nothing more than a rehash of the productivity drive launched in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
              <p><strong>In order to increase the income of the average Singaporean, we have to start producing high-valued goods which our competitors like China, Malaysia and Vietnam can’t.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We have to evolve into a knowledge-based economy like Japan, South Korea, Finland and Sweden instead of relying on manufacturing, tourism and other industries to continue to thrive and prosper.</strong></p>
              <p>Due to the high cost of living in Singapore, Singaporeans cannot expect to compete with workers elsewhere in terms of cost.</p>
              <p>Stagnant wages and inflation will lead increase the level of stress and tension thereby contributing indirectly to Singapore’s low birth rate.</p>
              <p><strong>The private sector is the best medium to grow the economy. Singapore’s domestic economy is currently dominated by major state-linked companies which stifle both creativity and competition.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The ruling party has to relinquish control of Singapore’s economy and return the ownership of the nation to the people.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Only then can we harness the full potential of every Singaporean and build a knowledge-based economy to compete with the rest of the world.</strong></p>
              <p>Unless the political economy is liberalized to allow new players to enter the fray, Singapore will risk becoming an economic basket-case within a decade with the emergence of China and India.</p>
              <p>The factors critical for Singapore’s success in the last fifty years have now become its liability.</p>
              <p>While complete political control ensures stability and continuity, it does not foster an active citizenry to partake in the nation-building process.</p>
              <p><strong>A “tops-down” approach serves only the interests of the ruling elite and not the society as a whole.</strong></p>
              <p>We are already witnessing the pitfalls of the present system: the middle class is falling behind, Singaporeans are getting increasingly flustered, unhappy and worried about their futures, birth rates are falling and the sense of pride in Singapore as a nation is diminishing with each passing day.</p>
              <p>If we persist in doing things as they are now, we may end up becoming a playground only for the rich and powerful, but with no nation to speak of.</p>

              <p>It is quite obvious by now that whether it is LKY or LHL name that appear here, the Taiwanese 'hum' will support these two characters.</p>
              <p>It is just like when the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.butler.org/healthGate/images/si55550966.jpg"><strong>‘Labia Majora’</strong></a> appear - it will and must be supported by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.labiaplastycenters.com/before_and_after_photos.htm"><strong>‘Labia Minora’</strong> </a>- as both must appear together when on public display - just to attract attention to the Taiwanese 'hum' acting as an 'Attention Seeking Whore'.</p>

              <p>It will benefit those work for the white army.</p>
              <p>More levy will be implemented when there is a conflict without solving or improving the key issues.</p>
              <p>The increase in levy will be pass to the consumers eventually as increased price.</p>
              <p>If I can understand this simple logic, the millionsters cannot figure it out or they want more money to support their pay increase.</p>
              <p>Since the dragon took over, it have been hell for every one as there is alway cost increase every now and then with no value added to the service rendered.</p>
              <p>So, why would any one want to stay here or form a family here if you become a forever slave to the white army ??</p>
              <p>The only one that benefited are the scums who are here for free study and accommodation and left after getting degree.</p>
