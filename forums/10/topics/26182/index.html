            <div class='col-md body'>unfortunately, this is to address a topic that was very sadly ignored in the "chit chat" forum.<br><br>rudyiskandar, a fellow forum-ite actually brought up a pretty good topic - are singaporeans really ignorant to the current affairs of the world today?<br><br>he was then shot down by the kids in the forum with 8 pages of useless and uncalled for insults just for bringing up this point! and the worst part is, that when people tried to defend him by being objective, they were shot down too?<br><br>bringing up the subject of 3G singaporeans, are we really that bad? do any of you think any of your peers are worthy to govern the country in a sensible way and not in the draconiacal hand of the PAP? unfortunately after spending some time in the "chit chat" forum, i am extremely doubtful of our country's "young sons". they honestly do not seem to be interested in anything other than anything but trash, and their mentality is much like that of a real-life phua chu kang. "i say you, you say me eh..." that kind of appalling singlish is scary when you think about how this country will end up when we're older.<br><br>how do you educate people like that? how do you take their heads out of their horrid eurotrashtechno-taiwanese-drama-i-love-f4 clouds?<br><br>thoughts anyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, a certain proportion off the 3G singaporeans are ignorant. As you and I have seen in the chit-chat room. They just don't care about national survival or anything that has to do with Singapore or even current affairs around the world. I remember a couple of weeks ago, they were making fun of Newater. I just don't get it, instead of supporting our government for her effort to wean off our dependence on others for water, they just treat it as a joke. I don't proclaim myself as politician wannabe, but when it comes to national survival, I am sure as hell not taking it for granted.<br><br>For those ignorant 3G singaporeans, they have been living a good and comfy life. Our government sheltered them too much. I admit that at one time I do have such thinking afterall I am a 3G singaporean as well. After spending sometime overseas, I realise that how limited and narrow my knowledge was of the bigger world outside. Maybe it will be a good idea to send them to a 3 world country and live there for a couple of years.<br><br>I do not know of any peers whom I think he is suitable to govern singapore. I hope somewhere in the future, somebody as capable as LKY and Goh CK will emerge. The most pressing task is perhaps to see if Lee Hsien Loong can step into the PM seat. Maybe the other person could be RAdm Teo and Geoge Yeo. As of now, only time could tell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, I agree with CX, on the point about people come here to discuss what they care to reveal, like i come here to discuss (more to learn actually, most people serious in the military-related forums here seems to know more than me) military stuff<br><br>been interested for 2 years but never found a good place to discuss it, and my friends in school don't give 2 cents about the military.... so had to just read info on the net and keep to myself, now can come here and discuss stuff, its become more interesting, reading people's comments and so on<br><br>however, these forums and others like it do not require people to divulge their identity, so they basically can do as they wish.<br><br>like we are studying in Lord Of the Flies in school this year... the book shows the naturally evil nature of humans as they degrade away from civilisation, and that civilisation is necessary as a control for humans as humans in civilisation will be bound by the values they are thought and the rules of society which they learn.  These values and rules will rapidly disappear if civilisation is lost.  Savagery will then come next.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, her space holiday...if you find those stuff in CC offensive, the best way out for you is not to go there. If one wishes to discuss on more serious socio politicial issues, it would be better done here.<br><br>Moreover, it is very unfair to stigmaize and to judge to competance of 3G Singaporeans based on what they write in the forums. The forums is an outlet to allow people to write their honest views and such and that includes trivialites that you consider in CC.<br><br>Let me quote Colin Goh, "We do not write our resumes in Singlish". As an EL student, I find no grudges against Singlish. It is a dialect no worse than other forms of dialects. Singlish is primary a means of communication among local Singaporeans and peers. Of course, we are not stupid enough to use that to speak to some foreigner. If you wish to think as such...I rest my case.<br><br>Furthermore, I am quite disturbed by the "I am holier than thou" attitude. What makes you judge whether something is trash which could well hold dear for another. One man's meat is another's poison. Let's not get too judgemental here.<br><br>I do not support F4...but there is nothing wrong with supporting it as well. I do not see the rational of condemning them with a "eurotrashtechno-taiwanese-drama-i-love-f4 clouds" statement. I could in the same light condemn those people who listen to Bach or Mozart as ancient and passe and not willing to let go of the past...but I don't.<br><br>We should respect each others culture and view points of life.<br><br>Let the CC regulars do what they like. It is their freedom to do so. If you still feel strongly about it, you and rudyiskander can come here anytime.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>unfortunately greengoblin, you have gotten me all wrong.<br><br>i do respect their likes and dislikes. however, i do not appreciate them shooting another person's postings down. it's is true that there is freedom of speech in forums, and that forums were created as an outlet of expression. however, these cc chatters simply brought down rudyiskandar's posting from the beginning, calling him "gek sai" or "gek seh" or something? and when rudy and some others tried to defend the posting/opinion, they simply launched into the primary skool banter of "u say me fool ah? u then is ah mofo!" and such.<br><br>my post was meant as a continuation of rudy's topic, which was, if most of the 3g singaporeans have this type of mentality, then aren't we in serious trouble? speak to any person in the cc forum, attempt to post a serious msg there, and all you'll get is an array of colourful singlish insults to your disturbing their comfortable little pigeonhole.<br><br>another thing, i love singlish. talk to me personally and i'd be the first to be spewing forth lahs, lors and all sorts of other singlish dialect. it's my culture too. as a peranakan nonya, i cherish that kind of language. it's a part of my life too.<br><br>in my posting, i was appalled by the singlish because they indirectly disrespected another forumite's posting, by beginning their own useless bantering of arguing to see who can phrase "gek seh" or "gek sai" better?! i mean... how do i explain the surprise and exasperation i felt?<br><br>and if i had known about this forum earlier when i first signed up, i wouldn't have gone in there at all. but the interface for sgforums didn't shout this page out, so i had only recently discovered this site.<br><br>i hope this has cleared up your misunderstanding of my post.<br><br>peace love unity respect PLUR</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will try to be as formal as possible in this post to see how this style of writing would affect myself.<br><br>I never visited the 'Chit Chat' forums until I saw this post in the section 'Politics'.  I have also read some of the posts above with some interest and would like to make a few comments.<br><br>As the title, 'Chit Chat', itself implies, it is meant for very informal posts and also for people to discuss anything under the sun other than topics which would fit into the other sections, such as 'Politics', 'Cars', 'Buy and Sell', etc.<br><br>The forums at 'Chit Chat' adopt a much lighter attitude in their posts than many of us here at 'Politics' would be familiar with.  Thus, I feel that many of rudy's posts would have been more appropriate in 'Politics' and therefore recommend that such future postings be started in 'Politics'.<br><br>I have seen the some of the replies to rudy's post and while I would consider them rude, I must add that I am not particularly surprised by the replies.  A quick a check at 'Yahoo!' forums would reveal that many serious posts are usually not that welcome and that there will always be people who post certain unwelcome comments and replies that are not called for.  It is just that the number of such posts vary from forum to forum.<br><br>Also, 'her space holiday', I would also recommend you visit 'politics' for serious discussion and a better standard of response.  Why do you think some people visit 'Chit Chat' while others visit more serious forums such as 'Politics', and others visit interest specific ones such as 'Cars'?  It is due to the different aim each individual person has by coming to a forum.  Some like posting and reading 'friendly banters' at 'Chit Chat'.  Others like having serious views from other people regarding their topics of interest.<br><br>Therefore, we cannot really blame the people in the 'Chit Chat forum for replying in such an abusive manner as it is what they give and what they probably also expect to recieve from others.<br><br>Thank you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i jus wan to say:<br><br>i was overreacted during the topic on e topic of usa/iraq.  please forgive mi 4 my reactions as i feel it is somewat important to clearify some doubts i hav all along.<br><br>quotes from an unknown guys i recieved in the internet email n in the internet:<br><br>"Call it conspiracy theory or whatever you like but the facts are the facts. Perhaps these facts bespeak not of conspiracy but of great and amazing 'coincidences' that have no relationship whatsoever. I guess you will have to decide that for yourself.<br><br>May the Truth indeed set you free..."<br><br>" ...My desire to spread the truth is much stronger than my fear of having my name added to Big Brother's black list,..."<br><br>"When you can lead people to ask the wrong questions, you don't have to worry about the answers."  Scary isn't it?  When you live in fear, you are deprived of your rational thinking; you need to distract yourself and are more inclined to look for immediate gratification.  Which makes you an excellent consumer and a "good" passive citizen!"<br><br>"Maybe my view is way too simplistic and I should trust the authorities, but I simply cannot dismiss so much evidence!<br><br>By putting this document together, my goal was simply to make you look at things with a new perspective. Just like we need to learn how to do due diligence on investment opportunities, we also need to scrutinize the news bulletins and try to figure out which ones<br>are scams!"<br><br>May these quotes inspire u all.<br><br></div>

But like wat CX says does it matter? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just wanna make a point here. From wat I see, many forumers here are probably very young. I predict most of them barely reach 18.....especially in the CC forum. They have yet to realise things around them as they are still young, they still trying to discover more about themselves.<br><br>From what I see, it's actually not that bad. If you go the general (as general as chit chat) forums in Australia or US you'll find most of their general forums kids talk as senseless as us....... The US kids are usually interested in relationships, music, video games  and other new-age stuff. The Aussies are more or less the same, sports and their "big brother" thingy. The only difference is that they language is more comprehensive and descriptive than our "singlish" and maybe that's why they sound so impressive or "matured".<br><br>That's a saying that what an "ang moh" say in a sentence of 15 words, a Singaporean can say it in 5 words. (Thanks to our singlish ) But the important thing is that the same emotion and message were expressed.<br><br>No I'm not defending 3G S'poreans cos I've also met the most ignorant (and arrogantly self-centered) 3G S'porean (some even exist here) But I still believe that there are many 3G singaporeans there who are concern about world issues and stuff like that. I just hope that you'll not judge us based on only the CC forums. Most post nonsense stuff there to "kill boredom" and "relieve stress"..........I do post idiotic stuff there once in a while too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>Like what most have suggested, do post such issues in this SC forum, you'll find more satisfying answers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> post it in CC forum is like telling kinderland kids COE have rise.<br><br>It's good to see topics like this rather than the typical "OUR-ARMY-IS-BIGGER-AND-BETTER-AND-MEANER-THAN-YOUR'S" topics that usually start burning by self-centered "military" wackos (including me sometimes) :p<br><br>no offence guys!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Sometimes, like in the US attack on Iraq, we also just want some comments from others who have the same interests.  And most of us here just try to give as good as we get, and sometimes maybe even better if we can find very reliable sources to back the statements we post.  and I usually only visit the 'politics' forums due to lack of time. . . my End of year exams starting in 2-3 weeks time. . . , so I'll probably come here less or not come at all till after about 4 weeks. . .<br><br>till then. . . , bye</div>
