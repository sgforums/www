The priority objective of all our transport system is serve our people, not to maximise profit!!<br><br>It is interesting to note that Temasek Holding holds the majority shares with 934,400 lots. For every $93,440 they make, I make $1 (with 10 lots), you make 60 cents, but we pay increased prices so that this profits can be made. And who owns Temasek? the government, using our CPF money. So the government use the citizen's money to make money from the citizens, smart idea!! no wonder they are paid millions of dollars.<br><br>As citizen, i should be contented with a candy or two, but at least I won't jump in rejoicing, for unless i sell my shares, i do not see any profits, but when i sell the shares, the next time i pay higher fares, i am not getting anything back. sigh.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The PTC has mandated certain service standards that all bus services must comply to. Some of the bus services are operating at unviable levels just to comply with these service standards, even though there is low demand. It's just like the govt insisting that all escalators in Sg move continuously despite no one is using them.<br><br>I am sure if operators declare the operating performance of each service, then commuters will be able to help operators reduce operating costs by forgoing loss making services.
