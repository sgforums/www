              <p>Why not they go play golf in JB instead? Join a country club in JB. For every year of membership they pay to play in Singapore, they can easily stretch it to 2 - 3 years of playing in JB. Win-win situation right?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>those who joined JB golf clubs have regretted. better to be walk-in guests, you pay less than 100 RM for a round of golf, plus buggy plug breakfast. as members you pay monthly subscription, whether you play or not.</p>
              <p>those who bought apartments or houses in malaysia, especially those in JB, have also regretted. if the properties were bought according to what were promosed in the brochure, you won't find tenants to stay. if you stay there, you better don't leave for holiday, for the immigrants would come into your house and live there, or take away your furnitures. go there as and when you want, pay for hotels, can affords hyatt or pan pacific.</p>
              <p>you can really stretch your money as long as you want. you can also go to malacca, KL,...so your money is stretched as far as you want.</p>

              <p>Do allow me to offer a non-political insight to this issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it much more economically wise to use state land, earn millions from it and then lease cheap land from neighbouring countries to house our aged citizens whom had slogged hard for us all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The aged had suffered enough, and must not be used as political pawns for governance domination. To insist that they remain in Spore would be to cramp them into tiny boxes in the sky and face the fast paced of life here. No politics please, no matter how well meaning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They deserve to retire in more comfortable surroundings - waterfalls, mountains, large open spaces and reflect back on their hard work they had done for us all. All these, Singapore of limited land, does not have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it costs us little if we manage our resources carefully, plan for their security as well as for relatives travelling there. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I apologise sincerly first if i had offended anyone. This post is not politically motivated, but only out of concern for our treasured old folks whom may lacked the voice to speak out and had only given their best to us.</p>
