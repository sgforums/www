            <div class='col-md body'>Truthfully or not, I am glad to share with you the joy of your new profound enthusiasm. With your support, the government is only 32.99% away from rallying the whole nation in next GE!<br><br>Promoting economic welfarism and improving living conditions and subsequently bringing higher value on housing for her citizens should always be the agenda of any government. It will be interesting to note that there had been a GDP growth rate of 10.6% in  Q1 and an unemployment rate of 2.6% in March in the year 2006. This speaks the efficiency of an experience government on multi-tasking.<br><br>It should always be the case and understood that the civil sector will first bear the brunt of wages cut in the even of a recession. This is leadership by example, an exemplary conduct. Notwithstanding is that the public sector cannot afford to go way too low below a certain level on par with the competitive business wages enviroment. Civil sector is afterall a place to serve the nation, henceforth a rather sheltered place. The slightly higher wages offer to retain the best talents in the field is justifiable.<br><br>Singapore arduous way to achieve a first world standard is by no means an easy feat but was lucky that the world in the 1960s was still accelerating at a rather moderate pace. But after the 1997 Asian Crisis and the recent rise of China and India, the threat of globalisation is a lurking force to be reckon with. The world is no longer view as multiple inaccessible continents but one big continental enterprise with company preparing to shift focus on their production to the most cost worthy environment. Nevertheless, we can combat this not only with wages competition but with quality technical or management knowledge through upgrading courses. This will all the more make us attractive for business ventures.<br><br>The media objective is to stay neutral and in the event of reporting to be responsible. Though such virtue does not place the media high in the international media standing but nevertheless it attributes to political stability which is yet another factor to attract business investments in this globalising era. Official Speakers corner, internet forums, blogs are still avenues available for ideas to be exchange between public.<br><br>It is the the job of every elected officials to take concern for their citizens well being and the action of the strong mandate of 66%+0.01% speaks louder than words. It is indeed disheartening that the remaining 32.99% distrusted in the leadership of the government for some unknown reason but nevertheless, I believed the government will continue to stride to win the hearts and souls of the remaining 32.99% so as to move forward together as one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>National day is coming and everytime when this part of the year came, I can't help but feel sad. Sad because fewer and fewer citizen hung their flag outside their home. Why is it happening? I tried seaching for the answer but it came to notch. LOOK! We had steadily increase GDP, strong economic growth in that sense, 160k new jobs for the quarter. So whats holding back for them to hung out those flags? Busy? It couldn't be busy as it only takes less than a minute to put it up. Forgetful? Maybe but it couldn't be all.<br><br>The reason lies after I did a little survey with 100 citizens is that 66% of them love and adore our current leadership so much that some hung their flag in door and some rather keep it than dirty it through rain and shine. Please don't ask me to provide the names of the 100 citizens for obvious reason.<br><br>Yes, some citizen may be displease with some of our government policy but did they ever compare singapore with other countries like Utiopia or Rwanda? We are so much luckier in that sense. Fares and Utilities bills have to go up unless someone can stop the cost of crude oil. We are lucky that unlike other countries whereby they subsidize the cost and spoon-feed their citizen in times of economic turmoil, singapore did just the opposite and allows the citizen the opportunity to do their duty as a citizen in bearing the brunt of the recession.<br><br>Singaporeans should not always be on the look out for hand-outs but learn to stand firm and strives along. Only then can we proclaim to come of age and go forth in times of economic turmoil. Only then can we give out more scholarship to foreign students so as to attract more foreign talent.<br><br>With promise of making each and every household to have lift stop at every level by 2011, we have a caring government unlike other countries who are wasting their time debating and tackling unimportant issues like recession and rising unemployment which can never be solved with rising crude oil.<br><br>Therefore I sincerely hope the remaining 33% of the citizen that took the survey will wake up and appreciate the beauty of our beloved government thinking and put on a happy face this coming national day.<br><br>As for me, I will definately look forward to 8th of August and salute to the aircraft carrying national flag flying past for I know my future lies with our flawless and respectful government.</div>

The three terms did not arise simultaneously.<br><br>After World War II, people began to speak of the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries as two major blocs, often using such terms as the "Western bloc" and the "Eastern bloc." The two "worlds" were not numbered. It was eventually pointed out that there were a great many countries that fit into neither category, and in the 1950s this latter group came to be called the Third World.<br><br>Eventually, nations within the Western European and United States' sphere of influence (e.g., the NATO countries) came to be called (unofficially) the First World. Besides North America (USA and Canada) and Western Europe, the First World also included other industrialized capitalist countries such as Japan and some of the former British colonies, particularly Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.<br><br>There were a number of countries that did not fit comfortably into this neat definition of partition, including Switzerland, Sweden, and the Republic of Ireland, who chose to be neutral. Finland was under the Soviet Union's sphere of influence but was not communist, nor was it a member of the Warsaw Pact. Austria was under the United States' sphere of influence, but in 1955, when the country became a fully independent republic, it did so under the influence that it remain neutral. Turkey, which joined NATO in 1952, was not predominantly in Western Europe and was not industrialized. Spain did not join NATO until 1982, towards the end of the Cold War and after the death of the authoritarian dictator Francisco Franco.<br><br>In modern usage, after the end of the Cold War, <span style="color: red;">the term First World</span> <span style="color: indigo;">has come to denote the 'developed' Industrialized-Capitalistic nations that in 2000 had</span> <span style="color: red;">a higher GDP per capita than $15,000</span><span style="color: indigo;">, as stated by the World Bank. This would include the United States, Canada, Japan, the countries of the European Union (in 2000), Norway, Iceland, Switzerland,</span> <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore</span></strong></span>, <span style="color: indigo;">Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan (The Republic of China), and South Korea. The World Bank also denotes these as "High Income Economies."[1]<br><br>In recent years, as many "developing" countries have industrialized, the term Fourth World has been coined to refer to countries that have "lagged behind" and still lack industrial infrastructure. However, these are completely subjective terms usually used by people from economically dominant nations.<br><br>Some nations have developed their own classification scheme consisting of the "Third World," and the "Two-Thirds World." This system is similar to the former in that it also reflects economic status or behaviour. In terms of material resources, the "Third World" takes just one third of the pie, while the "Two-Thirds World" unjustifiably takes two-thirds of the pie.<br></span></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Was Singapore mistakenly classified as a <span style="font-style: italic;">"<strong>First World</strong>"</span> based on the assumption that it has a GDP of US$15,000 ?<br><br>Could Singaporeans be enjoying a GDP of US$15,000 or has this come about through the small number of Elite Class (including the Ministers) earning a disproportionately huge sum that is <span style="font-style: italic;">a hundred time</span> larger than the entire earnings of Singapore wage earners ?<br><br>Could Singapore fit into the following clarification of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">"<strong>Third World</strong>"</span></a></span><br><span style="color: indigo;"><blockquote><br>Third World is a term first coined in 1952 by French demographer Alfred Sauvy to distinguish nations that aligned themselves with neither the West nor with the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War.<br><br>Today, however, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>the term is frequently used to denote nations with a low UN Human Development Index (HDI)</strong></span>, independent of their political status (meaning that the PRC, Russia and Brazil, all of which were very strongly aligned during the Cold War, are often termed third world). However, there is no objective definition of Third World or "Third World country" and the use of the term remains common. Some in academia see it as being out of date, colonialist, othering and inaccurate; its use has continued, however.<br><br>In general, Third World countries are not as industrialized or technologically advanced as OECD countries, and therefore in academia, the more politically correct term to use is "developing nation".<br><br>Terms such as Global South, less wealthy nations, developing countries, least developed countries and the Majority World have become more popular in circles where the term "third world" is regarded to have derogatory or out-of-date connotations. Development workers also call them the two-thirds world (because two-thirds of the world is underdeveloped) and The South. The term Third World is also disliked as it may imply the false notion that those countries are not a part of the global economic system. Some claim that the underdevelopment of Africa, Asia and South America during the Cold War was influenced, or even caused by the Cold War economic, political, and military maneuverings of the most powerful nations of the time. (See Emerging markets)<br><br>The term Fourth World (as least developed countries) is used by some writers to describe the poorest Third World countries, those which lack industrial infrastructure and the means to build it. More commonly, however, the term is used to describe indigenous peoples or other oppressed minority groups within First World countries.<br></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Is the Singapore economy developed to a level which allow us to compete with the likes of other industrialized countries classified as <span style="font-style: italic;">First World</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Developed World</span> ?<br><br>Or is the present Singapore economy an illusion that is dependent on the inputs from Foreign Talents in niche high tech sectors of the economy, and which local Singaporeans can hardly contribute due to non-existent knowledge and exposure.</span><br><br></div>
