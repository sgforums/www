TS is correct by asking the pri sch kid for information on how much of the money dat is donated goes to the poor actually, but if TS puts himself inside dat pri sch kid's shoes, he would hav been too innocent to noe anything, and may be frightened off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope schools are not turning flag day into a CCA thingy.<br><br>Charity comes from the heart, not from the desire to earn 'points'.<br><br>And yes, i disagree with the manner in which school children are being 'abused' to such an extent that those irresponsible jerks in charge of such charity events don't take the trouble to properly educate who and what institution the students are collecting for.<br><br>It's a shame that flag day itself is degrading into a 'saturday afternoon event'. The wrong message is being transmitted to the masses.<br><br>The commissioner of charities should step in and re-evaluate the way charities are being run.</div>
