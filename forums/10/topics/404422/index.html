            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>1. I don’t want to buy a house with a Cash-Over-Value of $100,000</p>
              <p>2. I don’t want to be accused of being fussy if I don’t want to live on the first floor or basement bomb shelter, or ulu ulu places like Kusu Island</p>
              <p>3. I don’t want keep hearing that flats are “affordable” when I really cannot afford flats.</p>
              <p>4. I don’t want to see foreigners flood our condos, HDB estates, MRT trains, buses, schools, EVERYWHERE</p>
              <p>5. I don’t want to know about how ministers are getting lots of landed and prime property both local and overseas when I have trouble getting a 3-room flat.</p>
              <p>6. I don’t want ministers who get multi-million dollar salaries when I do odd jobs and some months I don’t make more than $2,000.</p>
              <p>Ministers in other countries may take bribes and embezzle. My ministers are smarter, they get more money claiming more MILLIONS in salary LEGALLY.</p>
              <p>7. I don’t want to pay ERP just because foreigners’ cars are clogging my roads. Especially, when ERP do not solve congestion problems!!! We still have terrible traffic jams!</p>
              <p>8. I don’t want to do NS and reservist to protect my country against foreign invaders when:<br>(A) I don’t have a house to protect<br>(B) I cannot afford to start a family to protect<br>(C) I have to protect foreigners and their property with my life when they run away during war.<br>(D) Foreigner PRs do not have to serve<br>(E) I get paid worse than a Bangala worker. To think that National Service needed people donation’s in 1967, after a year, it gathered S$ 3 million from Singaporeans when we were all so poor.</p>
              <p>9. I do not want to see PRs and New citizens flashing their blue and pink ICs on their national days.</p>
              <p>10. I do not want to see the shamelessness of importing foreign athletes and claims that Singapore won when a foreigner won. Oh yes, we pay these foreigners millions of dollars so that Singapore can claim that it won. WOW!</p>
              <p>11. I do not want to hear jeering against the SG local soccer teams from foreigner spectators when we play against other countries IN OUR OWN COUNTRY!</p>
              <p>12. I don’t want to pay 7% more for everything I buy in my whole life when the government gives my $200 in “compensation” handouts!</p>
              <p>13. I want to see a local student being the top student. Not some China kid. Not hearing from ours kids that there is no point to work hard as some foreigner is going to squeeze them down inevitably.</p>
              <p>14. When there is public curiosity, I expect my government (especially Law minister) to be transparent enough let us know about Temasek and HDB cost to build a flat, etc.</p>
              <p>15. I want my country to be known as a COUNTRY. My country is NOT just a city like some idiot claims.</p>
              <p>16. I don’t want LHL’s son to be the next succeeding prime minister.</p>
              <p>17. I don’t like how China suckered us in the Suzhou park initiative and we still have to kiss their assess.</p>
              <p>18. I cannot understand why local siblings cannot buy flats when foreigner PR siblings can buy flats.</p>
              <p>19. Singles are not allowed to buy flats before 35? Are singles supposed to be forced into marriage just because of this? By the time singles reach 35, the flat prices will be higher by $100,000 to $300,000. These singles worked very hard to scrimp and save only to see savings ERODED away by inflation!</p>
              <p>20. I do not want to read the paper when it is pro-PAP and there is major censorship and selective publishing and late publishing for what cannot be hidden.</p>
              <p>21. I don’t want my life-savings to be belittled as the salt on the “peanuts”.</p>
              <p>22. I don’t like it when my country’s reserves lost tens of billions of dollars and the PM’s wife can still head Temasek!</p>
              <p>23. I want important national assets key to our security like power stations to BELONG to our country, not sold to foreigners.</p>
              <p>24. I like to add hum to my mee siam by the way.</p>
              <p>25. I want a president who actually DOES more. Not one which who I seek shakes hands, seldom speaks, does not even pardon and spare a 19-year-old kid his life. Not a president who kids confuse with Mas Selamat (Many kids who know Mas Selamat do not EVEN know Nathan)</p>
              <p>26. I don’t want to have my next national day parade at the silly riverside place….AGAIN! How long does it take to make a stadium? We are a country but we don’t even have a national stadium?? How about loaning Malaysia’s Merdeka Stadium for Singapore’s National day?</p>
              <p>27. I want job security. A contract for 1 or 2 years, Then look for work again. The cycle repeats. We have to worry for our jobs and livelihoods on a daily basis. When we are over 40 years old, who want us anymore? I might as well join the army as sign on. But wait, that is contract TOO!</p>
              <p>28. I don’t want the next generation to suffer like me in university. I had to work part-time to support my uni fees in NUS, while foreign students get free uni education thanks to MOE PLUS $500 allowance every month. After that, NUS still has the cheek to call me up and ask me to donate to NUS. Why they need money? They lost hundreds of millions of endowment in the financial crisis. I can still remember working and saving for 3 months before I could afford a 2nd hand laptop.</p>
              <p>29. I want to protest in the streets to voice my discontent without being put to jail by the ISA act or made bankrupt. For goodness sake, I don’t even dare to accept Singtel’s offer of giving me free 6 months internet if I switch from Starhub to Singtel, because I am scared that my IP address and my name will be blacklisted by the government. (considering Singtel’s afflictions with the govt)</p>
              <p>30. I want an opposition party in power. Any opposition is welcome. As educated and smart as my current and soon-to-be-ex ministers may be, I want people who CARE and LISTEN. Even if it is a guy who had graduated from kindergarten would be welcomed if he cares.</p>
              <p>31. Elites who have been born with a silver spoon, who never had trouble finding a job, who never had money difficulties, who never went hungry, who breezed through NS, do NOT deserve my respect nor should they be in the government. We need people who UNDERSTAND what it is like at the pits and bottom! Not some shortie who claims to understand hardship with a childhood living in 3-room flat but marries an angmoh and lives in a landed mansion.</p>
              <p>32. I want a better electoral system! I don’t want WALK-OVERs again. Some of the seniors did not even get to vote ONCE in their whole lives. How is that democracy?</p>
              <p>33. I want fairness. Is it a coincidence that certain estates under certain members of our government are especially well-cared for with upgrading etc incentives? Is this fair? Are residents of areas under the opposition similarly cared for? I quote a resident from Potong Pasir “the lifts here are so old and I can’t climb the flight of stairs to reach my place anymore.” I supposed the 60 year old aunty would be forced to vote for PAP to get new lifts.</p>
              <p>34. I want a limit to the number of years the PM can hold office, so that as bad and as lousy as the PM is, we can at least have a chance to start afresh.</p>
              <p>35. I want small quotas/ratios legislated for foreigners.</p>
              <p>36. I want foreigners to be restricted to less than 20% of our population instead of 36%.</p>
              <p>37. MBT actually said that foreigner PRs were under-represented in HDB flats. Pah! No more than 2 flats in a block should be sold to PRs! Otherwise, how can the many old uncles and aunties have pocket money for retirement by renting out flats?</p>
              <p>38. I want their CPF contribution percent to be much higher and that their CPF to be forfeited if they leave SG.</p>
              <p>39. I want higher income taxes and property taxes for foreigners.</p>
              <p>40. I want NS for foreigners.</p>
              <p>41. Foreigners who bought HDB flats cannot be allowed to rent their flat out EVER!</p>
              <p>42. I want the SGD to be moderated downwards! A higher SGD may benefit those who can afford to holiday overseas, those who are rich enough to send kids to overseas for studies, or PRs and foreigners when they remit money home. BUT overly high SGD deters investments into Singapore.</p>
              <p>43. I want curbs on inflation. To that effect, we need to install restrictions on property speculation, raise reserve ratios in banks, and have more stringent criteria before loans are issued. AND OF COURSE, GST lower back to 3%</p>
              <p>44. When foreign talent enters my country. I want these people to be REALLY foreign talent. I don’t want my country’s pink IC and PR to be handed out like toilet paper.</p>
              <p>45. I want more heavily subsidized birth-delivery, child-care, pediatric health and education care to boost local numbers. If S.Korea can do it, why not us? The practice of replacement diminishing local numbers with foreigner number MUST STOP.</p>
              <p>46. Instead of always saying Singapore does not have enough talent, will the government spend more money and effort in education and grooming the young? Every time they say that there is not enough of certain type of people, the government will import these people in masses and hordes.</p>
              <p>47. I expect government-affiliated institutions to not indulge themselves with luxuries when other citizens have bread-butter problems:</p>
              <p>When NTUC income unilaterally announced major cuts in its bonus for insurance-policy-holders, the MAS allowed this to happen. NTUC income claimed financial woes, but took HUNDREDS of agents to Australia for an exorbitant expense-paid holiday as they made the announcement earlier this year!!! Do they think about the widows and orphans when they dine fine with wine???</p>
              <p>At first I could not believe NTUC Income to be capable of this, then I checked on the web and saw the NTUC CEO hugging 2 BIKINI girls and drinking champagne in Australia too.<br>(1) <a href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?%E2%80%A61001838&amp;ref=mf">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?…1001838&amp;ref=mf</a><br>(2) <a href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?%E2%80%A61001838&amp;ref=mf">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?…1001838&amp;ref=mf</a></p>
              <p>48. I expect the MAS to protect citizens financially too:</p>
              <p>When thousands of investors lost their life savings in the mini-bond fiasco, where was the government?? Unlike the Hong Kong government which had exerted pressure on its local banks to compensate a minimum sum to its minibond holders, the Singapore authorities chose to stay out of the matter….. MM Lee Kuan Yew even chided Singapore investors for “walking in with their eyes open” and therefore did not deserve a compensation.</p>
              <p>49. I have 1 more issue with the state Media Press. HOW can they publish photos of people suspected of crimes when they have not EVEN been convicted?? Imagine the tarnishing to the poor suspect’s reputation if he were innocent! It is not as if the guy can sue ST and get $400,000 in defamation compensation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>50. Anyone can give the 50th reason??????????????? Come on my fellow locals. If I can say so much, you can at least say something! Few thousand people viewing this article and so little comments???</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: large;">Malaysian doctor: Singapore should be grateful to Malaysians for its success</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">December 6, 2009</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Malaysian doctor by the name of Chen Jiayi who had chosen to return to Malaysia after working for a number of years in Singapore wrote in the Malaysian Chinese newspaper Sin Chew yesterday that Singapore should be grateful to the Malaysians for its success today.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dr Chen did not reveal the reason behind his return except that “the answer would be revealed in time to come.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">When he first came to work in a Singapore government hospital as a house officer, Dr Chen soon realized that he was working with many of compatriots, some of whom are his highest level superiors. Even the Singapore Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan was a former Malaysian citizen.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the press that half the number of medical specialists at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital are Malaysians during his recent visit to Singapore to attend the APEC Summit.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The exact number of Malaysians doctors working in Singapore is not known. About 5 to 10 per cent of the each year cohort of medical students are Malaysians.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">While some Malaysians graduated from NUS, others like Dr Chen join the Singapore public healthcare service after they finished their studies overseas when they are lured here to work.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dr Che was told by colleagues that Malaysian talents were the most sought after in Singapore and it not a surprise as due to cultural similarities between the two nations, Malaysians find it easiest to assimilate themselves into Singapore society.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">During his years of working in Singapore, Dr Chen noticed that young Singapore doctors are encountering difficulties communicating with the older generation of patients due to language barriers.</span></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Due to their educational system, the younger generation of Singaporeans are proficient in English, mediocre only in Chinese. For Malay language, they are largely outsiders; as for Chinese dialects, that will have to depend on whether their gandpas and grannies are still around.</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>As such, young Singaporean doctors face communciation problems when they encounter aged patients, resorting to hand language at times just to get their messages across,”</em> he wrote.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As a result of a chronic shortage of doctors in the public sector, the Singapore Ministry of Health has turned elsewhere to recruit foreign doctors.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The polyclinics employ many doctors from other countries like the Philipines, Vietnam, India, Thailand and Indonesia, some of whom are unable to speak Chinese or Hokkien, the lingua franca of elderly Singaporeans.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Most Singapore doctors will leave the public sector upon the completion of their mandatory 5-year bond if they are local graduates unless they decide to specialize further.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The meagre pay, long working hours and job satisfaction are often commonly cited as reasons for their departure and yet little has been done to retain senior medical officers within the public sector over the years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dr Chen ended his letter with a smug remark that Singaporeans should be grateful to the Malaysian (doctors):</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">“The more successful Singapore has become, the more I feel proud of my Malaysian compatriots who have crossed the Causeway to serve in the Lion City.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">But sometimes I would have this perverted idea: You Singaporeans need to be grateful to us, the “Made in Malaysia” yet forsaken lot, for what you have achieved!”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As a matter of fact, Dr Chen should be thankful to Singapore for giving him an opportunity to succeed in life. Had he not come to Singapore, he would have to serve his internship in a Malaysian hospital which is much busier before being packed off to a remote corner to serve a rural community for three years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">After working in Singapore for a number of years, Dr Chen will probably be able to retire in his homeland with little financial worries for the rest of his life like many of his compatriots who enjoy the best of both worlds by being a Singapore PR and Malaysian citizen at the same time.</span></span></p>

              <p>I met up with some old classmates several times since my university graduation, and discovered that over half of my Form V classmates had gone to study, work, or even settle down in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I knew many of the top talents from my school ended up in Singapore, but I was not aware that the number could be so big.</p>
              <p>Those secondary school classmates of mine were among the most brilliant in school, and Singapore was more than happy to bring these independent Chinese secondary school students there so that they could get the opportunity to advance their ambitions.</p>
              <p>Still on my internship at a government hospital here, I had a mixed bag of feelings, and to my own disbelief, I joined their rank several years later.</p>
              <p>Only a few days in Singapore, I was told by my superior that there were plenty of my compatriots around me.</p>
              <p>Indeed, beginning with my colleagues and looking upward level by level, I found that many of my highest level superiors were Malaysians.</p>
              <p>They were doing their work conscientiously and had contributed significantly towards the success of the tiny city-state.</p>
              <p>I suddenly had that feeling of pride that Singapore owed much of its success to the contributions made by Malaysian citizens.</p>
              <p>I was told by colleagues that Malaysian talents were the most sought after in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Due to cultural and geographical proximity, we are actually that group of foreigners who can best assimilate themselves into the Singapore society.</p>
              <p>This can’t be more true, as the two countries were forced apart by nothing but politics!</p>
              <p>Due to the nature of my job, I came to know many patients. Singapore is a multicultural, more so a multinational country. To these migrant workers, fundamental communication is never a problem: Chinese Malaysians are well versed in three languages plus an array of Chinese dialects.</p>
              <p>Not all Singaporean doctors have this linguistic gift! Due to their educational system, the younger generation of Singaporeans are proficient in English, mediocre only in Chinese. For Malay language, they are largely outsiders; as for Chinese dialects, that will have to depend on whether their gandpas and grannies are still around.</p>
              <p>As such, young Singaporean doctors face communciation problems when they encounter aged patients, resorting to hand language at times just to get their messages across.</p>
              <p>To Singapore, Malaysian talents are what they are most avid to tout for.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s meritocratic system knows no skin colours. But if it does, I could have bagged in more perks.</p>
              <p>I later decided to return to my country. Many have asked me why I wanted to come back to Malaysia, which is filthy, messy, hard to make a good living, and plagued with partial government policies.</p>
              <p>Why did I make such an unnatural decision? Perhaps the answer would be revealed in time to come, I was thinking.</p>
              <p>The more successful Singapore has become, the more I feel proud of my Malaysian compatriots who have crossed the Causeway to serve in the Lion City.</p>
              <p>But sometimes I would have this perverted idea: You Singaporeans need to be grateful to us, the “Made in Malaysia” yet forsaken lot, for what you have achieved! <em>(By Chen Jiaqi (reader)/Translated by DOMINIC LOH/Sin Chew Daily)</em></p>

              <p><em>“You know, the cure for all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government. You get that alternative and you’ll never put Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again…and your asset values will be in peril, your security will be at risk and our women will become maids in other people’s countries, foreign workers.’”</em><br> <br><strong>(Lee Kuan Yew justifying pay hikes for Singapore ministers, The Straits Times, 5 April 2007)</strong><br> <br>Singaporeans are an apathetic lot, always afraid to express an opinion or to take risk, preferring others to make the first move.  They are afraid that the vote is not secret and fear losing their jobs if found out they voted the opposition. They are afraid to express the truth about someone in power.  They are even afraid to speak up about things that effecting them directly e.g. the high cost of living, unemployment and poor quality life.<br> <br>This is because they are quite unaware about their rights to free, fair and honest expression.  The ISA inherited from the British and perfected by the PAP has a lot to do with this “Politics of Fear” resulting in PAP getting away with intimidations and threats.  Consider these coercions:<br> <br>a.  Lee Kuan Yew (2006): “Please don’t assume that you can change governments. Young people don’t understand this.”<br>b.  Lee Kuan Yew (2006):“Without the elected President and if there is a freak (election) result, within two or three years, the army would have to come in and stop it.”<br>  <br>If we dare to dream and we live our dreams…….. then imagine this:    <br> <br>Singaporeans get an opposition government and as promised, they reverse some of these past bad policies e.g.<br> <br>1.      Revise ministerial and civil service pay to a realistic level;</p>
              <p>2.      Revert to the original constitution and strengthen citizen rights and abolish ISA, EP, GRC and NCMP;</p>
              <p>3.      Abolish the following appointments – Minister Mentor, Senior Minister, Ministry Without Portfolio, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Minister of State and Parliamentary Secretary; and</p>
              <p>4.      Repeal Newspaper and Printing Presses Act of 1974 (NPPA) with all its attendant amendments permitting state control of the media, Legal Profession (Amendment) Act of 1987 (LP(A)A of1987), Public Order Act 2009 (POA), Official Secrets Acts (OSA).<br> <br>To prevent collusion, corruption and nepotism, the opposition government then presses into law the following:<br> <br>5.     Limiting to one (1) Deputy Prime Minister;<br>         Limiting the number of ministries and appointments to minister and deputy minister only;<br>         Limiting Prime Minister and Ministers to a maximum two terms;<br>         Limiting the age of MPs to 65 years; and<br>         Limiting MPs to a maximum services life of 15 years;</p>
              <p>6.      Preventing MPs and civil servants from sitting on boards of listed companies; and</p>
              <p>7.      Preventing PM and Ministers from appointing their family members and relatives to GLC companies, Temasek and GIC.<br> <br>To assist Singaporeans and attain a good standard of living, the opposition institute and implement the following:<br> <br>8.      Minimum wage;</p>
              <p>9.      Freedom of Information rules;</p>
              <p>10.   Policies to regulate and limit foreigners workers and new citizens into Singapore;</p>
              <p>11.    Polices to safeguard Singaporeans’ interests – good housing, health, education etc.;</p>
              <p>12.    Independent panels to oversee judicial appointments, ministerial pay, civil service &amp; military appointments, election boundaries; and</p>
              <p>13.    Independent panels to oversee our sovereign wealth – GIC, Temasek and CPF;<br> <br>To liberalize the political landscape and level the playing field for all political parties:</p>
              <p>14.    Free the local media from Govt. and PAP control;</p>
              <p>15.    Establish permanent Judicial Commission to hear complaints of political nature;</p>
              <p>16.    Reduce Govt.’s participation in commerce and de-couple GLCs from Govt.;</p>
              <p>17.    De-couple the PA and NUTC from the PAP and Govt. and passes law to prevent NTUC and PA from being associated or controlled by any Government of any political parties;</p>
              <p>18.    De-couple the Police and the Military from the Government and PAP; and</p>
              <p>19.    Ensure real competition on open and fair basis for the telecom, electricity, power and gas industries;<br> <br>Finally, to heal the country from years of political and mental abuses, the opposition government should:<br> <br>20.    Apologize to all ex-political detainees and political exiles;</p>
              <p>21.    Revoke all charges against all political detainees and annul all judgments pronounced against them and reimburse their losses (even if the Govt. has to compensate them);</p>
              <p>22.    Ask all political exiles to return and enjoin Singaporeans in the re-building of our political landscape;</p>
              <p>24.    Pay a one-time token compensation for the hardships, pain and sufferings caused to political detainees and exiles by the previous government; </p>
              <p>25.    Allow and encourage all forms of open and honest debates and discussions; and</p>
              <p>26.    Set up a Truth and Re-conciliation Commission to enable the country bring closures and heal wounds caused by the past government misdeeds.<br> <br>Are we dreaming?  Do we dare to live our dreams?  It is not time for us to move away from this politics of fear?<br> <br>Singaporeans, I ask and urge you search your innermost conscience and heart of hearts and see if the above are not what you have always want, prayed for and wished for our beloved Singapore?   Yes, if we have the courage we can together rebuild a nation – a nation free of fear and one that to be proud of. <br> <br>If so, Singapore really deserves immediately nothing less than a huge dose of “bad” and “incompetent” government and we Singaporeans must send to the PAP Government in no unintelligible terms  (and in the MM’s words) a “good dose of election signal” by not voting PAP in the next election.</p>

              <p>1. I don’t want to buy a house with a Cash-Over-Value of $100,000</p>
              <p>2. I don’t want to be accused of being fussy if I don’t want to live on the first floor or basement bomb shelter, or ulu ulu places like Kusu Island</p>
              <p>3. I don’t want keep hearing that flats are “affordable” when I really cannot afford flats.</p>
              <p>4. I don’t want to see foreigners flood our condos, HDB estates, MRT trains, buses, schools, EVERYWHERE</p>
              <p>5. I don’t want to know about how ministers are getting lots of landed and prime property both local and overseas when I have trouble getting a 3-room flat.</p>
              <p>6. I don’t want ministers who get multi-million dollar salaries when I do odd jobs and some months I don’t make more than $2,000.</p>
              <p>Ministers in other countries may take bribes and embezzle. My ministers are smarter, they get more money claiming more MILLIONS in salary LEGALLY.</p>
              <p>7. I don’t want to pay ERP just because foreigners’ cars are clogging my roads. Especially, when ERP do not solve congestion problems!!! We still have terrible traffic jams!</p>
              <p>8. I don’t want to do NS and reservist to protect my country against foreign invaders when:<br>(A) I don’t have a house to protect<br>(B) I cannot afford to start a family to protect<br>(C) I have to protect foreigners and their property with my life when they run away during war.<br>(D) Foreigner PRs do not have to serve<br>(E) I get paid worse than a Bangala worker. To think that National Service needed people donation’s in 1967, after a year, it gathered S$ 3 million from Singaporeans when we were all so poor.</p>
              <p>9. I do not want to see PRs and New citizens flashing their blue and pink ICs on their national days.</p>
              <p>10. I do not want to see the shamelessness of importing foreign athletes and claims that Singapore won when a foreigner won. Oh yes, we pay these foreigners millions of dollars so that Singapore can claim that it won. WOW!</p>
              <p>11. I do not want to hear jeering against the SG local soccer teams from foreigner spectators when we play against other countries IN OUR OWN COUNTRY!</p>
              <p>12. I don’t want to pay 7% more for everything I buy in my whole life when the government gives my $200 in “compensation” handouts!</p>
              <p>13. I want to see a local student being the top student. Not some China kid. Not hearing from ours kids that there is no point to work hard as some foreigner is going to squeeze them down inevitably.</p>
              <p>14. When there is public curiosity, I expect my government (especially Law minister) to be transparent enough let us know about Temasek and HDB cost to build a flat, etc.</p>
              <p>15. I want my country to be known as a COUNTRY. My country is NOT just a city like some idiot claims.</p>
              <p>16. I don’t want LHL’s son to be the next succeeding prime minister.</p>
              <p>17. I don’t like how China suckered us in the Suzhou park initiative and we still have to kiss their assess.</p>
              <p>18. I cannot understand why local siblings cannot buy flats when foreigner PR siblings can buy flats.</p>
              <p>19. Singles are not allowed to buy flats before 35? Are singles supposed to be forced into marriage just because of this? By the time singles reach 35, the flat prices will be higher by $100,000 to $300,000. These singles worked very hard to scrimp and save only to see savings ERODED away by inflation!</p>
              <p>20. I do not want to read the paper when it is pro-PAP and there is major censorship and selective publishing and late publishing for what cannot be hidden.</p>
              <p>21. I don’t want my life-savings to be belittled as the salt on the “peanuts”.</p>
              <p>22. I don’t like it when my country’s reserves lost tens of billions of dollars and the PM’s wife can still head Temasek!</p>
              <p>23. I want important national assets key to our security like power stations to BELONG to our country, not sold to foreigners.</p>
              <p>24. I like to add hum to my mee siam by the way.</p>
              <p>25. I want a president who actually DOES more. Not one which who I seek shakes hands, seldom speaks, does not even pardon and spare a 19-year-old kid his life. Not a president who kids confuse with Mas Selamat (Many kids who know Mas Selamat do not EVEN know Nathan)</p>
              <p>26. I don’t want to have my next national day parade at the silly riverside place….AGAIN! How long does it take to make a stadium? We are a country but we don’t even have a national stadium?? How about loaning Malaysia’s Merdeka Stadium for Singapore’s National day?</p>
              <p>27. I want job security. A contract for 1 or 2 years, Then look for work again. The cycle repeats. We have to worry for our jobs and livelihoods on a daily basis. When we are over 40 years old, who want us anymore? I might as well join the army as sign on. But wait, that is contract TOO!</p>
              <p>28. I don’t want the next generation to suffer like me in university. I had to work part-time to support my uni fees in NUS, while foreign students get free uni education thanks to MOE PLUS $500 allowance every month. After that, NUS still has the cheek to call me up and ask me to donate to NUS. Why they need money? They lost hundreds of millions of endowment in the financial crisis. I can still remember working and saving for 3 months before I could afford a 2nd hand laptop.</p>
              <p>29. I want to protest in the streets to voice my discontent without being put to jail by the ISA act or made bankrupt. For goodness sake, I don’t even dare to accept Singtel’s offer of giving me free 6 months internet if I switch from Starhub to Singtel, because I am scared that my IP address and my name will be blacklisted by the government. (considering Singtel’s afflictions with the govt)</p>
              <p>30. I want an opposition party in power. Any opposition is welcome. As educated and smart as my current and soon-to-be-ex ministers may be, I want people who CARE and LISTEN. Even if it is a guy who had graduated from kindergarten would be welcomed if he cares.</p>
              <p>31. Elites who have been born with a silver spoon, who never had trouble finding a job, who never had money difficulties, who never went hungry, who breezed through NS, do NOT deserve my respect nor should they be in the government. We need people who UNDERSTAND what it is like at the pits and bottom! Not some shortie who claims to understand hardship with a childhood living in 3-room flat but marries an angmoh and lives in a landed mansion.</p>
              <p>32. I want a better electoral system! I don’t want WALK-OVERs again. Some of the seniors did not even get to vote ONCE in their whole lives. How is that democracy?</p>
              <p>33. I want fairness. Is it a coincidence that certain estates under certain members of our government are especially well-cared for with upgrading etc incentives? Is this fair? Are residents of areas under the opposition similarly cared for? I quote a resident from Potong Pasir “the lifts here are so old and I can’t climb the flight of stairs to reach my place anymore.” I supposed the 60 year old aunty would be forced to vote for PAP to get new lifts.</p>
              <p>34. I want a limit to the number of years the PM can hold office, so that as bad and as lousy as the PM is, we can at least have a chance to start afresh.</p>
              <p>35. I want small quotas/ratios legislated for foreigners.</p>
              <p>36. I want foreigners to be restricted to less than 20% of our population instead of 36%.</p>
              <p>37. MBT actually said that foreigner PRs were under-represented in HDB flats. Pah! No more than 2 flats in a block should be sold to PRs! Otherwise, how can the many old uncles and aunties have pocket money for retirement by renting out flats?</p>
              <p>38. I want their CPF contribution percent to be much higher and that their CPF to be forfeited if they leave SG.</p>
              <p>39. I want higher income taxes and property taxes for foreigners.</p>
              <p>40. I want NS for foreigners.</p>
              <p>41. Foreigners who bought HDB flats cannot be allowed to rent their flat out EVER!</p>
              <p>42. I want the SGD to be moderated downwards! A higher SGD may benefit those who can afford to holiday overseas, those who are rich enough to send kids to overseas for studies, or PRs and foreigners when they remit money home. BUT overly high SGD deters investments into Singapore.</p>
              <p>43. I want curbs on inflation. To that effect, we need to install restrictions on property speculation, raise reserve ratios in banks, and have more stringent criteria before loans are issued. AND OF COURSE, GST lower back to 3%</p>
              <p>44. When foreign talent enters my country. I want these people to be REALLY foreign talent. I don’t want my country’s pink IC and PR to be handed out like toilet paper.</p>
              <p>45. I want more heavily subsidized birth-delivery, child-care, pediatric health and education care to boost local numbers. If S.Korea can do it, why not us? The practice of replacement diminishing local numbers with foreigner number MUST STOP.</p>
              <p>46. Instead of always saying Singapore does not have enough talent, will the government spend more money and effort in education and grooming the young? Every time they say that there is not enough of certain type of people, the government will import these people in masses and hordes.</p>
              <p>47. I expect government-affiliated institutions to not indulge themselves with luxuries when other citizens have bread-butter problems:</p>
              <p>When NTUC income unilaterally announced major cuts in its bonus for insurance-policy-holders, the MAS allowed this to happen. NTUC income claimed financial woes, but took HUNDREDS of agents to Australia for an exorbitant expense-paid holiday as they made the announcement earlier this year!!! Do they think about the widows and orphans when they dine fine with wine???</p>
              <p>At first I could not believe NTUC Income to be capable of this, then I checked on the web and saw the NTUC CEO hugging 2 BIKINI girls and drinking champagne in Australia too.<br>(1) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?&amp;hellip;1001838&amp;amp;ref=mf">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?…1001838&amp;ref=mf</a><br>(2) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?&amp;hellip;1001838&amp;amp;ref=mf">http://ms-my.facebook.com/photo.php?…1001838&amp;ref=mf</a></p>
              <p>48. I expect the MAS to protect citizens financially too:</p>
              <p>When thousands of investors lost their life savings in the mini-bond fiasco, where was the government?? Unlike the Hong Kong government which had exerted pressure on its local banks to compensate a minimum sum to its minibond holders, the Singapore authorities chose to stay out of the matter….. MM Lee Kuan Yew even chided Singapore investors for “walking in with their eyes open” and therefore did not deserve a compensation.</p>
              <p>49. I have 1 more issue with the state Media Press. HOW can they publish photos of people suspected of crimes when they have not EVEN been convicted?? Imagine the tarnishing to the poor suspect’s reputation if he were innocent! It is not as if the guy can sue ST and get $400,000 in defamation compensation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>50. Anyone can give the 50th reason??????????????? Come on my fellow locals. If I can say so much, you can at least say something! Few thousand people viewing this article and so little comments???</p>
