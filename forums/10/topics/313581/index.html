              Singapore, in addition to the search for escaped prisoner Mas Salamat
              Kastari, Lee has now begun a search for a future Prime Minister!</strong></div>
              <div class="post hentry uncustomized-post-template"><br></div>
              <div class="post hentry uncustomized-post-template">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Singapore state controlled paper, the Straits Times of April 04, 2008 in their story <em>"PM still looking for his successor"</em> has announced the official beginning of a new island wide search. In
              addition to the ongoing search for escaped prisoner Mas Selalamt
              Kastari, which has now entered its 30 day, a simultaneous thorough
              nationwide search has begun in Singapore to find a successor to the
              Prime Minister. Both searches are funded by the Singapore taxpayer!<br><br>Anyone
              not familiar with Singapore, having only read the Singapore Government
              website; would be surprised if told of such a search; for someone to
              replace the Prime Minister in 15 years time! For a start, is it not
              somewhat presumptive to assume he will remain Prime Minister for the
              coming 15 years; let alone his handing over power to someone of his
              choosing? Is this a democracy or is it a monarchy? Isn’t the Singapore
              government website claiming it to be a democracy a whole load of bull!<br><br>Isn't
              this peculiar practice in Singapore, of going around searching for a
              successor; somewhat similar to pre Chinese invasion Tibet, a theocracy,
              where Buddhist high priests scoured the entire country looking for an
              infant, God's chosen successor, and groom him to succeed the Dalai
              Lama, the spiritual and political leader of the country, when he
              eventually dies or retires!<br><br>But wait a minute, you will say.
              According to the Singapore Government Website, Singapore is supposed to
              be a democracy. Leaders are not supposed to be chosen the way a
              successor to the Dalai Lama is chosen! It is supposed to be the people
              who decide who their Prime Minister is going to be.<br><br>Not for Lee
              Kuan Yew's son to be going around searching high and low, under beds
              and behind cabinets, now! In any case, what makes him think he is going
              to be the Prime Minister for the next 15 years! Is it not possible for
              him to lose the elections the next time, so the question of his
              choosing the next leader will be preemptive? Why is he so confident
              that he will remain in power that long?<br><br>Anyone who understands
              Singapore will tell you that what meets the eye cannot be further from
              the truth. The Singapore Government Website is deliberately deceptive.
              And shamelessly so; shamelessly, because the government itself knows
              that no one believes the nonsense in it. If Singapore is a
              parliamentary democracy, as it claims, then Burma is not a military
              junta but a liberal democracy based on the rule of law, not dissimilar
              to Sweden!<br><br>The discredited Singapore government shamelessly
              continues to tell the world that it is something which it is not.
              According to the Singapore government website, it claims to be a
              parliamentary democracy. It is not. It does not practice rule of law.
              There is no free or independent press, all of which are both owned and
              controlled by the government. The system of government is no different
              from say, North Korea; except that it is impossible to escape from
              North Korea. You can from Singapore, which explains the massive
              continuing brain drain of young men and women who leave the country to
              settle overseas permanently. Young men and women who can no longer
              tolerate living in tyranny.<br><br>In the article, Lee's son, the Prime
              Minster, attributes the increasing brain drain of Singapore talent to
              settle overseas, as a reason why choosing a successor becomes even more
              difficult. According to the report, of the best High School students,
              about 100 leave the island permanently every year. Many others leave
              Singapore later. In fact these figures are much less than the real
              numbers that leave, an expected manipulation by a state controlled
              press. Almost 3,000 or so talented Singaporeans leave Singapore
              annually. These are the very best of the best; citizens whom Singapore
              would least want to lose.<br><br>And one reason why they leave is
              because of such inane silly statements that Lee's son puts out on a
              daily basis; thereby insulting the intelligence of any Singaporean who
              still can think; a group which is itself an endangered species.<br><br>Any
              self respecting young educated Singaporean would be outraged to read
              that Lee's chosen son is looking out to the next 15 years when he will
              eventually step down and appoint his chosen successor! Lee's son has to
              be advised to be a little less arrogant and self assured. He should not
              be assuming himself in power for the next 15 years if in fact Singapore
              is supposed to be a parliamentary democracy. Although practically
              unlikely, because he will rig the elections again, as he has done in
              all past elections; at least it is theoretically possible that he will
              be voted out in the 2011 elections. So don’t count your chickens before
              they are hatched!<br><br>But the truth of the matter is this. The
              Singapore press is entirely owned and controlled by the Singapore
              government; otherwise which press in the world would come out with
              arrogance such as this? Second, his prediction that he will remain in
              power for the coming 15 years will almost certainly be realized. With
              election rigging, defamation actions and criminal arrests, any possible
              contender for government office will be destroyed. Through such
              dishonesty and skullduggery and straightforward abuse of the law and
              illegal actions; he will probably be able to anoint his successor in
              the next 15 years after all.<br><br>And while this man, with the help
              of his father Lee Kuan Yew continues his illegal grip on power, those
              who can; the educated and skilled; continue to flee the country,
              leaving behind only those who are unable or incapable of leaving,
              through lack of education, skills or old age. While educated
              Singaporeans leave its shores in the droves, immigrants from Communist
              China who are unable to even speak English, let alone Malay are brought
              in to replace them. These immigrants from Communist China, through lack
              of skills or any ability are incapable of replacing the highly talented
              Singaporeans who leave. This continues the vicious cycle, on the one
              hand Singaporeans leaving and being replaced by uneducated unskilled
              immigrants from China.<br><br>A vicious cycle in a downward spiral.<br><br>I
              doubt very much Lee Kuan Yew's son being successful in his nationwide
              search for a successor. In fact I doubt very much whether Singapore
              will continue to function at its present level. All signs indicate that
              in the not distant future, he and his family will be the sole readers
              left for his state controlled newspaper, the Straits Times. That is, if
              it is still printed in the English Language!<br><br>I understand that
              “Thank You” in Mandarin Chinese is “Hsieh Hsieh”. So, Hsieh Hsieh to
              all of you. I am sorry I have to go now. I have to rush to my Mandarin
              lessons!<br><br>Gopalan Nair</div>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Letter from Daniel Lim, 6th April 2008</h3>
              <p><em>Following letter from Daniel Lim, verbatim, unedited</em><br><em>April 06, 2008</em><br><br>Dear Mr. Nair,<br><br>I
              hope what you said will one day come true, Lee is gone, the sooner the
              better. He has been a dictator for more than 40 years, should have been
              enough good life for him, God has been very kind to him and his family.
              Lee Kuan Yew has everything he wants in life, good food, good wine, etc<br><br>The
              problem is he is still going strong at his age, don't seems to get sick
              or on MC, so far never heard Lee Kuan Yew on MC. His mind is still
              sharp and alert, people said that he has been going thru blood
              transfusion, renewing his blood with blood from young people, some sort
              like vampire sucking virgin blood from women, not sure whether it is a
              fact or a myth? At the moment, Lee Kuan Yew has been keeping himself
              alive as long as possible, the reason is not because he wanted to have
              more title, like Supreme Senior Minister Mentor (SSMM), I guess he is
              more concern about his son, Lee Hsien Loong, it seems like his son
              don't have leadership quality to lead Singapore, Of course, Lee Kuan
              Yew took years to build up Singapore, he will not want to see PAP being
              ruined by his incompetent son, and his son still needs papa to be
              around. Without papa, there is no good wine, good woman, good money for
              Lee Hsien Loong and the generation after.<br><br>The Lee's family has
              been owing many assets, hoding high ranking position in private as well
              as government sectors, they have indirectly or directly involved over
              many things such as power station, transportation sectors, the media,
              stock market, airlines, telecommunication, public and private housing
              etc. Singapore is being runs like a business corporation, a money
              making places for them not like a democratic country.Who said Singapore
              never practice nepotism, who said Singapore don't have corruption.<br><br>Do
              you why the minister being overly pay? It is to silent them, as they
              knew some of the dirty secret inside, not because the government wanted
              to keep good people. Who dare to critise the pay master who pay them
              extremely well? Just close one eye.<br>Even the minister are pay well above market rate, they don't seems to perform that well, still screw things up and give excuses.<br><br>Mr.
              Nair, you are very lucky to have left Singapore with all your CPF
              saving, really good for you. Those who still in Singapore had to
              tolerate and listen to Lee Kuan Yew propaganda, we feels like living in
              North Korea, listing to the great leader Kim. Many of my friend who
              went overseas, I usually advise them not to return to Singapore, as you
              will not find any opportunity, as long as PAP is around. You can never
              reach the top especially in government sector, the top most is reserved
              for you know who.<br><br>Right now, the Lee's government is eyeing on
              our CPF, they claimed we needs to work until the age of 80, as they
              claimed that the CPF money is not enough for Singaporean retirement.
              What kind of bullshit! The CPF fund was set-up to secure our
              retirement, now they said the opposite, the CPF funds has been channel
              to some uses which we are not fully aware, we have been hidden from the
              truth. Do you ever wonder, those old folks who do not have any relative
              or next-of-kin, if they passed away, what happened to the CPF saving
              inside their account? Where will it channel to? This question has been
              lurking in everyone minds for sometimes.<br><br>I ready do hope there
              are resistance happening as you have mentioned in your previous mail,
              sad to said every election PAP always win, that confirmed for sure.
              Every election, PAP will offer some money, in other countries this
              called vote buying, in Singapore, they named it as GST rebates, NSS
              shares etc.<br><br>The opposition party at the moment do not have the
              talent and resources to stand up to PAP, those who are outspoken,
              either outlawed, outcasted or make bankrupt by PAP. I don't believe in
              one party government, it is very dangerous for Singapore, too much
              power under one person is not a good idea. If that person said black,
              who dare to said white, this remind me of the ancient China emperor,
              that why the dynasty does not last, and who suffer the most, it is the
              people at the bottom. In Singapore, that what happens, a dynasty
              raises, the emperor sit was passed on from father to son, then to
              grandson so on, as predicted. That why, Singaporean don't have any hope
              if this type of dynasty system keep going on, what can we do? To
              protest, it has been outlawed, to criticize you will be sue for
              bankrupt, everyone just keep their mouth shut.<br><br>For the ghost
              writer you have mentioned, definitely I am not the ghost writer or
              ninja writer or phantom writer working for Mindef, anyway the funds
              comes from tax payers, we are paying them to spy on us, Mindef should
              not have problem paying the writer, funds not enough ask the parliament
              to top up, so simple. Sometimes I wonder whether I have been monitored
              by ISD, who knows for sure?<br><br>Let keep our finger crossed.<br><br>I
              hope you can understand my writing, I am not a good English writer, my
              command of English is not as perfect as you do, please accept my
              sincere apology if you have problem understanding what I'm saying. <br><br>You
              need not reply if you feel it is not necessary or for my bad English, I
              just wanted to share my point of view as what democratic is all about.<br><br>By the way, what is Lee Kuan Yew net worth, anyone have any idea?<br><br>Nice meeting you.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Daniel Lim</p>

              <p>Emphasis is on <strong>RULING </strong>Singapore. I agree its not easy, you have to watch out for coups and disloyalty from your ka kia all the time. But then again with citizens like PAP propogandists and normal apolitical people...</p>
              <p>I am suprised at this public talk about finding a successor. LHL must want to purge the PAP whilst his father is still around. Step forward if you want to be leader (and get FIXED).</p>
