            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ejl:</div><div class="quote_body">What's wrong with making Singapore more cosmopolitan?  Singapore has an ageing society.  Look at Japan.  Ageing society, citizenship limited to Japanese natives and this is one amongst the other factors contributing to slower economic growth.<br><br>Singaporeans complain about racism in countries that are predominantly white.  Racist sentiments in Australia is overplayed by the Singapore media.  Having lived in Oz for nearly a decade, only one incident of racism and it's only one verbal sentence.  No attacks.<br><br>In fact, Singaporeans seem to have a significantly stronger tendency to exhibit discriminatory behavior.  Whites are treated better, people from less developed countries are treated worse.  Stop generalizing and look at the individual characteristics instead!<br><br>A multicultural place is beautiful.  Imagine yr neighbour on the left being Egyptian, your boss is Nigerian, yr colleague is Korean, yr best friend is Spanish and yr banker is Vietnamese.  Wouldn't that be so beautiful? </div></blockquote>Who was the one that restrict us to have more than two children in Seventies? wasn't it our freaking government, right?<br><br>Why didn't they (Gov) encourage people to have more children during the good time in late eighties toward mid nineties.  Isn't it too late to encourage people to have more children at this time where  recently the gov are encourging singaporeans to expore business into other countries;  if a family have to break up to go and earn a living in elsewhere, you think it is appropriate to do so....?<br>I feel that is very contradicting.  You called them an efficient government.  I said they must be an idiot! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Very disgusting!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First, I'm not sure who said Singapore's government is efficient.  I certainly didn't, but of course.. I've heard some crazy &amp; spineless people (without much hope of leaving Spore) sing praises about the Singapore government.<br><br>Second, it's astounding how many ppl listen to the govt's stop-at-two policy.  Actually, it demonstrates how obedient Singaporeans are.... I find it a big joke sometimes.  Birth choices is actually up to the individual.<br><br>Third, although I usually am satirical abt the Spore government, I think it's quite a good idea to go overseas for business opportunities.  Get PR status overseas, bring the family over and then start enjoying life OUT OF SINGAPORE.  It makes you a better person too, not like a frog in a well.  If you find a good place, it's highly likely you'll find that people in society don't really care much about material possessions, but more abt your personality.  So much happier..<br><br></div>
