            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, I really doubt that foreigners eg expat.. like to help us. B'cos many of us have been sabotage by them before. I think government should value their own citizens, train our own people rather than the foreigners. As in the end, they were to depend on us and not the foreigners. Chinese nationals were in singapore not just out for education but also to earn singapore monies as when it is converted is 4 times their Ren ming pi. RNB if i am not wrong. They have also taken up alot of our jobs as they ask for lower salary. This is unfair. Our government should know that it is us, Singaporeans whom they have to take good care of.</div>
