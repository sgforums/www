The government is. And even then, no there is no complete transparency. Temasek has only obligation to tell you your current standing. ROI is published yes, but not everytime they make a trade. That's just silly.<br><br>2) NULL<br><br>3a) The point stands. Even if you pay is not justified, there is no value in staying if there is no potential for increase. Ministers are paid highly here. That's how it works. We do not express shock that american presidents hold more power than our own. That's how THEY work. And you do elect your own leaders. Our prime minister wouldn't stay the prime minister for long if he loses in his own constituency. But he won. We DID elect him. Deal with it. If you hate this, help out in the opposition campaign next election. Did you work against the PAP last election season? If not, why are you complaining?<br><br>3b) 30% payraise. mmm. When was the last time ministers had a payraise? It's all relative. And people can get higher payraises in the private sector all the time. I've seen it happen.<br><br>4a) I remember a chinese proverb that translates roughly to this : to build something is easy, to maintain it is hard. Which is pretty true in today's turbulent times. Take the recent bloomberg article on Chile for example. The government is hoarding money, refusing to distribute wealth from the recent boom in copper exports, in the expectation that the boom will not last. That makes it an extremely unpopular administration. Sometimes doing the right things may seem wrong, and unpopular. But someone has to do it. Just because you don't see anything new doesn't mean no one's working. Thermodynamics baby, it's all about attrition. Someone has to constantly upgrade to maintain the status quo. Who's doing that work? Certainly not me.<br>I give credit where credit's due. If they weren't doing anything, the country would already by falling apart.<br><br>4b) Furthermore, look back in the times when the early leaders were implementing their plans for the future. Do you think putting so much money into infrastructure was at that time applauded by our fathers? At that time, do you really think people had the foresight that this investment would pay off? Much like the recent "foreign talent" debate, there would have been people raising doubts. Doomsday predictions would have been pretty common in the early days of independence. There IS progress. But progress is change. And people hate change. Hate blinds us. We never see the progress. Take a look around you. Think back to the days when you were a child. Maybe a decade ago. Has singapore REALLY stagnated?<br><br>To all the people who wish LKY die, I can only hope i hear your cries of regret when he really does. Because it will be a time of turmoil in Singapore. His sons may not be as great as he is, but thus far, I've yet to see better candidates.<br><br></div></blockquote>1) And in turn, the govt should report back to the people. That's my stand. You can say that we cannot question. My question is, why can't we question?<br><br>3) Again, you cannot disagree that their pay is so high that it has stunned so many people around the world. Therefore, whether they have frequent payrise is no longer an issue, since their pay is so high to begin with<br><br>4a) That is not exactly true. A well oiled system runs without any major problems. You can wipe up our entire cabinet, and our ministries can still function without the snakeheads.<br>I think the chinese saying you use might not be very applicable given today's emphasis on building operational processes to ensure a consistent method of handling tasks.<br><br>Take for instance an IT system. Its always the creation that is the main pain. After that, a well oiled system has less pain, less fire to fight, and less work to do to ensure it runs smoothly<br><br>Again, I say. The Elite will CREATE, so where is that super accomplishment that justifies their elite pay?<br><br>b) Again, you did not disagree with me. Great leaders must step down to allow new blood to work their ideas. This is something which we Asians fail miserably, but the westerners are really good at.<br>Coming back to the older generation.<br>HDB, CPF, these are policies that impact the people positively, though of course people at that time will have their concerns.<br>What can I remember about our current leadership?<br>- COE? ERP? Foreign Talent? Pay Increase? GST?<br>Do these benefit the people? NO. Does it benefit them? YES.<br>Look, I don't HATE them per se, but I do not like their elitist and high-handed approach in making changes beneficial to themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by soul_rage:<br><br>A few questions:<br>1) Does cheap = No quality?</blockquote>For public transport, to me at least, quality suggests a certain degree of comfort, cleanliness, efficiency and generally all round high standards in terms of service, punctuality and performance.<br><br>No. Cheap does not equal no quality. But cheap can almost certainly mean LOW quality.<br><br>Face it: quality costs something and someone always ends up paying in the end. the question as always, is who? It has to be the commuters.<br><br><blockquote>2) Does SBS truly really accomplish its A to B effectively? I remember surveys saying that bus punctuality is still a huge problem</blockquote>There are comparative studies done that suggests that Delgro does quite well when compared with other regional competition.<br><br>I take a bus and a train to work every morning. Granted, my workplace is pretty central and my neighbourhood is relatively well connected, but I'm very seldom ridiculously late for work even if I press the snooze button a few more times then I should.<br><br>If our public transport system is sub-par, then I must say that I must be very lucky cos I haven't encountered that many unpleasant situations on the public transport systems in my many years of commuting.<br><br>Put into its proper perspective, its an above average system by most measures. I don't exactly spend a fortune on public transport every month either.<br><br><blockquote>3) Is running it like a cooperative truly going to make it a loss-making machine?<br>4) Kindly do not compare with NTUC, its a useless cooperative that is doing EVERYTHING EXCEPT for what it was formed for.</blockquote>That was not my point but you've answered your own question. Like NTUC, Co-ops can be profitable. Like NTUC, Co-ops don't necessarily turn out to achieve its intended purpose and they certainly do not always pass on savings back to the consumers.<br><br><blockquote>Reask another question:<br>1) Does making public transport private necessarily make it better?<br></blockquote>In my view, yes. Privatization isn't the miracle cure to all problems but it helps. Freeing up a transport operator from being run through a government bureaucracy definitely helps.<br><br>Money is more forthcoming from either institutional investors, shareholders or bank loans rather than from the annual government budget.<br><br>The link between paid service to the commuter and its own bottom line is also clearer. No confusion about who pays the salary. It can help foster a more "customer oriented" service culture in the company.<br><br>The company has more freedom to experiment with new concepts and technology in public transport and has to do so with its own money. Proof of concept has to come quickly because even if the commuters don't have a competing company to defect to, it remains to be seen if a board accountable to its shareholders is willing to reinforce a failed concept with more money that could be better spent elsewhere.<br><br><blockquote>2) Why must it be a profit-oriented enterprise to help with urban planning?</blockquote>Because they will pick up part of the tab! It is in the interest of a city planner to ensure that buses that plies its streets are clean, modern buses so they do not become an eyesore or a source of air pollution. A pauper of a bus company will be in no position to do so.<br><br>Not to mention the construction of bus shelters? I'm honestly not very sure if its done by Delgro or LTA or if there's cost sharing but certainly, in a hypothetical situation, a stakeholder thats able to pay its own way is certainly better than one thats just waiting for a hand-out from the govt.<br><br>In fairness to your comment, urban planning is a multi-faceted affair with diverse stakeholders. Not all are "profit driven" or publicly listed, more than a few are government agencies and in this complex process, everyone comes to the table and tries to make the city better.<br><br>My view is that a privatized transport operator is probably in a better position to contribute and impose a degree of objectivity to those stakeholders who may be more driven by ideals than commercial viability.<br><br>The irony is, one might think that a profit oriented enterprise will attempt to squeeze every single bus for all that its worth and work it to death, but the truth is, its not in its interests to do so. Having a decrepit fleet is unsafe for commuters, damaging to public image and investor's confidence and chalks up excessive maintenance costs.<br><br>A government owned bus operator or a co-op won't have to worry about all of the above (except maybe public safety, if its mission is to merely provide cheap transport)<br><br>Will a govt owned or co-op bus operator be better run than a public listed, profit driven one? I think its debatable but I would place my bets on latter.<br><br><blockquote>And also kindly elaborate on what you mean by them not being contradictory.</blockquote>I mean that they are not contradictory goals because in the case of a privatized public transport operator, it is possible to make good money while providing quality and affordable transport for commuters.<br><br>The profit motive does not work against affordable transportation for the masses because there are many reasons for a privatized operator to keep the bus fleet safe, efficient and comfortable while at the same time charging a meaningful fare that almost everyone can afford.<br><br></div>

But cheap can almost certainly mean LOW quality.<br><br>Face it: quality costs something and someone always ends up paying in the end. the question as always, is who? It has to be the commuters.<br><br>There are comparative studies done that suggests that Delgro does quite well when compared with other regional competition.<br><br>I take a bus and a train to work every morning. Granted, my workplace is pretty central and my neighbourhood is relatively well connected, but I'm very seldom ridiculously late for work even if I press the snooze button a few more times then I should.<br><br>If our public transport system is sub-par, then I must say that I must be very lucky cos I haven't encountered that many unpleasant situations on the public transport systems in my many years of commuting.<br><br>Put into its proper perspective, its an above average system by most measures. I don't exactly spend a fortune on public transport every month either.<br><br>That was not my point but you've answered your own question. Like NTUC, Co-ops can be profitable. Like NTUC, Co-ops don't necessarily turn out to achieve its intended purpose and they certainly do not always pass on savings back to the consumers.<br><br>In my view, yes. Privatization isn't the miracle cure to all problems but it helps. Freeing up a transport operator from being run through a government bureaucracy definitely helps.<br><br>Money is more forthcoming from either institutional investors, shareholders or bank loans rather than from the annual government budget.<br><br>The link between paid service to the commuter and its own bottom line is also clearer. No confusion about who pays the salary. It can help foster a more "customer oriented" service culture in the company.<br><br>The company has more freedom to experiment with new concepts and technology in public transport and has to do so with its own money. Proof of concept has to come quickly because even if the commuters don't have a competing company to defect to, it remains to be seen if a board accountable to its shareholders is willing to reinforce a failed concept with more money that could be better spent elsewhere.<br><br>Because they will pick up part of the tab! It is in the interest of a city planner to ensure that buses that plies its streets are clean, modern buses so they do not become an eyesore or a source of air pollution. A pauper of a bus company will be in no position to do so.<br><br>Not to mention the construction of bus shelters? I'm honestly not very sure if its done by Delgro or LTA or if there's cost sharing but certainly, in a hypothetical situation, a stakeholder thats able to pay its own way is certainly better than one thats just waiting for a hand-out from the govt.<br><br>In fairness to your comment, urban planning is a multi-faceted affair with diverse stakeholders. Not all are "profit driven" or publicly listed, more than a few are government agencies and in this complex process, everyone comes to the table and tries to make the city better.<br><br>My view is that a privatized transport operator is probably in a better position to contribute and impose a degree of objectivity to those stakeholders who may be more driven by ideals than commercial viability.<br><br>The irony is, one might think that a profit oriented enterprise will attempt to squeeze every single bus for all that its worth and work it to death, but the truth is, its not in its interests to do so. Having a decrepit fleet is unsafe for commuters, damaging to public image and investor's confidence and chalks up excessive maintenance costs.<br><br>A government owned bus operator or a co-op won't have to worry about all of the above (except maybe public safety, if its mission is to merely provide cheap transport)<br><br>Will a govt owned or co-op bus operator be better run than a public listed, profit driven one? I think its debatable but I would place my bets on latter.<br><br>quote:And also kindly elaborate on what you mean by them not being contradictory.<br><br>I mean that they are not contradictory goals because in the case of a privatized public transport operator, it is possible to make good money while providing quality and affordable transport for commuters.<br><br>The profit motive does not work against affordable transportation for the masses because there are many reasons for a privatized operator to keep the bus fleet safe, efficient and comfortable while at the same time charging a meaningful fare that almost everyone can afford.<br></div></blockquote>Then perhaps you might want to change the word cheap to very affordable. Its all subjective. In your opinion, any cheap almost certainly means low quality, but that is not necessarily so. Even Japan has a 100 Yen shop, where all its products are of pretty good quality.<br><br>The word "Quality" is also subjective. To me, a bus service with air con is sufficient. To you, you might prefer better seats, Mobile TV etc. Remember the main purpose of public transport, is to ensure that it is affordable even to the poor<br><br>As for your personal case on how you travel to work, its again subjective. You have a convenient location. Others don't. Certain bus services are better than others, certain are not. The point is, a survey on Singaporeans island-wide gave a general view that bus punctuality is still not acceptable, and that is a fact.<br><br>By the way, in no way did I say our transport is sub-par. But its definitely still not up to the 'world-class' standards that we claim we are, because even the basic bus punctuality is not met.<br><br>By using an example of NTUC, you seek to stereotype cooperatives. If a cooperative is setup with the correct fundamentals, in which it ensures that it covers its cost adequately (without govt funding), and be used as a form of distribution of wealth, I am sure it will benefit many Singaporeans than the current monopolistic system we have.<br><br>And your idea that a private company will participate in urban planning and contributing to costs, is again not a guarantee. Its up to each private company to decide whether they want to participate.<br><br>And kindly note that privatising a public transport (which itself is already a contradictory statement) is contradictory, because a private company first and foremost cares about its shareholders and its profits. Its not 'public-oriented', but is 'profit-oriented'. Given a monopolistic market, where they can easily apply for fare increase, its already running against the public objective of making transport affordable.<br><br>You can say that in a cooperative, its unclear who pays the wages. I can say that in a cooperative, we can ask it to steer clear of additional costs (such as mobile TV, better seats, etc), and focus instead on its core, that is, affordable and punctual transport.<br><br>That being said, I agree that each model has its own merits, but currently, I am against privatization of public transport company because its, simply put, a monopoly. And all monopolies are bad for the end user (simple as that)<br><br>In a monopoly, increasing prices is the direct approach they use to increasing their bottom line. If we really should continue on the privatization approach, then we should have true competitors to ensure that fare increases are controlled by the market, and not some PWC council whose formulas are also questionable.</div>
