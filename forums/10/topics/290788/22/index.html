My dear Andrew. Like I've repeated oh so many times, we're no longer boys fighting in the playground. Kindly be more mature when phrasing your arguments. A little concrete logic behind said arguments would help immensely too.<br><br>Seriously, I can't believe you claim to have good English based on the fact that you may or may not have written a book yet to be published. And then, a few posts down, give this kind of gibberish.<br><br>Your arguments against my statement have thus far been illogical, and when pressed, incapable of establishing doubt. Repeating the same crap over and over again will not further your cause. Who's the Simpleton now?<br><br>I have indulged you weeks ago by writing two long posts describing the reasoning behind my position. Your only rebuttal thus far has been to call me an idiot, reasoning that explaining your rebuttal to an idiot is a waste of time. Sorry bro, that doesn't work in the real world. Also, your (only) rebuttal point of my statement being wrong simply because people offer programs online to calculate odds for POKER is so far off the logic charts I'm surprised you could even imagine it.<br><br>Basically you're going to need to come up with hard answers for some of the garbage you've been spewing. This is just one of the more recent ones. Let's revisit the topic that started your recent insult post:<br><br>1) You claim that forex trading is a stab in the dark. This implies you think any currency trades is pure speculation and doomed to failure in the long run.<br><br>2) You follow up previous point with a hint that you have been successful only because you used "insider information", and that only by trading on  "insider information" can anyone be successful in trades.<br><br>3) You predict a rise in Thai baht against the SGD. Reasons cited :<br><br>"because Thailand is the second biggest economy in SEA... and you can go to Thailand by bus...<br>"<br><br>4) Thai baht appreciates against SGD. You now claim to have bought on the baht, citing this as an example of your expertise.<br><br>It does not take much to put two and two together and realise you are either saying:<br><br>1) you believe that the statements "thailand is 2nd biggest economy in SEA" and "you can go to thailand by bus" are considered insiders information, AND that they were the driving influence in the recent appreciation of the baht against the SGD.<br><br>OR<br><br>2) You believe your previous statements about all forex trades being a gamble AND recognise that the above statements do not constitute insiders information. In this case, you have been obviously GAMBLING with the baht, and now claim credit on a winning gamble, hoping to increase your credibility as a market guru.<br><br>It is of point to note that Andrew does not even talk about having bought the baht until after the baht appreciated. Talk about hindsight. I don't even see why you bother posting about markets or gambling anymore Andrew. I have obviously crushed you in both arenas in terms of knowledge and common sense.<br><br>Oh btw Andrew, don't worry. I don't make empty threats(even if you misunderstand them). You'll get what's coming. I promise.</div>
