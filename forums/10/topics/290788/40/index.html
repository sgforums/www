Evidence of widening unemployment heightened anticipation that the Federal Reserve would further cut interest rates this month, perhaps by an unusually large half a percentage point, in a bid to prevent the economy from sliding into the muck.<br><br>Â“This is unambiguously negative,Â” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at MoodyÂ’s Economy.com.

Of course not, the policies they make are for the benefit of themselves, their relatives and their cronies.<br><br>I am not saying that they should have taken my advice. What I am saying is that, as I have shown in my article, this is just waiting to happen and the despots know but do not care. They pay themselves millions, why should they care if you suffer?<br><br>They only care how much public money they can get for themselves, and their relatives and all they care about you is to make policies that put you in as much debt as possible, so you will have to work harder for their benefit.<br><br>When (not if) things go wrong, they do not care because they will still be in power and why is that? Silliporeans did not care when they did and do scurrilous acts to opposition members (think Mr JB Jeyaratnam, Dr Chee Soon Juan, Dr Francis Seow, et al....).<br><br>So ultimately, Silliporeans are to blame for their short-sighted blind faith in despots that are all out to enrich themselves with public money.</div>
