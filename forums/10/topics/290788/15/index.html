If we really should continue on the privatization approach, then we should have true competitors to ensure that fare increases are controlled by the market, and not some PWC council whose formulas are also questionable.</div></blockquote>I agree with what you're saying in theory, but when applied to the local situation, we also need to consider whether there's a critical mass available to support more competition.<br><br>I think the best we can do is achieve an oligopoly (and that's not exactly desirable too cos it can turn into a cartel by crossing the thin red line).<br><br>Maybe a "monopolistic" model might be workable, with different companies given licenses to ply specific routes and open tenders required say, every 3 to 5 years to ensure that the most competitive bid with the best overall service package gets to operate the route.<br><br>That will introduce competition in the public transportation industry while ensuring the viability of a few medium sized bus service operators.<br><br>That will of course, raise separate problems as medium sized bus operators may not be able to achieve the economies of scale necessary to ensure affordable pricings.<br><br>Ultimately, its back to the point of "who's paying for it"? Somebody will have to in the end and i think the current situation, though not perfect, offers the most equitable solution possible for our situation.</div>

Am I right to say that since July 2007 (as you claim is the time have predicted the market will crash)you would have already exit the stock market?<br><br>b) Suppose if Yes. What will you be doing with the $100m worth of funds?<br><br>c) Suppose your answer is NO, will you be able to tell us which are the stock which you will continue to hold starting from today (reason I asking starting from today is because I know you will dig out the best performing stocks from the last 3 months and say thats your prediction)<br><br>Over to you Andrew!!<br></div>

But you seem adamant about finding her guilty anyway, so on to the next point...<br><br>you really have to forgive us mortals andrew. Unlike you, we have no power to predict what will happen tommorow. Oh right, sorry, i forgot all your predictions have been wrong. Guess you're a mortal too.<br><br>I guess you've never bought high and sold low before. What was that you were saying? Stop loss importance? Definately doesn't apply to your enemies right. When they stop loss, it's buy high sell low. When it's you, it's financial genius.<br><br>See, unlike financial gods such as yourself, we look to long term investments. What? You buy and hold for decades? That sounds pretty long term too. It's beginning to really sound like you're not so much a financial guru, as a paradox of values.<br><br>Hey if you're so great about prediction, maybe you shorted the market recently, anticipating free-fall. Is that the real reason for your current inactivity? I mean, you were confident right? Why not short?<br><br>That's really the question you should ask all "experts" when they tell you it's crashing. If they don't even believe in their own analysis, why should you believe them?</div>
