            <div class='col-md body'>By the way Andrew, you always seem to have tons of "knowledge" to share with the public.<br><br>It's pretty weird how you're refusing to share this "secret" of yours. Nothing to hide right? Why not? You're still in favor of helping your fellow singaporeans break free of poverty right?<br><br>Well here's pure speculation based on your posts:<br><br>1) you worked in a member firm of SIMEX(which could mean pretty much anything. You could have been head cleaner for all i know)<br><br>2) somehow you got some insider information from there regarding certain big movements(here's where it gets dodgy. see 2a and 2b for reasons)<br><br>2a) now if this were accurate information(which could only be P&amp;C), you would be pretty much breaking the law by trading on it.<br><br>2b) here's the kicker. The other alternative(which is the legal one) would be that this was hearsay(rumors) you overeheard while working. This puts you at around the level of competence in trading as the aunties in the market who play the market based on rumors.<br><br>So really andrew, which is it? Was it accurate, private information that you ILLEGALLY traded on, or pure rumor speculation which you legally(but stupidly) traded on?<br><br>The fact that you actually made money doesn't really matter. As they say in poker, even blind squirrels occasionally find the nuts.<br><br>Note that just because no one came after you does not make it legal in any way. Or ethical for that matter. Hey Andrew, Ethics!! We need to discuss this. I'm VERY interested in what you consider ethical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only unique thing I observe in this thread and sometimes the whole speaker's corner - people can be divided separately into three basic groups : The  pro PAP supporters, the anti PAP and then we have those who practically " <span style="font-style: italic;">ai yo , not the pap vs non pap crap again</span>" .<br><br>The pro pap supporter - good thing: they support PAP , bad thing: some support PAP so blindly that they walk into walls. PAP tell them to jump down a cliff - they will .<br><br>The anti pap supporter - the good thing : they can criticise the policies and PAP for the good of the nation, bad thing: some do go overboard sometimes. Head on straight into a clash.<br><br>The third group just sit silent and add neutral remarks to avoid getting labelled as PAP lapdog or opposition idiot.<br><br>The fact remains: the whole thread is hilarious to read because of all the extremist views coming from both sides.</div>

It just shows how naive some are.<br><br>First of all , you ain't living in a country that encourages free speech. So don't free speech too much. I learnt my lesson when I went on a free speech rampage in a MP face to face forum - got asked for my NRIC number. Yup face to face.<br><br>Second of all, it's fun when people just don't see the problems and think PAP is infallible  like God.<br><br>Third of all, I am laughing at some of the naive remarks. It does nothing. I would think that PAP have people to monitor the internet  - if your ideas are good - they may actually reformulate your idea and package it as theirs. That is the only way I see that the internet working. You trash them also no point - they just bring out the big carrots and the gullible will follow like donkeys.</div>
