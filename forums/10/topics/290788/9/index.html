            <div class='col-md body'><strong>S'pore less attractive to expats: Survey<br>Island slowly edging its way up the list of costliest cities </strong><br><br>Singapore may be gradually losing its competitive edge to regional rivals like Hong Kong as the rising cost of living deters expatriates from coming here.<br>.<br>This is according to a survey by human resource body ECA International, which compared the costs of 128 consumer goods and services purchased by expatriates in more than 300 cities. They include groceries, drinks and tobacco, clothing, motoring expenses and restaurant meals. Accommodation, car purchase and children's school fees are not included because they are usually provided as part of expat packages.<br>.<br>According to the survey, Singapore is the ninth most expensive city in Asia this year, up a notch from last year Â— 122nd worldwide, up 10 rungs. Hong Kong's ranking has remained unchanged as the fifth most expensive location in the region and 79th worldwide.<br>.<br>In a head-to-head comparison, Hong Kong is 12 per cent more expensive than Singapore, Shanghai 5 per cent more expensive, while Kuala Lumpur is 30 per cent cheaper, ECA told Today.<br>.<br>The most expensive city in Asia for expats is Seoul, followed by Tokyo and Yokohama. Worldwide, the most expensive city is Luanda, the capital city of Angola, followed by Oslo and Moscow.<br>.<br>The consumer price index (CPI) in Singapore jumped 3.6 per cent last month from that of a year earlier, the fastest pace in more than 16 years, the Department of Statistics said last week. Contributing to the rise was the 2-percentage-point increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July and the surge in oil prices.<br>.<br>"The recent rise in GST and overall rising inflation resulting in higher CPI have all contributed to pushing up living costs in Singapore. This, together with no change in Hong Kong's position, means that the gap is closing between the two traditionally competitive locations," said ECA, the world's largest membership organisation for human resource professionals.<br>.<br>The strengthening of the Singapore dollar to a 10-year high against the United States currency this month has also made the cost of living dearer for expatriates.<br>.<br>"Companies that need to send employees into Singapore will now have to apply higher cost of living indices to salaries to guarantee their personnel's spending power," said Mr Lee Quane, general manager of ECA International in Hong Kong.<br>.<br>Mr Quane's observation highlights the dilemma faced by the Singapore Government. The threat of an inflationary spiral has prompted calls for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to let the local dollar strengthen further but there are concerns among the business community that a stronger local currency will hurt export competitiveness and diminish the island's attractiveness as a business hub.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>....looks like we might have a crash... remember, it is so serious now that "we might have a crash... anytime" MIGHT, there are no guarantees ... but according to my analysis, the possibilities of it happening are very high....<br><br>... take the necessary defensive actions...<br><br>... hope for the best but be well prepared for the worse!<br><br>... it night not happen, but I am telling you that the possibilities of it happening is very high...

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew there is no point telling us you are smart by reporting DowJones and yesterday news because my notebook and internet connection is already capable for feeding me more accurate and timely information.<br><br>If you want to show us how smart an investor you are, let me ask you.<br><br>a) Suppose if your running a investment company that manage $100m worth of fund. Am I right to say that since July 2007 (as you claim is the time have predicted the market will crash)you would have already exit the stock market?<br><br>b) Suppose if Yes. What will you be doing with the $100m worth of funds?<br><br>c) Suppose your answer is NO, will you be able to tell us which are the stock which you will continue to hold starting from today (reason I asking starting from today is because I know you will dig out the best performing stocks from the last 3 months and say thats your prediction)<br><br>Over to you Andrew!!<br><br></div>
