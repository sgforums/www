Harrison<br>Special to TheStreet.com<br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">7/23/2007 2:51 PM EDT</span></span></strong><br>Click here for more stories by Daniel M. Harrison<br><br>While the consensus in Europe is that Barclays (BCS - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr) will not end up owning ABN Amro (ABN - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr - Rating), a new deal offered by the British bank signals a change in the landscape of global banking.<br><br>In a move to compete with the 71 billion euro bid for the Dutch financial goliath by the Royal Bank of Scotland-led banking consortium Banco Santander and Fortis, Barclays on Sunday turned to China State Development Bank and Singapore's Temasek Holdings. The Asian institutions in turn agreed to provide up to 13.6 billion euros ($18.76 billion) to juice a new, 67.5 billion euro ($93.1 billion) counter-offer composed of 37% cash.<br><br>Most pertinently, however, was the disclosure that 3.6 billion euros -- nearly $5 billion -- of that investment in Barclays is "unconditional on outcome of proposed merger with ABN Amro."<br><br>In other words, whether or not the deal with ABN goes through, China State Development Bank will now purchase an additional 3.1% stake in Barclays, while Temasek's 1.4 billion euro infusion will give it a further shareholding of 2.1%.<br><br>Those sums give China State Development Bank -- which is owned and controlled by Beijing -- a 6.3% shareholding and Temasek a 2.2% shareholding in Britain's largest global investment house. Barclays is currently valued at 47.22 billion pounds, or $88 billion. </blockquote><a href="http://www.thestreet.com/markets/marketfeatures/10369550.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestreet.com/markets/marketfeatures/10369550.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you considered what you would do if Singapore crashed?<br><br><blockquote>Singapore<br>INDEX	VALUE	CHANGE	%CHANGE	TIME STRAITS TIMES INDEX	<strong>3,454.98	-56.14	-1.60%	22:53</strong><br>SINGAPORE ALL INDEX	967.07	-12.01	-1.23%	22:51</blockquote>People have been warning and warning the despots not to be so well despotic and be more transparent and accountable.... but did they listen? Just because they had gotten away with it for so long does not mean that they will always get away with it....<br><br>Remember, this stock market crash is not like all the previous stock market crashes... because this stock market crash is a symptom of far worse problems... and if they cannot solve the problem... nobody wants it to happen ... but if it does, its going to be a really hard knock this time...<br><br>forget them for a moment... what would YOU do? How would YOU react? are YOU prepared?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wait until it stares you in the face... it will be too  little too late...<br><br>Just like, by the time time the despots are forced to abandon their non-transparent and despotic ways... it will be too little too late...<br><br>BTW it is because of their fawning running dogs that they can keep their opaque, unaccountability and they can continue in such dishonorable ways...<br><br>people keep on telling them not to be so despotic but their running dogs keep on fawning on them to encourage them to be dishonorable...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So nobody know whether its going to be a crash or a correction lah..so every time the market comes down, its a sign of a crash lah..then just sell.. issit correct ? Like July start coming down going to crash then sell lah...break new high then start to come down so going to crash then sell lah..if got anything left to sell....so everytime coming down just say going to crash lah...<br><br>Its good to take measures to protect against a crash though...drop how much constitutes a crash ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just hope that it doesn't crash... but even if you escape this time, you might not be so lucky the next time... because the despots pushed the property prices so sky high by acts of commission and omission (if it crashes this time... ) it will be much worse than if they had moderated the property price increase, or as I suggest more than one year ago, cause a gradual price decrease, to a more reasonable level....<br><br>Yet the propaganda machine, if there is a crash, will put the blame squarely on "international forces" and remove any blame away from themselves... and their running dogs will help spread the message that it is not their masters fault...</div>
