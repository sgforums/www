In a single party government , it becomes more pronounced.<br><br>Even in a multi party government - there are opposing views as there are supportive views amongst the media.<br><br>So just look and laugh lor.<br><br>For example in one forum, the 2% GST increase , some people (especially some of the pro pap supporters) so naively think it is 2% increase only on the product . It is not . Take for example 2% GST increase on your chicken rice - your chicken already got 2% increase on it , the rice also 2% increase on it as with all the ingredients.  Add up all the 2% increases on the raw materials to produce a product - yup 2% increase in GST is not equals to 2% only.<br><br></div>

In the next 2 years , it is too risky for me to dabble with the current market . I already pulled out at the right time when Rio Tinto shares went up.<br><br>Singapore won't be the only one affected. It will be other countries as well.<br><br>Now is the time to not play shares.
