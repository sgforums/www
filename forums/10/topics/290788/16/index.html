            <div class='col-md body'>Wow Andrew, you've uttered so much rubbish while i was gone, this is going to take some time.<br><br>Let's do this quote by quote:<br><br><blockquote>Lucky for us the the financial markets crash did not happen...<br><br>If it did, then the liquidity crunch adding to the credit crunch would have been a big disaster.<br></blockquote>Was this supposed to explain for why the markets didn't crash as you predicted? In your infinite wisdom, shouldn't you have accounted for this possibility? Yeah, we're lucky the markets didn't crash. You also gain credit for us being lucky we didn't get hit by a meteor today. We were just lucky.<br><br><blockquote>It is so good to be a 1st world democracy... the rest of the world has no choice (other than other 1st world democracies, meaning Euro zone) but to support these countries and let their citizens party on at the expense of the coolie economies. </blockquote>This one really convinced me you have no idea what you're saying when you string random words together. "1st world democracy"? WTF has a democracy got to do with the way they manipulate their economies? Can a communist country with USA's economic muscle not execute the same moves? But hey, stringing big words together make you sound more intelligent, right? Moving on!<br><br><blockquote>Ho Jinx is really a Jinx. In July when she bought Barclays, it plunged and she could have bought it at a much cheaper price.<br><br>Just after she sold Bank of China, the markets stabilized and she could have sold at a much better price... hahahahaha JINX </blockquote>I love how good your hindsight vision is. It's not like you've never made a wrong call before right. Oh right, the market crashes you predicted never happened. OMG ANDREW IS A JINX HAHAHAHA. Does that sound fair to you?<br><br><blockquote>I am almost tempted to say, watch Ho Jinx moves (reverse) in foreign transactions and because Temasek has bully power locally, watch Ho Jinx moves in Singapore (linear)...<br><br>... but the truth is, there are too many things to consider when it comes to investing...<br><br>... speculating, like forex and futures are completely out of the question for they are, gambling, like casino gambling and in the end you will lose it all...</blockquote>I don't understand that first paragraph here, and I'm almost certain no one else did, so there's nothing to say about that. Of course, the part about speculating and casino gambling is the one i want to talk about. In that thread you had about this very topic, you have proved yourself to be unfamiliar with casino gambling AND the forex. How are you in any way authorised to make judgements on either, and especially on both?<br><br><blockquote>... if you want to speculate the forex and futures markets, forget it, it will only be like gambling at the casino because you have no access to inside information...<br><br>... even then, I went in, made my money and stopped... you have to wait until you have good inside information.... if you want to win...<br></blockquote>Here we get to Andrew's secret. The reason why he thinks he's way of trading is the best, a surefire-win method. INSIDE INFORMATION! Yeah, bank robbing is sure win too, if you don't get caught. He follows on to say:<br><br><blockquote>... depending on "odds calculation" using openly available information is useless...<br><br>... it is as good as a tikam tikam guess and like tikam tikam guesses, you will be right and you will be wrong at times...<br><br>... but losing money in the end is for certain.</blockquote>In other words, in all his supposed experience in trading, he has never believed in the standard methods used for investments by honest traders everywhere. He views them as gambling, because it's not 100% success. Oh no, the only way to trade is to use insider information. Yup, this is what he's trying to preach here. Fundamentals? Useless. Estimation of odds? Useless. In other words, being the world champion in poker is useless, no matter what skills you have, because Andrew will always bet you, because he only plays when he can look at your cards. That's what he's trying to say here.<br><br><blockquote>Once Ho Jinx sell at rock bottom, the market stabilized and she could have sold at a much better price...... </blockquote>I find it odd that you advocated the importance of a stop loss in your market crash thread, yet seem to think that stop losses aren't important here. I know, you're used to insider's information. Hindsight bias doesn't apply to you. You KNEW the market would rebound right? Oh that's right, you agreed that the markets would crash too. Holy 20/20 hindsight batman.<br><br>So what you're saying is that, if you were running Temasek, despite the predictions you had that the markets would crash or dive lower, you would have held on to your positions?<br><br>Andrew, your logic is perverse beyond compare.</div>
