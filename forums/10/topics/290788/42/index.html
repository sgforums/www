I will say, just follow the stock markets and when it is time, to take a position, it could be six months or one year or two years.<br><br>As for 'what are the best vehicle to park your money?' That is a very good question.<br><br>The despots have put Singapore in a precarious position when they pushed up property prices. Unfortunately in Singapore, without democratic checks and balances, they could do what they like just so that it benefits themselves and their cronies while putting the welfare of the country at risks.<br><br>There is not much the average Singaporean can do because they have no idea how to hedge the risks even if they know where the risks are. To try to do it can do more harm than good, if you do not have a crystal clear idea of what to do and how to do it and what the harms and dangers of doing it are. These type of activities, hedging, the person doing it needs also, to have a heart of stone.</div>
