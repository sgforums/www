And what benefit will that bring to EU if US$ is low.<br><br></div></blockquote>Mr. G<br><br>1) EUR/USD<br><br>Numerator and Denominator<br><br>The Numerator is the top part of the fraction and the Denominator would obviously be the bottom part of it. Lets take an example with EUR/USD<br><br>EUR would be the Numerator (the first currency which is on top)<br><br>USD would be the Denominator (the currency that comes below or after the EUR)<br><br>The numerator is called the base currency and the denomiator is known as the counter currency.<br><br>Now whenever you place a "BUY" order in a Forex platform for example with the EUR/USD pair, what you are actually doing is buying the EUR and selling the USD. Buying in the Forex is known as going "LONG".<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-for-beginners/forex-currencies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-for-beginners/forex-currencies.html</a><br><br><strong>If people in EU starts selling USD for EUR, won't that push down the value of the USD???<br><br>Do I have to spoonfeed you everytime? Use abit of your brain to think things out.</strong><br><br>2) Capital Flight<br><br>Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets and/or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an economic event that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength. This leads to a disappearance of wealth and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country (depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime).<br><br>This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss of faith in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods.<br><br>In 1995, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that capital flight amounted to roughly half of the outstanding foreign debt of the most heavily indebted countries of the world.<br><br>Capital flight was seen in some Asian and Latin American markets in the 1990s. The Argentine economic crisis of 2001 was in part the result of massive capital flight, induced by fears that Argentina would default on its external debt (the situation was made worse by the fact that Argentina has an artificially low fixed exchange rate and was dependent on large levels of reserve currency). This was also seen in Venezuela in the early 1980s with one year's total export income leaving through illegal capital flight.<br><br>Capital flight is also sometimes used to refer to the removal of wealth and assets from a city or region within a country. Post-apartheid South African cities are probably the most visible example of this phenomenon. Johannesburg in particular has been abandoned by business moving to northern suburbs. The flight of capital from central cities to the suburbs that ring them was also common throughout the second half of the twentieth century in the United States.<br><br>In the last quarter of 20th century capital flight was observed from countries that offer low or negative real interest rate (like Russia and Argentina) to countries that offer higher real interest rate (like China).<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight</a><br><br>I am sure you don't need me to spoonfeed you on the effects of capital flight.<br><br><strong>With money flying out of USA (where will it fly to?), which other country has a stable economy like USA? Ok, I will type it out. EU!!!<br><br>Please use more of the lipids in between your ears, instead of relying on pure spoonfeeding from our government controlled media.</strong></div>

Even more important, China's huge foreign reserves of $1.43 trillion are in danger, with the dollar weakening as the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. Already the dollar has fallen more than 5% against China's international currency, the renminbi, to now about 7.45 RMB to the dollar.</blockquote><blockquote>Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) Â— Federated Investors Inc., the third- largest manager of money-market accounts in the U.S., bailed out its Enhanced Reserve cash fund as declines in mortgage-backed securities caused the credit markets to seize up.</blockquote></div>
