I would exit the higher risk stocks and consolidate the profits, and move those into safer instruments like bonds and deposits. But as a fund manager, I would be constrained by the fund (some funds require a 75% equity and 25% bonds target for eg).<br><br>I would buy into blue chip's that are performing well now at a price that looks reasonable (based on certain factors like PE, competitive advantages etc), since the market has corrected quite a bit since the sub-prime crisis. Blue chips generally are a safer investment during bearish corrections. I will stay out of the finance companies, and wait abit to see how the sub-prime plays out before re-investing into them<br><br>Anyway, I am not a fund manager so those are my guesses on what I will do.</div>

It is an investment house. I'm not sure who you've been talking to, but this is an industry shrouded with mystery.<br><br>2) Charities do not fall under the government. They are subsidised by it. There's a difference. In fact, as a donator, we had more responsibility to keep an eye on it.<br><br>3) change takes time. and the time taken is proportional to effort. as for the comparisons to private sector, that was just spin. It's a pay raise, pure and simple. But they predicted the citizens wouldn't understand this concept due to their idea of leaders equating to martyrs. What, ministers can't have pay raises? That's rubbish.<br><br>4) They aren't harping their past achievements. If you realise, they are trying to improve on it. Andrew was the one who brought those up, so I had to defend them, seeing as no one else would. Those were remarkable achievements, and did not deserve Andrew's slander.</div>

You are PAID to come up with solutions, not coming up with excuse.<br><br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CX:</div><div class="quote_body">I am actually sympathetic to their explanation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  It is a potential chimera and it is really complicated because it will be almost impossible to properly categorize a "necessity".<br><br>There are also other implications: what about import GST? Are we going to allow 0% import GST for a "necessity" like say... rice flour?<br><br>And what about service GST on value add to "necessities" imported? Like, for example, if I import rice flour and make it into rice noodles and sell it to a supermarket? The "value-add" would have been taxable, even if the cost of the flour was not. Should it be waived?<br><br>And then, will the supermarket be allowed retail it for 0% GST?<br><br>The compliance costs for a company to track all these requirements will be onerous and they will quite simply pass on this cost to the consumers, GST or not.<br><br>Here's another crap example just for fun: what if i made the rice flour into udong, or ramen, or spaghetti? are they are same as rice noodle? should they be duty free too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The list goes on... So really... the "its too complicated" rationale is not an "excuse"... its an oversimplification of a tragically complicated issue.<br><br>From IRAS's perspective, it will be impossible to regulate such a tax regime. They will probably have to hire more leeches... errm...  sorry, "tax officers"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  to monitor the regime... that's gonna drive up costs even more.<br><br>Then, u'll find that the govt will need to spend more money to make sure that they collect less money and u don't have to pay more GST... its an impossible situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I quite agree that the GST is a regressive tax... But I don't find the exemption of so called "necessities" equitable as well.<br><br>It might be more equitable to waive GST for goods on importation, but to apply it fairly across the board for all other transactions and services performed in the economy, post-importation.<br><br>This may even stimulate foreign trade on top of slightly reducing the tax burden across the board. </div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soul_rage:</div><div class="quote_body">Either way, if there is a willingness to implement a staggered GST, there are ways to circumvent those excuses they came up with to convince us that staggered system is impossible. For eg, use the simplest solution by just categorizing all rice types to 0% GST, regardless. After all, you gain much more from other types of goods, so what's the problem about letting some types of rice that are more 'luxurious' get thru the loophole?<br><br>Anyway, the importation idea you have is worth considering.</div></blockquote>I think in Taxation, both income tax has to work together with good and service tax to help the poor.

There's a difference. In fact, as a donator, we had more responsibility to keep an eye on it.<br><br>3) change takes time. and the time taken is proportional to effort. as for the comparisons to private sector, that was just spin. It's a pay raise, pure and simple. But they predicted the citizens wouldn't understand this concept due to their idea of leaders equating to martyrs. What, ministers can't have pay raises? That's rubbish.<br><br>4) They aren't harping their past achievements. If you realise, they are trying to improve on it. Andrew was the one who brought those up, so I had to defend them, seeing as no one else would. Those were remarkable achievements, and did not deserve Andrew's slander.</div></blockquote>Quick response back to you<br>1) Temasek is not required to be transparent, that's true. But Temasek does hold the public's money (its the govt's investment arm) and uses it for funding of their investments. How would you know proper checks and balances are in place if they are not transparent?

And even then, no there is no complete transparency. Temasek has only obligation to tell you your current standing. ROI is published yes, but not everytime they make a trade. That's just silly.<br><br>2) NULL<br><br>3a) The point stands. Even if you pay is not justified, there is no value in staying if there is no potential for increase. Ministers are paid highly here. That's how it works. We do not express shock that american presidents hold more power than our own. That's how THEY work. And you do elect your own leaders. Our prime minister wouldn't stay the prime minister for long if he loses in his own constituency. But he won. We DID elect him. Deal with it. If you hate this, help out in the opposition campaign next election. Did you work against the PAP last election season? If not, why are you complaining?<br><br>3b) 30% payraise. mmm. When was the last time ministers had a payraise? It's all relative. And people can get higher payraises in the private sector all the time. I've seen it happen.<br><br>4a) I remember a chinese proverb that translates roughly to this : to build something is easy, to maintain it is hard. Which is pretty true in today's turbulent times. Take the recent bloomberg article on Chile for example. The government is hoarding money, refusing to distribute wealth from the recent boom in copper exports, in the expectation that the boom will not last. That makes it an extremely unpopular administration. Sometimes doing the right things may seem wrong, and unpopular. But someone has to do it. Just because you don't see anything new doesn't mean no one's working. Thermodynamics baby, it's all about attrition. Someone has to constantly upgrade to maintain the status quo. Who's doing that work? Certainly not me.<br>I give credit where credit's due. If they weren't doing anything, the country would already by falling apart.<br><br>4b) Furthermore, look back in the times when the early leaders were implementing their plans for the future. Do you think putting so much money into infrastructure was at that time applauded by our fathers? At that time, do you really think people had the foresight that this investment would pay off? Much like the recent "foreign talent" debate, there would have been people raising doubts. Doomsday predictions would have been pretty common in the early days of independence. There IS progress. But progress is change. And people hate change. Hate blinds us. We never see the progress. Take a look around you. Think back to the days when you were a child. Maybe a decade ago. Has singapore REALLY stagnated?<br><br>To all the people who wish LKY die, I can only hope i hear your cries of regret when he really does. Because it will be a time of turmoil in Singapore. His sons may not be as great as he is, but thus far, I've yet to see better candidates.<br><br></div>

Then come back and tell me that you think singapore's public transport is subpar.<br><br>The reality is, despite the rising prices, or the heavier traffic, we have one of the best(i won't say best) transport systems around. And it's one of the cheapest to boot.<br><br>Seriously, try to get around in, say Melbourne. Cabs cost 3 times as much, buses and trams come infrequently and with less diverse routes. Oh and they cost alot more too.</div>

With regards to that, don't even get me started on the recent taxi fare debate!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I think that all public transport operations must, beyond accomplishing the simple task of getting pple from point A to point B, be financially viable, must be able to grow and change with the times and must be comfortable for commuters.<br><br>Financially viable: Lets take the extreme - Are we willing to contemplate a tax-payer's bailout of the local bus service if they do not make money? Taking into account opportunity costs, every dollar pumped there is less money for other things. Is that something tax-payers are willing to pay for?<br><br>Growth &amp; change + Comfort: It brings to mind my ride on a jeepney in Manila earlier this year... Sure, it gets you places and its dirt cheap, but the experience was so unpleasant that I did not repeat it for the entire duration of my trip... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The streets are a mess with numerous smog belching jeepneys plying different routes.<br><br>A profitable public transport company will be able to invest in newer vehicles that offers more creature comforts (tv mobile anyone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and emits less noxious fumes. And we have seen Delgro do all of the above.<br><br>It will also be able to invest in new amenities that makes the overall public transport experience more enjoyable. (i.e. air con bus interchange, more comfortable bus stops, display panels that shows bus arrival timings, etc.<br><br>A co-op can potentially fulfill these roles, but I would be less confident about its willingness to return savings to the public it serves  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I don't remember getting any substantial discounts from NTUC from my years of support... (tough luck for me... not a union member).<br><br>In fact, Cold Storage seems more generous and more professional to me (Choice Card! Yeah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and I do find their pricings competitive as well.<br><br>I digress with that of course... But seriously: a public transport provider does not just provide public transport. It needs to be a serious stake-holder in a country's urban planning and to do this, it needs to be a robust, well run and profit oriented enterprise.<br></div>
