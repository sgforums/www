Looks like its getting really serious....<br><br>... even with an interest rate cut to save the stock market (proxy for the economy), it plunges! The situation is so bad that people expects a big cut and a small cut is seen as too little too late!<br><br>2. If you try to save the stock market with a big interest rate cut, you might kill the US$...<br><br>... and so, they have no choice but to cut so little, so late...<br><br>This is supposed to be the Christmas holidays season but when it gets so serious, holidays season or no... when the market's got to plunge, it got to plunge!<br><br>I hope that you are prepared, after all this warning since July..... and have not been listening to the idiots telling you "odds ARE everything" and expecting others to tell you what to do.... other people in a forum, can only give you their "opinions, views and comments" and you have to make up your own mind... don't be a juvenile expecting people to spoon-feed you... make up your own mind....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">This is getting really serious too</span></strong><br><br>the Third World War would start when Russia suddenly attacks Europe in coalition with certain Middle Eastern countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Libya and probably China. Prior to the World War III, USA would be severely crippled by terrorist attacks, assassinations, a civil war and an economic collapse. Prior to that, there would be a civil war in Italy, during which the Vatican would be overrun by the mob. The Pope would escape but many of his cardinals would die. The palace and the chapels would be burnt down. While on the run, the Pope would be captured and killed. There would be a schism in the Vatican and three Popes would reign at the same time, propped up by competing powers. Supported by US and other catholic countries, the Papacy would be shifted elsewhere and a "true" Pope would be elected there. Europe would be almost overrun by the Russian and eastern forces and many of its cities and also those of USA would be destroyed by conventional weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction like nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Russia would attack from the North as well as from the East of Europe. An Arab / Iranian army would attack from the south. The Pope, and later the British Prime Minister would be forced to flee to the US. Paris would be destroyed by "revolutionaries" within France. The attack on the US would stop the Civil War there.  New types of weapons, like Chemical Weapons and particularly what appears to be portable Laser weapons, would be used in the war. At the same time an unprecedented disaster would take place. A comet would suddenly appear over the earth in the peak of the war, would break into several pieces and fall to the earth. Smaller pieces would rain fire on cities and forests all over the world, burning them down. A large piece would fall into the sea creating a Tsunami of Biblical proportions, flooding parts of Europe (including Britain), USA and Africa. One medium sized chunk would fall on land, creating a huge crater, resulting in earthquake and volcano activities all over the world. This event would loosen the grip of the invading army over Europe. A joint coalition of US and European forces under the leadership of a charismatic leader "Chiren" would organize a counter-attack against the invading forces in Europe and elsewhere. The Russian forces in Europe would be almost destroyed by the counter-attack and this would lead to a revolution in Russia and the Russian leader who started the war would be assassinated. Russia, under a new leader would then join the western coalition and fight against its former allies, who would eventually be defeated. The Pope would return to Europe and Chiren would be crowned the Monarch. Peace would return to the world after a loss of almost two-thirds of its population and the wealth of nations accumulated over millennia. But this would surely not be the end of the world.</div>

You don't get it, do you?<br><br>When it comes to investing in liquid assets like stocks, you should be following the market closely and flow with it. You can never fight the market.<br><br>If your long term view is down and the market is trending up, then you better abandon your views ASAP... making it ridiculous to have a "long term view".<br><br>If your view is up and there is an ongoing credit crunch in the USA, you better rethink and make the necessary adjustments to your portfolio...<br><br>... and there are many other considerations to take into account...</div>
