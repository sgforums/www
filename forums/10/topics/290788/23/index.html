I never intended to post, but I saw some people actually believing in his theories. Ok seriously, he was advocating 3 trades per decade. There was no way I was keeping mum after I saw ppl were taking him seriously.<br><br>Trading is my bread and butter, and everything Andrew has said to this point has been completely alien to me. He doesn't determine the odds before he trades. He trades only on insiders information. He makes 3 trades a year. He prides himself in knowing markets so well he can predict crashes, but does not even know the STI components are public knowledge.<br><br>He predicts crashes. They don't come. He claims to profit off crashes, but only after the fact. He blames temasek for "mistakes" that are really variance. He throws insults as a defensive mechanism and refuses to reveal details of his analysis.<br><br>Andrew claims to have been a training manager for a member company of SIMEX, but refuses to go into details. The head of cleaning services of that company could hold that same title btw. He writes a book against gambling in the casino, then reveals he knows next to nothing about what happens in a casino. He talks about the forex, but doesn't even know how it works.<br><br>He bashes forex traders, then turns around and boasts that he made many off the baht. He bashes TA, then draws out charts to prove temasek should have seen crashes coming. He gives vague statements, and refuse to elaborate when questioned.<br><br>Andrew claims to have written a book. But it is not published. Andrew uses his credentials as an "author" as an argument itself. Andrew claims to have been part of the process of commodities trading, but he's now a IT consultant. That is a really strange career move by the way, and he has never answered my very first question to him. Did you blow up, Andrew?<br><br></div>

It's not considered documented if you document it AFTER the fact.<br><br>It's like me claiming now that I shorted just before 9/11 and consider this as documentation. It doesn't work.<br><br>You may point out that you DID predict the baht would appreciate against the SGD at some point. But then again, you also predicted many things that never happened. If we were to assume that you did indeed act on all your predictions, you would still not be considered a good investor.<br><br>I'm a student of mathematics. I believe in variance, not luck. And your correct predictions against the incorrect ones are pretty much in line with the predicted results of random guessing. Especially when you cannot give reasons to justify the predictions(or at least reasonable reasons).<br><br>Seriously. You can take a bus to Thailand? What kind of justification is that?</div>
