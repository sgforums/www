Back when Singapore was struggling, you weren't the one sweating it out trying to get it on it's feet. You weren't there when the tough decisions had to be made. Who are you, really to judge?<br><br>Every government makes good decisions and bad decisions. Ours has served us well so far. Do you REALLY have anything of substance to complain of? Please, stop talking about temasek. That money doesn't belong to you/us. Don't try to incite riots out of misinformation. You're concerned you don't have enough money to spend? Maybe that's because you need to start taking out that money out of the tin can underneath your bed. Or better yet, get a job.</div>

You need to look at it objectively. The money is NOT yours. You'll never get it back. EVER. People put themselves in debt. Governments don't do that.<br><br>And if you're going to tell me that the system put in place to provide HDBs to people in exchange for a low interest rate loan is better than the alternative, massive homeless population, i am going to go down there right now to slap you silly.<br><br>You sitting in the comfort of your home can complain about it. How many people would be homeless if not for the HDB scheme? Do you know of poverty? Of people who would otherwise be definitely homeless?<br><br>It's not hard to see that people put themselves in debt. In fact, the government is pretty obviously trying to re-organise the system to increase variable tax over a blanket one.<br><br>COE : the really poor don't have to worry about this one.<br>ERP : ditto<br>income tax : poor, low tax, hello?<br>GST : hits the poor more than the rich, but that's a standard tax applied all over the world.
