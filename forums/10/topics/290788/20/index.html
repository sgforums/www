So you are placing the mouse over the text, and clicking on the text.<br><br>And mouse cursors do not "embed" themselves into pixels. Mouse cursors on computer screens ARE made up of pixels.<br><br>As the mouse cursor moves across the screen, the pixels change colors to illustrate this movement. So by moving the mouse to a position where your line is, the pixels around the line changes into color of your mouse cursor. So your mouse cursor is, in effect, "covering the line", or as you say has become "part of the line".<br><br>So the mouse cursor is on top of the line, not inside it.<br><br>Any "embeding" you suggest is purely imaginary.
