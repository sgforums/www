It is just transferring worthless papers from one hand to another... from banks that made poor decisions to banks that did not make those poor decisions.<br>2. Think Singapore government's bailout of UBS... the banks in Japan reportedly are not so keen to participate (or are willing only to participate much less than asked) and many banks are not so keen to participate because they might be sued by their share-holders and you know the Japanese, they are honorable people and are willing to commit suicide to atone for their mistakes... and they will rather be careful than to recklessly bailout foreigners... the Singapore government simply ask Singaporeans to cough up when they make mistakes... (think 2%GST rise to "help the poor")... behaving most dishonorably.<br>3. Overall, it would still result in a credit crunch because, the money is lost and the best that they can do is to buy time... hoping to earn back the money they have lost.</div>
