Just don't confuse support with blind following.<br><br>Also, I'm wrote that last post in a relatively calm manner in the hopes of getting you guys to understand how it works.<br><br>To Andrew :<br><br>This is a bigger thing than our squabble. You need to look at it objectively. The money is NOT yours. You'll never get it back. EVER. People put themselves in debt. Governments don't do that.<br><br>And if you're going to tell me that the system put in place to provide HDBs to people in exchange for a low interest rate loan is better than the alternative, massive homeless population, i am going to go down there right now to slap you silly.<br><br>You sitting in the comfort of your home can complain about it. How many people would be homeless if not for the HDB scheme? Do you know of poverty? Of people who would otherwise be definitely homeless?<br><br>It's not hard to see that people put themselves in debt. In fact, the government is pretty obviously trying to re-organise the system to increase variable tax over a blanket one.<br><br>COE : the really poor don't have to worry about this one.<br>ERP : ditto<br>income tax : poor, low tax, hello?<br>GST : hits the poor more than the rich, but that's a standard tax applied all over the world. The time to complain about it was a decade ago, not now.<br><br></div></blockquote>I do not support Dr Chee, but I am also against the CURRENT PAP politicians<br><br>What you are talking about (the HDB scheme) is an achievement of the past. Taking out old achievements to brag repeatedly doesn't conceal the fact that this PAP batch isn't achieving what they are being paid for (and they are paid many times more than the old leaders that came up with good schemes for Singapore)<br><br>COE, ERP, etc, do not help the citizens, and only generate more problems to the citizens. Those are not achievements to me.<br><br>The refusal to implement a staggered GST (0% tax for necessities) due to the excuse of the system being too complex, is unacceptable to me. Try telling that to your boss next time when he asks you to complete a task. You probably will end up with a bad performance grading. You are PAID to come up with solutions, not coming up with excuses.<br><br>Lately, you heard about all the talk about rising costs of living. They said they help in a different way. They do not believe in controlling prices of necessities, but will instead dole out cash subsidies from time to time to help the people.<br><br>The fact is, The former solution results probably in increased RECURRENT costs for the Govt, whereas the latter solution goes in line with their "Low Pay, High bonus" policy for the people, where the subsidy (bonus) is never guaranteed, therefore they can always kill off the subsidy (bonus) whenever they want.<br><br>And the way they work reminds me of petrol companies. Increase price, give discounts, but the price increase remains a fact.<br><br>I am neutral to Andrew, coz he is too extreme. Nevertheless, I am waiting for him to answer Gazelle's questions. Its interesting to see how a person who writes a book will answer or avoid Gazelle, since his questions make sense.</div>

What they do with the money has nothing to do with you, as long as they fulfill their commitment to provide you with the service.<br><br>Same thing goes for the government's finances. As long as you have no real thing to complain about the country, it's doing it's job. Are many Singaporeans homeless? Are the roads and streets clean/kept in usable condition? Are your children getting an education? The government has fulfilled it's commitment to the public. How the money is used is not your problem, unless they start failing to hold their end of the promise.<br><br>So what are your complaints about the investments temasek made that are losing money? Is it that you're losing money too? That's not true. It does not affect you at all, unless you find the government cutting corners, like closing down schools, or cleaning the streets twice a year.<br><br>I know the taxes have been increased lately. That has nothing to do with the government losing money in investments. So please, don't even think of drawing a correlation between the two.<br></div></blockquote>No objections with your explanation... Its quite factual that government monies are consolidated for re-distribution in accordance with the annual budget, with proper revenue forecasts and estimates of budget surpluses or deficits properly announced.<br><br>Budget speeches are, undoubtedly, one of the most important, albeit boring, sessions of parliamentary sessions.<br><br>However, although it is fair and factually correct to say that the government's duty is to properly disburse public monies, it is not exactly good PR to suggest that the public has no right to question how a govt spends public money.<br><br>Certain aspects of public spending is indeed questionable and wasteful. One needs only to read the Auditor-General's reports to know some of the more notable instances of waste and irregularities.<br><br>My point is that it is perfectly legitimate for a citizen to raise questions about the government's expenditures.<br><br>It is not the point that we should not complain just because the roads are working and the streets are clean. These things could perhaps be done at a disproportionate financial cost that may reflect poor tender practices, poor choice of service providers, misdirected resources, etc etc etc.<br><br>What's wrong with being more accountable to the public and whats wrong with the public wanting to know more?</div>

As you have seen, there are other countries that implemented staggered GST, and they have been successful. As such, if our leaders are paid 3 to 4x more than other leaders, then they should be expected to think of this 'chimera' and turn it into a 'mouse'. Impossible? Can't be, since our leaders are paid more to think, and other countries have implemented this successfully.<br><br>Besides, their target of 10% GST is really a tad unreasonable to be implemented across the board. The impact to the poor will be really huge.<br><br>Either way, if there is a willingness to implement a staggered GST, there are ways to circumvent those excuses they came up with to convince us that staggered system is impossible. For eg, use the simplest solution by just categorizing all rice types to 0% GST, regardless. After all, you gain much more from other types of goods, so what's the problem about letting some types of rice that are more 'luxurious' get thru the loophole?<br><br>Hawkers have been utilizing the loophole in our income taxes for years and years. So what's the complaint about certain goods getting thru the loophole?<br><br>Anyway, the importation idea you have is worth considering.</div>
