            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Make no mistake: The central bankers' announcement Wednesday of a new coordinated effort to pump cash into the global financial system is a sign of their nervousness. The global credit squeeze that began last summer still hasn't run its course, and the central bankers fear that the stressed financial system could pull the world economy into a deep recession.</blockquote> from Washington Post... <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/14/AR2007121401522.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/14/AR2007121401522.html</a><br><br>More...<br><blockquote>What does this market feel like for players at ground zero? I asked the head of one of the leading hedge funds how he had traded his portfolio Wednesday, the day the joint rescue package was announced. He answered that he had stayed out of the market because he wasn't sure what to do. Trades that looked sensible at 10 a.m. would have turned out to be mistakes by noon.<br><br>"If someone would take me out of all my positions, long and short, I'd do it," he said. This is the financial market equivalent of saying you want to start over. Six months into the credit crunch, that's the way many exhausted players are feeling. The markets will have to sink a good deal more, alas, before the vultures arrive to carry off the debris and the process of rebuilding can start. </blockquote></div>
