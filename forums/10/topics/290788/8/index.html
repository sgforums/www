            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting extracts of comments from my blog:<br><br><blockquote>giant pyramid global economy wrote:<br><br>after reading the various articles, one can only come to the conclusion that the world economy including Singapore is just one giant pyramid scheme. Singapore is just part of it. Given today's mortgage induced credit contraction problems in US and Europe, Singapore high real estate prices can only be viewed as a negative divergence from the rest of the world and not as a beacon of protected prosperity in a world plague by credit crunch and tumbling real estate prices.<br><br>So what comes next? Sooner or later the game will stop; no sportmen can keep running without stopping for rest breaks.<br>Posted on 11/22/07 at 10:03:00 </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew, I wonder if you have intentionally show us the STI index movement for 3 months instead of 5 days. Reason I am asking is because on 16Nov 2007, you have predicted that we will see the mother of all black mondays on Monday. 19th Nov 2007. But in actually fact the market didnt crash by 25%, it actually gone up. Which also mean that you have misread the market by over 25%.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/w?s=%5ESTI"><br><br></div>
