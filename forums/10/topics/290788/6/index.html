To benefit the few even when it is at the expense of vast majority... which family and their immediate relatives, I ask you, own lots of  property in Orchard Road?<br><br>Why they do that? So that Temasek has funds so they can appoint their family member to run it... and end up losing Singaporeans money to foreigners...<br><br>The rest you are familiar with... GST increases, ERP increases, Transport costs increase....<br><br>... all these help put Singaporeans into more debt... their favorite policy...<br><br><strong>PxP is More debt for Singaporeans...<br><br>...worse than Pay and Pay they are Debt and Debt</strong><br><br>Why did they get away with doing this kind of traitorous acts on Singaporeans? Like the Pedra Blanca case... even when they started what led  to this current mess and might lead to Singapore losing the island... (they built military installations and refusing to budge when Malaysia complained, <strong>as shown by court evidence) </strong><br><br>...their supporters continue to support their arrogant act of putting military installations... instead of supporting the nation and the country...<br><br>...when you support despotic dictators instead of the country, you are a traitor of your motherland....<br><br>So how? People warn and warn them, people beg and beg them but they just remain arrogant despotic dictators...<br><br>So how? Without a free press to expose their dirty deeds to the wider population, they get to sell their propaganda to the masses and the masses are fooled into believing that it is the USA, globalisation and what-nots and it is not their fault....<br><br>You might or might not like Dr Chee Soon Juan but he is the only brilliant one to have realized a long time ago that playing nice with despotic dictators will not change them and supporting their despotic acts will destroy the country...<br><br>... stop being traitors to you own motherland and while there is nothing much you can do as an individual, support Dr Chee in demanding accountability and transparency... before they destroy us all...<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/donations.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/donations.html</a></div>

This leads to a disappearance of wealth and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country (depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime).<br><br>This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss of faith in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods.<br><br>In 1995, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that capital flight amounted to roughly half of the outstanding foreign debt of the most heavily indebted countries of the world.<br><br>Capital flight was seen in some Asian and Latin American markets in the 1990s. The Argentine economic crisis of 2001 was in part the result of massive capital flight, induced by fears that Argentina would default on its external debt (the situation was made worse by the fact that Argentina has an artificially low fixed exchange rate and was dependent on large levels of reserve currency). This was also seen in Venezuela in the early 1980s with one year's total export income leaving through illegal capital flight.<br><br>Capital flight is also sometimes used to refer to the removal of wealth and assets from a city or region within a country. Post-apartheid South African cities are probably the most visible example of this phenomenon. Johannesburg in particular has been abandoned by business moving to northern suburbs. The flight of capital from central cities to the suburbs that ring them was also common throughout the second half of the twentieth century in the United States.<br><br>In the last quarter of 20th century capital flight was observed from countries that offer low or negative real interest rate (like Russia and Argentina) to countries that offer higher real interest rate (like China).<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight</a><br><br>I am sure you don't need me to spoonfeed you on the effects of capital flight.</div>
