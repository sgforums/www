            <div class='col-md body'>So where are we now?<br><br>In 2006 there were hints of an impending housing related crisis in the US. In July 2007 the crisis become full-blown.<br><br>You can think of it as, in 2006, the US housing market was hit with HIV and full-blown AIDS developed in July 2007.<br><br>The next alarming development was the spread of the disease across the Atlantic to none other than HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, among others, like Temasek's purchase, Barclays Bank.<br><br>How Temasek can buy Barclays Bank in July at a time when the equivalent of full-blown AIDS hit the banks, is a mystery. Didn't Temasek, with such a big portfolio of banks, know that the banks were infected with the equivalent of HIV in 2006 and developed AIDS in July, the same month they added positions to their Barclays Bank stock holdings?<br><br>When the problem became full-blown, the first knee jerk reactions of the central banks were to cut interest rates. Well, that, as we all know failed. The markets were in turmoil.<br><br>They could not cut interest rates more to calm the markets because cutting interest rates created other problems, like inflation and problems with the value of the US Dollars, which in turn led to even more problems.<br><br>Therefore they decided to do a concerted central bank intervention and loan unlimited amounts of money to banks at lower interest rates. The banks had a massive liquidity problem caused by the write-downs due to their sub-prime related losses.<br><br>They were also wary of lending to each other just in case the money they lent, yes money they lent to other banks, become bad debts.<br><br>If the problem is contained within the financial markets, the problem could be, well, contained.<br><br>If the disease spreads to the US economy, we could see massive infection rates across many countries before it gets better.<br><br>Last Friday, the US Department of Labor reported very poor unemployment figures and warning bells started toll.<br><br>London was doing pretty well that Friday, smug in the idea that the problem could all go away with the concerted central bank intervention.<br><br>When the report came out, the reaction was swift and furious. It was a straight line down.<br><br>The US market opened, promptly headed south in a straight line and meandered the rest of the night down.<br><br>Last night was quiet. After a big drop you would expect a rebound. A quiet session after a sharp drop is ominous.<br><br>Eager money that believes a sharp drop represents buying opportunities, is buying and smart money is quietly selling to them, and no rebound materializes.<br><br>In Singapore, the same. After the big drop on Monday, it is quiet today when it should be rebounding.<br><br>Big drop, consolidation, big drop, consolidation, is the nightmare scenario to watch out for. It always end with an almighty crash. The more it drops, consolidates, drops, consolidates, the bigger the crash.<br><br>Unless of course, it drops, consolidates... consolidates... consolidates... to the point that no one is really interested in the market... that would signal a time to consider getting back into the market...<br><br>... to be continued....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>What are we looking out for next?<br><br>1. Further evidence of a deterioration or improvement in the US economy<br>2. Possible US interest rate cut<br>3. A big rate cut would send a really strong signal that all is not well with the US economy.<br>4. It takes time for the effects of a rate cut to flow through.<br>5. Meanwhile there might be turmoil in the currency markets.<br>6. If the currency markets sell off US dollars, we might see crude hitting past US$100 per barrel.<br>7. Further evidence of a deterioration of the housing market and further escalation of the sub-prime crisis. (The way the sub-prime crisis unfolds, it can get worse in the next six months before it gets better.)<br><br>In Singapore, the last quarter figures came in below expectations.<br>QUOTE<br>Singapore's GDP contracts 3.2 percent in fourth quarter on weak manufacturing<br>The Associated Press<br>Published: January 2, 2008<br><br>SINGAPORE: Singapore's economy contracted the first time in more than four years in the fourth quarter as weakness in manufacturing outweighed windfall growth from a construction boom, the government said Wednesday.<br><br>Singapore's economy shrank 3.2 percent from the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry's advance estimate showed. It expanded 4.4 percent in the July-September quarter compared to the second.<br>UNQUOTE<br><br>With inflation surging and GDP falling, it does not at all paint a rosy picture. Â“Construction output rose 24.4 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, accelerating from 19.2 percent growth in the third quarter.Â”<br><br>This could be due to the effects of the IR construction, the MRT and the on-block sales activities. With the IR and the MRT circle line construction coming to an end, what next? The integrated resorts open in 2009 and so what? The gains made by the casino will be losses by the locals (but losses by foreigners living outside of Singapore will have a net benefit).<br><br>The property market is cooling as it should but with many suffering; those that bought recently and heavily in debt.<br><br>If MAS let the Singapore dollars rise, then exports will be affected. My guess is that they will let Singapore dollar appreciates against the US Dollars, but let it fall against the rest.<br><br>There is not much to look forward to, is there? There is not much to look forward to in the equities market. With a downtrend in equities, can the property prices hold? Stay out of equities for the time being until the picture turns better.<br></div>
