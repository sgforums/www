              <p>Following is the extract from page 150 of Ross Worthington’s book, “<strong>Governance in Singapore</strong>”(Publisher: Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc, Dec 2002):</p>
              <p>In 1990, an incident occurred in a pre-cabinet meeting which was the 
              beginning of entrenching further among the many in the core executive, 
              resistance to Lee Hsien Loong’s long term ambitions for prime 
              ministership. Prior to this meeting Lee Hsien Loong had gone to the 
              office of Richard Hu, the Minister of Finance, and removed a number of 
              files without Hu’s permission. At that time Lee’s office was on the 48th
               floor of what is now Temasek Tower and Hu’s was on the 50th floor.</p>
              <p>At the pre-cabinet meeting Hu took Lee to task for doing this and was
               supported by Tony Tan. Lee’s response was aggressive and insulting, he 
              directly insulted Tan and Hu, a man of his father’s age. This was a 
              double insult to Hu, who was Lee’s superior in cabinet and a person of 
              an age who should of itself deserve respect in Chinese society. Suppiah 
              Dhanabalan intervened and chastised Lee for his behaviour, demanding 
              that he apologise to Hu, withdraw his remarks and not interfere in other
               minister’s portfolios. A heated exchange occurred into which a number 
              of other issues intruded and eventually Lee lost his temper, and 
              reportedly reached across the table and slapped Dhanabalan across the 
              face.</p>
              <p>This caused an uproar in the cabinet and Lee was severely chastised 
              by Goh Chok Tong. Dhanabalan stormed out of the room and did not return 
              for some time. Lee, in response to a demand from Goh, subsequently 
              apologised to Dhanabalan, Hu and Tan. Hu, Dhanabalan and Tan all 
              initially stated that they would leave the cabinet as a result of this 
              incident. Goh later took up the matter with Lee Kuan Yew who reportedly 
              verbally thrashed his son over the matter.</p>
              <p>This was apparently followed by a more sober, educational but equally
               critical assessment from Lee Hsien Loong’s mother, a talented though 
              background political adviser. Lee Kuan Yew reportedly met later that day
               with Hu, Tan and Dhanabalan, apologised for his son’s behaviour and 
              requested that they not resign, supported by a similar request from Goh 
              Chok Tong.</p>
              <p>All held out for some time, eventually Hu agreed to stay, but 
              Dhanabalan and Tan both resolved to leave. This they did the following 
              August 1991 elections, all without a public word against Lee Hsien 
              Loong, continuing to subscribe to the tenet of all secrets staying 
              within the PAP family.</p>

              <p>With little effort :) Extracted from TR. As the saying goes: "There's no smoke without fire." Even GCT had to come out and clarify in a national rally.</p>
              <p>I've always noticed a streak of bad temper about the PM. On the surface, he looks all smiley and approachable but deep beneath is a control freak.</p>
              <p>If any of you had tuned in to the moment back in April 2006, when the results of AMK GRC were announced, he had only garnered 66% of the votes. Lim Boon Heng forecasted something like 80%. His face turned really black and sombre, reporters tried to ask him questions but he ordered them to wait. Funny...this must be the only country in the world where reporters listen to the PM....well, he's their boss right lol.</p>

              <p>With little effort :) Extracted from TR. As the saying goes: "There's no smoke without fire." Even GCT had to come out and clarify in a national rally.</p>
              <p>I've always noticed a streak of bad temper about the PM. On the surface, he looks all smiley and approachable but deep beneath is a control freak.</p>
              <p>If any of you had tuned in to the moment back in April 2006, when the results of AMK GRC were announced, he had only garnered 66% of the votes. Lim Boon Heng forecasted something like 80%. His face turned really black and sombre, reporters tried to ask him questions but he ordered them to wait. Funny...this must be the only country in the world where reporters listen to the PM....well, he's their boss right lol.</p>
