"But speak in full sentences, with proper sentence structure."<br><br>According to published reports, LoongÂ’s administration started their campaign against the Â“SinglishÂ” dialect in 2000.

"But speak in full sentences, with proper sentence structure and cutting out all the 'lahs' and 'lors' at the end of each sentence."<br><br>Lee was referring to two words commonly added to the end of sentences in "Singlish" - a mishmash of English and local dialects.<br><br>"Can or not? I think can," he said, using another commonly used phrase in Singlish.<br><br>The city-state is well known for its numerous social engineering campaigns, most of which are government-backed. Singapore in the past has urged its citizens to wave at fellow motorists, flush public toilets, be more romantic and arrive at wedding receptions on time.<br><br>Lee urged teachers to use "pop songs, hip-hop and rap as mediums for teaching good English."<br><br>"If our English becomes too mutated, then we become unintelligible to others," he said. "If we speak in a dialect which only some Singaporeans can understand, then we are handicapping ourselves and cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world."<br><br>The administration began waging war on Singlish in 2000 and attacked the country's most popular TV character, Phua Chu Kang, blaming his use of Singlish for a rise in bad grammar among citizens.<br><br>Critics have denounced the numerous behavioural campaigns as Orwellian and condescending.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sometimes wonder if LHL even knows the ghetto origins of rap and hip hop.<br><br>The govt seems to be still caught in the SPG mindset that anything western must be good (except for freedom of speech and democracy of course).  Singlish, or what the stuff profs at the English Lang Dept at NUS call SCE(Singapore Colloquial English), borrows heavily from dialects and words from our respective languages (English, Malay, Mandarin, Hokkien, etc).It is part of the glue holding together the social fabric in Singapore. Singlish is part of our culture and national identity contributing to racial harmony (its very refreshing to see chinese using malay words and malays using hokkien etc). It helps people from the different races in Singapore bond, and this is the most apparent(for me at least) during national service, where we mix with people from different ethnic groups and backgrounds. Are our MIW ashamed of their own local culture?  With all the emphasis on racial harmony day and racial harmony activities in schools today, why is LHL bent on destroying the one thing in common we have, besides citizenship?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Singlish, or what the stuff profs at the English Lang Dept at NUS call SCE(Singapore Colloquial English), borrows heavily from dialects and words from our respective languages (English, Malay, Mandarin, Hokkien, etc).It is part of the glue holding together the social fabric in Singapore. Singlish is part of our culture and national identity contributing to racial harmony (its very refreshing to see chinese using malay words and malays using hokkien etc). It helps people from the different races in Singapore bond, and this is the most apparent(for me at least) during national service, where we mix with people from different ethnic groups and backgrounds. Are our MIW ashamed of their own local culture?  With all the emphasis on racial harmony day and racial harmony activities in schools today, why is LHL bent on destroying the one thing in common we have, besides citizenship?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>Kong gai sui ah.<br><br>WTF, singlish is one of the genuine product of the SGP mixing pot.

I am sure many people know the value of speaking and writing well without all the hypes and social engineering.<br><br>However, to spend the national time to promote language accents as spoken by the Englishmen or Americans or Chinese is like "much ado about nothing" . This is typical of the nanny state the government has been promoting all these time.<br><br>It will only be found that at the end of the day it is not campaign that will help citizens to speak or write better or to build a more vibrant society of the east. The correct approach lies in the willingness of government in promoting greater tolerances of various social and cultural values that belong to the people of various origins and ethnic backgrounds and adoption of proper values from young consistently promoted in schools all the ways up.<br><br>By governing the whole nation based on overwhelming pragmatism as is apparently being practised by our money-minded government, we tend to neglect considerations of needs and expectations and value systems setting itself backwards our language, cultural and social developments or the softwares of the people.<br><br>It is too obvious that the larger aspects of nation building in the context of social and cultural areas as expressed in the casino debates have been expectedly set aside leaving people largely dissatisfied and disappointed.<br><br>It is very clear that as long as government is able to achieve its targeted surpluses and comfortable lives for only the elites and the rich many of the problems concerning social and language aspects are secondary.<br><br>Under such conditions, I do not see the value in campaigns to promote any one's languages or social behaviours as government has not committed itself to upholding or promotion of root social and cultural values for all.<br><br>At best all kinds of engineering engineering, press control and brainwashing will have to be resorted to for justifications to serve narrow-minded pragmatic ends.<br><br>The more government treats everyone like kids and try to promote particular social language and ethical values through campaigns the more it will be running into contradictions with its real behaviours at works. To promote true social and correct personal behaviours and value systems, let it be done naturally through care and consistent practices at all levels of nationhood and not through artificial means.<br><br>Many problems including the teaching of values, religious and racial tolerances and respects for elderly and fellow human beings or Singaporeans should be spontaneously inculcated by setting good corporate governance standards and not artificially interceded by government campaigns.<br><br>Such aspects of national wellbeing is part of good corporate governance and the latter is only wish-washy what good is there of more artificial campaigns.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
