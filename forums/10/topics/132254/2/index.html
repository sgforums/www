"But speak in full sentences, with proper sentence structure."<br><br>According to published reports, LoongÂ’s administration started their campaign against the Â“SinglishÂ” dialect in 2000. The government blamed a popular TV character named Phua Chu Kang for the rise in bad grammar among the population.<br><br>Loong has been criticized in the past for various social engineering campaigns aimed at the Singaporean population.<br></strong><br></blockquote>-----------<br><br>He actually has a point re Singaporean's tendency to get lazy and mix languages. I've had foreign friends who speak both English and Chinese and many times, they have difficulties following when I converse with a fellow Singaporeans. I also think Singaporeans have a tendency to speak too quickly such that it becomes unintelligible to foreigners.<br><br>However, i have also noticed that people adapt mighty quickly; Singaporeans overseas will usually learn to speak more clearly and slowly. It works so i dun see why we need another campaign. After all, even the Americans and the English speak in different accents! Find something better to tinker with LHL!<br><br>Also, the new generation generally speaks with proper sentence structure anyway.<br></div>
