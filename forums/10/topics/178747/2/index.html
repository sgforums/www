That is why the stock market is down cos businesses don't benefit much.<br>See today's papers. They upgraded Dunman Hawker ctr. but then increase rent by 20% to 30%. In the end, we have to pay higher food prices cos the hawkers will sure to increase.<br><br>What's the point of giving measly $200 - $800 when they spend millions on upgrading. The people wants money in the pocket &amp; more subsidies for healthcare &amp; edn. The $200 I get won't even be enough to pay my utility bill!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heard this story from a Business Consultant...<br><br>HK millionaire Li Ka Shing (not sg forum Li Ka Shing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) dropped a HK$1 coin when he was board his car. The coin rolled and dropped into the drain. Mr Li came out from his car, squat down and tried to retrieve the HK$1. When his boidyguard saw him, he immediately offer to help to recover the money. When the bodyguard finally recoverd the money, he handed it over to Mr Li. Mr Li took his wallet out and pull out a HK$20 and offered it to his bodyguard. His bodyguard asked him if that HK$1 coin was of sedimental value and he told him that it was just another ordinary HK$1 coin.<br><br>Then the guard was puzzled and asked him why he would offer him a HK$20 for a HK$1. Wouldn't he be making a loss for a shrewed businessman? Mr Li replied that the HK$20 will eventually returned to his pocket but the HK$1 will be forever lost in the drain if nobody recover it.<br><br>Similarly all $$$ offered will be recovered by the gahmen in term of taxes etc etc etc.....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by TooFree:<br><span style="color: violet;">There is also a new Work Support programme to provide for higher childcare and student care subsidies.<br><br>To continue the government's emphasis on investing in the next generation, there is a new Opportunity Fund for all schools, with neighbourhood schools getting double the grant per student than the independent and autonomous schools.<br><br>It will work out to about $118,000 for a typical neighbourhood primary school and $150,000 for a typical secondary school.</span><br></blockquote>So does this so called Opportunity Fund apply to JCs as well? My school seems to be hurting for more funds all the time, even the PC are like 1000 year old antiques that are either too slow or spoiled, lol.<br><br>And, in my opinion, this progress package is simply trying to "buy" the votes of Singaporeans. The money given is almost insignificant to most individuals, yet it will cost the government up to billions. Honestly, increased subsidies on bus/train fares would have more impact than this "kind act of generosity" in the long term.</div>
