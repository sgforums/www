              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>U might not be Singaporean or u r too young to encounter President Wee n Ong.</p>
              <p>President Wee is a very compassionate n caring president who has been actively doing community work even after his term.</p>
              <p>President Ong is one whom we known as People's President. He is one who question &amp; ask till PAP fed up.</p>
              <p><strong>On 28 August 1993, close to 60% of voters chose Mr Ong as the country's first Elected President. In his pre-election speech, he said, " Some people still ask whether my long previous association with the PAP will stop me from acting independently. The answer is no. My loyalty is first and foremost, to the people of Singapore. It has always been so, and will always remain so". Mr Ong indeed fulfilled this electoral promise of being pro-Singapore as can be seen in these examples:<br><br>a) In 1994, Mr Ong, as President, had disagreed with the Government's interpretation of the Constitution, regarding the powers of the Presidential Office. Mr Ong referred the issue to a special High Court tribunal, which was chaired by the Chief Justice. When the final decision was ruled in favour of the government, Mr Ong graciously accepted it.<br><br>b) On 16 July 1999, at a press conference to indicate that he would not be contesting a second term, President Ong mentioned some problems he had faced during his term as President. His points drew a swift response from the government but it was evident that President had been accountable to Singaporeans while performing his duties as President.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As the President, Mr Ong was also concerned with the less fortunate in society as well as the promotion of arts and culture. He initiated several events such as the President's Star Charity and the President's Charity Art Exhibition and Concert.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Among the five former presidents who have died, Ong is the first president who did not receive a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral">state funeral</a>. He received a state-assisted funeral instead.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>Well said, but when did I ever mention of joining politics?</p>
              <p>Any politics in any job nature will require oneself to be cunning &amp; at times dirty which includes working in your pub as well.</p>

              <p>He was CEO for 30 years, NTUC Income wasn't worth $17 billion since day 1.</p>
              <p>The thing is insurance industry is a poor cousin to other finance lines. Agents earn on commission year on year, sure alot of them earn more than salaried execs in insurance.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, profit margin for NTUC's business (selling house, travel, motor, accident insurance) is low compared to commercial insurance. How much does one customer spend, and how much does the agent take compared to the company?</p>
              <p>Whether or not he will be President, I am saying his CEO's pay was a laughing stock among insurance ppl.</p>
