              <p>Reposted from <a title="Redwire Times Singapore" href="http://redwiretimes.com/cow-beh-cow-bu/xenophobia-its-the-fault-of-faulty-government-policies/">Redwire Times Singapore</a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s face it, for some time already 
              there’s been a rising wave of xenophobia creeping into Singaporean 
              society. The fury sparked by the Filipino National Day celebrations 
              outside Ngee Ann City just happens to be the latest in a series of 
              unfortunate incidents, all of which have painted a very negative picture
               of Singaporeans on the international stage.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look at the most notable ones in recent times to start:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) the HDB curry incident, in which 
              many Singaporeans called for the eviction of the China nationals 
              involved for raising their concerns about the smell of curry.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) the Anton Casey incident, where many Singaporeans called for “Bo Gar See” to be sacked and exiled.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) and the unwitting Filipinos, whom 
              many Singaporeans stormed internet in protest against their celebration 
              of their faraway homeland. Some even called for them to be deported.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The common thread linking these 
              incidents? The urge to remove foreigners from our soil, based on a 
              spark, hardly even a flame. Now, what exactly is prompting this? Perhaps
               these three factors, all of which are born and bred by the ruling 
              party.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">SCARCITY -</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Cost of living is rising, and many 
              Singaporeans find it difficult to keep up. Already, locals are 
              tightening their belts, to the point where they don’t to have children 
              (probably one of the greatest joys in life). This scarcity breeds 
              selfishness, even against fellow Singaporeans, much less foreigners. The
               government has caused this scarcity through unsound policies, which 
              have brought on inflated housing prices, inflated car prices, inflated 
              medical fees, and much more (certainly not an inflated argument -Ed). 
              The worst part? The government doesn’t know how to fix these problems!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">SEGREGATION -</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Elitism. Pure and simple. From young, 
              the Singapore government carves our local population through the 
              education system, under the guise of meritocracy. Our status in life 
              appears to be sealed right from that time, and we build our own 
              in-groups and networks based on that status. These groups tend to be 
              sealed off from the rest, what more foreigners from whom we are 
              distanced.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">SOLIDARITY -</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Not in a group, but true solidarity – 
              isolation. Singaporeans don’t have a support network to fall back on 
              should we fall on hard times. The bureaucratic process prevents many 
              from seeking welfare grants (which leads the government to further 
              believe that these grants aren’t important). The lack of pensions for 
              the elderly means many continue to work at a time when they should be 
              enjoying the fruits of their labour. This absence of compassion for 
              Singaporeans is precisely what promotes anxiety, anger and inevitably a 
              “me against the world” mindset.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The Singapore government has bred this 
              rising discontent amongst Singaporeans through its half-baked policies 
              over the years. And it is only making life worse with each step forward.
               Singaporeans must shoulder part of the blame for their actions. Or 
              rather inaction in ensuring a sound government is in power to lead. The 
              body follows the head.</p>
