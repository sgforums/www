            <div class='col-md body'>Why, I thought the answer is obvious.<br><br>If the costs of running traffic control and the car parking services, collections of certain types of payments and taxes as performed by outside companies are lower, such services should be outsourced to help Singaporeans in lowering costs. (or build up their medical or retirement funds)<br><br>The only services that should be retained by government should be in areas like national security, defence, judiciary and enforcements of sensitive laws and regulations.<br><br>Singaporeans will save billions if these various non-critical services are outsourced. Outsourced companies will help to render greater accountability and transparency not available at this moment.<br><br>It is already well proven Traffic Police only performs mostly routine and standardized services so they are very easy to outsource. Many traffic policemen are over-authoritative and give a poor image to citizens.<br><br>Cost savings are already proven when services previously performed by government or government-linked companies such as Singtel, Car Park, SIA and related Airport services are outsourced.<br><br>At this moment, all government and government-related services are at least 50 - 300 % higher than outside. There is a lack of accountability and transparency as well.<br><br>Had these non-critical services been privatized or corporatized, many services will continue to be very expensive.<br><br>What the Singtel, HDB, PSA and SIA have done are only the tips of the icebergs. Nearly all the PA, EDB, TDB, TC, and statutory board services can be outsourced to private companies to lower the costs of living and doing business in Singapore which are extremely by comparison with those performed by the private sector.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you what true outsourcing means. It means a company is willing to perform a certain function of their customer company for a fee. Normally a price divided by number of years to perform the service is agreed upon after negotiation between outsourcing company and the client.<br><br>Once the contract is inked, the outsourcing company will buy up a large portion of the customers assets in which the service is being outsourced and lease it back to the customer and charge a yearly fee including the profit percentage.<br><br>When this is in process the outsourcing company will do a "wall to wall" inventory for all the assets being taken over which may include entire buildings, vehicles etc ... and "in-scope" a number of the customers original employees who have been doing this function for years and years.<br><br>And these employees will now belong to the outsourcing company, they may have a contract with the new company stating that original benefits and whatnot be unchanged for 2 years normally.<br><br>Outsourcing companies earn roughly 15-25% for each deal, but they make even more after the 2nd or 3rd year as "cost goes down", depending on situations earlier in-scoped employees are highly likely to "participate" in other deals, aka "leveraging", it also means that 1 person starts doing 3-4 accounts in-order to justify his cost to the outsourcing company.<br><br>For this topic I have 2 questions<br><br>1) Do we want our traffic law enforcement to be coporatised by a private company?<br>2) How do you outsource "Honesty" to another company?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did you guys watch Robocop?<br><br>In that show, all the police functions have been outsourced to a private company, OCP. The funny part was when a robber held up a doughnut shop which was filled will cops. All the cops pointed their guns at the robber and was about to make the arrest when... riiiinnnggg!!! 5 pm, time to knock off... And they all upped and left.<br><br>Maybe we'll have that in future...<br><br>citizen: help! help! I think theres a break in down the street!<br><br>Cop1: Its 5pm now. But dun worry, I have job pride and professionalism! I'll check it out first think tml morning!</div>

May it be on two or four wheels there would be two atleast.<br><br>Therefore like you I also do not understand that reason for them to not be there(Jam) So what I would usually do when I am stuck in a Jam especially the causeway jam (Singapore to Malaysia)I would call the Toll free Traffic police line and report the traffic conditions to them, and they would send their officers there in a swift. PM me if you need the number.<br><br>I believe that a large population of the increase drivers driving on the roads with high headlights on are contributed by the HID drivers, they have super bright white lights which never fails to blind me..<br><br>Cheers..<br></div>
