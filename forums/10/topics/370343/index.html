              <p><strong>The Sydney Morning Herald, 30 Jul 2009, Eric Ellis</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Lumbered with the boss's wife</strong></span><br> <br> SINGAPOREANS aren’t usually given to open criticism of the Lee
              family that has ruled them for half a century. Rightly or wrongly, some
              presume that in their tightly controlled island state, walls have ears,
              and one never knows who is listening.<br> <br> But this time it’s different. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Singaporeans are deeply displeased with their Prime Minister’s wife, Ho Ching.</strong></span> She has run Temasek Holdings, the state-owned fund, since 2002, and has
              presided over a spectacular series of misjudgments that have lost
              Singaporeans billions.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>There was the murky $3 billion deal she made in
              Bangkok in 2006, to buy then Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra out of his
              telco. Ho’s massive plunges into European and American banks ended in
              tears last year when Temasek lost a third of its $100 billion
              portfolio. In Australia, Ho lost Temasek’s entire $400 million stake
              she’d plunged into Eddie Groves’ ABC Learning Centres, among other
              missteps.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>So much for her much-lauded ‘‘Superwoman’’ smarts
              and vision when the state appointed her, even though her pre-Temasek
              record at Temasek-owned arms supplier Singapore Technologies was hardly
              Sorosesque.</strong></span> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Today,
              Singaporeans are sick of Ho and have been for some time. They want her
              out of Temasek, lest she create any more financial havoc for them.<br> </strong></span> <br> Except she’s not going. In a February ‘‘transition’’ — not a sacking,
              as Temasek spun furiously — Ho was supposed to hand over Temasek to
              Chip Goodyear, the 51-year-old American (and North Melbourne supporter)
              who pointed BHP-Billiton at China for four years and made billions.<br> <br> The big idea was that Goodyear would fix the mess Ho made in banking
              and tilt Singapore into the booming China and India growth stories,
              which meant placing Temasek at the middle of big regional resources
              plays. But that, too, has ended in tears, when Temasek last week cited
              ‘‘strategic differences,’’ announcing it was "mutually agreed" Goodyear
              would not become CEO.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>It seems clear that after five
              months hanging around the Temasek office, Goodyear has been paid
              millions for his life-long silence.</strong></span><br> <br> But only a few days earlier, Goodyear was doing the rounds of Temasek
              satellites mapping out his vision. One CEO I spoke to expressed shock,
              saying he had been on the ‘‘same page’’ as Goodyear and was looking
              forward to working with him. The implication was clear: Goodyear was a
              genuine businessperson whereas Ho was not.<br> <br> That was mid-July. A week later, Chip was chopped. Temasek’s board met
              the weekend before last, then announced Goodyear was gone. So what
              happened?<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Government-controlled Straits Times said Goodyear’s proposals to shake up Temasek were viewed as "too risky" by the board.</strong></span> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Too risky? Ho’s bad bets in banks lost Temasek around $30 billion. What could be riskier than that?<br> </strong></span> <br> More likely is the take doing the rounds of Singapore’s banking and
              business communities. Local insiders, under few illusions that little
              happens at Temasek without Government say-so, say the <span style="color: red;"><strong>Government has been spooked by the arrest in China of Rio-Tinto executive Stern Hu.</strong></span><br> <br> Temasek hired Goodyear because they wanted him to do for it what he had
              done at BHP, expertly play China, which is far more politically
              important for an Asian nation such as tiny Chinese-dominated Singapore
              than it is for a global mining giant. But <span style="color: red;"><strong>after
              the Chinese Government arrested Hu and sent a message it was taking
              back control of its resources management, it wouldn’t do now, they say,
              for a foreigner who knows so much about Chinese resources to front
              mostly Singapore Inc’s ambitions in China.</strong></span><br> <br> The handling of Goodyear has deeply embarrassed Singapore and seems to
              give lie to the fiction that Temasek operates transparently and
              separately from Government policy. And knowing how deep runs the anger
              among its readers that Ho has squandered a big chunk of their nest egg,
              even the normally lap-dog Straits Times was moved to ask how ‘‘private
              sector’’ can Temasek really be, commenting: ‘‘Like it or not, Temasek
              cannot get away from the fact that it is inextricably linked to the
              Singapore Government’’.<br> <br> It’s shaken up the arcane world of sovereign wealth funds too, where
              Temasek liked to portray itself as the model for emerging wealthy
              states. Delegations from around the world made pilgrimages to Singapore
              to see how it was done, how their state’s strategic jewels can be
              packaged and managed into an investment vehicle that maintained the
              illusion it was somehow separated from the Government. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Journalists
              describing Temasek as "Government-controlled" invited a welter of
              complaints to their editors from Temasek’s spinners who demanded it be
              benignly referenced as an "Asian investment company" with no references
              to the Government whatsoever, and certainly not to describe the family
              connections of Ho’s. Failure to comply would mean an outlet would be
              blackballed by Temasek, which in Singapore ultimately suggests a libel
              suit no media company has ever won there.</strong></span><br> <br> East Timor decided the Temasek model wasn’t for them, and chose a
              Norwegian-inspired transparent route for its now $6 billion petroleum
              royalties pile. In many respects, it’s actually a model for Temasek.
              Certainly, the East Timorese fund made more money than Temasek has
              recently — it invested in boring US treasury bonds while Ho was
              plunging billions into Merrill Lynch.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Unsurprisingly, Temasek’s model
              appeals more to the more authoritarian and less democratic of states,
              such as Kazakhstan which, like Singapore, is run along family lines.</strong></span><br> <br> Now Singapore Inc is in a pickle. It said it wants to internationalise
              Temasek, and appointing the much-respected Goodyear was a huge – and
              widely welcomed – statement. Now it’s stuck with the bumbling Ho, for
              at least another year, which simply deepens the market’s conviction
              that dealing with Temasek is akin to de facto dealing with the
              Government.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Temasek says it is continuing its
              international search for a new boss. But after Goodyear’s bad year at
              Temasek, why would anyone want to go there?</strong></span><br> <br> .</p>
