              Are you aware that the deposit insurance scheme (DI) which traditionally guarantees your first $20,000 isn't free?<p></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">More importantly, when no one really knows the amount in this fascist regime's reserves, on what basis do you determine "MAS is rich" (how a Central Bank can be "rich" is anyone's guess when it isn't even a free market enterprise, but a monopoly dictating monetary policy) or that there are "very low risks"?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">On a sidenote, I bet you must also be pleased to know your beloved Temasek and GIC are infallible and are, in all probability, immuned to the credit crunch since they do not face the liquidity issues real banks, hedge funds and financial institutions (I mean such institutions in the free world here, not some despot-initiated crime syndicates embellished in the name of those institutions) face - thanks to the large chunks of money extorted from you (i.e. in the form of CPF) which effectively serves as their liquidity base. <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"> Maybe, ignorance is really a bliss...</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">How Lehman Brothers must have wished they could just have frivlously enacted legislation to seize assets of the US citizenry to tide them over the way this beloved regime could dictate how you could utilise money that is rightfully yours without your say in it.</p>

              <p>Nobody is asking you to read or believe the Straits Times.  <br>As mentioned in my post, you should go validate your assertion with the private banks and bankers that funds have flowed out of Singapore because of lack of press freedom and that the Singapore financial sector is in dire straits. You'll find that you are one of the rare few to hold such a bigoted view. </p>

              the private banks and bankers that funds have flowed out of

              <p>You don't need anyone to tell you what to do or solve the crisis for you. Singaporeans are one of the most educated bunch of citizens in the world. We can do it ourselves. All it needs is for us to be calm and rational.</p>
              <p><br>It isnt a meteor that striked earth. The world had not been overwhelmed by towering tsunamis. We are not dropping like flies from a plague. The crisis is man made, and destruction caused by men can be rebuilt by man - YOU.</p>
              <p><br>Just think:-<br>1. Life will have to go on.</p>
              <p><br>2. Trade will still have to continue. People need goods. Not ALL our purchases are luxury goods, but are essential goods.</p>
              <p><br>3. Earth is still resource rich, and capable of providing materials for our needs.</p>
              <p><br>4. Banks are now capitalised, and ready to lend money for manufacturing of essential goods, and goods that can improve and be productive for our lives.</p>
              <p><br>5. Some may be homeless, or made bankrupt, but not ALL. Those who are still surviving, still have the ability to work or create.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The financial turmoil is not as deadly as it looks. It is only business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Whatever hurt or harm it can do, it does not cripple us physically. As long as we remain rational and willing to pick up and learn from mistakes, we can still continue on to be productive for ourselves and our family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current mood is only panic reaction and shock. The fears are only loss of jobs and our current way of life. Be realistic, there diffinately will be changes with a catastrophe of such global magnitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it will not kill you. It will only make you stronger, so long as you stay rational, and am willing to persevere, to provide for yourself and your family. As long as we still have a brain, hands and legs, we will survive. We are evolved humans. Not apes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The end of this world will only come if we remain in a state of shock, be paralysed by further man-made bad news, aggravated further by panic mongers, hiding ourselves and our money deep down under shelters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I for one certainly dont intend to hide or cower in fear, or give up this life without a fight. Fortunately there are many like me ready to take on the worst of this malstrom with our brains, hands and legs. You too, are just as capable as anyone of us.</p>

              <p>You don't need anyone to tell you what to do or solve the crisis
              for you. Singaporeans are one of the most educated bunch of
              citizens in the world. We can do it ourselves. All it needs is for
              us to be calm and rational.</p>
              <p><br> It isnt a meteor that striked earth. The world had not been
              overwhelmed by towering tsunamis. We are not dropping like flies
              from a plague. The crisis is man made, and destruction caused by
              men can be rebuilt by man - YOU.</p>
              <p><br> Just think:-<br> 1. Life will have to go on.</p>
              <p><br> 2. Trade will still have to continue. People need goods. Not ALL
              our purchases are luxury goods, but are essential goods.</p>
              <p><br> 3. Earth is still resource rich, and capable of providing materials
              for our needs.</p>
              <p><br> 4. Banks are now capitalised, and ready to lend money for
              manufacturing of essential goods, and goods that can improve and be
              productive for our lives.</p>
              <p><br> 5. Some may be homeless, or made bankrupt, but not ALL. Those who
              are still surviving, still have the ability to work or create.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The financial turmoil is not as deadly as it looks. It is only
              business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Whatever hurt or harm it can do, it does not cripple us
              physically. As long as we remain rational and willing to pick up
              and learn from mistakes, we can still continue on to be productive
              for ourselves and our family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current mood is only panic reaction and shock. The fears are
              only loss of jobs and our current way of life. Be realistic, there
              diffinately will be changes with a catastrophe of such global
              magnitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it will not kill you. It will only make you stronger, so
              long as you stay rational, and am willing to persevere, to provide
              for yourself and your family. As long as we still have a brain,
              hands and legs, we will survive. We are evolved humans. Not
              apes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The end of this world will only come if we remain in a state of
              shock, be paralysed by further man-made bad news, aggravated
              further by panic mongers, hiding ourselves and our money deep down
              under shelters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I for one certainly dont intend to hide or cower in fear, or
              give up this life without a fight. Fortunately there are many like
              me ready to take on the worst of this malstrom with our brains,
              hands and legs. You too, are just as capable as anyone of us.</p>

              <p>A fair question. You certainly do not sound idiotic unlike other persons posting in this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>A very simplistic anaylsis would be that the outflow of deposits would constrain the activities of financial institutions. Yes, it would affect the bank's earnings but the ones to suffer would also be the Singaporeans whom they employ as well as other entities providing services to the banks (lawyers, IT firms etc). And when these people earn less (or worst case scenario lose their jobs), they will in turn spend less on meals, groceries, entertainment etc. These retailers and their staff will now be affected and you get into a downward spiral.</p>

              <p>Err.. by the way, is foreigner pulling money (which I interpret
              to be non Singapore dollar) out of Singapore banks necessarily a
              bad thing? If they pull money out, that means bank will have less
              income right? But banks made so much money in the past anyway so
              earning less now will not hurt them too much right? Not sure if I
              sound idiotic through this line of thought.</p>

              <p>We have both posted lots of stuff for readers to chew on. It is for readers to decide for themselves what is and what is not.</p>
              <p>AndrewPKYap asserts that he smells a rat in the deposit guarantee. He concludes that massive amounts of money must have flowed out of Singapore (and that we should follow suit). On what basis does he make the assertion ? Purely because Singapore has an official secrets act and a 'restricted' press. Therefore, whatever the Singapore government says regarding the guarantee or anything else for that matter, <em>must</em> be a lie; it can <em>never</em> be true. If this is AndrewPKYap's best 'educated guess' regarding the guarantee, so be it. As I said in my first post, he is free to move out whatever funds he has.</p>
              <p>Readers however, owe it to themselves to scrutinise these claims and decide whether there are any merits in them. Many of us complain about propaganda spread by the press. In the same vein, we have to be wary of propaganda spread by individuals.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">For me at least, AndrewPKYap has not presented any credible arguments to change my belief and conclusion that the Singapore financial sector is sound and that the deposit guarantee is indeed a pre-emptive measure taken to level the playing field, in response to similar moves made by our competitors, eg: HK. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In other words (and we seem to like to do this in this thread),</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Foreigners are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> pulling money out of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore Banks</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">, least of all because of the official secrets act or 'restricted press'.</span></p>

Or that the treasures of Atlantis, the Jewish ark of the covenant and the holy grail are being kept in Singapore ?

              <p>Nobody is asking you to read or believe the Straits Times.  <br>As mentioned in my post, you should go validate your assertion with the private banks and bankers that funds have flowed out of Singapore because of lack of press freedom and that the Singapore financial sector is in dire straits.

              <p>Will they talk to the common man from the street ?</p>
