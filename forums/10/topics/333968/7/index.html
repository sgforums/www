We each are responsible and must take responsibility for our own actions. However, loans are still avaliable, none had been rejected unless they have bad credit ratings to begin with.</span></p>

              <p>How true. We must be ultimately responsible for our own action. No point blaming people for telling me it is a great idea to own my own property. Just like the people who lost money in minibond should never blame the RM for misselling.</p>
              <p>That is why we must always not take people's word at value and learn to ask critical question, to understand fully. Because I must learn fully to take care of myself.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore shares plunged 8.33 per cent on Friday on fears of a global recession hurting corporate earnings, dealers said. <br><br>The Straits Times Index fell 145.39 points to 1,600.28. It was the index's lowest closing level since September 2003. <br><br>Volume was 1.36 billion shares. Losers led gainers 486 to 116. <br><br>"The mood on the trading floor is just terrible, the Nikkei is collapsing... There are worries over the banks' results," a trader with a local house told Dow Jones Newswires. <br><br>Japan's Nikkei index plunged more than nine per cent on Friday, coming close to its post-bubble low after the yen surged and technology giant Sony slashed its profit forecasts. <br><br>"Absolute carnage in Asia as recession fears spread like a wild fire. Risk aversion is happening on a massive scale," Knight Equity Markets vice president Ioan Smith said. <br><br>Among Singapore's leading blue chips, Singapore Airlines plunged S$1.22 to S$10.52, Singapore Telecommunications was off 22 cents to S$2.06 and Neptune Orient Lines dropped 13 cents to S$1.03. <br><br>Property stocks also closed weaker after the latest figures showed private residential property prices fell in the third quarter, the first decline in more than four years. <br><br>CapitaLand sank 19 cents to S$2.58, City Developments retreated 46 cents to S$6.10 and Keppel Land was nine cents lower at S$1.59. <br><br>As for banks, DBS gave up 94 cents to S$10.04, United Overseas Bank lost S$1.72 to S$12.08 and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp was down 61 cents at S$4.88. - AFP/ms </span></p>

              <p><br>Just have a look at how much raw materials price had dropped. What cost a dollar yesterday to buy is now only 80cts.</p>
              <p>DO remember, trade is in US dollars. How much had our exchange rate drop to the US dollar? Not as significantly as our neighbours who lost much more.<br>Thus, our product prices will be more competitive while fighting for the western world's dollar.</p>
              <p>Orders are meant for future productions. With more orders due to lower singdollar, means factories can continue to hire, or workers stay on their jobs.</p>
              <p><br>And oil? Hahahaha...its a lost cause. I personally am glad they are weeping now at $64/barrel, even with their million barrel cuts. And they will only weep more. They are the true selfish masters of greed, selling oil happily at $147 a barrel without a care for the rest of the world, causing immense rise in prices of everything else, except for Saudi Arabia.</p>

              <p><br>Just a minor correction on your post:-<br>Oil was oversold at $147/barrel, due to speculators pushing up the prices and NOT reflective of actual demand as well as knee jerked reactionary stockpiling to news that it would shoot to $200/barrels.<br>NOw, Iran and the rest of their gang are stewing, as the same speculators are dumping their investments holdings on oil. $64/barrel may just be the true value of oil and in relation to demand and even lower if markets truly go into recession.<br>Yi Haaaar!!!!</p>
