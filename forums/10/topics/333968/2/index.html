              <p><br>Ho ho ho, we can easily self sustain ourselves without any problem, foreigners bought our properties, we also bought foreiger property mah, it an globlise economy, you compete with the world, not with singapore alone, no problem, if needed, i can call my daddy to sell his profitland in London, ask my grandma to sell her land reit at victoria Hill in hongkong, and i can close my account from HSBC shanghai, no problem ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are not afraid of foreigners pulling out their investment here, in fact, it will be the most stupid thing to do at the moment as singapore is consider one of the top 5 most stable place to invest and do business for FOREIGNER ONLY. What we afraid right now is those MNC pulling out their operation here leading to retrenchment and people out of jobs, that will completely change the scenarios from a technical recession to a Reccesion</p>

              <p>I don't know why T is selling the monopolies.

              <p>I don't have much money to send overseas anyway so will just
              leave it with the banks here. I am placing my hope  in the
              government deposit guarantee . Definitely the banks here will
              try as much as possible to solve/hide/massage their problems but
              some which cannot be contained will eventually spill out, I
              believe.... Banks are tightening lending etc so I see this as they
              probably think the quality of their assets are going to
              deterioriate...</p>

              <p>And if anyone is foolish enough to believe that Singapore will face a property bubble if, and only if foriegners pull out, then he/she must be an idiot being manipulated by a cunning neanderthal hoping to buy the property at fire sale prices now and profiting it later when sanity returns.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is a financial hub but a small island and attracts a lot of global folks as well as a booming population. Property prices may dipped 5-10% in this current climate, but burst? Laughable!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, asia is not without resources. It's padi fields alone could feed the whole world several times over and Singapore is an entreport where such products are exported to the western world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> They may live without oil or tin but they cannot live without food. Thus Asia can whether the storm as long as we remain calm and sane, and help boost domestic demand and spending while US and Europe burn, a conflageration created by their greedy neanderthals there.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The problem is, without a free press that asks hard hitting questions of the ministers and with the official secrets act there, people are not sure and if do not have much money, it is not important to you, but if you have money (at least if you own stocks and properties) you need to know in order to make the correct decisions.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What if you still owe massive amounts of mortgage on your property? What then? What decision should you make? How can you make them when the information is not coming out or only propaganda comes out? Or comes out after the fact?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you see, the foreigners can play safe, they can escape without needing to know, just escape first, but Singaporeans? How to escape? What if you make a wrong decision?You live here, you have to suffer the consequences while the foreigner is safely home. Without the information, the foreigner can escape but the Singaporean dies (without knowing the true cause of his death).</span></p>

              <p>You are right. I missed the topic.</p>
              <p>I guess it goes back what I was trying to say earlier.</p>
              <p>To the foreigner, whether to pull the fund or not would depend on her assessment of the bank's risk and the reward of keeping singapore dollar based asset.</p>
              <p>The key, in my view, is the relative risk/reward compared to other countries.</p>
              <p>Stock price is falling all over the world. Bank risk is increasing all over the world.</p>
              <p>So the relativity here is hard to say.</p>
              <p>But if we look at 2 parameter here, the singapore dollar and property price, then my view is:</p>
              <p>singapore dollar looks to soften - since we need export to drive economy and government has no choice here...</p>
              <p>property  - hmm very controversial topic. I'd like to say singapore price has peaked. but that is because my perspective on this topic is very biased...</p>
