              <p>You are right. I missed the topic.</p>
              <p>I guess it goes back what I was trying to say earlier.</p>
              <p>To the foreigner, whether to pull the fund or not would depend
                  on her assessment of the bank's risk and the reward of keeping
                  singapore dollar based asset.</p>
              <p>The key, in my view, is the relative risk/reward compared to
                  other countries.</p>
              <p>Stock price is falling all over the world. Bank risk is
                  increasing all over the world.</p>
              <p>So the relativity here is hard to say.</p>
              <p>But if we look at 2 parameter here, the singapore dollar and
                  property price, then my view is:</p>
              <p>singapore dollar looks to soften - since we need export to drive
                  economy and government has no choice here...</p>
              <p>property  - hmm very controversial topic. I'd like to
                  say singapore price has peaked. but that is because my
                  perspective on this topic is very biased...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They will run and instead of solving the problem at its core, a briddled press and an unaccountable government, the despots provide guarantee like that is the problem.</span></p>

              <p><br>I had been eyeing a penthouse at East Coast for some time, costing around $3.5million. If the foreigner is willing to sell at $2million, give me his lawyer's number and I will deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't expect me to be charitable, after all, if he is foolish to let go at this price just to put the money in a tin box, too bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless of course, he can prove that his business had collapse and needs the money to pay his singaporean workers, and i will up the figures.</p>
              <p><br>Joke aside, our Han chinese forefathers know what is discrimination and tyranny - bullied by Manchus, had our lands and books burned by Mao, brothers' head lopped off by the japs, treated like dogs by the colonnial western cowards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our Indian forefathers knew too what it was like too - bullied by a caste system and robbed by colonnial powers, treated like slaves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our Malay forefathers didnt had it any better - ruled by despotic Majahapit kings as serfs and equally treated as dogs by colonnial masters.</p>
              <p><br>But together, they came to this piece of rock called Singapore and made it home. Despite their sufferings, they worked hard, together as one, to build what we had enjoyed yesterday. In the comfort of today, it is easy to forget the sweat of our forefathers.</p>
              <p><br>I didn't make Singapore successful. MM Lee didnt make Singapore. It was your forefather,  the hard work by our multi-racial forefathers whose resilience, dynamism, flexibility and courage in the face of wars and suffering, to make this rock outcrop a home for us all, sheltered from the multi-faceted problematic world.</p>
              <p><br>It would be a shame if we let our country rot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many had claimed they will set aside their emotions and help Singapore in times of crisis, even those who left our shores or those who shirked from their NS duties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now our country is in crisis. Who will help save our countries if not ourselves? Or should we be partisan, turn traitor and harm all just because of our own contempt for some individuals?</p>
              <p><br>This crisis calls not for arms or to kill any human being. Our enemy is fear itself. Irrational and herd instincts. All it needs for all to survive is to continue one's way of life - save and spend, though less frivolously.</p>
              <p><br>The alternative would be to see our savings wipe out in months, the middle class a little later and the rich would have to spend vast sums to protect themselves and their loved ones, as what Indonesian rich had to do during their crisis in the late 90s.</p>
              <p><br>To Artboon:-<br>You are looking at the crisis from your own perspective. But not everyone would be in the similar financial situation as you. There are 3.2million Singaporeans. There are many more rich people than Ng Teng Fong, quietly living beside us, wearing bermudas and slippers.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reason For PAP/MAS Policy Change?</span></span></p>
              <p>Its nice to know that after Hong Kong and Australia initiated guarantee
              measures, the Singapore PAP Govt has risen to follow in the footsteps
              and also issue guarantees on deposits in banks licenced by the MAS.</p>
              <p>Previously,
              this was a government that had stoutly implemented a miserly capp
              SGD25,000/- for such guarantees and also given little support to
              citizens in these difficult times, apart from raising electricity
              prices, extending ERP gantries and increasing the salaries of its
              million dollar ministers.</p>
              <p>So it really begets ths question;  Why the sudden magnanimous change of heart? Are we see signs of a more caring and humane PAP?</p>
              <p><strong>Just
              so every one is under no false illusions, the latest move by the MAS is
              not to look after the plight of the average man on the street. As every
              seasoned banker knows, this was a strategic move to halt the flight of
              capital to other safe haven countries like Australia.</strong></p>
              <p>Countries
              who implemented such guarantees early can still be credited with having
              the noble intention to safe-guard the savings of the common folks.
              However, this is not the case for the PAP Government who was only
              prodded from its state of lethargy to follow sjuite only to prevent
              what would have been a migration of billions of dollars of deposits
              and AUMs (Assets Under Management) of the affluent and rich depositers
              to other private banking accounts maintained offshore in safe havens.</p>
              <p>The
              plight of the common average joe (who has 20-30k) is of little
              relevance. But as the good news is that the average depositer and
              common man still benefits from the policy change notwithstanding the
              real reasons behind the change.</p>

              <p>The old damned despot with a wife that cannot die a peaceful death, and a son with cancer of the anus said, lied, fooled, whatever you will that:</p>

              <p>Either he lied, fooled or is just a damned idiot for saying that.</p>
              <p> ...and yet he has the gumption to persecute dissdents and opposition trying to make this a better place while he takes massive amounts of public money and put his relatives and cronies in charge of the reserves losing billions supporting foreign banks.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">His assdogs will once again tell you to forgive them for their "honest mistakes" and the only mistake is that silliporeans trusted dishonorable people instead of cursing them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dishonorable people must be damned and cursed until their grandchildren suffer from cancer and or until they step down and stop taking massive amounts of public money for themselves.</span></p>
