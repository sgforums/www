"</span><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">OUR MONEY AND OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS MONEY" ???!!! </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Stupid delusional idiot that believes in propaganda and one that buys the propaganda hook line and sinker. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">President Ong Teng Chong asked them to account for the money, since he as president was supposed to be the "guardian of the reserves" and was immediately made a pariah.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is better that the money stays in Singaporeans' pockets for them to leave it for their children and the future generations instead of it being in the hands of dishonorable despots that will persecute people like Dr Chee Soon Juan that dares to ask them to account for the money.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Honorable people, when asked, account for it. Dishonorable people when asked, persecute the one that questions. So you decide, the despots, honorable or dishonorable?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let me repeat. The guarantees are useless to stop the outflow of money from Singapore banks because the issue is not the fear of banks collapsing but the recession and heavy losses (on the reserves) suffered by the despot's relative and cronies, thus eroding the value of the currency. This in turn will cause further contagion effects on the economy.</span></p>

              <p><br>Are you aware that the deposit insurance scheme (DI) which traditionally guarantees your first $20,000 isn't free?</p>
              <p>More importantly, when no one really knows the amount in this fascist regime's reserves, on what basis do you determine "MAS is rich" (how a Central Bank can be "rich" is anyone's guess when it isn't even a free market enterprise, but a monopoly dictating monetary policy) or that there are "very low risks"?</p>
              <p>On a sidenote, I bet you must also be pleased to know your beloved Temasek and GIC are infallible and are, in all probability, immuned to the credit crunch since they do not face the liquidity issues real banks, hedge funds and financial institutions (I mean such institutions in the free world here, not some despot-initiated crime syndicates embellished in the name of those institutions) face - thanks to the large chunks of money extorted from you (i.e. in the form of CPF) which effectively serves as their liquidity base. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"> Maybe, ignorance is really a bliss...</p>
              <p>How Lehman Brothers must have wished they could just have frivlously enacted legislation to seize assets of the US citizenry to tide them over the way this beloved regime could dictate how you could utilise money that is rightfully yours without your say in it.</p>

              <p>To the threadstarter: if you feel strongly that your money would be safer in Thailand, Philipines, Indonesia, Timbuktu than in Singapore, please go ahead and transfer your funds out. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nobody is stopping you.</span></p>
              <p>Speak to any private bank or banker and hardly any of them (if at all) will confirm your assertion that massive funds have been flowing out of Singapore because of the 'lack of press freedom' or 'the official secrets act'.</p>
              <p>The decision by Singapore to guarantee deposits was made to <span style="color: #ff0000;">pre-empt</span> any significant deposit outflows due to guarantees given by other jurisdictions; and not because the Singapore financial sector is facing collapse as implied by the threadstarter. In other words, the motivation was indeed to level the playing field.</p>
              <p>The decision made by Singapore to guarantee deposits was not made lightly. There will be a cost to banks and we also have to be mindful of regional sensitivities with such a move. It was a good thing that Malaysia simultaneously announced a guarantee of their own. This was why Singapore did not 'lead the pack' in announcing such a guarantee; it did so only after our competitor HK did so.</p>
              <p>Someone asked why the Singapore deposit guarantee only lasts till 2010. Can anyone make an intelligent guess ? ... ...  It's because the HK one lasts till 2010.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let me repeat. The guarantees are useless to stop the outflow of money from Singapore banks because the issue is not the fear of banks collapsing but the recession and heavy losses (on the reserves) suffered by the despot's relative and cronies, thus eroding the value of the currency. This in turn will cause further contagion effects on the economy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Confidence will not return because of the propaganda, official secrets acts and a censored/self censored press. These are the real reasons for the outflow and the guarantees by the despots will not help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Silliporeans are paying a heavy price for coddling dishonorable despots.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The despot's behavior with regards to the investors that lost money with the "sold as safe" Lehman bonds (especially when Hong Kong allowed the people to protest in front of the banks, whereas here only at Hong Lim park) when in Hong Kong they can get their money back; further eroded confidence that this is a just society.</span></p>

              <p><br>It is so easy to spread panic and fear at these present times. With a despicable agenda to destablise and remove people whom they have hatred for, without a care to others who are not knowledgeable and worries they faced.</p>
              <p><br>This is not the time please. It is a crisis we face. Lets for humanity and society sake, drop the agenda filled panic mongering!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My 2cts suggestion is:-</span></p>
              <p>1. Keep calm and be rational<br>2. Put your hardearned money in banks and not at home.<br>3. Continue spending, but not frivously. It will keep the domestic economy going.<br>4. Wait for rationality to return, as it ultimately will. Regulation and improvements will be made, you can bet on it. We are humans, we make mistakes, but will learn and improve from it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drop in currency value fear mongering:</span></p>
              <p><br>I will give a brief explanation minus the economist tech jargon in order to briefly explain to mom and pops here, to dispel the myth of 'currency dropping value' and the dangers associated with it. I would advise further reading on the subject at libraries or buy the books.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-------------------------------------</p>
              <p><br>Every nation on Earth would need to back the piece of paper called money so that it can be accepted by another. It is backed by a national guarantee that the amount printed on it is the amount you can use for any other purpose.</p>
              <p> <br>And that guarantee are gold reserves held in national treasuries, equal in amount to all money being printed and circulated.</p>
              <p><br>Over time, nations started collect‌ing foreign currencies instead of holding gold - a volitile commodity subjected to market conditions and difference in valuation daily, thus a headache for national accounting purposes, one of the major reasons being that it can be easily traded and used, with US dollar being the most of it as it was the dollar used for international trade, a source of stability.</p>
              <p><br>With the current turmoil and the unimaginable vasts amounts in trillions of dollars being printed and used to prop and intervene in the market, there is a fear that western countries may be printing more than the value of gold they hold, thus causing a drop in value of the dollar to match their amount of gold in vaults.</p>
              <p><br>This may only be true in the temporary sense, but then think again. How much gold would national treasuries have?</p>
              <p><br>Gold is a metal that does not rust or evaporates. Since the dawn of civilisation, mankind had realize that and had valued gold and had sought and dug for it. The Greek empire has it, the Pharonic empires, rulers of the world - Rome in abundance, Spain and England rob it from Asia.</p>
              <p><br>Empires come and go. Gold changed hands. But gold never disappeared.</p>
              <p><br>Imagine if only 500kg of gold were dug a year. How many tonnes of gold would the world have by today after 6000 years of recorded history?</p>
              <p><br>And who has the most gold reserves? After WW2, USA was the only resource rich country left untouched by the war. It was paid in gold by the great empires for the reconstruction of the battered world.<br>USA thus is the one holding the most gold reserves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><br>The current turmoil is caused by panic reaction. As more took out their cash and kept at home, countries had to print more money and would continue to print to assure their citizens and keep the economy running.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A secondary panic reaction would be to think that the currency value of their dollars would be lower and then they will turn to hoarding gold instead.</p>
              <p><br>This will only drive the value of gold up. Countries with gold reserves will be laughing to the bank. They would gladly sell their gold bought at $56 an ounce to suckers at $840++ today's prices. It would pay off their national debts.</p>
              <p><br>And when suckers realised that the currency values are holding up, they will dump their gold, as it is not readily convertible as cash, causing the price of gold to massively drop.</p>
              <p><br>Gold reserves countries would gladly by back at the lowered prices.</p>
              <p><br>Who loses?</p>
              <p><br>You who panicked and believed in false prophets of doom.</p>

              <p>Should interest rates be a consideration for my deposits in bank?</p>
              <p>YES! But not for the reason you would greedily accept.</p>
              <p>Think! How does banks pay for your interests?</p>
              <p> <br>They do so by investing your money in loans and stocks. For a bank to offer higher interest rate would mean they would have to take on higher risks for higher returns. And when things get sour, what happens? I thought most would have learnt their lesson now. Greed will make you suffer.</p>
              <p><br>Your deposit may be guaranteed. <strong>But your interests are NOT!<br></strong>Do remember to read the lines in fine print - "returns are subjected to market conditions for your FIXED deposits".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By all means, deposit in a foriegn banks that offer high rates. But dont come back crying when you find some dollars missing.</p>
              <p><br>We singaporeans are known to be 'kiasu'. It was this trait that made us successful. We do not have the wild extremes other countries suffer, where some get amazingly rich and others homeless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We always have enough for food on the table, a holiday or 2, kids with schools to go to, and one job lost means another is waiting if we are resourceful enough.</p>
              <p><br>So too are our national institutions and banks. Kiasuism may just save us. We willingly spend if there is a need, but save if the need is not there, no matter how convincing a Harvard degree conmen tells us we need their products. At least for the majority of us.</p>
