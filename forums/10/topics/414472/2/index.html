              <p>maybe already bankrupted ! just look at the huge amount of money the government lost on overseas investments</p>
              <p>nobody has a clear idea of whether Temasek is making money on the overseas investments because the account is not audited , everything is covered up like a black box</p>
              <p>the worry, is that they lose too much, by the time we retire, we may not have enough money left in our CPF to cover our old age living</p>

              <p>I still find Sg ok provided the GIC can start spread their investments elsewhere from US. I think the Jap did better than Sg with their reserve managed.

              <p>My main bone of contention is the way the gov sarcificed the local aunties and uncles who are nearing the old CPF total withdrawn age and found that they cannot withdraw much at all. That's bad as some of them don't have much in CPF at all after the mandatory minimun being lockout by the gov, they can only get back a few thousands. Most can't find work due to the influx of FloorTraps and some already sick and need the money to pay for their medicine which also has a 7% GST slapped on those medicine. How inhumane can the gov be, especially to all these elderly people who contributed to Sinkapore. If the gov can do all that to people, they must be morally and also finnancially close to meltdown!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
