              <p><strong>Thenewamerican.com, 10 Jul 2009, Alex Newman</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Unqualified Immigrants Fixing American Planes?</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Calls to investigate the Federal Aviation
              Administration (FAA) are growing after media outlets revealed that
              immigrants with inadequate certifications may be working on American
              airplanes. </strong></span>In many cases, according to reports, mechanics who don’t even speak English are replacing qualified American workers.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>"We just have to bring them before
              Congress and ask them what they're doing,” said Texas Rep. Ted Poe of
              Houston. “I will ask Congressman Oberstar of the Aviation Committee to
              hold hearings with the FAA regarding this whole situation."</strong></span><br> <br> WFAA-TV in Dallas and Fort Worth exposed the problems with an investigation in early July. <span style="color: red;"><strong>“Reporters found that aliens are being brought into the country so that they can be paid less than American workers,”</strong></span> the TV station noted on its website. The investigation also charged
              that the immigrants' experience and credentials may be in question.
              Quoting insiders, the station claims <span style="color: red;"><strong>“the companies that are importing the mechanics are so eager to save money, they’re overstating their qualifications. </strong></span>The result may be a threat to safety, abetted by lax enforcement of immigration law.”<br> <br> The foreign mechanics working at San Antonio International Airport were
              mostly here on temporary permits called TN visas, a provision of the
              North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) designed to allow licensed
              professionals to work in other countries. Citing documents obtained
              from Mexican mechanics, the report found that many were not licensed
              anywhere, though they may have attended airplane repair school in
              Mexico. Other workers came from places like the Philippines, Chile, and
              a variety of other Asian and Latin American countries.<br> <br> "The more experienced mechanics, we would get paired up with either one
              or two of these guys,” said a former mechanic with San Antonio
              Aerospace who was laid off. “They would watch us for a month or so. And
              that’s how they would get their training.” According to a former
              administrator, as soon as the American employees were let go, the
              foreign workers would arrive.<br> <br> "They’ve employed over 200 since I left,” alleged Jada Williams, a
              former employee of Aircraft Workers Worldwide. The contracting company
              provided workers for companies owned by Singapore Technologies (ST)
              Aerospace, the largest aircraft repair company in the world. "And I
              know we had over a hundred when I was in there, just in Mobile,” she
              added, referring to Mobile Aerospace Engineering in Alabama, which like
              San Antonio Aerospace is controlled by ST Aerospace.<br> <br> But Chye Kiat Ang, the president of the Singapore-based company,
              defended the firms’ actions. “They are as good as any American worker,”
              he said, explaining that between 10 percent and 15 percent of the
              employees were immigrants. <span style="color: red;"><strong>“No
              one is working in a situation where they are forced to accept a lower
              wage,” Ang noted, adding that the company had found it difficult to
              recruit qualified Americans, who are required to be certified by an
              FAA-approved company.</strong></span><br> <br> The foreign workers also defended the companies. One of the Mexicans
              working at the San Antonio airport explained that mechanics in Mexico
              learn in English using English manuals. Another, Ruben Ramirez, said,
              “I can prove my skills with my documents.” The director of quality for
              San Antonio Aerospace added that the workers were very skilled and
              professional.<br> <br> A spokesperson for the FAA, which is in charge of regulating the
              industry and frequently inspects the San Antonio facility, said the
              firm is not currently under investigation. But a former employee at the
              company alleges that before inspectors arrived they were given a
              one-hour warning. “A lot of guys who were not able to read English,
              they would hide those guys or send them home for the evening," he said.<br> <br> Many of the foreign workers apply for Social Security numbers under
              their visas and stay longer than they are allowed to — sometimes
              forever. NAFTA has created a myriad of problems and hazards for the
              United States, and this is simply another example. NAFTA should be
              abolished so the United States can set its own responsible policies.
              And if it turns out that unqualified mechanics are really fixing our
              planes, there should be severe consequences for those responsible.<br> <br> ------------------------<br> <br> <strong>Latest @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>Unfortunately in Singapore - there are no independent voices willing to be as vocal with the situation in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The back-bencher Members of Parliament from the Ruling Party - are not allowed to speak their conscience, while the Members of Parliament from the Alternative Parties are too cosy with their seats in Parliament.</p>
              <p>The Government is the largest employer in Singapore, and the regulations have been changed or bent to suit their own operational requirements to cut costs all round.</p>
              <p>Employment contracts for Singaporeans are brought to the same level as foreign workers - now everyone is employed on short-term contracts.</p>
              <p>Wages are pressed downwards to the levels closer to that of foregin workers.</p>
              <p>In a recession, the market driven economy is overwhelmed by a large pool of unemployed Singaporeans who will take on jobs at wages that are not based on the job scope, level of responsibilities, but by the wages of a foreign replacement.</p>
              <p>In better times, the same will also occur when Singaporeans shun the job for the poor wages offered, and which the employer has the option of getting foreign replacement.</p>
              <p>While in Singapore there may not be enough skilled workers to fill the various positions that the organisations need, the Singapore Employers are not subject to the wages set by the market conditions of the limited local labor pool - as the labor supply of the World is open.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans will have to compete even in our own home ground against the foreign workers, while other governments protect their own citizens.</p>
              <p>While this Government refuse to allow their own wages to be measured with other similar First World Governments, they will subject Singaporean to the wages of foreign workers willing to replace Singaporeans who shun the low wage offered.</p>
