              <h1>Ousted Nepal prince leaves nation</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44796000/jpg/_44796926_parashleavingafp226.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="170"></p>
              <p class="first"><strong>The former Crown Prince of Nepal, Paras Shah, has left the country
                      for the first time in more than two years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on a flight to Singapore.</span> </strong></p>
              <p>There has been speculation that the controversial former heir to the
                      now abolished throne is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> moving to the island city permanently.</span></p>
              <p>But this has been denied by one of his close relatives.</p>
              <p>Abhinesh Shah told the BBC there was "no way" that Paras was moving out of the country.</p>
              <p>Mr Shah, who is married to Paras' first cousin, said Paras was
                      instead looking for a good school for his three young children, whose
                      education was being disrupted by constant strikes and traffic problems
                      in Nepal.</p>
              <p>He said Paras and his wife, Himani, would - as guardians - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be
                      spending a lot of time in Singapore,</span> but added that once the children
                      got older they might return to good schools in Nepal.</p>
              <p>Mr Shah said Singapore's good medical facilities would be useful to the
                      37-year-old former prince who recently suffered a heart attack.</p>
              <p>The pony-tailed former prince was pictured arriving at the
                      airport before flying out to Singapore, reportedly with two bodyguards
                      and his brother-in-law.</p>
              <p><strong>Controversial</strong></p>
              <p>The editor of Jana Astha, a weekly paper known for its royal stories,
                      was quoted as saying Paras was concerned for the safety of his wife and
                      three young children and was planning to leave Nepal for good.</p>
              <p>But Mr Shah said he did not believe Paras was concerned for his family's security in Nepal.</p>
              <p>There have however been press reports that the former princess is worried about that very issue.</p>
              <p>As the son of ex-King Gyanendra, Paras was the first in line to the
                      throne and was unpopular among Nepalis for his drunken antics and
                      playboy lifestyle.</p>
              <p>One observer here said that in travelling he was enjoying the
                      advantages of being a commoner, which he became in May when a new
                      assembly abolished the monarchy.</p>
              <p>Like his father, his movements had been restricted for two years after the failure of a period of direct royal rule.</p>
