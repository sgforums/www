He is currently appealing the bankruptcy court's verdict.<br><br>Banlang Pinsakol, the public prosecutor in charge of litigation against iTV, said he expected the Prime Minister's Office would file a complaint against iTV with the Central Administrative Court, initiating the process compelling iTV to pay the concession fee and fine by March 30.<br><br>Mr Banlang said the PM's Office had asked the Attorney-General's Office to file the legal execution complaint against iTV on its behalf.<br><br>The attorney-general had suggested the PM's Office verify the amount of the fine and fee it is owed by iTV.
