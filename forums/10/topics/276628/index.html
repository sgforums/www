Flood waters also caused heavy traffic jams throughout the city.<br><br>Non-stop rain showers were recorded early morning Tuesday. Thousands of Singaporean workers and students were stranded because of the rising waters and some decided not to go out of their houses anymore.<br><br>In the Commonwealth MRT station, traffic was bumper-to-bumper with some vehicles reported to have been caught in flood waters.</div>

Afterall we are where we are because of him. There is no IF in this real world.<br><br>Facts are facts. No use complaining about it and not doing anything after that.</div></blockquote>The opposition parties in Singapore face an uphill task as they are being treated unequally in many situations. Take the recent rejection of the WP application to hold a cycling event to celebrate their 50th anniversary, it seems to me that the reason is more politically motivated than anything else since the reason given is ridiculous.<br><br>So it's not possible to join politic to promote your own cause. Either join the ruling party to be MIW yes man, or join the opposition parties but be bullied by the ruling parties.<br><br>Secondly, we are paying the ministers so that they can lead us to build a better future for SG. So I don't care what LKY did in the past, but what he can contribute in the future. If he's able to contribute, then he can stay, otherwise, he should retire and not waste taxpayer money.<br><br></div>
