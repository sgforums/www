Those that are already citizens and are looping mad are the government's responsibility as well as the family's burden. (The single citizenship thing. And no, you can't deport a citizen who is mentally ill.) Of course, Singapore should not let in people who have a history of psychotic episodes to work in Singapore.(Which means that such foreign talents must declare that they are wholly sane before a work permit is issued and thus be disallowed to bring in their medical histories of psychotic espisodes from abroad.)<br><br>Ah Hao family tried to use the mentally mad loop hole to allow Ah Hao to escape the gallows.(They claimed Ah Hao had schizophrenic problems and thus should be given a lighter sentence.)<br><br>In fact, Ah Hao's family tried to bring in Ah Hao's medical history with psychotic illness as evidence of mental instability. However, our court concluded otherwise. In the first place, given such a history, Ah Hao shouldn't be working in Singapore alone. Otherwise, he's mentally fit for trial in a court of law.</div>
