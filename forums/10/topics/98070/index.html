            <div class='col-md body'>I respect Mr Tung Chee Hwa its really sad to see someone who has been working so hard for HongKong being haress by a thug like long hair. I hope this will never happen in Singapore.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Rebel lawmaker disrupts grilling of Tung </strong></span><br><br>HONG KONG - The new Hong Kong legislature got its first chance to question Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa yesterday but the session was disrupted by a radical lawmaker.<br><br>Security guards blocking Mr Leung (right) outside the legislative chambers. The radical lawmaker again hogged the limelight by causing havoc at the session yesterday and claiming official harrasment. -- AP<br>The showdown made clear that Mr Tung could be in for a rough ride in his last three years of office. His opposition in the Legislative Council (Legco) added three new members, for a total of 25 out of 60 seats, including some harsh, vocal critics.<br><br>Mr Tung entered the legislative chambers ready to be grilled on policy, but the hearing was delayed by a bizarre exchange as lawmaker 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok Hung charged that he had been harassed by Mr Tung's bodyguards on the way in.<br><br>Mr Leung said he tried to hand the Chief Executive a petition but was physically restrained by two bodyguards.<br><br>He said Mr Tung watched the confrontation and did nothing.<br><br>'Mr Tung saw that his bodyguards were violent to me, ignored it and left,' Mr Leung said. 'When you see your dog biting your friend, you at least tell your dog to stop biting. You wouldn't just walk away.'<br><br>Mr Tung stood at a podium in silence as 'Long Hair' argued with Legco president Rita Fan over the fracas.<br><br>When Mr Leung refused to be pacified, Ms Fan adjourned the meeting for about 10 minutes.<br><br>Mr Tung's office later issued a statement saying it would provide Legco secretariat officials with a detailed explanation of the incident 'to assist them in ascertaining what actually happened'.<br><br>Mr Leung came under fire himself for wearing a T-shirt in violation of the legislature's dress code.<br><br>He refused to cover it up with a jacket at Ms Fan's urging, and the Legco president said she would deal with the issue later.<br><br>The shirt was emblazoned with a political slogan demanding that mainland China atone for the killing of student activists during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.<br><br>During the swearing-in ceremony on Oct 6, he shattered the solemnity by shouting pro-democracy slogans after he read his oath of office.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Tung, who was picked by an 800-member pro-Beijing committee, was peppered with questions from more than a dozen lawmakers about a variety of social concerns, including pollution from mainland China, the economy as well as the lack of a minimum wage.<br><br>He said he was working on Hong Kong's problems and considering all the issues being raised, but he produced no new answers for solving them.<br><br>Mr Tung also promised the pro-democracy lawmakers that he would follow up on their request to visit Chinese leaders in Beijing.<br><br>The mundane workings of government were vastly overshadowed by the drama being stirred up by Mr Leung, who was swept to office last month in a massive protest vote. -- AP, Reuters<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being hardworking is different from "effective". In fact, the Chief Executive should do a deep down reflection, how come he is so lousy that Long Hair could get more than 60,000 votes to get into Legco!
