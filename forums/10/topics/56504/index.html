            <div class='col-md body'>The recent announcement of the Singapore Sports Council raising entry fees to all public swimming pools seem to be a "sick joke" in the middle of wage and CPF cuts to the Singaporean 'heartlanders'.<br><br>It is surprising that public swimming pools gets the attention and immediate reaction in Parliament, and required the Cabinet to influence the decision to an increase of the entry fee of a Public Swimming Pool.<br><br>Now, one can only wonder what does not come under the purview of the Singapore Cabinet ?<br><br>If a small gesture - such as reversing the increase to the entry fee of Public Swimming Pool - can reap so much supposed goodwill and warm response from the average Singaporean, what IF the Government should also decide to reduce the other "BIG TICKET" tax items that affect the larger Singaporean Community - both private and buisness ?<br><br>Will the Government take and bite this bait that can only result in a win-win situation, or is the Government too stubborn to reverse its wrong decision to tax Singapore out of its competitiveness ?<br><br>The Government has made such a "big deal" to the attention it has given to the 'entry fee of Public Swimming Pools", and it is surprising to learn that there is an upcoming slew of more price increases that are now put on hold !<br><br><strong><span class="large">Better to make U-turn than 'try to save face' </span><br>Embarrassing climb-down, says Soo Sen, but forging ahead despite feedback would have been worse </strong><br><br><span class="small">By Rebecca Lee </span><br><br>YES, it was an embarrassing about-turn, Minister of State (Education and Community Development &amp; Sports) Chan Soo Sen acknowledged yesterday, of the Government reversing its decision to raise fees at public sports facilities.<br><br>But it would have been worse to go ahead in the face of such strong and valid opposition, just for the sake of saving face, he added.<br><br>The reason for the Government's sudden change of heart - in just two days - was the feedback it had received, Mr Chan told The Straits Times.<br><br>'It is a bit embarrassing, yes, but it will be more embarrassing if we just go ahead regardless of the feedback,' he said.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday also acknowledged that the Government had not handled the matter 'quite as slickly as we should have'.<br><br>'But I think the minister has put things right,' he told reporters at the launch of this year's National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign.<br><br>He said the Government could not afford to put off raising big ticket items such as the GST, but <strong><span style="color: red;">would do its best to be generous and delay raising charges on smaller items</span></strong>.<br><br>On Thursday, Minister for Community Development and Sports Yaacob Ibrahim announced that the hikes, scheduled for next month and next July, were not going ahead.<br><br>Two days earlier, Mr Chan had defended the hikes in Parliament after MPs Cynthia Phua (Aljunied GRC) and Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central) protested against the rises, which would have made swimming at a public pool cost twice as much from next July.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Chan said that the turnaround was due to the valid points raised by the two MPs, who had argued that it was ill-timed and went against what Mr Lee had earlier said, that the newly-formed Cut Waste Panel could demand, among other things, that unnecessary fees and charges be reviewed.<br><br>Mr Chan also said he could not delay the announcement 'because my duty on that day was to announce the decision'. And he could not say the ministry would reconsider without first consulting the minister.<br><br>But the two MPs' feedback struck a chord.<br><br>In a written reply to The Straits Times queries, the MCDS yesterday said that it has set up an Economy Drive Committee, chaired by SSC chief executive officer Colonel (Ret) Kwan Yue Yeong, to look into ways to cut costs by 'reviewing service delivery and service standards'.<br><br>SSC has already taken steps to cut costs at its facilities by employing part-timers, and using coin-operated lockers to reduce manpower costs.<br><br>'But the saving may not be enough. We will have to re-think how we can better leverage on existing resources,' MCDS said.<br><br>Yesterday, the president of the Singapore Hockey Federation, Mr M. Lukshumayeh, welcomed the move.<br><br>'With the tense economic situation, people need an outlet and I think sports is an ideal outlet.<br><br>'The increase would have denied a lot of people, especially families, from participating in sporting events,' he said.<br><br>In his remarks to reporters, Mr Lee also said he sensed that following his dialogue with business and unions leaders on Thursday, people were accepting the CPF changes very calmly and understood what the Government was doing.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,208413,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,208413,00.html?</a></div>
