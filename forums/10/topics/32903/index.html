            <div class='col-md body'>The government released the White Paper on the activities and arrest of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorists.  Why the government bothered to charge people $20+ for the booklet is amazing when CNA offers a free pdf version of it. But that is a seperate debate on whether governments should charge so much for public information (some nominal fee is of course expected but $20+?).<br><br>It looks like the government is becoming more transparent, at least where handling ISA cases are concerned. According to Part IV of the White Paper, the terrorists even had a hearing in front of a judge and also had lawyers to represent them if they wanted to. Perhaps it is a one-off stunt by the government to show that they have "fair" trials for ISA detainees, but it sure looks like an impartial hearing for the Jemaah Islamiah terrorsits despite it being "closed" to the public and media.<br><br><a href="http://www.thevoiddeck.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.thevoiddeck.org</a></div>
