            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore could only boast of a system of taxing and recovering all costs which drive up citizensÂ’ costs of living to the roof and its middle class to economic slavery.<br><br>The incomes of the middle class have been dropping since the 1980s with many in their late 30s and early 40s joining the rank of unemployed despite all the education.<br><br>The economy has been languishing since then and during all the past three deep recessions the government ministers are despairing with no solutions to problems.<br><br>Yet, believing that the ministers are the talents and against peopleÂ’s objections, they continue to raise taxes and recover all possible expenses by charging higher fees from medical to education and health raising the costs of living, forcing the closures of many domestic businesses.<br><br>The government is only able to boast its success only after finally the economy recovers from world recovery.<br><br>While the rich is getting richer and the ministers and civil servants are getting their higher salaries the people are getting poorer and owing more debts caused by past policy errors on asset enhancements etc.<br><br>The peopleÂ’s rage can be seen in the way they reacted to NKF wrong doings supported by ministers and higher authorities.<br><br>Canberra does not know enough of such facts when it decided to award the mm of the honorable degree.<br><br>The University should have done more researches by reading postings in sgforums and youngpap forums.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, not sure if u guys saw the MediaCorp news?  I think though the protests against our MM may not be in print media, it certainly was in broadcast media.<br><br>Ya, some of the students there may be "jia pah jin oo eng" but that's where they will receive their hard knocks and challenges against their group's thinking and principles.  Over time, some of them will outgrow their beliefs (just like religion right? though few people will admit) and align their thoughts to some other principles.  This is just part and parcel of education.  There will always be some other groups that hold different thoughts and challenge them as they will challenge the establishment for giving out the HD to our MM.  It's part of democracy right?</div>
