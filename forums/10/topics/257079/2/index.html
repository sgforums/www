But sadly, this WORLD is far from perfect.<br><br>btw..... the same Great Man you quoted from now have followers who insist that you join them or die...... so much for following <strong>ethical principal of reversibility/reciprocity</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Hmm I think you didn't really get my question.<br><strong>Yes </strong>you do not want to be arrested but what if the govt insists on detaining you when you are innocent but they think you ain't.<br><strong>yes</strong>you don't get involved in any illegal activity but what if the gov't just thinks you have and detain you for a few years until they prove that you are harmless.<br><strong>Yes</strong>we cannot say that the govt is acting like a dictator. But to a certain extent, our freedom and rights are compromised and I believe that these compromises can be better worked out.<br><strong>Yes</strong>of course prevention is better than cure, but not at the expense of people's life<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO</span></strong> my quotes aren't from people who think about a perfect world, but are outlines to an ethical society and world. I guess you do not understand the difference between universability and reversibility.<br>Universability is that some sacrifce is acceptable for the majority's well-being. And reversability is more of an individual basis. So the question is whether the sacrifice of some of our citizen's 'LIFE' and one day even OUR own 'LIFE' acceptable?<br>If you feel that, yes you'l be willing to be detained/exiled if the gov't suspects you but you are innocent, you have a strong stand.</div>
