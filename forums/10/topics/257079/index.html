This led to 32 years of LIFE being taken away, including 22.5 years of detention in various prisons, followed by 3.5 years of internal exile to Sentosa Island and another 6 years of restriction on the mainland.

Only four had been released on restriction orders. 37 terrorists? Or are there individuals who have a life, family and bright future having their life wasted and decimated?<br>Amnesty International,which campaigned for Mr Chia Thye Poh since 1969, believes that Chia Thye Poh's 22.5 years' detention without trial, and the subsequent prolonged restriction of his freedom of expression, association and movement, are a potent symbol of the oppressive effects of the ISA on Singapore's political and civil life. The ISA remains at the heart of a formidable array of legislation which restricts the ability of Singaporeans to enjoy fundamental human rights. Such laws continue to effectively deter Singaporeans from expressing dissenting political opinions, or from participating in political life without the consent -- overt or tacit -- of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).<br>Of course we need laws to prevent and suppress troublemakers, but I believe that our PAP or our people can come up with a win-win solution.

How anyone can make a case for someone being detained for 2 years without sufficient evidence being brought against him for his alleged crime is beyond me.<br><br>The ISA is merely a smokescreen used to mask the criminal practices by the criminals in power who obviously haven't got sufficient evidence to prosecute the suspect in a court of law.</div>

Basically, in such cases, the suspects are still subjected to a free and fair trial without being arbitrarily detained without a substantial rhyme or reason.

Is Singaporean free from religion as one is involved in politics ? It will seem that those good Christians and Budhists in the Ruling Party have correctly suppressed their religious teachings and correctly separated their religious moral values from their political responsibilities to the Ruling Party and to the State.<br><br>Conscience, moral values, and religious guidance have no place in Singapore Politics unless prescribed and sanctioned by LKY - as in his convenient and cynical promotion of Confucianism. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Is writing one's own pay cheque or NKF malpractices one such key causes of instability of law and order.
