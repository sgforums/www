And if stayed closely on the news of the law graduate, there has already been evidence of his travel, activities involved etc. And most important of all, we oppose those instance whereby ISA detained politicians claiming they are of danger to the society without evidence or charge. I believe that even if a politician is communist influenced or leftist/rightist, he should be allowed to speak and critise the govt freely and not seen as a threat to the community. No politician will want to harm his country's people, they only will want the better for them. And FYI, that law grad is facing a charge.</div>

Ok why not I try again to give you some real idea of what is happening.<br>ISA is an act where people can be detained indefinitely if one is found to be of a threat to the society. yes threat and what kind of threat should be liable for such indefinite detention? I don't think any form of threat with only an empty accusation qualifies for such indefinite detention.<br>There has to be a TRIAL, CHARGE by a proper jurisdiction and not by a few peanuts working in ISD and a minister whom decides whether the detention is to be extended anot. Understand???<br>ISA is just an act, some people suggests that it be removed and replaced  with a better act, some others want a change in the act will do. It's because the majority of Singapore do not know its adverse effects and the individuals it had wronged and harmed, that the majority of Singaporeans feel yes the ISA is good, it simply wipes out almost all possible threats and having a few of our Singaporean's 'lifes' sacrficed is OK.</div>

Anyway hloc, its a pleasure to have views from people like you who oppose the removal of ISA. It makes us think more critically too!<br><br>Anyway, what I hope the govt will make a change is to rewrite the act so that detention ain't indefinite. Maybe cap it at at most a year, put him under close watch by undercovers while not interfering his life with his family. This, he has a chance to proof his innocence, and if he really is involved in certain abominable activities, the ISD will be able to even trace and find out more, get to the roots and clear the pests.<br><br>Yeah saying all this is easy and makes sense, but to carry them out is difficile. A team should be set up to revise the act asap before more innocents are lost and which also provide a chance for the guilty to flee.</div>
