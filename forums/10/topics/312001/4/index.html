              <p>You know, when I hear talk about "no political showmanship and what not crap", I seriously wonder why everything that we demand of the our government is construed as that. Now, would someone tell me, that our damn fucking government has never tried political showmanship, however fucking incompetent many of the idiot ministers are? Then comes the "we should not be bickering among ourselves" euphemism which simply means "Shut the fuck up and don't argue with me". Really, can these be even considered valid arguments? If the idiots continue on with the notion of unity, I'm going to laugh. This country was never founded on the notion of unity. It was founded on the prinicple of cut throat competition which our government joyously termed as "meritocracy". We see elements of this cut-throat competition in every policy we have, from the lack of a real safety net, to a government's refusal to offer real welfare etc. etc. And people wonder why we have no civil spirit. Yeah, like it wasn't obvious enough to anyone.</p>
              <p>Now, on to the subject matter at hand. Let's be frank. When a screwup of this variety happened, any punishment met out will obviously stop somewhere. The ones on top are going to feign ignorance to protect their butts. No investigation, at least involving anything with the PAP's fingerprints, is going to go as far as say that there was systematic problems in the oversight, even if it does exist. So they obviously find the the obvious scapegoats, and don't bother to go up further and check why no one was reviewing the practices of the scapegoats, and why no action was taken if they were known. If the answer is "they have better and more important things to do" then obviously someone needs a course on management and responsibility.</p>

              specific duties. It had been the hallmark of our government of
              putting only qualified people for the job so as not to waste
              taxpayers money, and not just some Tom, dick and harry from

              <p>Qualification my ass. The issue is not qualification, but instead who was looking over the fucker's shoulder. If the moron looking over the shoulder and monitoring the work didn't do his damn job, then the guy looking over the shoulder should also get his ass kicked.And yes, it should go all the way to the top if found that the CEO didn't do his job making sure that a culture of best practices was maintained.</p>

              <p>So much so till the People are complaining of Qualified FTs
              taking over our jobs. Now the govt is in a tight spot

              blame. Support qualified outsiders, they get blamed. Their
              solution now is to adopt flexible education style - selection of
              courses and upgrading of courses that best suit market
              opportunities in the next few years to help our locals.</p>

              trained for the job?</p>
              <p>Most people are hire because they had been qualified for the
              job, and thus solely responsible for it. They cannot shirk that
              responsibility by pushing it upwards if management had already
              approved their appointments, not by fortune telling, but by paper
              qualifications.</p>

              <p>False dilemma. Substantiate why you would say there would be no unqualified persons who can take up the jobs. Are our universities incapable of producing the persons trained for the jobs in question? If yes, why is it so? If no, then is it the issue of too many persons? If not enough people want to take the jobs in question, why wasn't more effort done to attract them?</p>

              <p>again, it seems that you have to make this statement "wake
              you up to your failings" even though all the failings were from you. This is a behaviour that Gazelle and clones has constantly exhibit.</p>
              <p>Grats that you finally understood what you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> And great that you have woken up to your pathetic self. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I will take it as you have been thrashed (in your words) since you cannot answer to any of the above claims. From now on, we shall all refer to you as a person who is a lunatic, an illogical hypocrite, and a failure in both school and society. Thanks for telling us that.</p>

              <p>First you compare about soldier's private lives with that of guards on duty (under the jurisdiction of the military).</p>
              <p>Then you compare torture of prisoners of wars with crashing of missle corvette and guards on duty. Here you are talking about a Minister in charge of the entire operations of the Home Affairs Ministry, who was incompetent that he cannot forsee a lapse in security with the toilet windows. The Singapore ISD guards were performing duty as required of them, not going against the standard operating procedure (SOP). The US scenario was that of soldiers going against proper standard operating procedure (SOP), that's why the soldiers were at fault. There is a difference between system wide incompetence and abuse by individuals.</p>
              <p>Systems are set by people from the top, whereas abuse by individual is folks from the lower ranks going against systems set by folks from the top.</p>

              <p>You open up new issues when you lose in your current argument. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If I answer this, you will bring up more cases, any end to this? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>First you compare about soldier's private lives with that of guards on duty (under the jurisdiction of the military).</p>
              <p>Then you compare torture of prisoners of wars with crashing of missle corvette and guards on duty. Here you are talking about a Minister in charge of the entire operations of the Home Affairs Ministry, who was incompetent that he cannot forsee a lapse in security with the toilet windows. The Singapore ISD guards were performing duty as required of them, not going against the standard operating procedure (SOP). The US scenario was that of soldiers going against proper standard operating procedure (SOP), that's why the soldiers were at fault. There is a difference between system wide incompetence and abuse by individuals.</p>
              <p>Systems are set by people from the top, whereas abuse by individual is folks from the lower ranks going against systems set by folks from the top.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't think I want to argue with you Gazelle, you have the habit of opening up new issues when you lose with your current points. There will be no end to this, I have better things to do than to entertain your TROLL fixation. Very soon you will be putting words into my mouth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's case is incompetence from the top who implemented the system, the junior officers were just following procedures set by the top, there was no abuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US case was where the servicemen go against the procedures set by the top and decide to do things themselves, there was abuse of proper procedures.</p>

              <p>The Fearless class is the 2nd class. The 1st class is the.....I forgot what, but it is a patrol vessel minus the ASW capabilities.</p>
              <p>And what larger corvette? The only ones we have are the Victory class from late 80s.</p>
              <p>And what does firing the fella do to aid investigations and prevent further accidents from happening? Accountability, yes. Fire, why not? But how can you suka suka just fire the top brass just because of an accident?</p>
              <p>If we're gonna take just this case and fire the guy, I can guarantee you, you'll be having super turn-over rates.</p>

              <p>Whatever Class of vessel - whether Missile Gun Boat, Gun Boat, Patrol Vessel, or simply Corvettes - you will have to make up your mind before any sensible discussion can take place; as matters stand you are much too late to re-kindle a dead issue.</p>
              <p>Was it a ''suka-suka'' matter in firing the Defense Minister and the Chief of Navy by the Japanese Government ?</p>
              <p>We can only assume that the Japanese Government had felt it necessary to ensure that the buck stops at the highest level, so as to instill discipline and respect in the Navy.</p>
              <p>Similarly, we have seen the US Secretary of Defense receiving the approval - from the US President and the Congressional Committee for Defense - to fire the Secretary to the Air Force and the Chief of the US Air Force for two serious violations that revealed the breakdown in the operational standards of the US Air Force in not following clear and established guidelines in handling nuclear weapons and devices.</p>
              <p>If Singapore is to instill a similar high standard of best practices so as to achieve the high operational high standards of a motivated and disciplined SAF, then it must start from the basic point of Accountability and Responsibility.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, do you think that there is already a high turnover rate in the General Staff, with the CDF not holding his post longer then 4 years, and with him retiring thereafter, with no further relationship in the SAF ?</p>
              <p>The high turnover rate with a new CDF every four years, is due more to a lack of trust in having a Military Man getting too strong in his seat and become a challenge to the Civil Administrator. .</p>
              <p>So far, only the CDF is in the limelight, and there are other senior officers in the General Staff that has seen a high rate of turnover at MINDEF - all done under the guise of self-renewal.</p>
