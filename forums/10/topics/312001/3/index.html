              <p class="first">A Western Australian court has ordered the parents of two teenagers to pay compensation to the victims of their children's crimes.</p>
              <p>The ruling is believed to be an Australian legal first.</p>
              <p>The parents have been ordered to pay a total of $60,000 to the owners of two properties in Kalgoorlie-Boulder.</p>
              <p>Their teenage sons set fire to the houses in June last year, causing about $400,000 in damage. One of the homes had to be demolished.</p>
              <p>An application for compensation was initially rejected but after an appeal to the full court, the president of the Children's Court today ruled that the parents should pay a total of $60,000 to the owners and residents.</p>
              <p>In his decision, Judge Denis Reynolds said the parents had generally been responsible in the years around the time of the arson attacks.</p>
              <p>But he said they had failed to adequately supervise their children, who were using amphetamines and cannabis and drinking alcohol.</p>

              <p>Anyone who suggest that the Chief of Navy had no part to play in the job fails to see that it is the Chief of Navy's duty to ensure that the force stay professional and to constantly review practices and ensure they are followed. Otherwise, the admiral isn't doing his bloody job, and he should be fired. The CINCPAC Admiral in the US navy also suffered for a string of problems involving US Navy warships in the Pacific. It is the duty of the navy admiral to ensure that his captains do their duty and if they don't, then something is wrong.</p>
              <p>Any damn idiot who suggest otherwise is suggesting that the admiral of the fleet has no responsibility over his captains, and thus is absolved of any failings in the instruction of his men.</p>
              <p>And someone apparently forgot, that within that same year, there was a collision between a navy vessel Endurance and a merchant ship. Yeah, same reason again; ensigns at the helm.</p>

We have no need to 'ape' any country for each society is different and have different laws, from other nations, for their countrymen to suit their national needs. But the thing is, these are not related to current Singapore laws on juveniles  or soon to be enacted laws. My question is: </p>

              <p>Anyone who suggest that the Chief of Navy had no part to play in the job fails to see that it is the Chief of Navy's duty to ensure that the force stay professional and to constantly review practices and ensure they are followed. Otherwise, the admiral isn't doing his bloody job, and he should be fired. The CINCPAC Admiral in the US navy also suffered for a string of problems involving US Navy warships in the Pacific. It is the duty of the navy admiral to ensure that his captains do their duty and if they don't, then something is wrong.</p>
              <p>Any damn idiot who suggest otherwise is suggesting that the admiral of the fleet has no responsibility over his captains, and thus is absolved of any failings in the instruction of his men.</p>
              <p>And someone apparently forgot, that within that same year, there was a collision between a navy vessel Endurance and a merchant ship. Yeah, same reason again; ensigns at the helm.</p>
