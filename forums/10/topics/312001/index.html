              <p>In typical Japanese culture of accountability and responsibility, the Japanese Defense Minister and the Chief of the Japanese Navy were fired from their posts for the two accidents involving the Aegis Destroyers - {one with a Japanese fishing vessel that killed two fishermen, and the other at the port of HoChiMinh City}. [See this Saturday's Straits Times, 22 March 2008, Front Section Page 12].</p>
              <p>Despite MM LKY's publicly declared admiration to the Japanese culture of the Top Management taking direct responsibility for the misdemeanours of their subordinates, he does not believe that it applies to the Singapore Government nor to the Politics practised by his Political Party.</p>

              <p>The present Mas Selamat Kastari scandal is typical politics practised by the Ruling Party, where the Minister of Home Affairs is not held personally accountable for the on-going events that followed the escape of MSK.</p>
              <p>Instead, the Singapore Media is employed to write up articles about MSK background, and propagate the supposedly sophisticated computerise data that log all unused or empty buildings that are either abandoned or under construction.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Defense Minister and the Singapore Navy Chief remained safe and dry, and protected from the events that followed the naval accident between a Singapore Navy Missile Gun Boat with a Maersk Line Commercial Vessel - which resulted in the death of four Singapore Women Naval Personnel.</p>
              <p>This is Singapore's culture of accountability - the buck stops at the level that is responsible for causing the event.</p>

              <p><br>You are correct in that the RSS Courageous was an anti-submarine patrol vessel.</p>
              <p>The RSS Courageous was the first batch of the Fearless Class of Patrol Vessel, and according to information from Singapore Technologies - the second batch of the Fearless Class was supposed to be a Missile Patrol Boats.</p>
              <p>These Missile Patrol Boats were superceded by a larger class of Missile Corvettes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, types of vessels aside, the moral standards of accountability is shamefully deficient in a Ruling Political Party when it will not place the same standard of measure on themselves, but will dare to preach to the Leadership of an Alternative Party - by holding it responsible for the administrative failings of its subordinate over a piece of paper.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, probably they will find some scapegoat in the navy to sack. Then they tell you that the Minister of Defence and Navy Chief is not responsible for the work of their juniors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>This is part of living under a dictatorial regime, the family members of the ruling elites are often spared punishment for their incompetence.</p>

              <p>Who is to be responsible? The junior staff? What's to prevent this from happening?</p>
              <p>The salary you get paid goes with the responsibility you bear, it's funny being paid afew millions (5-6 times the salary of President Bush), but you don't have to bear the responsibility.</p>
              <p>Investment bankers get paid millions, if one of their junior staff is incompetent, forgets to process a sell order, the bank ends up losing billions of dollars. Who is responsible? The junior staff who is being paid $2,000 a month; or the banker who is paid millions? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans don't think objectively, most of them get brainwashed by P4P propaganda in the newspaper and tv.</p>
