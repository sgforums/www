But alot of us, many of us in fact, are just stuck here mainly lacking in funds to do so along with little or no talents.<br><br>This is one major way Singapore is losing local talents; through ever increasing emigration numbers.<br><br>And true enough, in the past, one week before National Day I can see a lot of flags outside HDB flat windows - today, I only see a few scattered flags hung by endearingly faithful and loyal citizens - they might even be PRs....<br><br>Ideas?
