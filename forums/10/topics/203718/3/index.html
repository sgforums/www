There is a preconception that any product endorsed by a caucasian model will be much better received by consumers compared to an Asian.<br><br>Such products will give the masses here in Asia that it is superior, better quality, higher-end.<br><br>Take a look at the recent launch of properties commercials and prints. How many features asian compared to caucasians? In my memory, only one.

With the amount they are paid, small wonder they are able to pay more which in turn, pushes up the property prices which in turn, makes it all the more difficult of Singaporeans to get a roof over our heads.<br><br>Look at the posters and prints in magazines.

Yet its the opposite if a caucasians is used.

Even the clients there endorse such a perception. I've had chinese clients saying they want to use a caucasian just because they are white which will automatically sell better than an asian who will not give that superior effect regardless of the product to be promoted.<br><br>And here the Chinese are talking about China pride.

Personally, I think of IT because many Indians are good in IT. I also think of their wonderfully spicy and delicious food that they serve. Equally, when I think of Americans, I remember Hollywood and their many fantastic movies since time began, along with their many ground-breaking discoveries and inventions in the name of science and technologies. But when I think of China, I can only recall the dreaded SARS that brought our SIA almost to its knees! China may be huge and ancient, but they're entirely NEW to PROSPERITY. Which means, many lessons ahead of them. First lesson to learn - HUMILITY!<br><br>Now you tell me, what reputes a RACE? Can I now ask you what comes to your mind when I ask you to think of an Iraqi or any middle eastern individual?<br><br>In my opinion, a Race is known for what they're good in producing in commercial and industrial terms as well as what they have all these while been related to and in what international news that's read about them.<br><br>Comparatively, our western counterparts are far more advanced in social skills and manners, and this is very much in part to the education system they were brought up in, the society they are living in, and the kind of GOVERNMENT that governed them. Creativity is allowed to flourish thus.<br><br>One word sums it all up - IMAGE.<br>No, actually TWO words sums things up - IMAGE &amp; ENVIRONMENT.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with your point on Image and enviroment. The image that westerners are better are everywhere in both people and media. And Singapore is one such enviroment that promotes this thinking.<br><br>I think Asians are slowly losing their unique individual and cultural identities as a result of this. People should see that racial identities for what they are. Unique and individualistic.<br><br>What works for westeners shouldn't be taken as the norm for the rest of the world. Asia in particular.<br><br>But alot of of people has this mindset in my industry. I believe for most consumers as well.<br><br></div>
