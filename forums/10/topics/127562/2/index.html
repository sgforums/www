Should death penalty be applied only to the professional hardcore smugglers and sydicate masters (we should try our very best to crack the sydicate or get to the master) while the unwittingly involved due to sheer financial straits only penalised by life sentence at the most.<br><br>The lawmakers should try to review both: (1) Death Sentence for recalcitrants (Non-recalcitrant -  reduced to life akin to manslaughter for less than murder)<br><br>(2) Review the definition of serious or hard drugs attracting death penalty to exclude less dangerous types based on new research medical evidences.<br><br>I look forward to all comments and contributions from all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The law must be applied fairly to all, regardless of circumstances. I have sympathy for the two boys but I feel the law must run its course.<br><br>However, I do agree that there appears to be a hint of leniency given to the 'elite classes' in recent cases. If that is true, it is abhorent. Whether capital punishment for any crime should have a place in a civilized society is a matter for debate but I have the impression that Singaporeans are generally in favour of it. Unless we have a free and open debate (which is not quite possible in Singapore), we can never be sure.<br><br>What is lacking, however, is investigation into the social reasons behind drug offences. The government seems to think they have discharged their responsibility by successfully prosecuting a drug pusher and sentencing him to death. But what about preventing the disadvantaged children of the criminal from growing up to become criminals themselves? Will the down and out of society beget their own in a vicious cycle? Perhaps we have focused too much on the elite and have become myopic to those that have fallen by the wayside.</div>

This poor local Indian smuggle drugs not because for his pleasure but because he has had no choice.<br><br>Yes smuggling drugs is bad and always be bad. But we must be smart about it and evaluate one case on a case-by-case basis. I'd feel two things:<br><br>1) Make the system equal. if you wanna execute the death penalty, then apply to both locals and expats, ignoring the poor/rich status of that offender. No double standards shd be applied.<br><br>2) Evaluate a drug smuggling case on a case-by-case basis and then set a fair sentence once he's found to be gulity. In which case, these 14 yr old teens will still have a father- albeit one that is gonna be in jail for a long time.<br><br>Whereas, local and foreign drug smugglers who are found to be smuggling for sheer profit and pleasure will be executed after a free and fair trial where the defendants will have access to their lawyers.</div>

Drug traffickers are human too, and they should be accorded basic rights no matter their crime.<br><br>I am not surprised if the majority of the lower segments of the economy are unaware of the mandatory death sentence: their concerns would be making ends meet, not scrutinising the newspapers for articles of any "applicable drug laws".<br><br>I say that at the very least, the death penalty should be made [B]non-mandatory[/B] for drug trafficking: the offender's rationale should be as important as their intention.

Nathan has rejected an appeal to save the life of a convicted drug smuggler at the centre of a renewed campaign to abolish the death penalty here, the prisoner's lawyer said Tuesday, April 26.<br><br>Shanmugam Murugesu, 38, a former star athlete who was convicted of trying to import 1029.8 grams (36 ounces) of cannabis, is expected to be hanged at Changi Prison in three weeks' time, his lawyer, M. Ravi, said.<br><br>"I just got a letter from the Istana (the presidential office) dated April 22nd," Ravi told AFP.<br><br>The letter said that the president "after due consideration of the petition and on the advice of the cabinet had decided that the sentence of death should stand," according to Ravi.<br><br>Murugesu, who was arrested at a checkpoint while coming from Malaysia on August 29, 2003, was convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court in April last year.<br><br>Civil rights activists in Singapore are using Murugesu's case to mount a renewed campaign to abolish the death penalty in the affluent island-republic, where voices of dissent against the government are rarely heard.<br><br>Human rights group Amnesty International in a report last year singled out Singapore for executing more people than any other country relative to its population and renewed calls for it to abolish the death penalty.<br><br>Sinapan Samydorai, executive director of the Think Centre civil rights group, said there were currently eight other people on death row in Singapore.<br><br>In their appeal, the activists had highlighted the fact that Murugesu had served in the armed forces for eight years and represented the country in the 1995 World Championship Jetski Finals in the United States.<br><br>On the advice of Murugesu's lawyer, his twin sons, now aged 14 and living with their grandmother, had gone on a public campaign to save their father by distributing leaflets calling on people to write directly to the president.</div>

No double standards shd be applied.<br><br>2) Evaluate a drug smuggling case on a case-by-case basis and then set a fair sentence once he's found to be gulity.
