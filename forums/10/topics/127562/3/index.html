Thus anyone with more than the stipulated amount is assumed to be trafficking, with no exceptions allowed.</div></blockquote>sure, they are in excess of what a drug addict can possibly consume at one go, but not in how much a drug addict can hoard or save for self-consumption.<br><br>That is the loophole in a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking law. It does not seek to discover the intention for possessing the large quantities of drugs, which sometimes might not even be present, as in the case of the HK tourists who had heroin smuggled into their luggage at HK Airport, and henceforth the risk of sentencing an innocent is extremely high, as in innocent in desire to traffick drugs. In fact, the intention is ASSUMED, which is the greatest violation of Rule of Law, in that a suspect is innocent till proven guilty: in thsi case the suspect is taken to be guilty immediately, a gross miscarriage of justice.<br><br>Remember, quantitative measures can never be fully qualitative.<br><br>the deliberative pikamaster</div>
