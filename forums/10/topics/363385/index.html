              <h1>Petition drive HIJACKED by SPH and Mediacorp journalists!!!</h1>
              <p><span class="time">June 6, 2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>From The Field Report Team</strong></p>
              <p>[NOTE: The CNA report (read <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4034">here</a> ) that there <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">were less than 20 signatures</span></strong> collected is <strong>INACCURATE.</strong> There were <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">56 signatures</span></strong> collected for the petition to remove Lee Bee Wah as STTA President and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">37 signatures</span></strong> for the petition to DPM Teo Chee Hean to give the special award to Liu
              Guodong. The turnout will definitely be greater had not for the huge
              media presence at the booth.]</p>
              <p>It was supposed to be a low key event with an expected turnout of
              less than 100. Even so, it did not stop SPH and Mediacorp journalists,
              complete with a TV crew to turn up in force at the first outreach event
              organized by this blog and its axillaries.</p>
              <p>Our three freelancers were absolutely stunned by the presence of the
              media which kept hounding them from the very moment they were spotted -
              they were descended upon and literally ‘devoured’ by a pack of ‘hungry
              wolves’.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/gallery/honglim060609/honglimlbh02.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="425"></p>
              <p>In spite telling them that they were only paid to do a job, they
              were bombarded repeatedly with questions about the identities of the
              organizers, pestered to reveal their particulars and stopped from
              manning the booth.</p>
              <p>With the journalists filming their every single movement and taking
              photos of them without permission, they had to walk away from the booth
              instead of stationing themselves there as was planned.</p>
              <p>When one of our freelancers told them straight off to stop it, a
              lady journalist rebuked that “Hong Lim Park is a public place and they
              have no right to stop her from following them.”</p>
              <p>Harrassed, flustered and traumatized by the relentless stalking of
              these journalists, two of them left after 15 minutes. Another was
              recalled elsewhere to keep watch on the booth at a distance.</p>
              <p>Though our petition booth was unmanned subsequently, members of the
              public and Singaporeans who heard about it from the internet still
              turned up to sign on it. A few of them were interviewed by the
              journalists who were unwittingly manning the booth on our behalfs.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/gallery/honglim060609/honglimlbh05.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="425"></p>
              <p>The event ended at 6.30pm sharp with the journalists still hanging
              around the booth. It was really an eye-opener for the two of us who
              were dancing with the Pinoy rock band nearby. We would have thought
              that Singapore journalists are better behaved compared to their Western
              counterparts. It turned out that they are no different from the
              paparrazi.</p>
              <p>Our freelancers are not some super stars. They are simply students
              being paid to do a job. We had made an announcement here earlier that
              no Wayang Party columnists will be present and our temporary staff are
              not obliged to answer any questions other than those pertaining to the
              petition.</p>
              <p>What special scoop will these journalists gain by snapping at them
              non-stop with their cameras? Can’t they just do what was required of
              them without causing disruption to the event?</p>
              <p>Despite the low turnout, our petition has achieved its primary
              objective of heaping continued pressure on Lee Bee Wah to resign as
              STTA President and keeping the issue alive in public consciousness
              through the mainstream media.</p>
              <p>Till now, Lee Bee Wah has not come out to clarify her statements on
              Liu Guodong. She must be praying hard that Singaporeans will soon
              forget about her mistake. Unfortunately, she will be stirring MORE
              public FURORE and OUTRAGE in the weeks ahead………</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p><em>We apologize for the unexpected turn of events which had thrown
              our freelancers off guard. All three of them were newbies who were
              overwhelmed by the occasion. We had refrained from using seasoned old
              birds in this event as they are still needed as our undercover
              reporters. We thank all Wayang Party readers and Singaporeans for
              turning up to lend support to our petition drive. Though the turnout is
              less than expected due to the huge media presence which may have turned
              some people away, it is nevertheless a small, positive step forward. In
              the future, we will organize all events INDOORS at hotel function
              rooms. All journalists will be BANNED from entry to prevent a
              recurrence of this unfortunate episode.</em></p>

              <p>Thanks for the posting.</p>
              <p>Through this posting, it made me and my fellow citizens more aware of certain things. They are:-</p>
              <p>1. The 'wayangparty' team dares to be vocal only behind the computer screen, but do not have the guts to face the public even in a neutral ground for signing of a simple petition, in such a place as Hong Lim Park. Despite all their high flaunting criticisms, they dare not make a stand in open and neutral ground.</p>
              <p>2. Despite their calls for freedom, they disgustingly wish to enfore a 'BAN' on journalist, whom are citizens of this free country as well, from turning up. Why the double standards. talking in fork tongue? Where is their credibility? Or is it as usual, plain hot air?</p>
              <p>3. More despicable, and for that alone, I despise them to the core of my heart - the use of innocent students - to fulfill their political aims. This is  an absolutely  abominable and beastly thing to do. SPARE THE NAIVE KIDS, WILL YA, YOU F*KING BUNCH OF REVOLTING BASTARDS!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems we as a society still have a long way towards political maturity. Anyone who seeks for petitions would welcome the press, regardless if the report is later good or badly written, for it is the AWARENESS that is to be created that is most vital. Politicians woo the press, but it seems the opposition would have to buck up on their public relations if they ever aspire to 'uplift' the lives of our society, not thru hot air but real peaceful and intelligent actions.</p>
              <p>As it is, wayangparty and its contributors had only shown themselves vile and sleazy, the very kind of politicians not welcome in our society. Perhaps they should try instead to write for porn sites or apply for jobs as pimps from CID.</p>
              <p> PS: was that senior looking man in the pic the famous you, Uncle Chia?</p>

              <p>You call manipulating innocents kids by paying them money to do something which by right should be the job of those sleazeball whiners is 'building a democratic society'?</p>
              <p>Uncle Chia, you really test my patience, more so when you use kids for your mad propaganda. Please, I beg you, leave them out. Kid do not choose the kindergartens to go to, amongst many in our land of the brave and the free.</p>
              <p>Wanna blame, go blame the parents. Furthermore, that sacred pledge vowed and taught is to our nation - our society which is made up of you, me, our families, relatives and friends. Please, please, do not tar it and smear it. It is an honourable pledge that rise beyond politics.</p>
              <p>If you want to perform sacriledge or hell bent on destruction, do it to yourself and not to others whom are innocent. Is there nothing that is sacred to you? Have you no care for our society at all, espacially our young? </p>
