When that speech came out, the people I know who had left Singapore were pissing themselves laughing - it only served to reinforce their belief that leaving Singapore was the right thing to do.  The unfortunate bottom line is that the "quitters and stayers" framework was an extremely childish way of viewing the situation - imagine a government saying "fine - I don't want to play with you either!".<br><br>Before we answer the question "Are you proud to be Singaporean", we first need to define exactly what "a Singaporean" is.  Some may see it as being resourceful and hardworking, while others may focus upon the kiasu side of things.  Obviously, the answer would come out differently in each of these cases.<br><br>After ten years overseas, I don't know if your question could be answered with a simple "yes" or "no".<br><br>There are certainly advantages to being Singaporean.  As fraught as it is with flaws, the education system has served me well.  Then again, coming from SJI, where we influenced by Irish and Australian brothers, I suspect that my education was more cosmopolitan than that in government schools.  National service is a concept that I certainly support - being in countries without national service, it becomes apparent that Singaporeans are more resilient than people in other countries.  Without a social welfare system (at least until recently), Singaporeans are more independent.<br><br>That said, Singaporeans do have their shortcomings.  The average Singaporean could certainly stand to be more socially and politically aware.  Singaporeans also tend to be excessively conservative, and in being unwilling to explore and experiment, they do not make the most of their potantial.  The "keeping up with the Joneses" mentality typical of the kiasu Singaporean has also done a lot of harm - by using other people as a benchmark, Singaporeans tend to be somewhat misdirected in their personal development.</div>
