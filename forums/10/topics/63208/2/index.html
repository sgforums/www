            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose the fact that Singapore has its own water supply could be a source of national pride, but it is negated by the fact that most other countries have it too... Since pride is derived from having something UNIQUE that others don't have... like power.<br><br><blockquote><strong>My point being; what more can be done to further this nationalistic sentiment and walk toward a more progressive society?<br>What makes you proud? </strong></blockquote>Maybe what you people need is an empire, I know they are old fashioned, but have an empire like what America is doing. I am sure with American backing, Singapore could invade surrounding Muslim provinces, since the fashionable popular limited/fickle American view now is anti-Muslim (terrorist-stereotyping). Using a plea similar to Taiwan's anti-communist stance. Singapore could "maintain itself as the last bastion of american/christian/democratic way of life blah blah blah". I am sure a person as thick as Bush would back this endeavor.<br><br>However, such an invasion is immoral and insane, which is just a thought. The wheels are always turning in my head.<br><br><blockquote><strong>dun be too sure abt that<br><br>but sometimes i think abt staying behind and i get the feeling i'm the one who lost out<br>not the "quitters"</strong></blockquote>Oh yes ofcourse. The quitters used the system, which is like a ranger course for studying, the quitters suckled and learned discipline and hardwork at a higher level. Thus when they go to the more liberal Western countries, they find it easier, and thus they excel.<br><br>Anything is better than being boxed up on a island.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Does this flag belong to the common Singaporeans ?<br><br>No Singaporean is allowed to display the Singapore Flag unless specifically allowed by the Government through its weekly gazzette.<br><br>The Singapore Law does not allow any Singaporean to display the flag on its premises unless on specific occassions allowed by the Law.<br><br>The flag belongs to the Singapore Government.<br><br>Unlike other countries that allow their Citizens to proudly raise the Flag of their Country each morning, and lower it each evening, this opportunity is not allowed to common Singaporeans to express our pride in the country within our private properties.<br><br>In some establishments - Government and Civilian - the Singapore Flag remains flying all day and all night, and treated like some simple advertisement material.<br><br>Visit Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 2, and you will see the disrespect given to the Singapore Flag that remain fluttering at night.<br><br>Drive around Singapore to see the Flag fluttering at the flag poles all day and night - at the properties of industries and commercial buildings.<br><br>Why are the Citizens allowe to display its pride in the Flag, only during the 15 days before and after National Day ?<br><br>Is the Flag not suppose to be the property and pride of ALL SINGAPOREANS ? </strong></blockquote>Hear hear, I agree. But if the law is amended that its ok. Does that mean myself and any outlander will be shot if he hoists a Singapore flag?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Before we answer the question "Are you proud to be Singaporean", we first need to define exactly what "a Singaporean" is</strong></blockquote>[quote]<br><br>There is no proper definition for Singaporean now, well actually there never was, since SEA has an affinity for mixed populations. SEA and Singapore is like your rojak or salad bowl. You can try and compare yourself with Switzerland but its not the same. The point is this: I doubt being a Singaporean means anything by definition because of the diversity in this country. Perhaps it could mean: Being part of a larger united whole; which does sound very flash and patriotic.</div>
