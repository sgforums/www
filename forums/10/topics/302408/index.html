            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bridge drama<br>Ansley Ng</strong><br><br>THE Benjamin Sheares Bridge was the scene of a massive traffic jam last evening as police patrol boats and an amphibious vehicle stood by in the waters below.<br>.<br>The reason for the spectacle? A woman sitting on the railing and refusing to budge from her position for nearly two hours.<br>.<br>The police closed a lane and set up a cordon of a few hundred metres along the footpath on the bridge as officers moved in to talk her into coming down.<br>.<br>The unidentified woman, in her early 50s, had climbed onto the railing on the side of the road towards Changi Airport shortly before 5.45pm.<br>.<br>The sight of her Â— barefooted and clad in a yellow T-shirt and cream-coloured Capri pants Â— dangerously perched on the railing also attracted a large crowd of onlookers 35m below at the Kallang River bank behind the Costa Rhu condominium.<br>.<br>Eyewitnesses said she was gesturing furiously several times. A group of people canoeing in the Kallang Basin returned to shore after spotting the woman.<br>.<br>Patrol boats from the Police Coast Guard and an amphibious vehicle from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) were on standby in the river basin.<br>.<br>The two-hour standoff resulted in a massive traffic jam that extended to Keppel Bridge on the Ayer Rajah Expressway.<br>.<br>At about 8pm, the woman relented. Taking the hand of a police officer, she climbed over the railing and was immediately pulled to safety by SCDF officers from the Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team.<br>.<br>A police spokesman said the woman has been arrested for attempted suicide.<br></div>
