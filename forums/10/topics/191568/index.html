            <div class='col-md body'>It looks like Singaporeans have no real love for community self-help projects likely to be seen as opposing to the government.<br><br>Two reasons why government has no objection to such Potong Pasir and Hougang Upgrading fund 2006:-<br><br>(1) Government has always tried to avoid creating a welfare state and wanted people to be self-reliant. So the fund is one small step towards making people more self-reliant<br><br>(2) Senior Minister Mr. Goh Chok Tong has indirectly by telling residents of PP and HG that they do not expect the government to give them priority in estate upgrading if they do not vote for the ruling party that they better raise their own fund to do so.<br><br>So from a greater perspective, the fund is not anti-government and has been indirectly approved by the government in principle.<br><br>So I really don't see why people are fighting shy of helping to kick off such a fund. Or do they want the help of some international human right organization to plead for their cause they themselves being too afraid to do so?<br><br></div>
