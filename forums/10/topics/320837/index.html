                    Nair, former Singaporean, now United States citizen, has been charged with
                    another count of insulting a judge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">This makes two. Last week, he was charged with insulting Judge Belinda
                    Ang through an email allegedly sent by him in late May 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>

              <td width="480" align="left" valign="top">
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The new charge is really curious, relating as it does to an
                    alleged email that is more than 2 years old. Said to be dated 17 March
                    2006, the judge involved was named as Lai Siu Chiu. Court documents quoted
                    this sentence from the email: "The reason why (Lai) and her fellow
                    judges punish and silence PAP critics is because judges are well paid and
                    have comfortable lives."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><img style="border-style: solid; border-color: #ffffff;" src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2008/pic-895a.jpg" border="10" alt="" width="150" height="200" align="right">Nair
                    (photo right), in a hastily called press conference said that while he had been
                    shown an email by the investigating officers, he does not know whether it
                    was written by him or not. "I don't have access to my computer,"
                    he pointed out. His notebook had been seized by the police at the time he
                    was first arrested, on or around 31 May. "My password is there"
                    on the computer, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">At this stage, I don't intend to discuss this case. Facts are too
                    scanty. Instead, what I'd like to provide readers with is a description of
                    the press conference itself -- the story behind the story, as it were. How
                    was the news that you'd read about the next day generated? Does it cost money to set up a press conference? How
                    difficult is it for a private individual to get his story into the media?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <br> I heard about the press conference when a reporter with whom I was
                    scheduled to have lunch today called a little after 12 noon. She apologised
                    profusely for having to cancel at the very last minute. "Gopalan
                    Nair's calling at press conference at 2:30 pm," she explained.
                    "He was given a second charge this morning."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">However, since I had the time set aside for her anyway, I
                    figured I might as
                    well make my way to the same press conference.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">"Where is it?" I asked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">"No. 23 Peck Seah Street. It's a coffeeshop."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When I got there about 2:20, I saw a small scrum of reporters sitting
                    on stools sipping iced tea waiting for the show to begin. Straits Times,
                    Today, Reuters, Channel NewsAsia and two more at least, were represented.
                    There were photographers and video cameramen too. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2008/pic-895b.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="360"><br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #808080; font-size: x-small;"><em>Waiting....</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">  <br> It being warm and humid, I ordered a
                    cold drink and sat to chat with the rest, alternating between what a reporter's
                    life was like and ministers' statements pertaining to Gopalan Nair and Singapore
                    Democratic Party (SDP) leaders. Naturally, what we said to each other must
                    remain private, though I can say that there was a general air of levity
                    and some gracious sharing of information.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Around 2:45, Nair, accompanied by his lawyer Chia Ti Lik and some
                    supporters, arrived. They noticed us, but sat apart for a little while to
                    complete whatever discussion they had ongoing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Then they moved to a table near where we were and the press conference
                    began. Chia provided some context through opening remarks about the
                    morning's court proceedings and the additional charge.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2008/pic-895c.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="360"><br> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #808080; font-size: x-small;">Lawyer Chia Ti Lik (white
                    shirt) providing some opening remarks</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <br> Thereafter, Nair read from a prepared statement, which you can see
                    <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/news/gopalans-press-statement.pdf"> here</a> on
                    the SDP website.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">As you can see, he defended his right to post articles on his blog
                    regarding his observations of Singapore, particularly the recent trials
                    (26 – 28 May 2008) involving SDP leaders Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok
                    Chin:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">In the US where I come from, the judiciary just as any other government
                    or official body is open to criticism and they accept it as necessary for
                    the advancement and improvement of the administration of justice.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Referring to his blog postings,</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">As to the events that occurred during the 3 days in court, it is an
                    accurate observation which I have stated under my right as a free man.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">However,</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">It was never my intention to malign or cause distress to anyone and if
                    the words that I had used had this effect, I withdraw them and apologize.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The reporters present would later ask him to clarify this point.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">He repeated his critical observations of the court proceedings:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">During the High Court hearing, I found Judge Belinda Ang to be
                    completely unfair and prejudicial to the interests of Dr. Chee, Chee Siok
                    Chin and the SDP. Almost every question put by Dr. Chee, Chee Siok Chin
                    and Ravi on behalf of the SDP were disallowed and each and every question
                    put up by the lawyer for Lee Kuan Yew and his son were invariably allowed.
                    Almost every objection raised by the lawyer for Lee Kuan Yew was
                    sustained, keeping in mind that the lawyer for Lee Kuan Yew and son,
                    objected to almost every question that Dr. Chee and company raised.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">To state plainly, Dr. Chee and his company was denied the right to
                    cross-examine the Plaintiffs in any meaningful way. In fact we could go
                    even further and say that he and Siok Chin were denied the right to
                    cross-examine Lee and Son almost entirely. In fact if Dr. Chee managed to
                    put any questions to Lee and Son, it was over the refusal of Judge Belinda
                    Ang to allow the questions, so much so that Judge Belinda Ang had to
                    repeatedly prevent Dr. Chee and Siok Chin from conducting any meaningful
                    cross examination.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">As most readers would know, Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin were
                    subsequently jailed for contempt of court, the judge having found that
                    they disobeyed her orders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Nair's first charge related to an email he allegedly sent, that was
                    considered insulting to Belinda Ang. However, he denies sending any such
                    email. "I did not send to Belinda Ang or anyone else any email, as
                    far as this incident is concerned," he reiterated later.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">After reading his prepared statement, Nair took questions from the
                    reporters present. At that point, I put down my camera and started taking
                    notes. I will provide you, by way of example, three questions the reporters posed
                    -–
                    they posed many more -- and Nair's answers, to give readers a feel of the
                    kinds of questions that followed.</span></p>

                    apology?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Nair's reply was, "I only said if I used words somewhat more
                    stinging than they should have been, I apologise. Perhaps I could have
                    used more temperate language. I'm not apologising for the contents of my
                    blog." He also added that it was only gentlemanly to offer an apology
                    for harsh words.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Yawning Bread's observation: Which words
                    exactly was he apologising for? He couldn't possibly be apologising for
                    anything in the alleged email sent to Belinda Ang since he denies sending
                    it. As for words in his blog, he has not been charged for anything written
                    there, thus it's rather beside the point. So far, at least. But was this apology
                    intended to fend off a possible defamation suit over the words he used
                    in his blog? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">One of the reporters present must have
                    thought so too, for a little later, he asked, </span></p>

                              problematic is the condition "while such public servant is
                              sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding". How sitting
                              is sitting? Must he be physically in court? What if the insult
                              was hurled during the evening when the case, while ongoing, was
                              adjourned, and the judge
                              himself was at the cinema? What if the insult
                              was over a case unrelated to the ongoing case, say six months
                              after the issue had been decided?</span></span></p>

                              intended to be construed narrowly, meaning such outbursts, swear
                              words, snide remarks or other disruptive behaviour in court, say
                              from people in the public gallery, and not to shield judges and
                              prosecutors from criticism about the way they discharge their
                              duties.</span></span></p>

                    prepared statement</em></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <br> The entire press conference
                    took less than 45 minutes. After that, I sat chatting with Chia Ti Lik for
                    15- 30 minutes more, during which time, he received a call from the
                    prosecutor. I'm told the latter expressed some displeasure that Gopalan
                    Nair had gone to the media so quickly within hours of being charged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Why would the prosecutor be unhappy? I
                    can only speculate. One possibility is that once Gopalan Nair has
                    publicised the second charge, it becomes extremely difficult for the
                    government to withdraw the charge without looking weak. But if the
                    prosecution case is not yet watertight, it puts them in a fix.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Another possibility is that by acting so
                    quickly, and with technology compressing lead times for stories to get
                    out, the government has to rush to ensure that its spin is integrated into
                    the media story. Nair might have been seen as trying to preempt the official statement from the
                    government. Then again, it may make no difference, at least not for the
                    local media, for editors may wait till the government's side of the story
                    is received..</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">On the right is Reuters' version of the
                    story about the press conference, issued before the working day was over.
                    That was the only report I could find this same evening.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The local media had no mention of Nair's
                    press conference in any of their online "latest news" or "breaking
                    news" sections. Channel NewsAsia's website had a brief story about
                    the morning court hearing, but not about the afternoon's press conference or Nair's
                    statement. Unfortunately, I was far from any television set in the
                    evening, so I couldn't monitor the TV news.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">With this background, it would be interesting to see what comes
                    out in the Straits Times and Today on Friday, 13 June 2008. <img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/images/bar_red.gif" border="0" alt="" width="4" height="12" align="bottom"></span></p>
