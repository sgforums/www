              <div class="post-header" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;"></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore state controlled newspaper the Straits times online edition of Oct 9, 2010, has the story "Commonwealth Games 2010. Gold for Singapore Paddlers"( for those who are unfamiliar with Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, a silly sounding local patois, Paddlers means Ping Pong players).<br><br>The report reads "Singapore's paddlers began their gold rush in emphatic style last night, crushing India 3-0 to claim their third straight woman's title". <br><br>But let me tell you, this report is a blatant shameless lie.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Actually Singaporean sportswomen never took part at all in this match.</span></strong> It was in fact a match between Peoples Republic of China sportswomen who played this table tennis match against the Indian team and the Chinese side won 3-0. <br><br>Confused? Let me explain. The so called "Singapore players" in this match were Feng Tianwei, Wang Yuegu and Li Jiawei. These 3 were all born in the Peoples Republic of China, not Singapore, and were until a few months ago, citizens of the Peoples Republic of China. Until a few months ago, they had nothing to do with Singapore and had never even heard of such a place. <br><br>They were all trained in China, a country that produces the world's best table tennis players, trained professionally as is the fashion in China from a tender age, and since their teenage years, had already reached world class standard, just as every other sportsman and woman in their country. <br><br>Singapore on the other hand does not have any sportsmen or women of any class, let alone world class. <br><br>Singaporeans have never won any medals in any sporting events and even if they ever did, it probably would have been in chess, or some other sport which does not need much physical exertion. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans are by and large a weak effete people, lacking spontaneity or creativity, who live in fear under a dictatorship of Lee Kuan Yew. </span></strong></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Their entire lives are consumed with how to make a living and keeping clear of the wrath of the Singapore strongman Lee Kuan Yew who can have you arrested anytime he wants, as there is no rule of law. <br><br>What the one party state Singapore government under Lee Kuan Yew has done in this case is this. Just a few months ago they went to China and literally "bought" world class Chinese players, that is, by paying each of these 3 women millions of dollars to come to Singapore where they are given instant Singapore citizenship, after which they are sent to the Commonwealth Games in India to compete as "Singapore" sportsmen and women.<br><br>The article reports of the Chinese sportswomen (or Singaporean which Singapore wants you to believe) having defeated the Indian player Mouma Das. Mouma Das by the way is truly Indian. India does not engage in the dirty business of "buying" sportsmen or women from China or anywhere else. India has more pride than that. <br><br>And the disgrace of the Republic of Singapore in this shameful deceit is even worse because they deliberately get Chinese from China to fool the world, since both Chinese from China or Singapore are both ethnic Chinese and therefore look alike. People are therefore more likely to be fooled into believing the Chinese from China are Singaporean. Imagine the opposite if India had gone to China and similarly "purchased" world class players, no one would believe they were Indian! <br><br>Singapore never won any sports medals and never will. Singapore island, a place fast declining in population, in morale, in economy and a growing disgruntled population realizes they have to resort increasingly to deception and lies to keep the country going. Only yesterday, there was another false report claiming they were the 4th richest country in the world, when the truth is, they have a few millionaires and the rest of the country live in poverty or just above it. <br><br>There was another report in the same disgraceful paper that the Singapore table tennis team (paddlers in Singlish, a stupid concoction of various local dialects spoken in a sing song effeminate style) beat the English team. Of course they did. The English table tennis team is no match for PRC Chinese team, and we all know that. The so-called Singapore team too were in effect professional Chinese players recently "purchased" from China. The English team on the other hand was truly English, as they too are not in the habit of parading foreign sportsmen and women under British colors. They too like the Indians have more pride than that. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The moral of the story is that even if the Indian team and the English team lost to the "Singapore team" , I mean the Peoples Republic of China team, at least the they had some honor in their defeat. Singapore on the other hand has none; no shame whatsoever. </span></strong><br><br>Only a disgraceful country behaves the way Singapore does. I am not surprised there are no jubilant celebrations on the Singapore streets over these "victories". Singaporeans too known these shameless desperate acts of their 88 year old leader Lee Kuan Yew, who is going to kick the bucket any minute. <br><br>And by the way, had not Singapore bought over these Chinese trained Chinese nationals to play for Singapore, they would not otherwise been able to play in the Commonwealth Games at all. Peoples Republic of China is not a Commonwealth country. <br><br>And if I would guess the sequel to this disgraceful episode, these Chinese nationals would thank their Singapore patrons very much for the millions of dollars, fling these stupid medals and their Singapore passports in the nearest garbage, and say goodbye to Singapore once and for all, heading back to China with a few millions dollars of Singapore tax payers money in their pockets. All they wanted was the money. They would care two hoots for Lee Kuan Yew or his small little island.<br><br>If I recall, that was exactly what another Chinese woman ping pong player did not too long ago. <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em></div>

              <p>Surprise, surprise, a man or an old man of your status and ilteracy do not understand the meaning of globlisation and interconnectivity.</p>
              <p>I understand, it is alway nice to sit somewhere in a warm US of A evening, on a comfort armchair with a six pack cans of budwiser and wrote whatever you like about Singapore, which is out of the jurisdiction of singapore.  </p>
              <p>The ironic here is, no one give a damn to someone who have no guts to face what he said here, not even a gal down here in joo chiat.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and condemn singapore as much as you hate, cos your hatre shall be with you forever. The only thing i can said bad about singapore court is that they let you go too easily.</p>

              <p>aiya, again compare, taiwan is a totally different condition and picture, we are homogenous society facing a tight strait relation with china up above. As for sport, we prefer those recreation/leisure sports like bowling, snooker and our own village sport like ridng on buffalo, or ah mah walking on stick competition etc etc. Moreover, we certain got more people than Singapore, so we can have a big array of people to choose from, I see taiwan also cannot match singapore, we are not good in football, people dun craze over football like here, but one thing we certainly can win over Singapore, that is we are more nice looking, both men and women.</p>

              <p>Back to topic, Singaporeans need to learn a bit from Taiwanese, concentrate on sports that their citizens are passionate about and nurture it, instead of going for quick fixes just to get that hollow gold.</p>
