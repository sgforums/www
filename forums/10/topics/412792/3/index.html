              <p>Erm, at least it's a free state. You can freely speak what you want and people debate over it. Can you do that in Singapore? I have to agree with you on Singapore's sports culture, unfortunately, our govt only looks at the short term gains, instead of cultivating sports that Singaporeans are passionate about. It is just so "manufactured".</p>

              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; line-height: 1.3em;"></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br> <br> Singapore state controlled newspaper the Straits times online
              edition of Oct 9, 2010, has the story "Commonwealth Games 2010.
              Gold for Singapore Paddlers"( for those who are unfamiliar with
              Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, a silly sounding local
              patois, Paddlers means Ping Pong players).<br> <br> The report reads "Singapore's paddlers began their gold rush in
              emphatic style last night, crushing India 3-0 to claim their third
              straight woman's title". <br> <br> But let me tell you, this report is a blatant shameless lie.
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Actually
              Singaporean sportswomen never took part at all in this
              match.</span></strong> It was in fact a match between Peoples
              Republic of China sportswomen who played this table tennis match
              against the Indian team and the Chinese side won 3-0. <br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; line-height: 1.3em;">Confused? Let me explain. The so called "Singapore players" in this
              match were Feng Tianwei, Wang Yuegu and Li Jiawei. These 3 were all
              born in the Peoples Republic of China, not Singapore, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and were
              until a few months ago, citizens of the Peoples Republic of China.
              Until a few months ago, they had nothing to do with Singapore and
              had never even heard of such a place. </span><br></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; line-height: 1.3em;">They were all trained in China, a country that produces the world's
              best table tennis players, trained professionally as is the fashion
              in China from a tender age, and since their teenage years, had
              already reached world class standard, just as every other sportsman
              and woman in their country. <br> <br> Singapore on the other hand does not have any sportsmen or women of
              any class, let alone world class. <br> <br> Singaporeans have never won any medals in any sporting events and
              even if they ever did, it probably would have been in chess, or
              some other sport which does not need much physical
              exertion. <br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans are
              by and large a weak effete people, lacking spontaneity or
              creativity, who live in fear under a dictatorship of Lee Kuan
              Yew.</span></strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; line-height: 1.3em;">Their entire lives are consumed with how to make a living and
              keeping clear of the wrath of the Singapore strongman Lee Kuan Yew
              who can have you arrested anytime he wants, as there is no rule of
              law. <br> <br> What the one party state Singapore government under Lee Kuan Yew
              has done in this case is this. Just a few months ago they went to
              China and literally "bought" world class Chinese players, that is,
              by paying each of these 3 women millions of dollars to come to
              Singapore where they are given instant Singapore citizenship, after
              which they are sent to the Commonwealth Games in India to compete
              as "Singapore" sportsmen and women.<br> <br> The article reports of the Chinese sportswomen (or Singaporean
              which Singapore wants you to believe) having defeated the Indian
              player Mouma Das. Mouma Das by the way is truly Indian. India does
              not engage in the dirty business of "buying" sportsmen or women
              from China or anywhere else. India has more pride than
              that. <br> <br> And the disgrace of the Republic of Singapore in this shameful
              deceit is even worse because they deliberately get Chinese from
              China to fool the world, since both Chinese from China or Singapore
              are both ethnic Chinese and therefore look alike. People are
              therefore more likely to be fooled into believing the Chinese from
              China are Singaporean. Imagine the opposite if India had gone to
              China and similarly "purchased" world class players, no one would
              believe they were Indian! <br> <br> Singapore never won any sports medals and never will. Singapore
              island, a place fast declining in population, in morale, in economy
              and a growing disgruntled population realizes they have to resort
              increasingly to deception and lies to keep the country going. Only
              yesterday, there was another false report claiming they were the
              4th richest country in the world, when the truth is, they have a
              few millionaires and the rest of the country live in poverty or
              just above it. <br> <br> There was another report in the same disgraceful paper that the
              Singapore table tennis team (paddlers in Singlish, a stupid
              concoction of various local dialects spoken in a sing song
              effeminate style) beat the English team. Of course they did. The
              English table tennis team is no match for PRC Chinese team, and we
              all know that. The so-called Singapore team too were in effect
              professional Chinese players recently "purchased" from China. The
              English team on the other hand was truly English, as they too are
              not in the habit of parading foreign sportsmen and women under
              British colors. They too like the Indians have more pride than
              that. <br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The moral of the
              story is that even if the Indian team and the English team lost to
              the "Singapore team" , I mean the Peoples Republic of China team,
              at least the they had some honor in their defeat. Singapore on the
              other hand has none; no shame
              whatsoever. </span></strong><br> <br> Only a disgraceful country behaves the way Singapore does. I am not
              surprised there are no jubilant celebrations on the Singapore
              streets over these "victories". Singaporeans too known these
              shameless desperate acts of their 88 year old leader Lee Kuan Yew,
              who is going to kick the bucket any minute. <br> <br> And by the way, had not Singapore bought over these Chinese trained
              Chinese nationals to play for Singapore, they would not otherwise
              been able to play in the Commonwealth Games at all. Peoples
              Republic of China is not a Commonwealth country. <br> <br> And if I would guess the sequel to this disgraceful episode, these
              Chinese nationals would thank their Singapore patrons very much for
              the millions of dollars, fling these stupid medals and their
              Singapore passports in the nearest garbage, and say goodbye to
              Singapore once and for all, heading back to China with a few
              millions dollars of Singapore tax payers money in their pockets.
              All they wanted was the money. They would care two hoots for Lee
              Kuan Yew or his small little island.<br> <br> If I recall, that was exactly what another Chinese woman ping pong
              player did not too long ago. <br> <br> <em>Gopalan Nair</em></div>

              <p>A very fair statement. First of all, don't put gold on our face and think we are world class.  If you base on the commonwealth result, Malaysia got more world class than us. Besides,a few good players who made it to the top does not meant the sport is popular in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Firstly, I respect opinions and to a certain extent, websites like TR which gives an alternative views. What I do not like is irrelevance and opportunistic criticisms. The article was about 'buying' athletes. Fine, concentrate on that topic, why did Mr Nair have to include a paragraph like this:</p>
              <p>"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans are
                                      by and large a weak effete people, lacking spontaneity or
                                      creativity, who live in fear under a dictatorship of Lee Kuan
                                      Yew.</span></strong> Their
                                      entire lives are consumed with how to make a living and keeping
                                      clear of the wrath of the Singapore strongman Lee Kuan Yew who can
                                      have you arrested anytime he wants, as there is no rule of
                                      law. "</p>
              <p>I do not think that has any relevance to the issue of citizenship and buying athletes. At best, it is a weak attempt to criticise the government in whatever ways. Blame the government for every single thing. I fear that this does not convince me that the government is bad, I am sure that the ruling party has alot of things I am unhappy about, but the more such kind of articles with no objectivity and including irrelevant criticisms, the more I do not see a future for the opposition. Concentrate on why the opposition is good for us instead of harping on why PAP is bad for us.</p>

              <p>Actually, you can't blame them for importing so many foreigners to represent the country in sports.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's sort of an ego thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Singapore first gained independence, everything was geared towards economic success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was hard wired into Singaporeans that nothing else mattered, only economic survival - sports was just something you did after work if you could be bothered. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fast forward to present times, when they saw that you could gain more exposure and recognition by winning medals in international sports, they wanted to make a name for Singapore (one can argue, for themselves).  However, with the "economic survival first" mindset already ingrained fiercely into the minds of young and old Singaporeans alike, they had no choice but to entice foreigners who were willing to train full time and represent Singapore on the world sports stage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One can argue that it was just another economic transaction.  I give you money, you achieve something in the sporting arena for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just like in other aspects of life in Singapore - everything is like an economic transaction. There is no such thing as pride, passion and loyalty anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right from the day you are born to the day you die - it's all about the money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what can you do for "Singapore"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
