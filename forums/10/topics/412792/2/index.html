              <p>in taiwan, fighting makes frens, it is a different culture, you see those peoples fighting at bar or pub or parliament, later they become good buddies, unlike singapore, fight until die, the hatre still never let go, still keep inside for life, really pity Singaporeans. Never learn to let go, so emotional in everything, lucky most of us taiwanese go for nunnery class and learn more about life, i think singapore should start doing it, otherwise i see most, rich or poor, living in a stressful and alway dissatisfy life.</p>
