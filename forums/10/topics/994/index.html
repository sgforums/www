            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder since when does the 1st lesbian ever found.But i know that Gays aren't far from now.I think everyone  should know a little  bit of China History that during the Emperor Dynasty time servants are to be castrate in order to become servant in palace.From then onwards,i think there is where the source of gays from.<br>But flash back to this century or millellium i shall say Lesbians and Gays are so common in our life.While in the past their acts are regards as shamless and disgraceful thing for their ancestor. Are we improving in our sense of minds or just turning back (side tracking our thoughts)<br>I had seen lot of Lesbians.Some well dress up.I wonder why 1 have to dress up to become male and other as female.Why donn they find a real man in actual fact?They think that by tighting up their breast,smoke ,wear like a man ,act like a man they can imagine themself as truly man!I donn think the needs of doing so many things to convice people that they can do the same as real man!<br>I had seen Lesbian doing some thing extra---<br>enter a Gent.That quite a comical scene!I remember my frenz and i went to this toliet and see 2 lesbian inside.At 1st we tok we enter the wrong loo.But then we double check and went in.But the lesbian ignored our presence.Relive they are not using the loo they are just washing their face.But the cleaner inside the Gent keep on staring at them.The xpression of this cleaner was very entertaining like the show Under one Roof act by Richard Ng,really look like him man!<br>Thinking and looking at them my frenz wonder how they are going to use the loo in the presence of the cleaner who keep on staring at time.The whole scence look weird...<br>Some of them their girl friend are dammn chio man! i must really hand in to these HUA MULAN.<br>---------------------------------------------<br>And as for gays.I saw even more when going out.The gays are sometime alone or in groups.<br>Some of them are very exagerated they make up their face 2 red spots,putting lot of power dresssing like FAnn WONG.There is even one i will not forget 1.Can u imagine a BIg fellow guy dresss like singapore is a winter time.ALL those furly clothes got spots one,go coffeshop and eat their lunch!I really must hand in to their courage of enduring the heats of singapore. Some of the gays are really huge big fellow like those we saw on Tv WWF,wreslter.But too bad they act like sissy.There goes their image of Aronld or vammm dammn.<br>These are some of the views.I hope that u all can join in and speak up your stand.Stand leh buay steady la 4 your rights,<br>and sit down to relax 4 your minds.That all i have to say....hope to hear from u ...soon<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest MIKEN80... in my opnion, you are quite an idiot. No kidding.<br><br>Homosexuality goes beyond ancient China my dear boy, and more than just your retarded 'servant of the emperor' crap... if you have read up on the history of the ancient world, you will have found out that homosexuality is prevailent in ancient Rome and Greece, possibly even Eygpt.<br><br>Homosexuality has always been a part of human existence despite the fact that some people may deny it.<br><br>The acts of Gays and Lesbians i'm sure, does not concern you. It is not shameful, neither is it disgraceful to our ancestors because since homosexuality goes back a long way into the past, our ancestors could have been homosexuals themselves.<br>It is not fair for you to condemn the acts of these homosexuals anyway. What makes you so sure that you haven't done something considered 'shameful' anyway? It is not right for anyone to judge anyone.<br>MIKEN80, you seem to be living in the time of ancient China to me... this is the 21th century if i may remind you. If you think of the oppression and discrimination these human beings, who are homosexuals have suffered throughout the ages, it should come clear to you that these people have suffered under the likes of ignorant people and homophobes for a very long time. I believe it is time to allow these people to live their lives the way they want it.<br><br>Oh yes, about the 'Gays' and 'Lesbians' you have seen dressing up in clothes of the opposite gender,has it occured to you that you have labled them wrongly? There is a condition known as Gender Dysphoria, where the Gender of the person, conflicts with the Sex of the person. Perhaps this might be the one of the answers to your 'cross-dressers'<br><br></div>
