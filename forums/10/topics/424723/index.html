              </p><p>i don't think MM need to stand corrected for the comments when it wasn't targetted at islam but the minority of malays.he didn't target at religion.i'm in my 30s &amp; i ever come across a minority of malays that stick only to malays.i totally agree with him that few years ago there were malays that mixed more with their own race.thus the book he wrote wasn't entirely misinterpreted which was written 2years back.</p>
              <p>it all depends on which area or what group of people one mixed during that period of time &amp; where he experienced it.why are those ministers from muslim states or even locally so touchy about what MM wrote?so as to 'bring him down' literally?why put a founding father of singapore who has done great things for singaporeans down just for the comment he made?he only commented what he experienced.</p>
              <p>i would comment what i experienced too.i believe any of you will comment thru your own experiences &amp; not thru the eyes of another person.he has done so much for singapore.but just for this one comment,people start to give their own criticism based on their own views.have any of you lived thru what MM lived thru?have any of you lived at the same area as MM?have any of you 'seen' thru life/experience?</p>
              <p>have the ministers in other countries lived in singapore around the area where MM lived &amp; experienced &amp; mixed with exactly the same group of malays as MM?they can't be speaking for ALL malays in their own countries or any other countries or even in singapore where they don't live here at all.every humans have different characters, way &amp; standard of living.for the one thing MM commented,he was criticized.</p>
              <p>then for the great things he did in/for singapore,do all singaporeans appreciate to respect his comments?NONE can be like him that has build up singapore like what he did &amp; still doing.so,for goodness sake,move on.......... and give him all the support.</p>

              <p>In fact. when a student of confucius criticizing students of prophet mohammad, there is nothing improper for students of prophet mohammad to feel emotionally sadden and retort againt it. Although both Confucius and Propher Mohammad revealed inherent peace, love and equality of mankind <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> Besides, it is very diffcult for Muslim leader of other countries to build everlasting common peace and trust amongst Malay and its minority.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>personally, this is one of the very few issue i agree with MM. just ask ourselves, how many other races friends do you really hang out with. i am supporter of respect of other religion culture, at the sametime we had to admit there are differences in the way we think and live. we can really only live in harmony when we truely learnt and understand our differences. tolerate, respect can last a long way then purely shooting down a person who dare to talk the truth.  by the way, MM is the only person who dare to say, but no one dare to touch him.</p></div>
