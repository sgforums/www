            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><strong><span class="large">Have policy to protect rights of older workers</span> </strong><br><br><strong>Sat, Jul 28, 2007<br>The Straits Times  </strong><br><br>IN THE article, 'When ladies' night isn't for all ladies' (ST, July 11), Dr Andy Ho discussed the marginalising effects of age and gender discrimination.<br><br>Dr Ho suggested that older women who are discriminated against could perhaps contest the issue in the courts. His article made me wonder whether the rights of older adults are protected by our laws.<br><br>Currently, 7 per cent of Singapore's population is over the age of 65 and, by 2030, this will increase to 19 per cent.<br><br>Additionally, Singapore has one of the fastest-growing ageing populations in Asia.<br><br>There is psychological research which shows that those who are 65 and above perceive they have lower status than those who are middle-aged, and they are more likely to perceive age discrimination directed against them.<br><br>Research has also shown age consistently plays a negative role in hiring decisions and evaluation of older adults' work performance.<br><br>Because of these reasons, policies relating to age discrimination in the workplace should be addressed.<br><br>Currently, there are no legal protections or policies in place that prevent discrimination from taking place in workplaces, for example, employers giving preferential treatment to younger job applicants, giving more promotion opportunities to younger people in the organisation while letting the older adults languish in the system, laying off disproportionately more older and more experienced workers or conferring full-time status on younger part-time employees over older part-time employees who have worked in the organisation for many years.<br><br>It is a known and unfortunate fact that older adults experience and accept age discrimination in work settings.<br><br>While I acknowledge the contribution of the Government in providing infrastructure and a commerce-friendly environment for big businesses to thrive, we should take into account the rights of the people who in their prime contributed to the prosperity of these corporations.<br><br>I would like to propose that the authorities consider a comprehensive policy which protects the rights of older workers.<br><br>Perhaps a commission or national committee comprising human-resource officers, chief executive officers, social workers, conflict-mediation specialists and policymakers should be set up to discuss how we could address age-related discrimination in the workplace. Protecting the rights of older adults is the hallmark of a civil society.<br><br>Dr Adrian John Kok Chung Ming<br><br>Readers' Comments:<br>==================================================<br>/-/<br>Is was the HR practioners problem...they need to practised what he are doing now, otherwise they will be out of job...<br>The HR alway compliant of the problem they faced with older workers....so the can get the young and inexperience workers then the HR can easiely 'control them''<br><br>and made thier job easier..<br><br>-/-<br>Also another problem is this PAP government who allowed unlimited cheaper supply of labour from the ''entire world supply''<br><br>Most of the counties will ''protect'' their own ciziten as the first prority when come to employement...SG don't protect it voter/it employees...just compare the numbers of foreigner that work in singapore to actual jobless (employable up to 62) singaporean (who also voted the PAP government)<br>Posted by: New Wave at Sat Jul 28 17:18:34 SGT 2007<br><br>-/-<br>[QUOTE=chieftain;68659]The govt wants to extend the retirement age while the reality is how many businesses &amp; orgs are willing to keep or hire workers older than 40? It just doesn't make sense.<br><br>Just turn the TV on or read the magazines &amp; we're inundated with 'youth worshipping' culture &amp; environment just like in the West. As someone remarked, when you hit 40, better be able to hang on to yr job or career bec you certainly Do Not want to look for a job at this age range as you're more or less marked as 'over the hill.' That's the unpleasant harsh reality.[/QUOTE]<br><br>-/-<br>Its just alot of lip service.<br>If they really want to lead by example.<br>The civil service should take the lead<br>followed by the GLC ( state owned enterprise).<br>Then the rest of the people can see .....<br>Posted by: loyaltosingapore at Sat Jul 28 14:51:13 SGT 2007<br><br></div>
