              Education System Not Helping 
              ---------------------------- 
               
              <a id="par9" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/02/07SINGAPORE394.html#par9">Â¶</a>9. (C) Singapore boasts a highly competitive and 
              well-regarded primary and secondary education system, but the 
              number of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is 
              relatively low.  Only 23 percent of Singaporean students 
              entering primary school complete a degree at a local 
              four-year university.  In other knowledge-economies such as 
              Japan's, around 50 percent of students complete a university 
              degree.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant 
              Director of the Planning Division at the Ministry of 
              Education (MOE), the government does not plan to encourage 
              more students to get a higher education.  The university 
              enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at 20-25 
              percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need 
              everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted. </strong></span>
               
              <a id="par10" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/02/07SINGAPORE394.html#par10">Â¶</a>10. (SBU) <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's education system has been criticized 
              for being heavy on memorization and light on critical 
              thinking and creativity.</span></strong>  Based on the British model, the 
              system is highly test-focused and separates students (a 
              process referred to as "streaming") at an early age between 
              high, middle, and low achievers.  The GOS has slowly begun to 
              introduce greater flexibility into the system by allowing 
              "streaming" in subjects (rather than based on total average 
              scores) and has created new magnet schools focused on 
              mathematics, the arts, and sports.  But there are only three 
              such schools, and the overall education system has changed 
              little.

              <p>I think this policy took off in late 90s. There was a propaganda campaign at the time by PAP regime to push for people to enter poly and not JC. </p>
              <p>They wanted to restrict the number of people that can get into university.</p>
              <p>Flooding of Singapore with cheap foreign labour, the creation of a new class of aliens as citizens - all these are probably part of the diabolical master plan of the PAP.</p>

              <p>What's so regressive about this?</p>
              <p>If you are interested in learning, the SG system, while restrictive, also gives plenty of opportunities for you to do so (within the bounds of what the govt wants you to learn).</p>

              <p><br>Nice to meet you. My name is Chin Seng, I am the co-founder and moderator of <a href="/forums/2297">Homework Forum</a>. I quited my school about 9 months ago, and put in my soul and blood into my business. I agree with your sentiments and that is why I always believe every student have the potential.</p>
              <p>When I told my mum that I wanted to quit school, she supported my idea. I work hard and smart and proved to her that I can survive on my own and paper qualification does not mean everything.</p>

              <p>Ok fair enough, I see two schools of thought there. The factory mill and the development of full potential models.</p>
              <p>In singapore, many who can qualify for poly, can qualify for JC too. The poly grads, many have to go overseas for studies or take a private degree because they do not fall into the top 20% category to qualify for the local unis.</p>
              <p>Then I wonder, why penalise those able students who chose the poly experience and then give a place to really mediocre students from JC? Then answer all lies in pushing people into the economic pyramid as the easy way out. Very highly structured thinking system and hence the pool of candidates for the development of full potential becomes lesser.</p>

              <p>I have met quite a number of insurance and property agents in my life and it seems that many of those successful entreprenuerial ones came from a poly background. Would these people have made it big had they gone into civil service? No way because paper matters.</p>
              <p>Then begs the question, why are the govt limiting their pool of talents according to different levels? The degree holders one path and the poly dip holders (with private degree) another rung lower?</p>

              <p>1st para cannot like tat compare... Insurance and property are sales jobs, entreprenueres are business related... which u seldom see in civil service... if compare must use like (ehhh) accountant, finance, HR, PR etc etc...</p>

              <p>as for the discussion between DH and anes, both are the reason why I say this is an interesting topic...</p>
              <p>Do note the below, I use "Most" and do take note I did not include FTs in my point.</p>
              <p>1) Gov limiting potential to fill job markets... Most of everyone gets job, most jobs are filled, most of everyone happy... However most of everyone isn't fully developed (which I think is stupid, I'll explain why later)</p>
              <p>2) Gov not limiting potential... 80% degree holders, 20% others... Job market would be slightly chaotic, most degree holders will have problem finding jobs and will likely not take on jobs like call centre etc etc... then those jobs will have problem finding ppl to fill them (though by bringing FTs, they can resolve this problem but piority will have to go to singaporean first)... Most of everyone will be unhappy but potentially smarter... [we shldn't limit mankind ability just becoz of jobs market, we shldn't accomadate the job market but shld be the job market accomodate to mankind (which mankind created the job market)]</p>
              <p>From both the points above, most ppl will be happy in (1) and unhappy in (2)... So it's a choice of choosing doing popular thing or the right (IMO) thing... Besides, in this era/age of information and technologies, it's very hard to limit ppl's ability/potential...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I am puzzled about is, why is the government doing (1) but bringing FTs, which is usually a solution for (2)... It's like slapping their own face, which is a totally stupid course of action...</p>

              <p>LKY is actually indeed a visionary man. I wasn't really a supporter of LKY, but this policy is made me know him better.</p>
              <p>If I may argue, his 25% policy entry to Local University and to allow influx foreigner to study local university is thought to be</p>
              <p><strong>1) Avoid over-saturation of local degree holders (our market do not need so much)</strong></p>
              <p>It's true, our local economy do not need so many degree holders. It is also true that as an educator, it is our mission to help student reached their full potential. If Singapore is over-saturated with degree holders (like China), it will create a whole new sets of problems for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2) This supports that the rule and a report on hight turnover of foreigner &amp; only retained talented</strong></p>
              <p>Many students after serving their bond will go back to their country. This is done at our cost, we are the taxpayer, and we seek foreign students to come here to study and offer scholarship for them. However, we only retained extreme talented foreigners with good package.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3) Foreginer came to Singapore and study, and go back to their country.</strong></p>
              <p>The result of this - not to over-saturate the local market. Most foreigner will want to quickly finish the study, serve out their bond, and go back to their country. Most will not have the intention of getting citizenship in singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
              <p>We have a buffer system in place where by local degree holder are just 25% rate from PSLE - Bachelor. and a huge buffer in place. Buffer is good because it allows the govt to control/plan the economy well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>We can do it another way round. Grant higher percentage of local student to university. Encourage our citizen to be global citizen.</p>
