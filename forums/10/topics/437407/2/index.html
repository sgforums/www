              <p>Maybe the criticism in the U.S cable has merits:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore boasts a highly competitive and 
              well-regarded primary and secondary education system, but the 
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">number of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is 
              relatively low. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Only<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> 23</span></span></strong> percent of Singaporean students 
              entering primary school complete a degree at a local 
              four-year university.</p>
              <p>In <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">other knowledge-economies such as 
              Japan's, around 50 percent of students complete a university 
              degree. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant 
              Director of the Planning Division at the Ministry of 
              Education (MOE), the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> government does not plan to encourage 
              more students to get a higher education. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The university 
              enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at 20-25 
              percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need 
              everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted. 
               
              <a id="par10" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/02/07SINGAPORE394.html#par10">¶</a>10.</p>
              <p>(SBU) Singapore's<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> education system has been criticized 
              for being heavy on memorization and light on critical 
              thinking and creativity. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Based on the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> British model</span></span></strong>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the 
              system is highly test-focused</span></span></strong> and separates students (a 
              process referred to as "streaming") at an early age between 
              high, middle, and low achievers.</p>
              <p>The GOS has slowly begun to 
              introduce greater flexibility into the system by allowing 
              "streaming" in subjects (rather than based on total average 
              scores) and has created new magnet schools focused on 
              mathematics, the arts, and sports.</p>
              <p>But there are only three 
              such schools, and the overall education system has changed 
              little.</p>

              <p>One of the few unbiased remarks. fully agree.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Many people think only anti government remarks are independent and good remarks, but they hold the government responsible for teaching and inculcating independent and resourceful thinking.</p>
              <p>Civilization began when human being live together as a society and led by leaders abiding a set of rules that strive to achieve prosperity peace and harmony for the society. Respect must first be given to the elected leaders of the society, then we can discuss if the set of values continue to reflect our common values.</p>
              <p>and what is our common values? make more money? higher GDP? be no. 1 in the world? that is where the government is the problem!!!</p>

              <p>The education system of Singapore doesn't work because of the 'pro-girl sexism' I speak of.</p>
              <p>'Pro-girl sexism' = society forces males of all ages to treat a girl-child "better" than boy-child of the same age and provide this treatment solely on the basis on gender.</p>
              <p>"Better" = the following:</p>
              <p>1. More compassion<br> 2. More sympathy<br> 3. More respect<br> 4. More gentleness<br> 5. More easiness<br> 6. More empathy<br> 7. More cleanliness<br> 8. More protection<br> 9. More luxury<br> 10. More personal space<br> 11. More privacy<br> 12. More security<br> 13. More freedom<br> 14. More modesty<br> 15. More decency</p>
              <p>... along with *less* physical contact.</p>
              <p>This 'pro-girl sexism' causes sweet boys [like Chen] to suffer in the hands of bitter girls [like Xinyi] and evil men [like Xinyi's father]. Boys are too distressed to retain information they study and girls have way too pleasure on their hands. As a result, the average boy is in too much agony to be educated and the average girl is spoiled-rotten and excessively-protected [by macho men] to the point where she feels she doesn't need education.</p>
              <p>On average, the adult woman:<br> <br> 1. Is physically weaker than the adult man<br> 2. Is more emotional than the adult man<br> 3. Is better behaved than the adult man<br> 4. Is far more likely to be a victim of opposite-gender violence
                                              [e.g. violence may be sexual, domestic, or spousal abuse] than the
                                              adult man<br> 5. Can get or be pregnant whereas the adult man can't<br> 6. Is physically more delicate than the adult man</p>
              <p>Also, it is likely natural for a man to want to treat an adult
                                              woman partially over an adult man -- this is seen in many mammalian
                                              species. For example in many species of large mammals -- such as
                                              bison --, the adult males are rough with each other but tender with
                                              the adult females.</p>
              <p>Due to this, I believe males of all ages should treat adult women "better" than
                                              adult men. However, NO male -- of any age
                                              -- should *ever* be socially-mandated to treat girl-children better than
                                              boy-children because this will cause boys to develop an intense and
                                              life-long hatred for young girls and a hatred for the macho men who
                                              teach these boys to defer to girls. This sexism against boy
                                              children will likely cause boys to also despise society and it's
                                              irrational norms.</p>
              <p>In addition, science has already proven that average girl-child is NOT *innately*:</p>
              <p>1.
                      Weaker<br>2. More sensitive<br>3. More delicate
                      <br>4. Lower-IQed
                      <br>5. Slower
                      <br>6. Less energetic
                      <br>7. Less aggresive
                      <br>8. Less violent
                      <br>9. Less cold-hearted [or more hot-hearted]
                      <br>10. Less openly abusive to members of the opposite gender
                      <br>11. Less openly sexist against members of the opposite gender
                      <br>12. More tense
                      <br>13. More emotional
                      <br>14. Less emotionally-stable
                      <br>15. More compassionate
                      <br>16. More mature in personality</p>
              <p>... than the average boy-child of the same age.</p>
              <p>Boy = male under 18 years of age = child</p>
              <p>Girl = female under 18 years of age = child</p>
              <p>Woman = female who is 18 years of age or older = adult</p>
              <p>Man = male who is 18 years of age or older = adult</p>

              <p>I agree in principle with the notion of restricting the percentage of degree holders to 20-25% of the cohort.</p>
              <p>Look at Taiwan. Since they 'upgraded' their polytechnics into universities, almost everyone is a degree holder, resulting in over-employment, where there are limited jobs for all these graduates, which lead to many people being over-qualified for their job.</p>
              <p>Over-qualification is a waste of the country's resources, since it would be more productive for the country and these people to have their education meet the demands of the workplace. It would be hard, if not impractical, to do the other way, to create a workplace that meet the demands of education.</p>
              <p><br>In Singapore, if everyone is a degree holder, who will end up filling the junior, executive level?</p>
              <p>In a system where 90-100% of the cohort gets a degree, we will have to:</p>
              <p>1) Bring in massive number of foreign labour, junior workers to work under all these grads. We will end up with an overnight population boom, with 2,3 workers under each grad.</p>
              <p>2) become unproductive. since job is scarce, people in order to survive, will end up taking up lower-quality jobs. so you may end up with degree-holders working as drivers, as salesman etc. Why waste their time and our country's resources if we could not provide for a career to match their qualification.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, what im pissed is that our government has decided to self-bomb its logic, by allowing an influx of cheap foreign grads, who are displacing many of our non-grads, by virtue of a lower salary. so instead of observing the moral contract between the people and the Govt, where the people accepts a quota for degree placement in exchange for jobs for all, our non-grads are betrayed by the influx of more qualified foreign competitors.</p>

                              <p>Maybe the criticism in the U.S cable has merits:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore boasts a highly competitive and well-regarded primary
              and secondary education system, but the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">number
              of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is relatively
              low.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">23</span></span></strong> percent of Singaporean
              students entering primary school complete a degree at a local
              four-year university.</p>
              <p>In <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">other
              knowledge-economies such as Japan's, around 50 percent of students
              complete a university degree.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant Director of the
              Planning Division at the Ministry of Education (MOE), the
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">government does not plan to encourage more
              students to get a higher education.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The university enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at
              20-25 percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need
              everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted. <a href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/02/07SINGAPORE394.html#par10" rel="nofollow" style="color: #517781;">Â¶</a>10.</p>
              <p>(SBU) Singapore's <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">education system has been criticized for being
              heavy on memorization and light on critical thinking and
              creativity.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Based on the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">British
              model</span></span></strong>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the
              system is highly test-focused</span></span></strong> and separates
              students (a process referred to as "streaming") at an early age
              between high, middle, and low achievers.</p>
              <p>The GOS has slowly begun to introduce greater flexibility into
              the system by allowing "streaming" in subjects (rather than based
              on total average scores) and has created new magnet schools focused
              on mathematics, the arts, and sports.</p>
              <p>But there are only three such schools, and the overall education
              system has changed little.</p>

              Agree. except u guys are narrowing things down. u say US. i say look at their crap-hole of an edu-crap-cation system. they boast having the world's finest unis? 50-80% of ALL those universities are by foriegners. to date, the USA has the LOUSIEST public school system ever in the world. Overpaid teachers, horrible academic results, low grad output, i tell u, singapore's edu system may be hell, but given a choice btw US and singapore, unless i can afford a private school in US, i say i'd rather stick here. in US, join a public schoool, u have no future either, unless u wanna be a janitor? i'm not saying here's that great either. given a choice i'd rather fly the europe, where at least the public schooling systems are remotely decent.

              <p>Look...</p>
              <p>Everything bash PAP, w/o looking what's going on in developed world..</p>
              <p>Sometimes things has its merits... Look at say Japan, lots of uni grads, but can they find a job? Does it incur any form of taxpayers money for their degree?</p>
              <p>Then come back to local scene, seriously for some courses is the uni really teaching? Many times it's solely on self study. If that's the case, then seriously not everyone is suitable to pursue it.</p>
              <p>When clearly everyone has diff learning adapbility, it's rather used as a cover to bash the PAP for everything.</p>
              <p>Anyway, there's alrdy issue w/ the 4 year degree course structure. Students for some courses are alrdy getting overloaded in order to cover the syallabus within the stipulated 4 yrs...</p>
              <p>Anyway, the uni campus can't take in anymore ppl beyond a planned 5 yr course. It's alry stretched to its limit.</p>

              <p><br>exactly! As I have mentioned in other similar threads, Singapore is just not big enough to accomodate so many degree holders. China is already facing this problem.</p>

              <p>i think many singaporeans are frustrated with the govt to the point of being irrational.</p>
              <p>every policies has its good and bad points.  it cant satisfy everybody.</p>
              <p>there is no perfect govt.  there is no perfect country.</p>
              <p>if you compare the good to the bad singapore is still a good place to live.</p>
              <p>my point is tackle issues that genuinely needs to be corrected.  if we complaint too much on issues that are actually not bad it clouds the whole thing.</p>

              <p>Why not make it more valuable by imparting more skills be it via degree or diploma level.</p>
              <p>Whichever society would have diff level of people in order to get the society to be working. Need not guess how we got here in the first place, there wasn't many degree holders to begin with.</p>
