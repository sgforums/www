              <p><br>The syllabus incorporated into each courses (diploma and degree) are industrial based already. It teaches them the student the fundamental thories and a little hands on practice of the skills that they need.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's the perception of many elder and younger generation that a paper qualification is far more important than anything else. The paper qualification and materialism is also closely link. i.e. if you have a degree, you can get a good job.</p>
              <p>What many ppl failed to understand is that paper qualification doesn't have any meaning when you come out to work. It's just a piece of paper stating the education you've gone through. It does not state whether you are able to be creative and apply knowledge learned in school. The paper does not empowers you to add value to the company.</p>
              <p>What current generation kids need to know is to how to add values using the knowledge and skillset they've gained during the course of study.</p>

              <p>No, you dont speak for the majority of singaporean.</p>
              <p>While your concern about affordability of HDB for the next generation is worthy of attention and action, the majority of Singaporean are living in HDB NOW!</p>
              <p>so stay with your parents if you must! If you are the only child in the family, the HDB flat your parents live, where you were born and brought up would be yours, until the lease expire. And if your wife is also the only child, then in time to come, you have 2 HDB flats to inherit.</p>

              <p><br>Well, maybe I am wrong - things may not change that much afterall. Status quo may not be a bad thing afterall. But we living in a period of fastest technology change in history of mankind - changing faster and faster with time.<br> <br>I have read an interesting article about predicting future jobs or rather future job titles and description that are non existence now. Wonder anyone read that article before? </p>
              <p>This set me thinking about putting future things in perpective when things are actually setting in motion or about to set in motion.  </p>
