            <div class='col-md body'>I saw the news tonight, some students in Ngee Ann developed a system that is able to track both SMRT's and SBS's buses. The students also integrated the ability to track the buses into mobile phones. The students believe that they are able to install this system into the various bus stop in Singapore and let passengers know when the bus will come.<br><br>Sound like a great idea? Yes, of course it is, for the commuters.<br><br>This way, they can claim that they need money for the equipment they installed at the various bus stop islandwide and have another bus hike. Then, they need money to maintain these equipment. And they can also say that they have less space for advertisement, which reduce their revenue to cover their operation cost. Then all these factors add up to a fare hike.<br><br>Don't be mistaken, forumers. I'm not against the students' invention, in fact, I'm looking forward for it. I just don't want the commuters to use this invention as an excuse to introduce another round of fare hike.</div>

Call it uniquely Singapore.<br><br>This method was called technopreneurship in NTU, a marked difference from entrepreneurship.<br><br>That being said, there are some things that are indeed unnecessary to make a 'world-class transportation system' more efficient. Things such as TV mobile, a mediacorp concept, are totally unnecessary. It makes commuters wonders why SBS transit bothered to link up with Mediacorp on a fruitless exercise that does nothing to improve the efficiency of buses. One would think creature comforts such as this could be better spent elsewhere, like better and more spacious seats.<br><br>The Ngee Ann invention is not really new, but such a system does track the movement of buses and in all benefit, help SBS transit and SMRT to track the movement of their buses and analyse their response time. Such a monitoring system benefits both commuters and bus services.<br><br>One wonders why none of the 'brilliant' management staff of these transport companies pushed for such a system to be implemented. Perhaps they were worried they could not justify their price hike if the system showed gapping flaws in their bus schedules and route planning? That the PTC might forgo their price hike if bus frequencies were sorely lacking and brutally exposed by such a monitoring system?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have hearing about the complains abt the frequency of buses but come to think of it, there is nothing much SBS or SMRT can do.<br><br>imagine a single service has a frequency of 15 mins, and a trip duration of 2 hours, that would mean 9 buses on the road for 1 way, and 18 buses both directions. if u want to cut the frequency to say 7.5 mins, then rough maths would tell that they will have to input another 8 buses either way. And thats 16 extra buses just for 1 service.<br>The new buses cost nearly S$1m (more ex than a Ferrari), so to cut waiting time by half for half of the nearly 200 services in operation, that would mean they need to buy 100 x 16 x $1m. Thats just a rough estimate, yet to factor in cost of maintenence and space for parking the buses. And there are no guarantees that every trip will be full for the buses. thus its very highly unlikely they can improve much on the frequency. (we dun want to give them an excuse to increase bus fares again!)<br>A bus life is abt 15-20 years, doubt they can recoup that amount in that time too.<br><br>I know for a fact that SBST has a system that tracks their buses on the road nearly at real time using GPS but i think they have yet to fully implement it, so we can hope that frequency improves but more likely than not its going to be minor if the frequency does improves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... The government should raise ERP to such an extent so that drivers will switch to public transport. In that case, more people will take public transport, and the transport companies will have more revenue, and there will be less jams on the road due to less cars. Like that, the public transport companies are happy due to more revenue and they can invest on more buses, and the passengers are also happy due to smoother rides and increased frequency without more fare hikes. The extra money collected from ERP can also be given to transport companies to improve their services.<br><br>Bus fare hikes are no longer an excuse. People pay more to take buses, only to find themselves stuck in traffic jams thanks to thousands of cars with only 1 driver. If we can persuade 10 drivers to take buses, we can free up road space which is equivalent to 10 cars. But the problem is, bus fare hikes discourage these "single drivers" to switch to buses, so these "single drivers" continue to hog the roads and in the end, bus commuters are the one who suffer...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Until they do something about the serious overcrowding problem on trains and buses, there will be lots of drivers who want to but cannot make the switch to public transport. Let's face it, if you have things to carry (like a briefcase or bag plus laptop,  for example) how the fuck are you going to get on and exit the fucking overcrowded buses and trains? Or couples with kids? Buses and trains will be very dangerous for young kids when crowded. I think people only take public transport when they are unable to or unwilling to cough up the money for a car. Even when you're stuck in a jam at least you're enclosed in your own car, and not packed together with other sweaty and angry commuters. From a mental health and safety standpoint, our public transport really cannot make it. And that is why you have excess demand for taxis during peak hours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the previous 3 posts seems like this country is on the verge of breaking down.<br><br>this cannot, that cannot, because it'll lead to one problem after another.<br>tsk tsk...<br><br>it comes down to this blood sucking place and to accomodate that we have to get more people in onto this confined island until we see hdb flats everywhere even the view of ur windows are nothing but hdb flats.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>any reason for fare hike is possible.. the reason don't have to be valid as long as it is approved by the authorities. Why do they care about the commuters since this is a monopoly.</div>
