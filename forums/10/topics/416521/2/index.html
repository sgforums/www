              <h2 class="art-PostHeader"><a title="Permanent Link to Debunking the myth that Lee Kuan Yew “created” Singapore" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/09/27/mm-gets-top-coverage-in-ukraine-media/">Debunking the myth that Lee Kuan Yew “created” Singapore</a></h2>
              <p>Dear Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs,<br>  <br> I refer to the 24 
              Sept 2010 Straits Times report of the statements made by Mr Alexander 
              Gorin during the visit of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew to Ukraine.<br>  <br> Mr Gorin reportedly said that MM Lee is a thinker, philosopher and 
              practitioner who created a state and guided it from Third World to 
              First.  There are many misconceptions in his statement that needs 
              clarification.  Mr Gorin needs to understand that:<br>  <br> 1.  
              Singapore wasn’t created by MM Lee in 1965.  It was founded in 1819 by 
              Sir Stamford Raffles.  It was Raffles who saw the potential of our 
              strategic maritime location.  Raffles proved to be correct and Singapore
               quickly became an important international port of call which led to a 
              thriving entrepot trade.<br>  <br> 2.  Singapore has been thriving for 
              nearly 150 years before MM Lee took over in 1959.  Even at independence 
              in 1965, our per capita GDP was already the fourth highest in Asia 
              behind Japan, Hong Kong and Brunei.<br>  <br> 3.  Singapore joined 
              Malaysia in 1963 and was booted out in 1965.  If there was anyone who 
              created the state of Singapore, it was Malaysia’s prime minister Tungku 
              Abdul Rahman since he was the one who booted Singapore out and thereby 
              ‘created’ the state of Singapore.<br>  <br> 4.  <strong>The supposed Singapore 
              success formula of foreign investment led export industrialisation 
              wasn’t the brainchild of MM Lee.  It was the brainchild of Dr Albert 
              Winsemius, a Dutch economist sent by the United Nations to Singapore in 
              1960 to help Singapore industrialise.  Singapore went from Third World 
              to First following Dr Winsemius’ plan rather than MM Lee’s.</strong><br>  <br> 5. <strong> Between 1961 and 1965, Singapore did not pursue export 
              industrialisation but pursued import substitution instead.  Only with 
              our separation from Malaysia in 1965 which rendered import substitution 
              untenable did Singapore finally embark on Dr Winsemius’ formula.  Thus, 
              MM Lee didn’t act on Dr Winsemius’ recommendations immediately and only 
              adopted it when faced with no other choice.  It seems therefore that our
               split from Malaysia in 1965 was the key factor that led Singapore to 
              adopt export industrialisation rather than some conscious decision by MM
               Lee.</strong><br>  <br> 6.  Singapore is not the only success story but is just 
              one of four East Asian economic miracles alongside Hong Kong, Taiwan and
               South Korea.  You will not find a similar statesman extraordinaire 
              responsible for the other three economic miracles.  This shows that you 
              don’t need a statesman extraordinaire for a country to succeed.  If we 
              were to ask ourselves what is so special about these four economies, 
              there is only one obvious answer, they are all East Asian societies.  
              <strong>Not only that, China too has been rising rapidly over the last twenty 
              years.  The Singapore success is very much an East Asian success rather 
              than the success of any one man.</strong><br>  <br>  <br> Thank you<br>  <br>  <br> <strong>Ng Kok Lim</strong></p>

One day later, Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, publicly revealed that they too had bought HPL condominiums. The story made headlines and started tongues wagging. The story was then traced back to one Ong Beng Seng, a property tycoon in Singapore, and Managing Director of HPL.<br><br></strong>Ong had developed two condominium projects at the choiciest districts of Singapore. One was the abovementioned Nassim Jade situated where opulent and expansive embassies and mansions were located around Nassim Road. The other, Scotts 28, was at the heart of Singapore's shopping and tourist district Scotts Road. Both projects consisted of condominum apartments valued at millions of dollars per unit before the property slump.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MORE RED FACES</span><br><br>It was also revealed that not only had Lee Kuan Yew, his brother and his son purchased these apartments, they were offered substantial discounts to boot. The apartments were due to be put on sale on the open market on 17 April 1995. Three days before the official launch, HPL conducted a "soft launch" where a select group of potential customers were invited to have first go at the apartments. This was not exactly an unheard of practice amongst property developers. The problem was that because HPL was a publicly listed company, it had shareholders to account to. Rules under the SES Manual Listing stated that approval had to be sought for transactions involving "connected persons" of the company involved and those persons' associates. The HPL did not seek the permission of its shareholders. Suan Yew, Lee's brother, was a non-executive director of the company.<br><br>At the soft launch, Madam Kwa Geok Choo, chose an apartment to buy. She was quoted a price of $3,578,260 (or $1,583 per square foot) for the apartment. This was a seven percent discount on the list price. Buyers at soft launches are usually given only a five percent discount.<br><br>Later, Kwa Geok Choo contacted her son, Hsien Loong, and told him of the Nassim Jade apartments upon which he called Aunty Pamelia Lee, wife of Uncle Suan Yew, and said that he and his wife, Ho Ching, were interested in buying the property as well. Aunty Pamelia then later came back to her nephew and offered him an apartment for $3,645,100 a discount of 12 per cent or $437,412 on the asking price. The Deputy Prime Minister accepted the offer.<br><br>This was not all. On the Scotts 28 condiminiums, similar offers and purchases were made. Lee Kuan Yew and son bought two more units and paid $2,791,500 and $2,776,400 respectively for them, each bagging a five percent discount.<br><br><strong>All in all, Lee Kuan Yew received from HPL a total of $416,252 whilst Lee Junior got $643,185 in discounts. All the purchases amounted to more than $10 million and were carried out without mortgages and loans.<br><br></strong>And yet, this was just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br><strong>It was later found out that Lee Kuan Yew's entire family was in on the purchases. Daughter Lee Wei Ling, a medical doctor in a government hospital; sister Lee Kim Mon; and his two other brothers Freddy and Dennis; Kwa Kim Li, a niece of Lee; and Gloria Lee, Lee's sister in law, all bought the condos at hefty discounts. Wei Ling bought two apartments at Nassim Jade and was reported to have sold one off for a tidy profit. Again, all these transactions were carried out without the approval of the shareholders of HPL.<br></strong><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SHAREHOLDERS' ANGER</span><br><br>News was leaking out about the Lee family's purchases of the HPL condominiums and the shareholders were getting increasingly alarmed and disgruntled. When pressure was brought to bear on the management, HPL decided to belatedly seek the approval of its shareholders a full eleven months later.<br><br>The SES had no choice but to issue a statement censuring HPL for the breach of regulations. It noted that some of the discounts given to directors and their relatives in respect of the Nassim Jade units were higher than those given to non-related buyers and that the publicly listed companies have a duty to obtain the best price so as to maximise the return to its shareholders.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">UNANSWERED QUESTIONS</span><br><br>In spite of this, there was no investigation nor inquiry, merely a censure for the company. Meanwhile, Lee Suan Yew quietly resigned as a director with HPL. To date, many questions remain unanswered:<br><strong>1. Who made the decisions to sell the apartments at such discounts to the Lee family?<br>2. Who authorised Pamelia Lee to sell the units to her relatives?<br>3. How many more relatives or friends, apart from those readily identifiable, bought the units through such connections?<br>4. Why did Ong Beng Seng, owner of HPL, offer the units, and presumably the discounts, to the Lee family?<br>5. Why was there no enquiry into Lee Suan Yew's involvement in affair?</strong></div>
