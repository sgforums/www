            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I find the xenophobic characteristic displayed by some of my fellow Singaporeans worrying. They speak as though living in prosperity in Singapore is a right, not something that we need to fight for. The same characteristic that I found among groups of youths in many well to do western countries. I cannot help but remembered how hard our forefathers worked when they first migrated to Singapore from their hometown, be it in China, Malaysia or India. And today, we the descendants of those who had fought so hard to prosper, are now demanding our government to keep out others with the same spirit of our forefathers so that we can have things easy!?!? What is the Ethos of us Singaporeans? Kiasuism? Was our state not built with sweat, blood and courage of our forefathers such as ricksaw pullers, coolies, construction workers. And instead of continuing the spirits that our forefathers displayed, we, who grew up in relative comfort compared to the majority of the rest of the world, we act as if we have inherited the right to be rich and prosper without a fight. Sure, jobs are not as readily available as they were during the 80s, but we won't starve to death as long as we are willing to work. If we want to raise to the top, we shouldn't demand people to give it to us, we should fight for it with our true ability! The state had already provided us with great subsidies in terms of education, and that is our greatest capital!<br>When we talk about foreign talents, two pictures spring to mind, the "experts" picture and the "construction worker" picture. The experts possess the skills that Singapore lack of while the "construction workers" took the jobs that Singaporeans are refusing to do. Without these foreign people coming in, we will not have enough population to renew the labour force and economical growth will be hampered.<br>In terms of culture, one must remembered that the greatest part of our culture is its diversity and its tolerance. Refusing "foreign element" from entering into our culture would be the greatest betrayal to our culture.The current racial mix of Chinese, Malay and Indian are incidental, they will not stay the same forever and rejection of new immigrants will only plant the seed for future racial disharmony.<br>The NS may seem like unfairness to Singaporean males, but utility should override fairnes and there are measures such as extra pay that reduce the degree of such unfairness.<br>Foreign influx may appear frightening to some, but we were once foreign to this island too.</strong><br><br>we din shut the door on all FTs but just wish govt to have tighter control on things.when our forefather come to singapore, singapore is not even a country but a british colony/settlement. no one care about this island, get your money and F*&amp;K off. situation now is rather different though it the same piece of land. we are singaporean, born, raise, serve our NS, educated here.<br>we just hope govt can have a tigher control on the immigration policy. make singaporean feel wanted and priority. trust me, since when is living in singapore as easy as you think especially when you start working in the society?<br>men that serve NS get extra pay only happen in govt uniform sector and some statutory board.<br><br>one of the main reason they come singapore is because of the safety, security that you, me, bro, fathers that spend 2.5 the very best years of our life provide for. thus asking those FTs who as you say has the intention to stay, breed next generation in  singapore to serve 2 years in national duty. too much to ask for?<br><br></div>

It has to be something significant, tangible and makes a distinction between Singaporean men versus women, PRs and FT.<br><br>In view of the concern over medical costs, how about a 20% discount for medical treatment at government hospitals and polyclinics, but only for Singaporean men who have served NS.</div>

It is a bit rich to get our males to serve NS for 2 and a half years (during my time). A time which we sacrificed to contribute to the security of our country, then get that brushed off. Not to mention the many injuries that happened to ourselves and our friends, plus a few deaths too.<br><br>And after that , we still get called up for yearly ICT, which in the private sector, puts male employees at a disadvantage, significantly or otherwise.<br><br>This issue must be addressed as our gates are opened.</div>

But to check and balance, we must ensure that only the best make it here. And not any Tom, Dick &amp; Harry. Let me explain by sharing 2 examples.<br><br>Mr Cao Guo Min from Setsco is an executive chemist. He assists my workshop by analysing oils for my workshop engineering projects. His English sux though he tries to converse in English and it's a chore to communicate with English. But I think his contributions technically compensated on his language handicap. Of course, at the rate he is going, one day his English will improve. (I'm more worried it might become Singlish) With his help, my projects become higher in quality.<br><br>Mr Chin Tech Sing is a Malaysian mechanic in SBS Transit with decades of experience in Singapore. I'd very much hope that he's stay longer even he's already in his late fifties. He has expressed that he wants to go back to Malaysia in 2 to 3 more years after his son starts to work. Mr Chin together with another Singaporean colleague are my twin champions (1 Malaysian 1 Singaporean). Whenever we're pushing buses for the road, I will look for them. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]Fast and efficient</span></strong>. On weekends, I always ensure at least one of them is around to help me fight the battle. From a management point of view, he has helped to increase competition among my mechanics and I'm extremely pleased with the contributions he has made.<br><br>In actual fact, becos of the super mechanics, most of the rest have bucked up and saved themselves from the recent retrenchment.<br><br>We as local Singaporeans should not deem these FT as unwelcomed guests. But as an opportunity to upgrade ourselves. When I choose an employee, I don't look only at their wages, I look at their attitude 1st. And if the guy is not right, I will not hesitate to ask him to go even after he starts work. If I can spend $500 more for a mechanic and groom another champion to take over Mr Chin TS, I will be very willing to do that.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans, I sincerely urge all of you to welcome the right FT to enter Singapore. On our part, we should buck up and help push the economy together. We may be different now. But our grandchildren will speak the same language, kiss the same floor when their Sergeants say "Whole lot! knock it down."[/b]</blockquote>Fully agreed with U.<br><br>We r not against these FTs who can contribute but looking ard u now! who r they,are they just flies???<br><br>Pls reality, my cond has all these FTs where I can invite u 2 come!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I'd very much agree with your views towards FT.<br>On our part, we should welcome capable foreign talents to join into our ranks and contribute their part to lift up our overall quality. But to check and balance, we must ensure that only the best make it here. And not any Tom, Dick &amp; Harry. Let me explain by sharing 2 examples.<br><br>Mr Cao Guo Min from Setsco is an executive chemist. He assists my workshop by analysing oils for my workshop engineering projects. His English sux though he tries to converse in English and it's a chore to communicate with English. But I think his contributions technically compensated on his language handicap. Of course, at the rate he is going, one day his English will improve. (I'm more worried it might become Singlish) With his help, my projects become higher in quality.<br><br>Mr Chin Tech Sing is a Malaysian mechanic in SBS Transit with decades of experience in Singapore. I'd very much hope that he's stay longer even he's already in his late fifties. He has expressed that he wants to go back to Malaysia in 2 to 3 more years after his son starts to work. Mr Chin together with another Singaporean colleague are my twin champions (1 Malaysian 1 Singaporean). Whenever we're pushing buses for the road, I will look for them. Fast and efficient. On weekends, I always ensure at least one of them is around to help me fight the battle. From a management point of view, he has helped to increase competition among my mechanics and I'm extremely pleased with the contributions he has made.<br><br>In actual fact, becos of the super mechanics, most of the rest have bucked up and saved themselves from the recent retrenchment.<br><br>We as local Singaporeans should not deem these FT as unwelcomed guests. But as an opportunity to upgrade ourselves. When I choose an employee, I don't look only at their wages, I look at their attitude 1st. And if the guy is not right, I will not hesitate to ask him to go even after he starts work. If I can spend $500 more for a mechanic and groom another champion to take over Mr Chin TS, I will be very willing to do that.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans, I sincerely urge all of you to welcome the right FT to enter Singapore. On our part, we should buck up and help push the economy together. We may be different now. But our grandchildren will speak the same language, kiss the same floor when their Sergeants say "Whole lot! knock it down."</strong><br><br>well the above speech should be read by our union secretary during union days or PM speech. these underlines our very concern,<br>1.The Mr Chin Tech Sing is a Malaysian mechanic in SBS Transit with decades of experience in Singapore apply for a Singapore citizenship? or does he treat singapore like a money spinning machine. spent years here, save up and retire in malaysia where medical, expenditure, housing, car are much cheaper?<br>is this FT where PM mention will booast birth rate, merge into our muiltiiracial society?<br><br>2.Mr Cao Guo Min from Setsco is an executive chemist. if he that good, welcome him, i would appreciate if he stay, have second generation here. serve their NS here. that is exactly what our forefather did.<br>dont just criticise fellow singaporean by using terms such as globalisation as an excuse for uncontrollable influx of foreign cheap labour.<br>if any company decided to set up office/factory in singapore, trust me, cost of labour would not be top of their priority coz singapore are never well know to be cheap. But we are good, stable, hardworking lot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even if the government bring in so many foreigners,but they also cannot manage to attract them stay on n become real Singapore citizens.Why?Becoz Singapore has become an unattractive place due to the PAP leaders dictatorial ruling.Those foreign talents wont really want to stay here for the rest of their lives n let their 2nd generations serve the stupid NS+reservist+IPPT test in here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And besides,if they become Singapore citizens,they will face the same problem as what we Singapore citizens are facing,that is high cost of living,low wages,long working hours,dictatorship rules by Lee family etc.No one will like this stupid country.As a matter of fact,when i met newbie foreign talent,i will act as a "Singapore embassador" n tell them how lousy this country is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .......But i think he or she will realise it sooner or later during their stay in Singapore,no problem at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>And there is another thing i want to say,although it is off topic.During the election time,young Lee actually use "email" to command Lou Goh to help him to win the election in Hougang n Potong Pasir areas.I dont know how far is young Lee office to Lou Goh office,but if i were young Lee,i will personally go to Lou Goh office to ask him for help in the election.This show how arrogant this young Lee is.........But then again,i think there is no need to give so much respect to a "boot-licking dog" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
