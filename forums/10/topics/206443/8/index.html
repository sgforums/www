            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i feel very unfair for our forefathers who came all the way here to settle for a better living. The success of this nation has a lot to do with these ppl. It is not built within a day. Yet, from what i can see. FT just see Singapore as a stepping stone for a better living <strong>back in their own country.</strong>, use our government subsidy for their benefits. What come to my mind is, " What have they even contributed to this little nation to enjoy all the benefits they are enjoying right now?"<br><br>They are just like the British colonial master, trying to make use of us. When they finish their business here, they will just wipe their backside and leave for their own countries. If there are any social problems, we still have to clear it up for them.

I don't think that is a good idea although it will solve the problems of an aging population and ensure that the population remains vibrant and productive. However, allowing foreigners into our country is equivalent to allowing strangers into our house.<br>Firstly, our local culture will clash with their foreign culture.<br>Secondly, even when they have their Singapore citizenship, we are still able to differentiate them from the locals so majority will still view them as foreigners. Having foreigners fighting over the rice bowl with the locals, the social cohesiveness will be weaken.<br>Thirdly, the locals will feel threaten by the presence of foreigners because most of them are willing to accept low pays, have better performances or protray themselves as foreign talents.<br><br>Conclusion, number of foreigners entering our countries must be restricted.</div></blockquote>Those 3 points you raised seemed pointing more towards a possible threat to our national security than identity.<br><br>National identity is forged by the citizens, whether by birth or naturalization, of a nation.
