Even with FTs and the employment of foreign workers. They too will eventually realise that it has become too expensive to enable them to send any money back.<br><br>And then what next after running the ship aground?<br><br>There you go again comparing Singapore with the west. We are just a tiny red dot; and CONTROL is our gov's forte!<br><br>Besides, what is our gov making us run for? Chasing world economies to meet WHOS' ends? The people or gov's own coffers??<br><br>After all they say they don't owe us a living, but we still owe them one!<br><br>One thing is sure, these FTs to top up population also tops up their pool of supporters for the next GE!<br><br>People can see through it all...and this is the REAL objective.</div>
