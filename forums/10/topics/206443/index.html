            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee said we will have to allow more foreigners to become Singapore citizens. I don't think that is a good idea although it will solve the problems of an aging population and ensure that the population remains vibrant and productive. However, allowing foreigners into our country is equivalent to allowing strangers into our house.<br>Firstly, our local culture will clash with their foreign culture.<br>Secondly, even when they have their Singapore citizenship, we are still able to differentiate them from the locals so majority will still view them as foreigners. Having foreigners fighting over the rice bowl with the locals, the social cohesiveness will be weaken.<br>Thirdly, the locals will feel threaten by the presence of foreigners because most of them are willing to accept low pays, have better performances or protray themselves as foreign talents.<br><br>Conclusion, number of foreigners entering our countries must be restricted.</div>

If I can spend $500 more for a mechanic and groom another champion to take over Mr Chin TS, I will be very willing to do that.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans, I sincerely urge all of you to welcome the right FT to enter Singapore.

From a management point of view, he has helped to increase competition among my mechanics and I'm extremely pleased with the contributions he has made.<br><br>In actual fact, becos of the super mechanics, most of the rest have bucked up and saved themselves from the recent retrenchment.<br><br>We as local Singaporeans should not deem these FT as unwelcomed guests. But as an opportunity to upgrade ourselves. When I choose an employee, I don't look only at their wages, I look at their attitude 1st. And if the guy is not right, I will not hesitate to ask him to go even after he starts work. If I can spend $500 more for a mechanic and groom another champion to take over Mr Chin TS, I will be very willing to do that.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans, I sincerely urge all of you to welcome the right FT to enter Singapore. On our part, we should buck up and help push the economy together. We may be different now. But our grandchildren will speak the same language, kiss the same floor when their Sergeants say "Whole lot! knock it down."[/b]</blockquote>We need them. Like it or not. I think no one can dispute that.<br><br>But what worries many of us are the advantages that the FTs have over us as I have listed above.</div>

That raises the competitiveness of Singaporean companies and grows the economy.<br><br>Of course there are winners and losers. The winners are the Singaporean employers, the FT and the nation as a whole. The losers are low- and semi-skilled Singaporeans who will see their wages depressed as a result.<br><br>Every developed nation will face a similar challenge, from Singaporeans who face PRC citizens to British workers who lose their jobs to Polish immigrant workers.<br><br>As to where to draw the balance, I believe in utilitarianism...what will bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Without FTs, our SMEs will not be as competitive and will have to move operations to cheaper economies in the region. Singapore will suffer a double whammy: losing <strong>both</strong> the jobs and the tax revenue, not to mention the entrepreneurs who move their businesses overseas.<br><br>The recent move to increase the number of doctors and lawyers with second medical and law schools may hurt the wages of existing lawyers and doctors. We already have cheap foreign doctors in our health service. But that is a price we have to pay to contain healthcare costs and grow the economy.<br><br>Singaporeans have to look at the greater good. Ultimately, if the nation loses competitiveness and businesses re-locate elesewhere, we all lose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find the xenophobic characteristic displayed by some of my fellow Singaporeans worrying. They speak as though living in prosperity in Singapore is a right, not something that we need to fight for. The same characteristic that I found among groups of youths in many well to do western countries. I cannot help but remembered how hard our forefathers worked when they first migrated to Singapore from their hometown, be it in China, Malaysia or India. And today, we  the descendants of those who had fought so hard to prosper, are now demanding our government to keep out others with the same spirit of our forefathers so that we can have things easy!?!? What is the Ethos of us Singaporeans? Kiasuism? Was our state not built with sweat, blood and courage of our forefathers such as ricksaw pullers, coolies, construction workers. And instead of continuing the spirits that our forefathers displayed, we, who grew up in relative comfort compared to the majority of the rest of the world, we act as if we have inherited the right to be rich and prosper without a fight. Sure, jobs are not as readily available as they were during the 80s, but we won't starve to death as long as we are willing to work. If we want to raise to the top, we shouldn't demand people to give it to us, we should fight for it with our true ability! The state had already provided us with great subsidies in terms of education, and that is our greatest capital!<br>When we talk about foreign talents, two pictures spring to mind, the "experts" picture and the "construction worker" picture. The experts possess the skills that Singapore lack of while the "construction workers" took the jobs that Singaporeans are refusing to do. Without these foreign people coming in, we will not have enough population to renew the labour force and economical growth will be hampered.<br>In terms of culture, one must remembered that the greatest part of our culture is its diversity and its tolerance. Refusing "foreign element" from entering into our culture would be the greatest betrayal to our culture.The current racial mix of Chinese, Malay and Indian are incidental, they will not stay the same forever and rejection of new immigrants will only plant the seed for future racial disharmony.<br>The NS may seem like unfairness to Singaporean males, but utility should override fairnes and there are measures such as extra pay that reduce the degree of such unfairness.<br>Foreign influx may appear frightening to some, but we were once foreign to this island too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think that's really what PM Lee mentioned.<br><br>He was probably responding to recent critics against our foreign worker policy. By explaining his reasons, he actually compartmentalized the catagories.<br><br>Clearly, there are the worker bees and there are the queens.<br><br>The worker bees of course refer to our trash collectors and road sweepers, the so-called unglamourous portfolios Singaporeans avoid. In this case, we as a gracious public should offer our thanks to this group who are willing to take the 'scraps' left by Singaporeans who 'steer clear' of such filthy jobs.<br><br>The queens of course refer to entrepreneurs and professionals who bring along their skill and expertise; and in doing so, provide jobs for people.<br><br>As such it is unfair for critics to single out the queen catagory and blanket smear the policy. By doing so, those critics are ignoring the construction workers, shipyard labour and service providers who flood our 'avoid-at-all-costs' industries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of us are convinced of the need to have more foreigners, even though our hearts are against it.<br><br>But the disadvantages we face compared to them, disadvantages that are structural and built into our Singaporean system have not been addressed yet.<br><br>Foreigners pay less for their college education(in India or China); they may not stay(actually, most won't become citizens), so they can accept lower pay, knowing that the Sing currency can give them a higher local currency when they go home(Malaysia, India or China); they do not serve NS, so male foreigners may be more desirable etc.<br><br>There is no getting away from it. If the foreigners don't come here, the jobs may go there. We should have more foreigners, but these and many other real issues have to be addressed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is interesting and instructive to look at how other developed countries are tackling this problem.<br><br>Japan--No immigrants please. NO. No. No. They are now facing the problem of a depleting population.<br><br>USA--traditionally welcoming of immigrants. But not to forget, they have plenty of land, of opportunities. Making the pie bigger for everyone is really true for that country. However, emotions against immigrants still run high now and then. Just goes to show that even in the best of "melting-pots", sentiments of keeping "outsiders" out still exist.<br><br>UK--taking in Polish and Eastern Europeans next. Took in lots of Indians and blacks in the past. Not going into whether it is the right or wrong policy, but riots have erupted in the past. Even now, there are many conflicts.<br><br>France--took in lots of Algerians. Zidane is Algerian. But they still have problems assimilating them.<br><br>Taking in foreigners is a complex and emotive issue, but i'd just like to point out that like it or not, there will be deep feelings against it. I prefer not to have them, but recognise that our country cannot do without them and it is the right policy by the government to let them in.</div>
