The name is the "Cuckoid Republic". Seriously, many of the throngs of Indian and PRC citizens we see here are not really interested to become citizens, they may not be even interested we our way of doing things or attempt to assimilate. Many are here just for the FREE SCHOLARSHIP and LAX IMMIGRATION POLICY. From my interaction with PRCians in my Uni, my would not even consider coming here to study let alone get PR, some were even full of complains abt us, thinking that this is their backyard. They are laughing all their way to the bank for the "Deity-like" reception provided by our govt. THE WORST IS-- MOST DUN EVEN WANT TO STAY. Thus I beg to ask, why bother to give them the scholarship? Even if we give, why can't we instill some 3 yrs compulsory, NS-like, "national education service term", to make them understand our way of life, and most importantly, weed out the "free-loaders".<br><br>Wad worries me most is, when the number of PR, our ppls from a certain nationality becomes a large force, so large that they become formidable, then these ppls may meddle with our internal affairs. For example, in my uni, the PRC students are such a large population that they can actually form an activity known as PRC-camp. They do not need to mix around with others from other nationalities as their numbers could easily fill half the lecture theatre. We also see the recent clam down on errant PDMMs. Many PDMMs can actually protest outside the embassy and the newspapers, talk-shows are filled with sympathisers, some even come out to defend their misdeeds. So much so that many ppls are thinking that we Singaporeans are actually ill-treating them.  Thus, I could see a strong "PRC lobby" being form. They are going to be lke the Jewish lobby in USA, influencing the govt policies. We could expect locals views and ideas being suppressed and sacrificed for the sake of their interest. Bcos our govt treat them like god, thus their words ae going to be viewed as "scarced teachings". I also wonder why SAF wants to give the SAFOs to the PRC guy?</div></blockquote>The RSAF officer had already converted his citizenship to be Sporean. It seemed to u think all PRC r eveil doers.</div>

I don't think that is a good idea although it will solve the problems of an aging population and ensure that the population remains vibrant and productive. However, allowing foreigners into our country is equivalent to allowing strangers into our house.<br>Firstly, our local culture will clash with their foreign culture.<br>Secondly, even when they have their Singapore citizenship, we are still able to differentiate them from the locals so majority will still view them as foreigners. Having foreigners fighting over the rice bowl with the locals, the social cohesiveness will be weaken.<br>Thirdly, the locals will feel threaten by the presence of foreigners because most of them are willing to accept low pays, have better performances or protray themselves as foreign talents.<br><br>Conclusion, number of foreigners entering our countries must be restricted.</div></blockquote>i feel threatened by their presence............<br><br>yup......we should start to purge some of them out of this small place.......the room ain't large enough to hold so many.............<br><br>in a sinking frigate...........the weak shall be thrown overboard without any compassion...........</div>

Surely that is a service that can be easily provided by unskilled Singaporeans? The fact is, foreign maids are cheap. Singaporeans would not want to pay a decent salary for fellow Singaporeans to clean their homes and baby sit when they can have a full-time maid for $300 a month, working 12 hours a day without annual leave or weekend off.<br><br>Singaporeans want a cheap service, and that means foreign workers even if the service can be provided at a higher price by Singaporeans.</div>

I was talking about Singaporeans, you and I, that I felt have very much an ostrich-like mindset towards foreign "talent" and foreign competition.<br><br>Let me say it before hand first, once upon a time, I was "xenophobic" too, I read about all those gold digging "crows" from China in the chinese tabloids and got pissed, I heard of my female friends being gropped by foreign workers in orchard, I had friends gripe to me about working for pathetic white expat bosses with fossilized colonial mindsets, I had thought we should keep them out forever.<br><br>but then, I realised, hey, this is a global tide ... an inexorable tide that's happening all over the world, you don't suppose Singapore is the only place that people are flocking to, eh ? And it's worse in other countries too, while in Singapore we take in mostly people from other asian countries (with similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds), in many western countries, people flock from all over the world, so you see baggers at the groceries stores from antigua to zambia. take a look at this. Let me tell you, the influx and the outcry is certainly bigger in other countries compared to Singapore.<br><br><a href="http://www.canadafirst.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadafirst.net/</a><br><br>read a few of their articles, I got this in the mail from a (white) canadian acquaintance as part of a talkc.ock session, but as you can see, this ostrich mentality is not exclusive to Singaporeans. The fact remains though, that global competition is NOT something you can keep out. Don't want foreign talents, who can do it better, faster, cheaper ? fine ! companies will just pack up and leave for places where they can get things done better, faster, cheaper then ! you think by keeping foreign talents and workers out you can keep your jobs ? that companies won't relocate out of Singapore ? welcome to reality, remember this, once upon a time, companies relocated to Singapore from their home countries precisely because we WERE the better, faster, cheaper ones, eh ? I remember talking to this old american in his fifties doing his masters in computer science in one of my senior year classes, I asked him why he was doing this, he told me he was replaced in his previous job (in canada) by an Indian chap half his age, nearly half his salary, and with twice his qualifications. Instead of whining, he elected to come back fighting, and so there he was.<br><br>I'm not sure about how much of the social aspects of this issue is due purely to "xenophobia" on part of our citizens. An interesting observation: once upon a time, some Singaporeans used to look down upon mainlanders, we derided them as country bumpkins, uncouth, kooky, with bad dress sense, now, however, we get pissed because those same mainlanders are now looking down on us ? ... I can't help but giggle here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . I want to say that many of the social aspects of the problems doesn't lie with all these foreigners, but with ourselves, say, ah peks getting hooked up with PDMMs, or sweet young things on student visas, well, can one actually suppose those same ah peks weren't getting their "fixes" from batam or bangkok previously ? you think massage parlours selling a different kind of massage didn't exist before this group of people came along and took it to a whole new level ? to me, they are simply the ones that could do it "better, faster, cheaper".<br><br>Global competition is a fact, regardless of our goverment policies, it is something we cannot keep out, nor can we afford to. I sometimes wonder if a large section of our workforce is a victim of our own economic successes in our boom years. We now have a cadre of older, under-educated workers, some of whom are highly resistant to change, and under-equipped for this borderless world, where jobs can flow from one place to the next very quickly. Callous words perhaps from a young man with a brand new scroll and has yet to land himself his first post grad job yet, but this is a marathon that you and I, and every fellow Singaporean, have to run, it is the only way. The sooner we snap our heads out of the sand, the better, for the world won't wait for us .....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Foreign talents, or foreign non-talents, or cheap foreigners would have to come in. Either we like it or not. As a matter of fact, Malaysians, who are certainly foreigners technically, have been around for a long time. But they are our cousins, relatives, etc, so that sense of "otherness" is not as strong as that elicited by PRCs, Indians and Benglas.<br><br>The government, being the group who can make the changes, should however take steps so that we can compete with them. Our education, especially the tertiary portion, should be made cheaper. Now that 2 Indian colleges are having their medical degrees recognised, does it makes sense for NUS Medicine to charge the same amount of fees, then bond the the graduates for a further 5 years? Instead of giving scholarships to foreigners, how about giving more to our own instead?<br><br>Why can't our 2 universities take in much more of our poly graduates, instead of having so many of them being forced to go overseas in Australia and UK to pursue their degrees, thus incurring that much higher costs? Not to mention that is encouraging even more Singaporeans to leave Singapore.<br><br>2 years is a long time, especially during the 18 to 23 range, when a young man is in his prime, mentally and physically. And the annual ICT can put off potential employers when compared to a male foreigner.<br><br>Our housing costs are not cheap. The government is at least trying to rectify that now, in a way, by building 2 and 3 room flats again. The foreigners can take low pay, because they would not stay. Fine, don't stay then. But our own people need higher, less competitive pay because they need a roof over their heads!<br><br></div>
