Anyone else felt that the question was brushed off?</span><br><br><span class="small"><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pda/139867ag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pda/139867ag.htm</a><br><br>Think big, dream beyond our size: Minister to youth<br>Friday Â• September 1, 2006<br>Â— Tor Ching Li<br><br>DON'T let the small size of Singapore limit the scope of your dreams Â— that was the rallying call from Minister of Manpower Ng Eng Hen to about 450 undergraduates at the annual Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum last night.<br><br>"We need Singaporeans to think big, take calculated risks and succeed big. We are in need of more real examples of Singaporeans who achieve dreams beyond others' imagination. In all fields Â— business, science, academia, sports Â— we need to produce our own world-class icons," said Mr Ng at the forum, on the theme "Standing Tall in a Shrinking World".<br><br>He cited "water queen" Olivia Lum, chief executive of water treatment company Hyflux, as someone who had fulfilled her dreams in Singapore. The 46-year-old entrepreneur, who is worth US$240 million ($377 million), was ranked 17th on Forbes Asia's Southeast Asia list of 40 richest businesspeople.<br><br>"If she could do it, why not you?" said Mr Ng.<br><br>Ms Lum had a good idea that made the seemingly improbable Â— selling water in a region with torrential rains Â— become possible and, more importantly, she had the drive to succeed. Mr Ng recounted how Ms Lum, a former Malaysian who came to Singapore at age 16, peddled her water filters and softeners from Jurong to Batu Pahat in Malaysia.<br><br>Mr Ng noted that while Singaporean graduates have the advantage of an "established international brand" renowned for intellectual rigour, they are also perceived as being less adept at dealing with "fuzzy situations" and "less daring".<br><br>"We have already realigned our educational system to train students to better handle ambiguity, to think and speak on their feet and to manage people, but this is still very much work in progress. Our universities will and must evolve new pedagogical styles to bring out these skills in students," he said.<br><br>Another weakness is the unwillingness of Singaporean graduates to work their way up.<br><br>"Singaporean graduates should realise that industry practices have changed," he said.<br><br>Mr Ng also warned the students they would have to face up to increasing competition from local and overseas graduates. "Ultimately, it will not be your paper qualifications which differentiate you, but your skills and attitudes," he said.<br><br>During the question and answer session, one student asked how getting more foreign talent could be reconciled with nation-building goals. Mr Ng replied that perceptions that foreigners stole jobs from locals would have to be managed. Foreign talent were part and parcel of creating more opportunities for Singaporeans.<br><br>To a query about dual citizenship, Mr Ng said "soft solutions", such as family ties, were needed to make mobile Singaporeans feel rooted here. It was not something one could solve just by allowing dual citizenship.<br><br>Singapore is well poised to benefit from the rise of India and China. Domestically, it has set the stage for local talent to shine, in sectors such as research and development, digital media and tourism.<br><br>"The opportunities are there for you and the decisions you make in the next 10 years will decide your trajectory and zenith. The world is literally at your feet, with the possibilities limited only by your grit and imagination," said Mr Ng.</span></div>
