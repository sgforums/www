I'll be glad to take any monetary incentives of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ..... but I don't think a dollar and cents solution is the answer (this another aspect of the singaporean (garbarment) psyche that's flawed ... we throw money at a problem and expect it to go away ....<br><br></div></blockquote>Fatum,<br><br>You are quite right that throwing money at a problem will not make it go away completely .... but  it will become a less significant issue. It resolves the question of people who are trying to rip off Singaporeans' sweat and hard work, enjoy our security, do not suffer our sweat, tears, blood, injuries and disabilities during service.  It adequately compensates Singaporean male citizens involve in NS in the absence of a Veteran Affairs type bureaucacy that advocates and establishes comprehensive services and recognition of NS man in really tangible ways.<br><br>Anyway NS is not just service (duty) but a right of citizenship. We should not allow non-citizens to bear arms, we want to call all the shots in any eventuality, please tax and buy me the biggest gun and fill my kitchen with ammo, thank you.<br><br>Pay NSF and NS man what regulars are paid for their vocations/rank and experience. So starting salary for most would be about $1000 to $1500 x 50000 NSF per month. Non-citizens derive security benefits by living in our midst through our handiwork - we should pay ourselves first....<br><br>P.S. Since you already know that the government uses monetary income as the yardstick by which all citizens are judged worthy of consumption, eg. COE for cars ---- so if we pay ourselves highly, then we know for sure tangibly we are worth more!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think soon Singapore is going to acquire a new reputation. The name is the "Cuckoid Republic".

Many are here just for the FREE SCHOLARSHIP and LAX IMMIGRATION POLICY. From my interaction with PRCians in my Uni, my would not even consider coming here to study let alone get PR, some were even full of complains abt us, thinking that this is their backyard. They are laughing all their way to the bank for the "Deity-like" reception provided by our govt. THE WORST IS-- MOST DUN EVEN WANT TO STAY. Thus I beg to ask, why bother to give them the scholarship?

They do not need to mix around with others from other nationalities as their numbers could easily fill half the lecture theatre. We also see the recent clam down on errant PDMMs. Many PDMMs can actually protest outside the embassy and the newspapers, talk-shows are filled with sympathisers, some even come out to defend their misdeeds. So much so that many ppls are thinking that we Singaporeans are actually ill-treating them.  Thus, I could see a strong "PRC lobby" being form. They are going to be lke the Jewish lobby in USA, influencing the govt policies. We could expect locals views and ideas being suppressed and sacrificed for the sake of their interest. Bcos our govt treat them like god, thus their words ae going to be viewed as "scarced teachings". I also wonder why SAF wants to give the SAFOs to the PRC guy?</div>
