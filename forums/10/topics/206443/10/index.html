            <div class='col-md body'>I think those foreigners should have the correct mentality. When they met troubles here, they should not expect the same assistance and treatment as the Singapore citizens. Which remains me of the issues of study mamas when they can't work in massage parlours and ask govt for help.<br><br>At that moment, I think they really think our govt is charity. They causes social problems and still need us to find work for them when we need to solve the umemployment of citizens. Funny sia! They should pack up and bring their problems home instead of demanding us to help them.</div>

So are foreigners automatically talent - because they are foreigners? I have seen and worked with many foreigners who are really seriously sub-par, and they got their PRs, and go around 'wayang' like they are gods because they know Singapore is hungry for them. I have met and worked with good ones too, and my definition of good foreigners are those who are strong in principles, really know their stuffs, and they are willing to help/collaborate and work with locals, and even helping locals to go forth to better things.

The question is does Singapore know 'who' to let in? As I've said earlier, there are many who really should not be in Singapore.
