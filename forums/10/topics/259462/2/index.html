            <div class='col-md body'>lol... actually for opposition to takes over Singapore, it is not as easy as just winning the elections. They need to have strong connections or relationship with foreign as well as domestic ( military , investors , agency and etc ). It is going to be a big headache for them if they do takeover. Therefore, in previous election, worker's party stated that they dont intend to form a government but their intention is for the future.<br><br>There goes again... whether opposition is able to shoulder all these pain is another question.<br><br>What will the day be if opposition takes over Singapore ?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>What will the day be if opposition takes over Singapore?</blockquote>Monday! jk<br><br>Taking it steps at a time. Vote for opposition doesn't equate to instability. Break it up into phases before another party other than the PAP can actually form the government. But then again, its trying to vote out the PAP in an election that is engineered to return them to power. But in theory it goes like this :<br><br>Phase 1, the number of high calibre candidates in the oppsition is significantly less than the PAP. Although that has started to change. Raising awareness on how the PAP has been amending the constitution and passing laws to their advantage. Raising awareness on how there is no seperation of powers, that singaporeans need to unlearn "learned unhelplessness". (may post a thread on this later) the "aiyah, what can we do?" attitude has to go.<br><br>Phase 2, Winning a GRC, gain a foothold, and which gives them a opportunity to prove their worth. And then hopefully have better recuits.<br><br>Phase 3, Total opposition occupation in parliament should have aim to be 40% first. That prevents them from amending the constitution. Which includes the eletions act, the judiciary, freedom of speech etc. Then aim for 51%. If 51% is split between 2 or more opposition parties with no coalitions, the PAP will still be in power, and forced to keep only its very best in parliament. Which works for all Singaporeans.<br><br>From here its goes both ways, the parties and MPs will then really be sensative to the vioces of the people. And as the people, we should work to reverse all the amendments that PAP made, to make sure that no other party is dug in like the PAP was, or it will be another PAP, just by another name.<br><br></div>

Coz, this 60% of votes(in general) are PAP's loyal supporters, no matter what unhappiness PAP cause.<br>Unless, opposition is able to prove themself to this 60% of population.<br>lol... then probably, we can talk about opposition taking over Singapore.<br><br>2) Opposition only contest on location that they think they might win or worth trying. This 60% of votes does not include areas that walkover.<br><br>Conclusion, opposition's journey to be the next government is a long long way. Probably, I wont be able to live that long to see that day.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The next step is attempt to swing two GRCs and contest all GRCs. The latter requires a stronger coalition of parties than the SDA currently can do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take is ,<br><br>if Opposition one day gets the mandate of the People,<br><br>there could be 2 scenarios:<br><br>1. SGX drops a little.  But after some time, the new leaders increase the salary for leaders and this attract the best of the best of the best of the best that money can hire. They let all the good policies remain. Change only much laterm gradually. So, the People continue as before but with appropriate changes implemented and these should be what  the people wants as well, not just good for singapore. SGX shoots up higher than before if not the same as before.<br><br>2.  SGX no change.  The best talent money can hire applied and get hired to serve the new administration.  Double the current budget for these talents and hire the best of the best , better than any we have seen before. Still the same policy to welcome talents. But this time only the very best talents of the world get invited. Locals not worried about competition as only the best are hired. These very best foreign talents get paid like at least 100K a month. But as there are so many to choose from, a thorough background check is done on all these before hiring. More budget put into this process to hire the best.<br><br>I believe that money talks.<br><br>If the new winners adopt the same policy but only for the top talents,<br>they can continue to instill confidence in investors and singaporeans. But changes that people want would also be implemented.<br><br>Current opposition like WP and Chiam are respectable and very loyal and decent talents rarely found in singapore. I can trust them.<br><br>But to prevent white ghosts from bombarding me, I will say that this does not mean I do not trust existing leaders nor I hope they lose. Ok lah to make them happy, I say I love them and am their supporter lor.<br><br></div>
