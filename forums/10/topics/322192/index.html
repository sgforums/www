              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">I Am Above Failure</span>: So you think that you are somehow far too talented, hard-working or knowledgeable and that everything you touch will turn into gold? Sorry to burst your bubble there, but we humans are flawed by nature so that, my friend, I?m afraid that you may just be living in denial if you have such a way of thinking.<br><br></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">It's Impossible to Take Me by Surprise</span>: If you think that being taken by surprise is impossible if you have everything planned then I have one questions: how is life in that fantasy world of yours treating you? Yes, planning ahead is always recommended but thinking that you can actually be able to prepare for absolutely everything is just plain foolish on your part.<br><br></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">If You Want Something Done Right, Do It Yourself</span>: Do you think that others should never be trusted and do you think that, if you want something done right, you should do it yourself? Aren't you giving yourself just a little bit too much credit there? It may just be me, but you most definitely don't strike me as a person with his or her feet on the ground.<br><br></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">I'm Never at Fault</span>: Others are always at fault, aren't they? You keep doing everything right and they just ruin things for you, do they? Sorry to have to say this, but not assuming responsibility is one of the most obvious signs that you are living in denial.<br><br></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">Everything Has an Excuse</span>: "I'm not going to do this because..." "I would have done that, if not for..." Do you somehow manage to find excuses for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">everything</span>? Good for you, maybe you will find someone who pays you for that, but for the time being, your attitude is yet another sign that you are simply living in a fantasy world.<br><br></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">Everyone Else is Wrong</span>: Are all of the people who don't agree with you clueless? Are they that ignorant, can't they understand your brilliance? I'm sorry but, if that's the way you see things, I am afraid that the problem lies elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">One tip: it's not with everyone else.</span><br><br></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6600;">It's All One Big Conspiracy I Tell You</span>: Does it seem that everyone and their dog is working against you? Are you just a poor innocent victim in what seems to be one huge conspiracy against you? In that case, have you considered getting some help? No, everyone is not conspiring against you, and it's about time you stopped living in denial and started seeing how things actually stand</li>

              <p>Reminds me of our beloved Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Wise words from our great leader:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"If I were in authority in Singapore indefinitely without having to ask
              those who are governed whether they like what is being done, then I
              would not have the slightest doubt that I could govern much more
              effectively in their interests." - Mr Lee Kuan Yew, 1962</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each
              in the same condition and needing a blood transfusion. The first, a
              Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later.
              The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few
              days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and
              survived. That is the X factor in development." - 27 December 1967</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"We must encourage those who earn less than $200 per month and cannot
              afford to nurture and educate many children never to have more than
              two... We will regret the time lost if we do not now take the first
              tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our society
              with a large number of the physically, intellecually and culturally
              anaemic." -Lee Kuan Yew in 1967.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"(Without the CPF), Singaporeans would buy enormous quantities of
              clothes, shoes, furniture, television sets, radio, tape recorders,
              hi-fis, washing machines, motor cars. They would have no substantial or
              permanent asset to show for it." - Asian Wall Street Journal, Oct 21
              1985</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"We have to lock up people, without trial, whether they are communists,
              whether they are language chauvinists, whether they are religious
              extremists. If you don't do that, the country would be in ruins." -
              Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, 1986</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens.
              Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn't be here today. And
              I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn't be here, we would
              not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very
              personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you
              make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right.
              Never mind what the people think." - Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew,
              Straits Times, 20 April 1987</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"At this rate, the one-man, one-vote system could lead to decline and disintegration" - after the Opposition won 2 seats</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"The party would withdraw services to the two opposition-held seats
              of Anson and Potong Pasir" - On Potong Pasir and Anson electing non-PAP
              MPs</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>“Even from my sick bed, even if you are going to lower me into the
              grave and I feel something is going wrong, I will get up.” 1988
              National Day Rally, when he discussed the leadership transition to Goh
              Chok Tong in 1990.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"You know, the cure for all this talk is really a good dose of
              incompetent government. You get that alternative and you'll never put
              Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again...
              and your asset values will disappear, your apartment will be worth a
              fraction of what it is, your jobs will be in peril, your security will
              be at risk and our women will become maids in other people's countries,
              foreign workers." - Justifying million-dollar pay hike for Singapore
              ministers (Straits Times, 5 April 2007)</em></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Lee's advice to other governments is – to have a government that the people support and have confidence in; to have a leadership that's above board, where decisions are made not for personal gain but because it is necessary for the country; and to have able men in charge.</span></p>

              <div class="quote_body"><ol>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">I Am Above
              Failure</span>: So you think that you are somehow far too talented,
              hard-working or knowledgeable and that everything you touch will
              turn into gold? Sorry to burst your bubble there, but we humans are
              flawed by nature so that, my friend, I?m afraid that you may just
              be living in denial if you have such a way of thinking.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">It's
              Impossible to Take Me by Surprise</span>: If you think that being
              taken by surprise is impossible if you have everything planned then
              I have one questions: how is life in that fantasy world of yours
              treating you? Yes, planning ahead is always recommended but
              thinking that you can actually be able to prepare for absolutely
              everything is just plain foolish on your part.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">If You Want
              Something Done Right, Do It Yourself</span>: Do you think that
              others should never be trusted and do you think that, if you want
              something done right, you should do it yourself? Aren't you giving
              yourself just a little bit too much credit there? It may just be
              me, but you most definitely don't strike me as a person with his or
              her feet on the ground.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">I'm Never at
              Fault</span>: Others are always at fault, aren't they? You keep
              doing everything right and they just ruin things for you, do they?
              Sorry to have to say this, but not assuming responsibility is one
              of the most obvious signs that you are living in denial.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Everything Has
              an Excuse</span>: "I'm not going to do this because..." "I would
              have done that, if not for..." Do you somehow manage to find
              excuses for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">everything</span>? Good
              for you, maybe you will find someone who pays you for that, but for
              the time being, your attitude is yet another sign that you are
              simply living in a fantasy world.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Everyone Else
              is Wrong</span>: Are all of the people who don't agree with you
              clueless? Are they that ignorant, can't they understand your
              brilliance? I'm sorry but, if that's the way you see things, I am
              afraid that the problem lies elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">One tip: it's not with
              everyone else.</span><br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">It's All One
              Big Conspiracy I Tell You</span>: Does it seem that everyone and
              their dog is working against you? Are you just a poor innocent
              victim in what seems to be one huge conspiracy against you? In that
              case, have you considered getting some help? No, everyone is not
              conspiring against you, and it's about time you stopped living in
              denial and started seeing how things actually stand</li>
              </ol>
              <p><span>Give it a little thought. Do any of these apply to
              you?</span></p>
