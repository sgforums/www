              <p>I also do not agree with SDP tactics of not focusing on elections.</p>
              <p>See:</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore's 'Martyr,' Chee Soon Juan</strong></p>
              <p><em><br> ...But one charge made by the government does stick: Mr. Chee is not
              terribly concerned about election results. Which is just as well,
              because his Singapore Democratic Party did not do very well in the May
              6 polls. It would be foolish, he suggests, for an opposition party in
              Singapore to pin its hopes on gaining one, or perhaps two, seats in
              parliament. He is aiming for a much bigger goal: bringing down the
              city-state’s one-party system of government. His weapon is a campaign
              of civil disobedience against laws designed to curtail democratic
              freedoms.<br><br> “You don’t vote out a dictatorship,” he says. “And basically that’s
              what Singapore is, albeit a very sophisticated one. It’s not possible
              for us to effect change just through the ballot box. They’ve got
              control of everything else around us.” Instead what’s needed is a
              coalition of civil society and political society coming together and
              demanding change—a color revolution for Singapore...</em></p>

              <p>One-party state? No thanks, i believe in political balancing instead of going political extreme. Who will there to question the government when PAP comes out with so called GST is to help the poor and more GST to push down your throat in future? Democracy is not perfect because human are imperfect. If the saints always become kings i don't mind <strong>monarchy or a<strong>ristocracy</strong> </strong>,but this is not the story if you refer back to history of mankind. That's why democracy should be staying for checks and balancing instead of one party state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the PAP during last election their party was directed to vote for someone who is not considered the best to be PM. You still want one party state to compromise Singapore?</p>
