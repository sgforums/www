              <p>It is interesting that you mentioned this question.</p>
              <p>I did think about the benefits of one-party state. I think it will be beneficial to the overall stability and strength of Singapore political, social, economic, security, and cultural needs.</p>
              <p>This question deserves further examination.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, not enough discussion is done on the downfalls and weaknesses or suitability of democracy, or multi-party democracy.</p>
              <p>Please dont be angry with me and say I am brainwashed.</p>
              <p>I do think it is abnormal when a leader is having 20% or 30% approval rate, like what happen in Japan and USA now.</p>
              <p>It is not good to have a leader who is seen not credible to lead.</p>
              <p>It is not good to have a process or athmosphere where a leader will inevitably come to this stage, unless he pander and follow polls.</p>
              <p>It is also not good when parlimentarians from different parties engage in horse trading, pork barrel spending, factional fighting, negative campainging, or even worse, a fundamentally weakening of a nation and its building block as a society when different parties represent their own ethnic, religious, or other fault lines.</p>
              <p>It's not clear to me why a nation should have competing managers or different channels of power. Why would that be beneficial compared to a centralized system?</p>
              <p>Soviet Union broke up because Gorbachev initiated "glasnot and perestroika" , Indonesia broke up and in chaos, even up to today there is religious clashes after the downfall of centralized Suharto system to introduce "democracy" and India is often compared to China and how it is lagging due to its messy "democracy" political system compared to China. I can also mention Malaysia where different ethnic groups are compartmentalized by their ethnic parties, a fundamental permanent weakening of their nation as "Malaysia". In another example, Thailand democracy brought years of political gridlock which the army had to step in and they manage to do that because of an "undemocratic" ideals found in the last safety valve which can unite the whole nation in an unchallenged authority, the Thai King. I need not mention Taiwan with its very messy political fights and the press who lambast each other.</p>
              <p>So it is really not clear to me what is the benefit of further democratization or liberalization, or more multi-party system.</p>
              <p>This question deserves a really hard look and an objective analysis.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, democracy is good on paper, but can be bad in real practice.</p>
