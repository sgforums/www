              <p>Effectively, I not sure how to describe the 3 opposition members in parlimern.</p>
              <p>I not sure how effective have they been.</p>
              <p>Every few years, singaporeans given chance to vote and each time, a few hundred thousand of them voted and indicated they don't wish to allow opposition enter the podium.</p>
              <p>This has been so endlessly for almost 50 years now.</p>
              <p>Any future election can lead to a 0 win for opposition. the chances are extremely high. Everytime many turnout for rally. They never win.</p>
              <p>Now, the ruling have many more activists. I think opposition run out of ideas.</p>
              <p>It may be their last election if they lose ppasir. will hg last under the hands of ltk?</p>
              <p>how effective can he be?  how can he out strategise? i sense a cyberwar already in action.</p>

              <p>I used to think that 2 or more parties as the ruling govt is good as there will be more vibrant and challenging, but then on the other hands, when i see other countries having lots of party having chaotic and power struggling problem rather than solving social issues, I decided that one party is also good in a sense that there will be less chaotic and better stability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However if there are good opposition party other than the present ruling party, i may consider to go for them, but it seem that opposition parties in singapore are also half standard type.</p>
