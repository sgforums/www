Lieutenants Ng Chin Fong and Divanadhari Ambat Chandrasekharan were each sentenced to nine months in jail for causing the death of Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai,<br>and each received another nine months for injuring Captain Ho Wan Huo. Their jail terms will run concurrently. Both commandos, who had stuck their<br>fingers in the traineesÂ’ noses to stop them from holding their breath, were held more culpable than the other two convicted officers. Captain Pandiaraj Mayandi was sent to jail for three months for instigating the dunkings, while Warrant Officer S Balakrishnan received a two-month jail term for failing to stop them.<br><br>During combat survival training (CST) at Pulau Tekong in August 2003, Sgt Hu<br>drowned after he was dunked repeatedly in a tub of seawater. Cpt Ho survived but had to be warded in intensive care. Yesterday, the court was packed with<br>friends, family members and colleagues of the four convicted men. Former trainees shook hands with them and gave them hugs and reassuring pats. In his oral judgment, District Judge Ng Peng Hong said the two lieutenants had<br>subjected the Â“defenceless traineesÂ” to treatment he deemed Â“shocking and senselessÂ”. Their Â“torturousÂ” and Â“inhumaneÂ” actions went beyond what was permitted.<br><br>As for the captain and warrant officer, DJ Ng said that by failing to do anything about the exercise, both men had exhibited callousness. The judge agreed with the prosecution that the manner in which the defence had been conducted must be considered in sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wee Soon said the lieutenants had called a defence witness who implied the police and prosecution had withheld some photographs. They had also made a Â“spurious allegationÂ” that the combat survival training lesson plan was nowhere to be found. In defending themselves, the officers had made allegations to bring Â“dishonour and disreputeÂ” to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).<br><br>In their mitigation pleas, lawyers for the four commandos tendered testimonials and highlighted their clientsÂ’ contributions to the SAF.<br>The officers also said they were sorry for Sgt HuÂ’s death and Capt HoÂ’s injuries.<br>But Mr Selva Naidu, who acted for Capt Pandiaraj, also said: Â“If dunking is wrong in itself, then it must be observed that the dunking carried out in the 80th CST was a result of not only of Capt PandiarajÂ’s briefing, but was also a result of systemic lapse.Â”<br><br>In turn, the prosecution noted that the captain had Â“a habit of blaming everyone else but himselfÂ”. Mr Alfonso Ang, who acts for Sgt HuÂ’s family, said: Â“The family has suffered much pain over EnhuaiÂ’s death and they hope to<br>overcome their grief as soon as possible. They now consider the matter closed.Â”<br>Capt Pandiaraj and Warrant Officer Balakrishnan, are appealing the judgeÂ’s decision. Â—<br></div>
