Their operations in Las Vegas actually derived 60pc of their profits from non gaming activites if i am not mistaken.<br><br>Genting can bring in the number of tourist. Trust them on that. Do u guys know that the annual tourists arrival for Genting Highlands alone is more than the total annual tourists into Singapore(of course there are quite a number of locals included but large ammount of them are foreigners)? More malaysians will come to Singapore because of the IRs. This is inevitable.</div>
