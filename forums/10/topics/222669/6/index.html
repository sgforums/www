True that the lower income will suffer because they also need to pay GST for basic necessity but this will be offset by all the additional GST collected. And the end of the day, they stand to benefit more than anyone else.<br><br>The corporates are happy that taxes are down. The high income earners are happy because they get to keep their hard earned rewards and the lower income are happy because they get more help then ever.<br><br></div></blockquote>How abt the middle class?? U understand that in order to qualify as a low income group and get help is not Easy... Increasing the GST affects the middle class the most which most singaporeans belong to... I still think they do not need to increase GST to raise revenues....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ProGovt:</div><div class="quote_body">You can't pleased everyone and it is only the small group of whiners that is complaining; and when you get frustrated and angry, the good ones is able to turn this into strength and get themselves out of the situtaion. It encourages fighting spirit and entrepreneurship; it makes the lazy and the incompetent to wake up from their idea and smell the reality.<br><br>Even God cannot help those that do not help themselves. So if you're unhappy because you feel that you're at the loosing end; then get off your lazy butt and do something!<br><br>I say this is the best strategy ever thought up. 3 cheers to PM Lee!</div></blockquote>In order for its pple to hv fighting spirit and entrepreneurship, Our leaders should demonstrate the same spirit too... Increasing GST to raise revenue is the easy or Lazy way out... I stress again... It's easy and it's lazy~!!<br><br>I suggest that they promote ourselves to other countries harder and start making fruitful investments other than Shin Corp Investments... They could keep acquiring companies overseas and maybe build up our brand name there   thereby increasing profit margins rather than increase price here~ This is wat I call fighting spirits and entrepreneurship~!</div>
