Fair and square across the board.</div></blockquote>*slaps forehead*<br><br>Certainly someone here hasn't heard about what a regressive tax is all about, and how GST is technically a regressive tax.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now, just to enlighten you a little, typing 'define: regressive tax' in Google yields the following definition:<br><br>'(Regressive tax) is a tax in which the poor pay a larger percentage of income than the rich. Progressive Tax is the exact opposite of regressive tax.'<br><br>Why is GST categorised as a regressive tax? Simple. When it comes to expenditure on basic necessities such as foodstuffs and water, comsumption patterns do not change much with rising income. Both rich men and poor men still have to eat rice. By increasing an across-the-board tax on everything including basic necessities, what you're doing is making the poor pay more for their necessities, i.e. taking out a larger percentage of their income.<br><br>The beef that we have with the increase in GST has nothing to do about the rich having to pay more for their luxury lifestyle. Rather, it has everything to do about the poor having to pay more for their meagre lifestyle. Unless you tell me that all poor men would break their bank accounts to eat caviar and drink chardonnay at every meal, you are in effect increasing the burden on them.<br><br>If they introduce a progressive tax that will increase taxes on luxury items, I might still be able to believe them, but to increase a regressive tax? Oh please... I'm not stupid enough to believe that that will work.<br><br>I will agree that there will be government handouts to the poor, but any handouts will be based on statistical data based on average consumption patterns. And as with any statistics, the law of averages tells us that there will always be people who will not be adequately represented by the data.<br><br>If a net monthly household income of $1000 is taken as the upper limit of lower-income families, then a household with an income of $1000 gets the handouts, while another household with an income of $1100 but with added burden of medical bills and what not doesn't get it.<br><br>In the end, to sum it up, this is what the increase in GST will do to the various income groups:<br><br>Low-income: Some will benefit if their consumption patterns are below the average and the handouts more than offset the rise in GST. Others with consumption patterns that go above the average will suffer a net loss.<br><br>Middle-income: No benefits from handouts, and with the largest burden of all since they have lower incomes than the high-income group.<br><br>High-income: No benefits from handouts, with a smaller burden than the middle-income group.<br><br>I hereby invite you to challenge my economic analysis.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Don't be a textbook idiot.<br></blockquote>I can agree that my economic analysis is a bit simplistic, but it's sound in its fundamentals.<br><br>So I'm a 'textbook idiot' for applying fundamental economic theory to Singapore's situation? Say whatever you will, but regressive taxes are a greater burden to the poor than to the rich wherever you are on earth. I am trying to work out the government's logic, and I still can't see the light of their reasoning.<br><br>And instead of having you challenge me on economic theory, I get empty rhetoric on how I should '....not take economics theory as applicable across all' as well as a personal attack on me, saying that I'm a 'textbook idiot'.<br><br>Kindly try explaining to me why Singapore's situation is so unique that basic economic theory does not apply here. Explain to me why a progressive tax system that imposes a smaller economic burden on the poor will not work, while a regressive tax will.<br><br>I think I can see your strategy here: 'If you can't question the guy's arguments, question the guy's credibility'.<br><br>Nice try, pointdexter.

By raising the 2% of GST is it helping the poor or is it helping the government itself? Seriously out of 4million of singaporean how many ppl is really that poor? Don't tell me the govt going to all the extra 2% to help all the poor in singapore? I don't think the ministers are all that capable if they have to spend $400,000 campaign to find out that marina bay should be call marina bay again. Also $30,000 on a campaign to find a name budget terminal which is eventually call budget terminal. if you call that smart and capable then i nothing to say. We even have MP's daughter coming out of the scene to disscrminate ppl who are 40s and his dad is on his side. So daughter of MP can anyhow talk? Ministers get so much pay and in the end government tell us that singaporean have to tackle on our own problem? Then i tackle my own problem and no welfare why i still need to pay tax? Seriously why civil servant deserve more pay? they say civil servant have to stay competitive with the private sector? Sure or not? Really private sector so high pay? I see a lot of ppl getting 1,300 - 1,500 a month for a poly graduate. And civil servant also getting around there.. Still need to increase? Seriously, singapore is a very peaceful country. We got a place to live and all that. But that doesn't mean that we can't improve anymore. We need a government to train a group of better Singaporean. At the same time take care of them. Not to really spoon feed them but rather change a better system.. You might say is easiler than done. But since they are getting so much pay.. They have the duty to do it.</div>

The only policy that works is to create equal opportunity for all and let the best and capable reach and take whatever their abilities allows them.<br><br>We complained about 2% GST increment.

GST is applicable for BOTH Luxury items and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DAILY NECESSITIES</strong></span>.... How can you say it is FAIR?<br><br>I can still do well with that 2% increase... What about those low-income households?  Are you going to say "cannot afford, then don't have babies?"... or cannot afford "eat less"?<br><br>Yes... we must make sure our ministers are well-paid to compensate them or should i quote "make their worth" (which todate is still questionable)... I understand that policy-making is not an easy job.... first and foremost, their job is to serve the public... not just the exclusive rich and famous...<br><br>This GST debate is not for the benefit for the RICH... it's the poor... GST increase will benefit the rich... not the poor... cos the poor will incur higher cost of living... and they won't be able to enjoy the tax savings (wat's there to tax?)...<br><br></div>
