            <div class='col-md body'>A couple of comments from fellow Singaporeans from asia1 forums:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">"Singapore key leaders and its ministers deserve good pay. Their pay could be above the benchmark level if they perform well. Any Singaporean has the equal right and opportunity to be a minister. It is not easy for some one to serve the country sincerely leaving their family behind and working for 24/7 w/o over-time compensation. I agree that they must be rewarded accordingly to attract future Singapore leaders."</span><br><br><strong>~Augustine Oei</strong><br><br>"Its amazing how our Govt feels that the civil servants and minsters are under-paid.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Look at the ground of the private sectors - we have to get tougher (not better paying) jobs overseas!<br>The Govt had previously pledged to reduce the size of civil service by at least one-third. That probably was not done but it's never measured anyway. The salaries of the ministers and top position holders were pegged to the top-6% of private sectors. So, how did they suddenly become underpaid?<br>Most private sectors' employees do not even get more than 1 month bonus this year and the civil service has announced 2.75 month!<br>If they just keep raising salaries across the public sector, without clear performance-linked measurements made transparent enough, I don't think it is going to be effective in retaining good talents - it shall be more of keeping the massive laggards while the real smaller group of talents will continue to move on.<br>We've a lot to learn from the successful large MNCs and global corporations..." </span><br><strong>~Bronson Ng</strong><br><br>"<span style="color: darkblue;">It is indeed an interesting article and the initial gut feel from reading this is the following:<br>1) Yes. I agree that market forces should decide where the salary levels head for all.<br>2) However, I would also like to know how the government will be accountable to the public in the case of benchmarking their aggregate / individual performance in line with the performance of the private sector.<br>3) This direct line of sight will enable a like-for-like comparison in terms of value per dollar obtained.<br>4) Other considerations in benchmarking should also be revalidated. Example would be the perception of an iron rice bowl (i.e. 5 year "contractual" term) for a minister versus that (i.e. hire and fire mentality) of a top notch banker or lawyer.<br><br>We want to retain the best possible talent to manage this country. The best buy-in is through an equitable and transparent benchmarking process leading to the pay increase decision managed around solid deliverables.<br><br>Thank you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Uh-huh. So to what level are they going to peg their pay to? Bill Gates? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I can't believe that they can actually make such a claim with a straight face. Even G W Bush (aka the most powerful man on earth) receives much less than what LHL is getting. If I hear anyone who dare say that LHL has a greater amount of responsibilities than Bush, I'm gonna start puking blood.<br><br>This nonsense is allowed to happen only because there are Singaporeans who would meekly accept it. Heck, when I raised the issue of LHL's pay relative to Bush's pay with my friends, they went so far as to claim that GW Bush receives 'under-the-counter' payments which we'll never hear of.<br><br>Under-the-counter my ass. When Al Gore was running for President, I remember reading that his net assets were worth just US$600k.<br><br>So let's sum it all up:<br><br>1. The higher-ups say that money to help the poor needs to come from somewhere.<br><br>2. This money has to come through the increase of across-the-board regressive taxes (aka GST) which will hit the poor more than the rich.<br><br>3. Ministers, who are already being paid much more than their US counterparts who have greater responsibilities supposedly 'deserve' more than what they're getting.<br><br>Let me see if I can try to make sense of all this warped logic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Using those wif household income of $1k.... Do you think u will ever bring their kids to Mac Donald's?? By then, hawker food would be more ex than ever~!<br><br>It oso affect the middle class... which most singaporeans belong to this category... Those wif many mouths to feed will hv trouble... Lesser savings or NO savings... 1 holiday per year or Even NO holiday...<br><br>The rich wun even bother gg to Mac Donalds how many times per day... or gg for holidays many times per year... with ONLY 2% increase... Do u think they really will spend less?? Yes... I agree they pay more GST here... But that does almost no damage for them... How abt the Poor? They are suffocating~!!<br><br>There are many avenues for the Country to increase our revenue... Wat they are doing rite now like opening doors in China, Europe for the earlier days... now for the Middle east, russia and india is Fine, drawing foreign direct investment etc... This strategy they know is out of date... our neighbours are doing the same thing... So our government hv decide to cross borders to draw revenues by going straight into their 'territory' by buying their banks, airline, telco etc.. When they Grow, We oso Grow~!! Keeping our currency relatively strong so that our Our Assets is worth more than our neighbouring countries etc...<br><br>Overall, they dun need the 2% increase in GST to bring in more revenue...</div>
