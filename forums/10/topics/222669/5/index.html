That's why the oppositions (WP and SDA) said that their elected candidates will quit their full-time job after they got elected into the Parliament and serve the people full-time.<br><br>And then PAP repelled by saying, those who can't handle MP job and their full-time job well are incompetent and they shouldn't be elected into the Parliament.

Firstly to make it worth their time and secondly, so that they stand more to loose with corruption.<br><br>Surely, you can now see why our Ministers needs to be paid more. Haven't this system worked well for Singapore for the last 41 years?<br><br>I support the govt policies because looking at the bigger picture than oneself, I see the country benefiting more. It is a very fair system and one that only the most brilliant of minds can come out with. MM once said that every country has to find their own path that will befit their own country.<br><br>Increasing GST across the board is fair because you pay according to your spending habits. True that the lower income will suffer because they also need to pay GST for basic necessity but this will be offset by all the additional GST collected. And the end of the day, they stand to benefit more than anyone else.<br><br>The corporates are happy that taxes are down. The high income earners are happy because they get to keep their hard earned rewards and the lower income are happy because they get more help then ever.<br><br>You can't pleased everyone and it is only the small group of whiners that is complaining; and when you get frustrated and angry, the good ones is able to turn this into strength and get themselves out of the situtaion. It encourages fighting spirit and entrepreneurship; it makes the lazy and the incompetent to wake up from their idea and smell the reality.<br><br>Even God cannot help those that do not help themselves. So if you're unhappy because you feel that you're at the loosing end; then get off your lazy butt and do something!<br><br>I say this is the best strategy ever thought up. 3 cheers to PM Lee!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3 cheers my behind....while refusing to have minimum wage for the lower income, they are insisting their own minimum income...poppycock....tens of thousands are earning incomes sub $1.5k and they are not lazy as you brand them....one minister's pay covers probably about 50000 of such folks....no one is begrudging good salaries for them, the current scale is more than sufficient and generous..and with the lifetime pension they will be receiving, the question is do they need more? anyone who has difficulty with a million dollar salary definitely lacks moral character...<br><br>in an open society, there is no shortage of people willing to serve and that includes the talented ones....developed countries' politicians are granted comfortable wages and many were successful in their private careers before joining politics..and they don't ask how much is the pay....here we have a unique situation where the so-called talents have tons of money thrown at them and promises of lifetime security....chan soon sen was a minister of sate, then lhl dumped him and weeks later chan was given a cushy job by an ex-mp in a quasi-govt co. so you see, these guys have no need for more money, they have the network....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Points to note:<br><br>- Most of the poodles are elected through the backdoor. The peasants did not vote for them as these junior poodes were brought in without any real test.<br><br>- Excellent Educational Qualification do not equal to High Moral. Just look at the mess caused by local professor. He was also "actively" involved in "community" work but his focus was bedding the foreign talent.<br><br>- Questions on whether the poodle's job is to serve the peasants or their master. Just look at the recent fee hike. Not one of them expressed any objection. They are only keen to learn how to dance.<br><br>- Are all the Poodles present at the weekly "Meet the Peasant" session or the stand-in were sent in ? Or they are only showing face when there are special boot-licking functions ?<br><br>- Gauge of performance for the Poodle. There is no accountability on the individual poodle's performance. So, on what basis can they ask for a raise ? If they want the money, solve the social problem and start doing some real work instead of all the wayang. They are elected to solve problems, not to show their face.<br><br></div>
