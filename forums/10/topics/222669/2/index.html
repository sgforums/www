I wasn't calling MM Lee a prophet as in definition than an expression.<br><br>When Jesus was entering the city of Jerusalem, his home town, people questioned his authenticity as they knew him and his family. Jesus was there to deliver the Jews but yet they treated him with doubt and jealousy. Hence, Jesus made the comment that a prophet is seldom welcome in his own country.<br><br>I used the phrase to draw similarly between the way Singaporean are treating MM and the way the Jews treated Jesus and I'm sure fellow Christians will not be offended.<br><br>That being said, this discussion on religion should end here<br><br>And when he does go, inevitably. I hope he'll keep to his promise to rise from his grave if Singapore runs into trouble. Maybe only then, through the baptism of fire, will Singaporeans truly realize how much we have benefited. .</div></blockquote>You not only quote that passage from Luke 4:24.<br><br>You compare him to Christ, "promise to rise from his grave", isn't that tantamount to comparing him to the resurrection of Christ.<br><br>What "baptism of fire"?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Baptism of fire is a commonly used expression to describe trouble times and testings. Yes it is from the bible, again.<br><br>Yes -  its from the bible<br><br>Wrong - its not commonly used expression to describe troubled times and testings especially when you are talking bout an individual or politics.<br><br>Singaporeans are pampered, we have been placed in a position of advantage but we are too lazy to make full use of what we have. We have more opportunities to succeed but we expect success to be deliver to us. - Thats your opinion<br><br>Sometimes, people have to loose what they have to truly understand the value of it. That is what I was trying to say. - so are you amounting that the loose of MM is equal to the Singaporeans as to the loose of Jesus to Jews?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
