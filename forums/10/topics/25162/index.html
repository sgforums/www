It was on their website a few months ago.<br><br>Well, like the Bionix project, the pictures or info about light tank for SAF is not going to appear in public domain for the next 2 to 3 years until SAF is happy with the vechicle and mass production begins.<br><br>There are also a couple of threads in this forum on this topics already.  There are even discussion about what tanks are the most suitable replacement for the 60+ SAF Centurions.<br><br>Anyway, my gut feeling says that we will soon see 105mm armed Bionix and Terrix variants.<br><br>..and I am hoping that SAF will also consider the 120mm armed CV90 as the centurion replacement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Are you thinking of the USMC Sheridan M551 alike?<br><br>I personally think that a M8 AGS, Stingray type light tank should be acquired. However, I don't think SAF needs to replace SM1 with the new light tank on a 1 to 1 basis.<br><br>Furthermore, I see that the Bionix 25mm armed version can add anti-armour missiles as part of its armament. Two individual launch tubes can be mounted each on the side of the turret like that of the LAV-25 Tow armed version.  Given Sg can license build Spikes, I think it will not be too difficult to integrate the Spikes unto the Bionix turrets.<br><br>I also think that Bionix can also carry a turret similar to the UMSC AAV7s with the CIS 40 AGL and 0.5 HMG, which gives better protection to the gunner. See pics below:<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/pmcmssr/armorupdate.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/pmcmssr/lvtp-28.jpg"></a><span style="font-style: italic;">if you don't see above pic, click on the image holder area and you will get to a page that has got the drawing of the AAV7 40/50 turret...Scroll to the bottom and click on the image of the right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </span><br><br>As for the light tank, we can marry a foreign turret to the Bionix chassis, for example, the Textron 105mm turrent:<br><a href="http://www.tmls.textron.com/Programs/LAND/Turrets/turrets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmls.textron.com/Programs/LAND/Turrets/turrets.htm</a><br><blockquote><br>For MBT, most probably it will be 2nd hand thick armour Makera MBT (Mk 2 or 3) at dirt cheap price to replace the Centurions.</blockquote>I doubt this will happen because the Merkava Mk2 and Mk3 are way too heavy for SAF.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is do we require a light tank armed with an underpowered gun?!?<br>To engage a top of the line MBT with composite layered armour plus reactive armour plates, even a 120mm round /w depleted uranium penetrator head may not warrant a kill.<br><br>To destroy a bunker/soft armour vehicle?!? might as well use a chain cannon and AGL to do the job.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">I doubt this will happen because the Merkava Mk2 and Mk3 are way too heavy for SAF.<br>[/img]</div></blockquote>It might be heavy but the average ground pressure per square inch is no more than the centurion tank, surprise, surprise...Advantage of the Merkava is a rugged/battle proven tank, simple to operate/maintain and can carry many many rounds, heavily armoured, low profile and able to carry a section of troopers, good for urban warfare or as a dig in defence weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the army is in no hurry to replace its current tanks.. the amx-13 or sm1. due to our terrain...to have a tank warfare on this island would be a disadvantage.to put it in simple terms..infantry or guards unit will be able to destory enemy tanks faster in urban areas..with spike anti tank missiles; rather than send tanks to engage them one by one..  In any warfare, bring able to defeat the enemy within a short time is one of the key factors. Wit the purchase of the AH-64D attack helicopters...there is no urgent need to replace all the tanks in saf inventory. Probably..what we need is a light mobile tank equipped with a powerful cannon... 120mm type..that should be adequate enough... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i  think at this moment SG tends to be concentrating on the APache tank buster.20 apaches is consider only a small amount to begin with if the Concept is real that SAF is using Apache as a primary defence against aggressor MBT instead of 120/105 mm guns mounted on some tanks.i doubt 20 will be enough i believ at least 50 apache will be acquire in the future including the 20 heli,it might be send to brunei , thai or taiwan to coordinate with the SAF troops present in those country  for training purpose.....since apache often need ground troopers coordination to take out our hidden<br>soldier who is carrying portable SAM which is unseen to the apache eyes.<br>I still think that SM1 scrap metal should thrown into the garbge dump.........</div>
