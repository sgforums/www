            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, a crazy idea is going on in my head now.  We all know a Predator UAV was armed with a Hellfire missile, and fired it at some unidentified men, believed to be part of the Al Qaeda Leadership.<br><br>We also read reports on the newspapres about armed unmanned air vehicles.<br><br>I would like to take this one step further.  An Armed air armada/battle group.<br><br>Basically, it would consist of one Large EAW aircraft (the eyes), and a Carrier Plane (the so called "carrier" of the skies.)<br><br>Given the current technology, precise GPS systems, airborn radar technology, "inflight refueling" technology, I believe it soon introduce a air carrier battle group.<br><br>Consists of, Advanced Armed UAV flights serving flyinG CAPs around the formation.  These UAVs are preferably armed with AMRAAMs or a longer ranged version of the AMRAAMs, for air to air engagements.  Movements and positioning of the UAVs around the formations should hopefully be computerized, with instructions relaying from the "eyes."  As the Eyes detects targets at long range, and vector the UAVs to a firing solution.  Once achieved, the Eyes will paint the targets providing initial guidance for the Missiles released by the UAVs.  Missiles will intercept targets, as second echelons of UAV will be directed towards the engagement.  UAVs that have expended their munitions can then be guided back to the carrier to be recovered, re fuel and re arm.<br><br>How to recover?  Basically, the Eyes will provide the location of the carrier, and the UAVs will feedback via GPS or even the Eyes.  The Eyes will steer the UAVs to the rear of the carrier.  Imagine a mid-air refueling situation, except that a smaller plane is actuallying being recovered by a larger one.<br><br>Hopefully, future UAVs will be able to carry more weapons, and have on board active sensors.  UAVs can be hopefully re-equipped to fly a variety of sorties, from SEAD, to CAS.  Even air combat.<br><br>Force composition would be something like...<br><br>- 1 EAW aka as the Eyes.  Mother ship to UAVs.<br><br>- 1 Carrier, to recover, launch and rearm UAVs.<br><br>- 1 Electronic Warfare aircraft, assists in gathering intelligence.<br><br>- Perhaps a few escorting F-16s or any jets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>read an article once regarding a similar concept as wat u tokking. basically ppl were tokkin bout the idea of establishing the future of air combat with unmanned fighter aircraft.<br>obvious advantage would be minimal to no casualty of pilots. guess who scorned this idea the most? the pilots themselves. the pilots refuse to believe that machines and computers can do their jobs as well or even better. the article (not me) said pilots feel a certain pride in being the few ppl capable of combat flights, like elite combatants. the article ended by saying to pave the way for such a future it is the pilots themselves who must first change their attitudes.<br>sori i cannot remember where i read this article and i stress it was wat the article roughly said and not my views. as for me, well, i guess we all, not just combat pilots, feel threatened with the prospect of having our role in work/society/combat replaced by machines and computers.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Air carrier would have to have extremely long endurance, as well as the capability to carry a meaningful load(at least 20) of strike and interceptor aircraft, their fuel and munitions. Only possible(if at all possible) option would be a lighter-than-air craft, however, they wont really be very survivable in the theater of operations, right? Furthermore, its destruction would mean bye bye for all the parasite aircraft it carries. Besides, why duplicate the sea-based aircraft carrier? The only advantage such a system would have is instant deployability, giving quick reaction to a crisis. But you wont even have time to build up a viable database of targets yet, so.....<br>This idea has been tested before, about 50 years ago. The prototpe XF-85 Goblin, which first flew in 1948, was a fighter prototype designed for launch and recovery from the B-36 bomber. The idea failed terribly, as docking with the mother-ship proved too difficult. Now, GPS helps a lot, and the idea you suggested can be replaced with a much better automated carrier landing system under trial by the US Navy.<br>It is based on a differential GPS location system. It works by comparing the coordinates of the incoming craft's with the coordinates of the carrier's, thus giving landing accuracies to within inches, as carrier landings have 2B very precise. This system has been very successful, and could possibly be adapted to your aerial carrier system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, but nowadays, with in flight refueling being accomplished readily, the next step would actually be docking a tiny aircraft within a mother ship wouldn't it?<br><br>The idea for this air-carrier, is basically to reduce the workload and the number of pilots being involved in a CAP or missions similar to fightersweeps.  Without losing valuable pilots to such encounters, whether by SAM or not.<br><br>Of course, the actual planes involved would preferably have stealthy designs.  With BVRAAM technology improving, these missiles should launched from a drone platform.  Whereas delivery of PGMs should still be undertaken by pilots.</div>
