              <p><strong>Omar Bongo, world's longest-serving president dies; his country of Gabon closes its borders </strong></p>
              <p><em class="timedate">June  8</em></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>LIBREVILLE, Gabon - Gabon's President Omar Bongo,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> the world's
              longest-serving president whose 42-year rule</em></span> was a throwback to an era
              when Africa was ruled by "Big Men," died of cardiac arrest in a Spanish
              hospital on Monday. He was 73.</p>
              <p>Doctors at the Quiron Clinic in Barcelona announced Bongo's death
              around 2:30 p.m., Gabonese Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong said. Bongo
              was admitted to the hospital last month.</p>
              <p>In Gabon, the government responded by announcing the closure of the
              country's international airport and all of its land and sea borders,
              and the mood in Libreville, the capital, appeared tense, as security
              forces fanned out and took positions in front of key government
              buildings and important electrical installations.</p>
              <p>People rushing to get home as soon as the news was announced caused
              huge traffic jams. Some residents could be seen hurrying home with rice
              bags, apparently to stockpile food in advance of possible store
              closures.</p>
              <p>The country's constitution calls for Senate leader to assume power
              and organize presidential elections in 90 days of Bongo's death. But
              there has been speculation that one of Bongo's sons - who is currently
              minister of defence - would try to seize power upon his father's death,
              as happened in nearby Togo.</p>
              <p>Hours before Bongo's death, Ndong had said in Barcelona that he saw
              the president and declared him "alive and well." Gabonese officials had
              become increasingly belligerent with journalists, including calling a
              meeting with the French ambassador in Gabon in order to scrutinize the
              coverage of the president's death by French media outlets.</p>
              <p>Bongo, who was believed to be one of the world's wealthiest leaders,
              became the longest-ruling head of government - a category that does not
              include the monarchs of Britain and Thailand - when Cuba's Fidel Castro
              handed power to his brother last year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bongo had kept a tight grip on
              power in the oil-rich former French colony since he became president in
              1967, and his ruling party has dominated the country's parliament for
              decades. Opposition parties were only allowed in 1990, amid a wave of
              pro-democracy protests. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Elections since then have been marred by allegations of rigging and
              unrest. In 2003, parliament - dominated by his supporters - removed
              presidential term limits from the constitution.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>While most Gabonese genuinely feared Bongo and there was little
              opposition, many accepted his rule because he had kept his country
              remarkably peaceful and governed without the sustained brutality
              characteristic of many dictators. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Bongo, meanwhile, amassed a fortune that made him one of the world's
              richest men, according to Freedom House, a private Washington-based
              democracy watchdog organization, although nobody really knows how much
              he was worth.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, a French judge decided to investigate Bongo and
              two other African leaders on accusations of money laundering and other
              alleged crimes linked to their wealth in France.</p>
              <p>The probe followed a complaint by Transparency International France,
              an association that tracks corruption. French media have reported that
              Bongo's family owns abundant real estate in France - at one time owning
              more properties in Paris than any other foreign leader.</p>
              <p>Born Albert Bernard Bongo on Dec. 30, 1935, the youngest of 12
              children, Bongo served as a lieutenant in the French air force, then
              climbed quickly through the civil service, eventually becoming
              vice-president. He assumed the presidency Dec. 2, 1967, after the death
              of Leon M'Ba, the country's only other head of state since independence
              from France in 1960.</p>
              <p>Bongo set up a one-party state. Six years later, he converted to Islam and took the name Omar.</p>
              <p>His presidential security staff numbered 1,500, according to the
              U.S. State Department, while the entire military numbers just 10,000
              troops.</p>
              <p>Bongo sought international approval and in May 2004 he visited
              then-President George W. Bush at the White House. He also tried to cast
              himself as a mediator, working to end conflicts in Chad and Central
              African Republic, where his country has a small contingent of
              peacekeepers.</p>
              <p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his "sadness and emotion"
              at Bongo's death on Monday and pledged that France would remain "loyal
              to its long relationship of friendship" with Gabon.</p>
              <p>"It is a great and loyal friend of France who has left us - a grand
              figure of Africa and a chief of state who knew how to win the esteem
              and the respect of all of his peers, notably for his numerous
              initiatives in favour of peace on the African continent," Sarkozy said
              in a statement.</p>
              <p>Gabon is the fifth-biggest oil exporter in sub-Saharan Africa, and
              Bongo built a vast system of patronage, doling out largesse in part
              through the salaries and benefits that came with cabinet posts.</p>
              <p>But oil dependency means the country has more oil pipeline (1,425
              kilometres) than paved roads (937 kilometres). Only one per cent of its
              land is cultivated and Gabon produces virtually no food. Instead,
              basics such as tomatoes are imported from France, the former colonial
              master, and neighbouring Cameroon, pushing prices so high that
              Libreville, the capital, is the world's eighth most expensive city,
              according to Employment Conditions Abroad International.</p>
              <p>Ndong, the prime minister, went on state TV in Gabon late Sunday
              night to deny news reports in the French media that Bongo had died,
              saying: "I was surprised - like many of my compatriots - to learn from
              French TV that the president of Gabon is dead," he said.</p>
              <p>"If such a thing were to happen, I believe and I know that the
              family of President Bongo would inform me. That is not the case for the
              moment. I have not been told of the death of the president of Gabon,"
              he said.</p>
              <p>Just hours later, he flew to Spain to hold a news conference at the
              Quiron Clinic, where he declared that the president was fine. At that
              time, he continued to insist that the head of state was only at the
              hospital for a checkup.</p>
