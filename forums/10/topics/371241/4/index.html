              <p>It will be the toughest choice a nation would have to bear in the search for our next Prime Minister, the leader and voice of our society.</p>
              <p>No human mortal can live forever, and let us all be glad that the present administrators are actively seeking for that special leader to groom and prepare him/her for the anointed day, otherwise only chaos and bitter infighting will occur if the succession is thrown into doubt due to unforseen circumstances.</p>
              <p>Whoever he is, and whatever political party he belongs to, I am sure that the anointed one had already been chosen by destiny to lead us Singaporeans, a special people in this world.</p>
              <p>The present ruling party is taking no chances on fate, but are actively seeking amongst those in their 30s or 40s, whom are matured and responsible to wear that mantle of leadership. It is an awesome responsibility, make no mistake, for those who choose and the chosen one.</p>
              <p>The rest of us can only give our support, and must be total, for the one chosen, to lead us to greater heights than ever before. Money must not be an issue, but the critical issue is that each and everyone of us citizens are uplifted by him/her and will be able to lead a quality life, if not a materially rich one, when none gets left behind.</p>
              <p>He who will be chosen is not an immortal, and certainly not one who does no wrong. He is someone who had fallen, but had courageously risen above,made good his mistakes and beyond, and is a role model to us all. There is no flawless man in humanity, so too must we beware one whom is claimed to have no flaws.</p>
              <p>He who has no flaws is no human, and will not comprehend human compassion to lead others.</p>
              <p>May our society and its representatives make the right choice and heaven help us.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore is "Grooming youth leaders"</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>By
              now you must know Singapore is a weird country with some weird
              practices. For instance unlike any other country, bringing chewing gum
              to Singapore is illegal! Unlike any other country, peaceful protests
              and public speaking is not allowed! Judges have 2 roles to play, one as
              a judge and the other as a government politician. This is what they do,
              when they are periodically called upon to abuse the law to punish
              critics of the government! <br><br>Although it claims to be a first
              world country, it brutally whips criminals like in Iran and hangs petty
              drug mules even if they had with them as little as 14.9 grams of heroin
              for personal consumption! And while they beat and they hang people (I
              understand it has the highest rates of execution in the world), they
              allow murderers to escape the noose if they could come up with some
              silly excuse, such as depression! All Singapore newspapers need a
              government licence to operate. And you guessed it, all Singapore
              newspapers are owned and controlled by them. And yes, you guessed it
              again. What you read in them is propaganda, since what else could you
              expect from a state controlled press!<br><br>You can read all these weird goings on in the newspapers of this Alice in Wonderland of a country, Singapore. <br><br>Take
              this for instance. Singapore's state controlled press, the online
              edition of the Straits Times of March 22, 2009 has this story <em>"Grooming youth leaders". </em>In
              it is described another weird practice, that of the government going
              around the island looking for leaders! In the story, Goh Chock Tong,
              the senior minister (another weird name for a politician since he has
              no particular duties and yet is paid a salary of not less than $3.7
              million a year, for basically doing nothing) has officially announced
              that he and<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> his friends have begun going around the island to look for
              political leaders for his government!</strong></span></span><br><br>I had written about this
              unusual activity in my earlier post some time ago. Think of it. In <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>any
              other country, politicians become politicians because that is what they
              chose to do and there is no need to persuade them to do it.</strong></span></span> But by
              their own admission, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore is incapable of producing any leaders so
              much so that the government has to deliberately go around the country
              to persuade people into becoming leaders, PAP leaders, that is! </strong></span></span>According to Goh chock Tong, once he locates such leadership potential,
              the shortlisted candidates would be promptly sent off for leadership
              training and thereafter appointed ministers in his cabinet!<br><br>Surely
              if they have to do this, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>there must be something seriously wrong with
              that country. It is quite obvious from this that Singaporeans by and
              large have completely shut off their minds to any form of political
              activity,</strong></span></span> unless it is political activity which is approved by Lee Kuan
              Yew and his minions. What you do get in the end is not true leaders who
              are prepared to speak their minds fearlessly, but opportunists who see
              advantage in being second fiddle to Lee Kuan Yew and his ideas of
              government. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>40 years of state persecution against dissenting
              views by Lee Kuan Yew has successfully shut out any semblance of
              independent thinking in the island. </strong></span></span>Take for instance the case of the
              Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean who so flagrantly abused legal process during
              the 3 day defamation trial of Lee Kuan Yew against Dr. Chee Soon Juan,
              May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008. I was there in her Singapore courtroom to
              see that shameful spectacle where she acted as if her job was to permit
              Lee Kuan Yew to get away with anything he wanted with a resultant fine
              of $410,000.00 against Dr. Chee. I was not the only one in that
              courtroom who saw the abuse of legal process. Yet not a single
              Singaporean present had the courage to write about it, as it is, except
              of course for Dr. Chee himself. I did write about it, and as a result,
              you know what happened. I was sent to prison for 3 months for my
              efforts. Anyone else who had any leadership in him, would have done
              exactly what I did, which is to say it as it is. But not in Singapore
              where the people have been terrified beyond their wits even to show the
              slightest of courage. <br><br>The only other country which practices
              this form of selected succession of a leader is Tibet. There the high
              priests scour the country looking for a child who shows the makings of
              a Dalai Lama, who is then taken from his parents and ensconced in the
              monastery to be groomed into a Dalai Lama. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It might be all right for a
              theocracy of the middle ages but if this is the practice to be adopted
              for a so called first world country, let me tell you this. Singapore is
              in more trouble than you think it is.</strong></span></span><br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Consider the fact that the post of Prime Minister basic qualification is to be a Singapore citizen. Isnt then a truth that one amongst us is 'destined' to be a Prime Minister? Is there anything strange at all in that statement?</p>
