              <p>Singapore’s Health Minister Mr Khaw Boon Wan is full of praise of Singapore’s healthcare system as he tried to promote it as a model for other countries to emulate at the “Healthcare in Asia” conference.</p>
              <p>Sharing the Singapore experience, he said that keeping politics out of healthcare and minimizing market distortions is the key to create a “sustainable” healthcare system in Singapore.</p>
              <p><em>“The more politicians do not speak the truth…for example, ‘healthcare is free, vote for me, I will give you free medicine’……(By saying this), you distort the market because you do not allow facts and rational thinking to surface,”</em> he was quoted as saying in Channel News Asia.</p>
              <p>Vijay Vaitheeswaran, health correspondent from the The Economist commented on Singapore:</p>
              <p><em>“The thing to remember about Singapore is that it has an extraordinary value conscious health system with a relatively low spending per GDP and a high contribution by the individual.”</em></p>
              <p>Though Singapore is the second richest country in Asia after Japan and its leaders are the highest paid in the entire world, Singaporeans enjoy few social welfare benefits compared to citizens in other first world countries.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s total healthcare spending is a miserable less than four per cent of its GDP, which is a relatively low figure compared to other countries while the state can afford to lose billions of dollars of national reserves in failed overseas investments via its two sovereign wealth funds.</p>
              <p>The government has constantly maintained that the public healthcare system is “heavily subsidized” in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is a common saying among Singaporeans – “one can afford to die, but not fall sick in Singapore.”</p>
              <p>A single hospital admission, a few days’ stay in the ICU or a major operation in a public hospital will suffice to wipe out the Medisave and savings of some Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With healthcare costs going up, Mr Khaw had encouraged Singaporeans to send their elderly parents to nursing homes in Johor if they cannot afford nursing care here.</p>
              <p>His remarks sparked a massive outcry among Singaporeans and he eventually backed down, claiming that he was “misquoted” by the media.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw should not be too concerned about politics being mixed with healthcare in Singapore as there is hardly any politics here to speak of.</p>
              <p>There are only two opposition MPs in the Singapore parliament. His party controls 82 out of 84 seats in Parliament and can pass any bills as and when it wishes too.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Mr Khaw should remind his audience that Singapore is able to maintain such an “extraordinary value conscious health system” for so long precisely because there is no opposition to hold the PAP to task for spending so little on healthcare in Parliament.</p>

              <p>Indeed, Singapore health system is so market oriented that many doctors become money first, patients' suffering last.</p>
              <p>For example, a patient that needs a major operation which can make a patient paralyses or even dies if the operation goes wrong. The subsidized patient will still be operated by a newly qualified surgeon who might do the operation first time and the patient has no choice but to accept it as the patient is a subsidized patient.</p>
              <p>While a private patient will get a choice of the very senior surgeon to operate. Since both the very senior surgeon and newly qualified surgeon are both the staff of the government hospitals, shouldn't the welfare of the patient be of the first priority instead based on the ability to pay ?</p>
