              <p>Terrorism is a state of mind, and hardly limited to any group of people. If the underlying reasons for the LTTE's birth is not dealt with, another version of it would be birthed in its place.</p>

              <p><strong>The making of a militant leader </strong></p>
              <p>Interview with VELUPILLAI PRABAKARAN:</p>
              <p><span style="color: red; font-size: small;">…Do you take the
              commitment to Eelam as a serious political proposition for the Tamil
              side — not just speaking for yourself or the LTTE? Or is it a
              bargaining position, meaning you won’t give this up until an
              alternative — a lesser political proposition — would come on the
              agenda? Do you seriously believe that the struggle for Tamil Eelam can
              be waged on a political front under the present circumstances and
              seeing the position taken by India? </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red; font-size: small;"> “Backward-looking mode” </span></p>
              <p>Certainly. If you look at our historical background, our experience
              of struggle over 30 years or so has brought us inescapably to this
              determination. Therefore we consider that only Tamil Eelam can be a
              secure outcome for us and there can be no alternative to this. The
              demands have evolved in stages. In 1961, our people in their struggle
              for a federal set-up conducted a satyagraha that brought the
              administration to a standstill. In 1961 itself, the demand for a
              federal solution was sharp and intense. What is taking place today
              seems (laughs ironically)... a backward-looking process…</p>
              <p><span style="color: red; font-size: small;">…Could you give us an
              idea of your personal heroes in revolutionary struggles or liberation
              movements or in any sphere of life..... people and experiences that
              have inspired you? And perhaps thereby give us some insight into your
              own political evolution from the time you were a schoolboy? </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my boyhood, the struggle that attracted me most was the Indian
              freedom struggle. The role of Netaji attracted me very much. I was
              brought up in an environment of strict discipline from childhood. I was
              not permitted to mingle freely with outsiders. I used to feel shy of
              girls. Great store was laid by personal rectitude and discipline. My
              father set an example through his own personal conduct: He would not
              even chew betel leaves. I modelled my conduct on his..... he was a
              government officer, a district land officer. A very straightforward
              man. People say in our area: “When he walks, he does not hurt even the
              grass under his feet, but his son is so.....” Even while criticising
              me, they marvel at the fact that such a son was born to such a father!
              He was strict, yes, but also soft and persuasive. In my own case, he
              reasoned rather than regimented and his attitude was that of a
              friend..... he would give me certain pieces of advice and discuss
              things with me. As I said, I grew up as a shy boy.....especially in the
              matter or mingling with girls.</p>
              <p>The life of Subhas Chandra Bose attracted me specially. Even as a
              boy, I would delve into Gandhiji’s books on experiments with truth, on
              celibacy and so on. Subhas attracted me particularly since even as a
              boy he went in search of spiritualism and, finding the life of a
              recluse dissatisfying, returned (laughs)….I followed this history and
              these stories with fascination. He became my special hero and some of
              his orations gripped me. For example: “I shall fight for the freedom of
              my land until I shed my last drop of blood.” These words used to thrill
              me whenever they came to me. Then the story of Bhagat Singh fascinated
              me.</p>
              <p>In other words, the biographies and histories of those who hit back
              at the perpetrators of injustice, those who counterattacked (the unjust
              foe) were my special favourite. Because in our land, the Sinhalese
              behaved so cruelly towards us..... we would hear stories about this and
              read about these cruel acts in books and newspapers..... Later I read
              about this particular episode that took place during the 1958 attacks
              on Tamils.....they broke into a temple at Panadura, found a Brahmin
              priest sleeping, tied him to his cot, poured petrol over him and burnt
              him alive. Ours was a god-fearing society and the people were
              religious-minded. The widespread feeling was: when a priest like him
              was burnt alive, why did we not have the capability to hit back? That
              was one atrocity that made people think deeply. In another episode,
              they threw a child into a drum of boiling tar. This left a very deep
              imprint on my mind and in the minds of those around me. If such
              innocent lives could be destroyed, why could we not strike back?</p>
              <p>…. If I was attracted by the experience of armed struggle against
              injustice, I was drawn by the moral force of ahimsa as well. I was
              inspired by examples of grit and determination. I began to think along
              these lines early in life..... why can’t we follow their example? why
              can’t we start an armed struggle?</p>
              <p>I used to read books on the rise of Napoleon and his exploits.....
              this kind of history held special appeal.....in the Mahabharata, the
              roles of Bhima and Karna were specially attractive to me..... the
              spirit of sacrifice appeared crucial. People respond to characters in
              the Mahabharata in various ways. I value the character and role of
              Karna the most, on account of his readiness to make the ultimate
              sacrifice..... I read some of Vivekananda’s sayings and the urge grew
              in me to work towards a strong youth force. I plunged into this line of
              thinking..... At what age? These feelings and ideas began to take shape
              when I was 16 approximately. I used to listen to the religious
              discourses of Kripananda Variar..... I used to go to all these
              events..... those connected with religion..... I would go and observe
              political meetings-attend dramatic performances..... in my place, they
              used to enact plays on Socrates and so on.</p>
              <p>So quite early on, we absorbed all these influences and the feeling
              grew in us that we must do something! Looking at our historical
              background, we had to take up arms to fight for our rights. The lesson
              was that they could do all this because we were defenceless and
              disarmed. Why should we remain so? We should take up violence to
              counter and overthrow their violence...Only after that did I engage in
              this movement...</p>

              <p><strong>When Pigs Fly–and Scold: Brits Lecturing Sri Lanka!</strong></p>
              <p>By War Nerd</p>
              <p>You see some pretty sick stuff when you do my job, but I just read
              something sicker than any Congo cannibal buffet. It’s an article by a
              posh little limey named Jeremey Brown condemning the Sri Lankan
              government for being too messy in putting down the LTTE, and <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6329468.ece?openComment=true">demanding that we stop buying the cheap textiles </a>the poor Sinhalese make their living churning out.</p>
              <p>What’s sick about this is that the British establishment destroyed
              the Sinhalese people completely. Completely and purposely,
              sadistically. Stole their land, humiliated and massacred their
              government, made it Imperial policy to erase every shred of
              self-respect the Sinhalese had left. </p>
              <p>You can talk about the Nazis all
              day long, but for my money nothing they did was as gross as what you
              find out when you actually look into the history of British-Sinhalese
              relations. If you can even call them “relations”; I guess a murder-rape
              is a relation, sort of...</p>
