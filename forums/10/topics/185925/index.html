They punched my face, and kicked me in the stomach.'<br><br>She covered her face but the men continued to hit her around her head and neck.<br><br>Madam Koh was seven months pregnant with a boy and, during her ordeal, she heard someone say in Malay: 'She's pregnant, don't kick her.'<br><br>The attackers took her handbag, containing RM1,000 ($440), as well as her ATM and credit cards before fleeing.<br><br>It was too late when her husband, who had gone to the cashier, rushed her to the hospital.<br><br>They lost the baby the next day.<br><br>This is Madam Koh's second miscarriage. Two years ago, her five-month-old foetus suddenly stopped growing.<br><br>Her husband said that they were shaken, but still hoped to have more children in the future.<br></div>
