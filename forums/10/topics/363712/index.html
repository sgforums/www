              <p>Might want to take a look at what the Chinese has been actually buying with those US dollars they've been getting. Major mining and oil contracts, they've been buying up commodities left right and center.</p>
              <p>So often we forget that physical resources have more actual value than paper currency.</p>
              <p>None of the major nations would profit from the US collapsing right now. There just isn't any suitable replacement and no one desires the chaos that would arise from it.</p>
              <p>China may be authoritarian and despotic but nothing they've been doing so far seems to indicate to me that they're either stupid or helpess.</p>
              <p>Unlike America, they are not limited to plans that only spans the current presidential term.</p>

              <p>China understand the need of resources and power, ie oil and minerals in their economy progress,  without a deep control of all these resources needed for industrialisation blooming, they may have to pay higher price or face trouble such as sanction if they do not get it now, especially at a lower price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the chip on the table now give china a better negotiation power with America, with most of US asset under Chinese ownership, the Chinese sure know wha they doing</p>

              <p>And what do you need when the economy starts to pick up again?- Physical resources to build infrastructure and facilities to support the economy. An economy doesn't generate its building materials from nowhere.</p>
              <p>I would be first to admit that the US indeed has a lot of great and creative minds. But they are still hopelessly outnumbered by the teeming masses of fools that allowed people like Bush into power.</p>
              <p>Of course talents are going into the US for decades, they were the only intact superpower after WW2. Having an high IQ is kinda useless when your cities and factories are in ruins.</p>
              <p>Ah, another Jewish supporter. They've certainly strung America up by the balls pretty good. But what is good for them does not neccessarily equals good for America. You've said it, they have identified themselves as Jews first Americans second.</p>
              <p>America hasn't exactly overcome any hurdles, it's still there but the people are ignoring it and the politicians are convinced that they're still good! They can keep borrowing from others and somehow everything would work out.</p>
              <p>You forget too that the Chinese had also undergo their baptisms by fire in the past century. They also have no problems with appearing weak as long as their objectives are met and pulling unpleasant surprises is a forte of theirs.</p>
              <p>I worry more when China's quiet.</p>

              <p>CHina should begin to accept the very real possibility of losing its American investments i dont think America can pay them back. Not only is American in big trouble economically, which it feably tries to solve by printing more money(!). it is also in huge trouble fiscally in the years to come when Social security payments start to rise to pay their baby boomers. </p>
              <p>I dont expect a country burdened with so many problems to be able to pay back trillion dollars</p>

              <p>FYI .....We are already in unchartered terroritory. There is not a single country on this walking planet with the world largerest population able to continue to substain its economic growth by importing agriculture resources around the world. At the same time trade on foreign currency and kept its own artificially low. Ones resources are at critical level it is typical for any Govt to take over and nationalized prohibit export or limit export.   </p>
              <p>An authoritarian means that it does not answer to its people. Checks n balance are not there. Every dirt will be under the Rug u can't see it but if it is huge enough to discover........ shit hits the fence. </p>
