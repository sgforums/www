              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew, who is currently in Moscow to dispense his usual “pearls of wisdom”, raised eyebrows when he told the audience during a dialogue session with students from the Skolkovo Moscow School of Management that he is no longer in charge of Singapore.</p>
              <p>When asked by an Armenian student Mr Grant Alaverdian about the goals he would set for Singapore’s next generation of leaders, Lee replied promptly:</p>
              <p><strong>“I’m not in charge anymore, it depends on what the present leaders envision for themselves and how they can take Singapore from where it is, to where they want to go. My contribution now is like an over-the-horizon radar – (telling them) there is opportunity there or there is trouble there…”</strong></p>
              <p>The octagenarian Lee, who just turned 87 lately, is probably the oldest living MP and minister in the entire world. A former prime minister of Singapore, he nows hold the title of “Minister Mentor”, an unique position not found anywhere else.</p>
              <p>Though he admitted that he is not doing much work except “forecasting”, many believe Lee continues to wield real influence behind the Singapore cabinet and is the prime driver behind some of its unpopular and controversial policies such as its pro-foreigner and ultra-immigration policies to increase Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people.</p>
              <p>He echoed it when asked about his dream for Singapore:</p>
              <p><strong>“Gradually but almost relentlessly, we will become cosmopolitan, international.”</strong></p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s open-door policy to immigrations, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>The newcomers coming from diverse parts of the world have diluted the national identity of Singapore, with two out of three Singaporeans polled indicating that they are worried by the relentless influx of foreigners.</p>
              <p>Lee forgot to add that his dream is not only to make Singapore an international city, but one which remains under the control of the despotic PAP regime forever.</p>

              <p>True,if he really not the person incharge,then he should quit what.Afterall,his salary also not cheap,like around 3 million a yr?Why waste taxpayers money if he is not the person incharge?</p>
              <p>Besides,even if he is not incharge,by staying behind,he still cast influence.If other ministers like GCT,Tony Tan or any ministers want to turn Singapore into a real democracy country,will LKY allows that?Certainly not,thats the main reason majority Singaporeans dont like him.</p>
