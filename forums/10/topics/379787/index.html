              <p><br>The danger with sweeping statements is that it covers too much with one broad stroke and with so little consideration as to what is being swept over.</p>
              <p>If one looks through the last sixty over years of history, one will see the changes to the US foreign and defense policies with the various countries that were previously allies to the USA for various strategic or treaty reasons; and you may wish to have a second look at your statement made in such a casual manner.</p>
              <p>Since Chiang Kai Shek lost its fight with Mao and took refuge in Taiwan, for more then forty years, the USA stood by Taiwan and supplied high tech weapons for its defense.</p>
              <p>The situation changed, when Mainland China presented a new face with new open door policies encouraged by Deng Xiao Peng; and about twenty years after China open its doors, a prosperous China was being economically engaged by the global community at the expense of Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Taiwan was relegated to second tier status even as the USA had treaty obligations to defend Taiwan, and the reason for this change was the new political economic reality that developed since the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Communist Bloc.</p>
              <p>With more then twenty years of political boycott and economic sanctions that had no positive results in changing the attitude of the military junta in Myanmar, the USA has now embarked on a new course of diplomatic engagement.</p>
              <p>This is also pursued with North Korea, as well as with Iran - both of which were once dubbed as Axis of Evil with Syria being the third party in the Axis.</p>
              <p>Those who are Allies today, may well be seens as adversary.</p>
              <p>Indonesia was once considered a strategic partner to block the Communist influence from spreading across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Now that Communism is defeated - Islamic Fundamentalism is the new threat and challenge to global stability.</p>
              <p>Islamic Fundamentalism is to create a new Islamic Caliphate that stretch from the Western Coast of Africa, across the Middle-East, and the entire Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>If Singapore turned into an Islamic Fundamentalist State, are you certain that the USA will not be concerned and continue to support Singapore ?</p>
              <p>If the USA can find a more stable and less problemsome government in Malaysia or even in Indonesia, and sacrifice Singapore for the sake of better relations with the two larger neighbors - (similar to the manner in which Taiwan was sacrificed for better relations with Mainland China) - do you seriously think that Singapore has any value in any new US strategic thinking that should arise with new developments ?</p>
              <p>Singapore had achieved premier status in the relationship with the USA as the PAP government was able to package Singapore as a strategic location for the interest of the USA.</p>
              <p>Our success is due partly to the inability of the political leadership in the neighboring countries to take a more strategic position even as they engage in petty politics to squeeze Singapore.</p>
              <p>With Malaysia moving forward in opening up its politics towards more liberalism and public participation, and a 1Malaysia political ideology - it will not be too long before Malaysia will be where Singapore had been 20 years ago, and perhaps succeed more then what MM LKY had falsely pledged to "aspire" for what Singapore is to be.</p>

              <p>The retired West German Chancellor Willie Brandt was asked to help win the release of Chia Thye Poh, and he did so without any favors in return.</p>
              <p>Unlike all other political detainees - such as the accused Marxist Conspirators from the Singapore Catholic Church in Siglap - Chia Thye Poh was released without him even being asked to sign any undertaking.</p>
              <p>Why should you worry for CSJ if he thinks that the USA will help him for nothing but to spread freedom and democracy ?</p>
              <p>Or are you worried for yourself that the USA will spread freedom and democracy at a price that the PAP will not want Singapore to pay ?</p>
              <p>Is the lost of US weapon systems for the SAF too high a price to be paid for us to have political freedom and democracy ?</p>
              <p>If this price is not worth paying for our political freedom and democracy - can we believe that you will pay the ultimate price for Singapore when Singapore's political freedom and existence is actually threatened ?</p>

              <p><br>In 1971, the relationship between the USA and PRC had taken a positive turn with the Nixon visit to China, and they collaborated to contain the Russians.</p>
              <p>Did USA and PRC become formal allies against the Communist Russia ?</p>
              <p>This did not change the USA support for the defense of Taiwan from PRC military threats in invading Taiwan.</p>
              <p>This US policy continued until 2004, when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nti.org/db/china/twnchr.htm">‘systematic change in Taiwan's political landscape saw Chen Shui Bien more aggressive stance that will ignite the extreme fragile cross-straits PRC-Taiwan situation’ (*1) </a>and caused the USA to become more cautious towards Chen Shui Bien's Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Although the USA is committed on paper to defend Taiwan, the USA also has her own political, military and economic priorities over that of Taiwan's.</p>
              <p>As records have it, as early as in 2001 - George Bush Jr had rejected <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2001-04-24/article/4525?headline=Bush-plans-to-sell-Taiwan-less-advanced-destroyers">‘Taiwan's military requests for high-tech weapons - which were met with lower key equipment such as the Berkeley Class of Destroyers instead of the Aegis Class’ (*2) </a></p>
              <p>What do you think could be the reason for such a drastic change to a US Ally since the Second World War ?  </p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020209c1.htm">‘ LKY: Well, I think if I had married a different woman, I would have had a very different life. She was my partner, both emotionally and intellectually <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at work</span> </strong>and at play.’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p>LKY had once said that he consults her on all issues before decisions are arrived at, especially on issues of law.</p>
              <p>Some of LKY's decisions had affected innocent lives and destroyed families - one of which is the decision to incarcerate Chia Thye Poh for 32 years under the ISA, and kept 32 years in solitary confinement, taunted with release by being brought on a regular tour of Singapore, and finally released without even a written or verbal confession, nor was any undertaking not to return to the supposedly Communist revolutionary ways that he was originally accused of being a participant.</p>
              <p>Another of LKY's accusation that destroyed families were the plot that the British ISD refused to be a participant to arrest LKY's political opponents, while LKY continue to act as their advocate, and which LKY persuaded Tunku Abdul Rahman to push the British to implement Operation Cold Store.</p>
              <p>The falsely accused Marxist Conspirators in the Catholic Church had caused 22 young Singapore social activists to be subjected to the pogroms of imprisonment, physical and mental torture, and forced confessions. When released, some of them made an open statement that informed the public of their innocence and retracted their forced confessions. They were immediately re-arrested, and subjected again to more punitive retribution by the ISD agents, and at the second forced confession they were subjected to doing it on live TV.</p>
              <p>The family of the Secretary-General of Alpha-ONE were ejected from Singapore, when all he had done was representing the position of the Singapore Airlines Pilots, had represented their interest to the best of his honest ability, and put up a strong argument with the retired MM LKY chairing the meeting.</p>
              <p>Did LKY consult his wife, and sought her views on the legality of his actions - before taking actions on all these issues ?</p>

              <p>I'm concerned because I feel alarmed that you're able to name names ("<em>zombie</em>") about a women who looks æ…ˆç¥¥ and has never been involved politically. It's her husband who's in the political arena, it's her sons who are involved. So direct your anger towards all the other family members who are involved politically, not the ones who are not..</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, i only pray and hope that people will uphold their decency and refer to their moral compass when making their point and saying anything else.
