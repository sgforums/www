              <p>PAP MP Mr Baey Yam Keng once expressed his shock and disbelief in the papers at the extreme incongruity between what was reported in the mainstream media and sentiments expressed freely without inhibition by ordinary citizens in cyberspace and he felt that “the truth is somewhere in between.”</p>
              <p>He is wrong. Truth and reality can only be found in a completely natural and unfettered environment in which free speech can exist, flourished and even be promoted without the confines of censorship. Blogosphere is the last bastion of free speech in Singapore not in the clutches of the massive imposing government machinery.</p>
              <p>With its encompassing pervasive stranglehold in controlling the flow and dissemination of news media in Singapore, the government, imbibed with a control-freak psyche, will not allow criticisms and attacks on it in blogosphere to go on forever indiscriminately.</p>
              <p>It has already signaled its intent to gain a foothold in this new media by admitting rather sheepishly the existence of an “internet management team” to “moderate” comments critical of it in cyberspace and the setting up of an online network portal for citizen journalism - STOMP through its proxy SPH.</p>
              <p>While STOMP is largely a light, trivial and non-political “complaint channel” for netizens to give them a “voice” in the mainstream media, there seems to be a dearth of serious, credible political blogs to challenge the anti-government propaganda that has been spewing out daily from independent blogs such as Yawning Bread, Mr Brown, Mr Wang, SDP homepage, Singapore Dissident, Singapore Rebel, Sg_Review, Diary of a Singapore Mind etc which obviously has been a thorn in its flesh for a long time - it must be incredibly peeved by some of the stinging remarks made on these blogs and yet it is not in a position to counter them directly.</p>

              <p>Dear Thinkpeople,</p>
              <p>The problem I see with the internet is that there are as many stupid, half formed, ill informed opinions as there are well formed ones.</p>
              <p>Mixing them all together and then looking at the result gives you a very poor education.</p>
              <p>However if you can pick out the well formed ones, you can get a very meaningful education.</p>
              <p>When I say pick out, I mean learn to recognize well formed opinions because while they may be very different from your own but they tend to bear certain characteristics.</p>

              <p>Recently, there have been many allegations made against the editors of the popular web portal, the Online Citizen (TOC): <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/">http://theonlinecitizen.com</a>/</p>
              <p>The
              TOC editors have been accused of being either funded by the PAP, or at
              the very least, closely associated with the PAP. In addition, TOC is
              alleged to have threatened legal action on at least one blogger. Just a
              couple of days back, TOC wrote a lengthy blog post fervently denying
              these allegations. Many readers also weighed in on the subject and
              expressed their support for TOC.</p>
              <p>I too would like to express my
              support for the Online Citizen. TOC provides a wide diversity of views
              and opinions on what is happening in Singapore, some pro-establishment,
              and some anti-establishment. This curious blend of neutral reporting
              and the ability to look at each issue from many sides without ever
              taking an unwavering stand is seldom found in cyberspace.</p>
              <p>Although
              the PAP is confident that its policies are sound, will benefit
              Singaporeans over the long run, and will definitely stand the test of
              time, the PAP also recognizes that people must be free to air their
              views, provided that they do so responsibly and moderately. TOC is one
              good example of responsible and moderate reporting that the PAP would
              certainly approve of.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew (praise and
              blessings be upon him!) and the Old Guard singlehandedly brought
              Singapore from 3rd World to 1st, and built a nation of peace and
              prosperity, security, racial and religious harmony, and social
              progress. It is entirely due to their incredible dedication, hard work,
              and monumental sacrifices that Singaporeans today have a nation that
              they can be very proud to call their home. We and our families owe a
              lifelong debt of honest gratitude to these courageous men and women who
              put their lives on the line to build a modern and prosperous Singapore.</p>
              <p>The
              PAP government (may the PAP progress!) has created a social environment
              that fosters intelligent questioning and debate of social and political
              issues, and encourages Singaporeans to play an active role in shaping
              the future of our society. It is out of this vibrant and thriving
              culture created by the PAP that TOC was born. TOC's articles are
              balanced and well-written, and always based on the facts, although
              there have been many occasion when those facts presented were
              incomplete and did not portray an accurate picture of reality.</p>
              <p>Although
              many TOC articles are critical of PAP policies, their arguments are
              presented in way that is thoughtful and measured, even if those
              arguments are often flawed.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the PAP does not expect
              that everyone will agree with all its policies. Not everyone has access
              to all the facts and information, and certainly TOC does not. As time
              goes by however, the PAP hopes that eventually most Singaporeans will
              come to see the wisdom and strength of its policies.</p>
              <p>In the
              meanwhile, TOC still plays an excellent role by offering an alternative
              platform and alternative set of views that encourages mature debate and
              logical thinking. That is what the PAP would like to see as well, as
              these qualities of logical thinking and mature debate will eventually
              lead people to see the goodness of its policies, and lead them back to
              the PAP.</p>
              <p>All in all, TOC plays a vital role in shaping the kind
              of society the PAP would like. Let us thus put aside our petty
              differences and squabbles, and focus on the greater tasks ahead. Let us
              join in the Great and Noble Cause of Nation Building. Together with the
              PAP, we can reach for the Pot Of Gold!</p>
              <p>Majulah PAP! Majulah Singapura!</p>
