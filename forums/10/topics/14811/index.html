OSAMA is in deep deep shit.... on the one hand... the americans want him... arrested, grilled, interrogated, trialed and probably hanged in the end... the ARABs and his former masters and sponsors would love to see the man dead before the americans found them out... through him....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer your questions, I would have to proselytize a little bit, but I promise that I will not go beyond clarifying your curiosity.<br><br>First, it is important to realise that the word 'Jihad' has often been mistranslated by ill-intentioned people (Muslim &amp; non-Muslim)to mean Holy War. In fact, Jihad, if correctly translated really means: "a struggle against persecution", or "in defense of the faith".<br><br>Therefore, if a Muslim community is repressed or deported from their homes or have their families killed by an enemy, the Muslim is allowed to retaliate against the oppressors, but only as far as getting those rights back.<br><br>"Fight those who fight against you along God's way, yet do not initiate hostilities; God does not love aggressors." (Holy Quran 2:190)<br><br>"If they stop, let there be no more hostility except towards wrongdoers." (Holy Quran 2:193)<br><br>Like I mentioned in my previous thread, some leaders have to use religion as a weapon in order to convince their followers of their cause. Hitler and Slobodan Milosevic (both Christians, I must add) honed this weapon down to an art, and look at where it landed them? Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are not exclusive to Islam alone. It is a phenomenon that must be eradicated from all faiths.<br><br>The Muslims call it Jihad, and claim that they have the right to fight against the injustices that have been committed on them in Palestine. The Americans call it a Crusade because Afghan terrorists killed their people and they want to hit back at those responsible, specifically Bin Laden. The Muslim Jihad and the Christian's Crusade seem to be two sides of the same coin.<br><br>Whether it is Hitler, Milosevic, Timothy McVie or Osama bin Laden, all these people should, as Tripwire mentioned, be tortured and then pay for the innocent lives with their own... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>For a rollicking good time, come visit my homepage at: <a href="http://clik.to/pebble" rel="nofollow">http://clik.to/pebble</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my feeling abt such teaching are cause of problems. Faith will last regardless of suppression or procecution. Both religion, teaches kindness and love... I'm not saying GOD is wrong or I doubted HIM. Could it be human whom add such a clause for their own interest?<br><br>If I got you right. Jihah can only be declared when muslims were forced to give up Islam or were killed because of their religion. Simply religion cause, right?  Isreal and Palestine fought for land not survival, right? And Isrealis are not forcing Palestine muslim to give up Islam, correct? Israel allowed Muslims to pray at the 'shared' holy site, right? Muslim states had accused Israel of killing Muslims and being anti-Islam, any prove? WHAT is the different between Islam, Christian and jewish Hebrew? It should not be Jihah, but mortal's war. My impression is that muslims states had brought in religion to support their aggression. Muslims states had also been very aggressive to their neighbours. Look at what Iraq did to Kuwait? And who invites Iraq aggressors to visit Malaysia? Is Malaysia telling and warning Singapore that you could be another Kuwait?<br><br>Fact is Singapore like Isreal were surrounded by Muslims states and these muslims states had been threatening Singapore's survival.........<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br>You are very insightful. It's true that Palestinians and Israel's fight is really for land, and not a battle for faith. As I mentioned earlier, there are madmen out there who do use religion to fight their wars. I agree with you that most of the time, religion is twisted by men to be used as a weapon.<br><br>A lot of dictators have to use either religion, or a political cause to unite the people. Let's take for example China in its early days. Many of the people were uneducated and unknowledgable about politics. Most of them worried only about when the next rains would come so that they could harvest their crops. When Mao Zhedong was planning his Cultural Revolution, he knew this about his people. He realised that he had to use SOMETHING to whip up the sentiments of his citizens. Now, although he did not use Islam, Christianity or any sort of religion to accomplish his goals, he used Communism. With its teachings about COMPLETE EQUALITY, it managed to win the hearts and minds of the Chinese.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that the Palestinians are in the same position as the Chinese were last time. They are uneducated and know nothing else but their religion. In order to unite the people, some leaders had to resort to religion to accomplish their goals of winning Palestinian land back.<br><br>The same goes for Adolf Hitler, who used Christianity to confer upon himself a holy mandate to destroy the Jews, and also Slobodan Milosevic, who said that his killing of innocent Muslim civilians was a Crusade. Same also for the Mao Zhedong when his cultural revolution toppled the Church and all other religions. History is scarred by the acts of these men, and Osama is one of those who will join these people in history.<br><br>[This message has been edited by salivateforme (edited 18 September 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think is quite smart of u to define jihad, Salivateforme.<br><br>What i think is that when pple's feelings are stirred up, they wil die for any cause tt they believe in. Juz like u said abt Mao's communist campaign, he stirred up pple's feelings of equality so that pple wil fight for their cause. They wil not mind dying if they can make their children lead a better life than ever b4.<br><br>Same for religion. Pple were mislead to believe that those that they killed were opposing their religion, and not beliving in their gods. They think the gods wil punish them or sth if they do not convert thse "ignorant" pple. This is exactly what happens in the book "The Royal Hunt of The Sun". It may be fiction, but it depicts the real life situation.<br><br>Leaders make use of this fact to get a lot of supporters. When against a govt, it is not tech that matters, but the numbers. Getting the whole population's support wil enable the leader to do anything he like without being persecuted.
