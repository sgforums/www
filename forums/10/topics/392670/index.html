              <p>Dear Minister Wong KS,</p>
              <p>You say that we want to attract the best people incl those who are mid-level to be Sporeans. As a govt who priced itself with being open and transparent, why dont you publish openly how many of the 533,000 PRs and  new citizens let in so far, are doctors, lawyers,engineers, scientists, technicians, etc and how many are mama-sans, hawker assistants, bus drivers, etc and may I add their ethnic background.  If you do this, then I for one, will truly say our govt is 100% transparent and open.</p>

              <p>Like it or not, when there's a demand, there will have to be a supply somewhere and if the supply is not coming from the local workforce, then employers will have to look elsewhere. </p>
              <p>Developed countries around the world adopt similar principles.  Doors are open to migrants when booming industries experience a shortfall in manpower that cannot be met by the local populace, thus leading to a reliance on skilled and/or professional foreigners.</p>
              <p>We do need these foreign workers and whilst they do disrupt the social fabric at times, the solution will be to help them integrate and inform them of what's the acceptable norm here and accept their presence graciously. </p>

              <p>An expression of my personal opinion of the matter in an open forum led to you throwing all these malicious accusations at me. </p>
              <p>FYI.  I am not interested in 'tricking' anyone and you have me laughing hard at how voicing my opinion has made me a 'dangerous and tricky person'.</p>
              <p>You are so immature.  Just because someone else's opinions differ from yours, you find eloquence in only one outlet - throwing personal insults.  Tsk tsk.  Show your mettle and express your objective opinions instead of becoming subjective, that is, if you are capable of that.</p>

              <p>Anyway, i find your posting interesting and good. No bias intended, straight to the real issue. Yes, as i said many times, we need peoples here, and we need it fast, but the way of getting the peoples we need is very critical to our society, in meantime, the govt just open the gates and getting less stringent in getting PRs and new Citizens, that could be detrimental to the society and also to the local.</p>
              <p>Some Singaporeans will keep on nagging about foreigner here and there, that is a norm, Singaporeans also hv emotion and the right to own this place, just that some go overboard and think that all foreigners are no good and why our govt are getting them in freely??? Well, everyone of us must have experienced with our foreigner counterparts in our daily life, if you dun, then something is very wrong, with 1.5millions here and ever growing, if you dun get involve with a foreigner, then you must be in jail or some islands. And all of us got good and bad experiences with them, and that decided our judgement on them.</p>

              <p>You are like trying to justify extremely huge influx of foreign workers with the fact we do need foreigners in some fields like in construction. The problem now is foreigners are occupying numerous white collar jobs.</p>

              <p>Why not 50%? why people want to repatriate all? i think no one would want that. we still need maids to clean our houses and cars. we still need construction workers. we do not need so many IT foreigners and white collar foreigners.</p>
