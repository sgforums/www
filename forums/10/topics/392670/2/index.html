              <p>I like to pose a question to all people:</p>
              <p>1. Wouldn't the new citizens ADD To the AGEING POPULATION?</p>
              <p>2. Australia and USA and many 1st worlds have strict immigration rules or criteria or standards. Yet, they have long long queues of foreign talents willing to queue up to become a citizen there.</p>
              <p>Since its said that singapore is so attractive, why need to open the door so wide and easy?</p>

              <p>Anyway, i find your posting interesting and good. No bias intended, straight to the real issue. Yes, as i said many times, we need peoples here, and we need it fast, but the way of getting the peoples we need is very critical to our society, in meantime, the govt just open the gates and getting less stringent in getting PRs and new Citizens, that could be detrimental to the society and also to the local.</p>
              <p>Some Singaporeans will keep on nagging about foreigner here and there, that is a norm, Singaporeans also hv emotion and the right to own this place, just that some go overboard and think that all foreigners are no good and why our govt are getting them in freely??? Well, everyone of us must have experienced with our foreigner counterparts in our daily life, if you dun, then something is very wrong, with 1.5millions here and ever growing, if you dun get involve with a foreigner, then you must be in jail or some islands. And all of us got good and bad experiences with them, and that decided our judgement on them.</p>

              <p>Angel, unfortunately, the voters will cast the vote base on his/her individual preference. Hence, it is the biggest problem for the ruling party because the door is open to many wrong ppl and we citizens have to pay the price via all sort of taxes levied.</p>

              <p>Uncle,</p>
              <p>Bringing in top talents foreigners existed long ago, as i study modern history of Singapore, in the 70s and 80s we got lots of good Japanese, German, Dutch, British, US, French that we even have shopping centres and schools for them, our productivity was at record high. That was good, according to the author, not only they helped us to build our economy, they also bring along good culture and gracious manner to us.</p>
              <p>But today, 2010, we are attracting the wrong crowd, poor China or Indian PhD researchers, lecturers, so forth and so on, that bring nothing much except lots of problem with a funny habit of talking loud and not gracious at all. And bear this in mind, today top foreign talents from China, mynmar, india, viet, malaysia come into Singapore, get a top job or open an investment, then they bring along their fellow countrymen as staffs and workers to gather their strength, make up the nos  by introducing one after another in term of relative or friendship with some bribery going on. So anyone can come in with recommedation from the top.</p>
              <p>Recently, an industrial officer just told me over a coffee, an Indian HR director of a shipyards can call in 200 indian workers with a flick of his thumb, and every worker have to pay him $4000 sing to get here, not to the company. Just imagine how much he makes, next, a China construction project manager called in 175 PRC construction workers( which some are actually farmers) to join him, with each paying $2000 sing to him just to get the work permit and the jobs. Now, are we becoming a place for human transaction??? If you look at MOM last year, how much workers goes there complaining that their bosses neglected them, and it is because of protest, MOM then decide to take action, but who gives the work permit in the first place??? MOM.</p>

              <p>Hey I obviously agree with you on the Middle Income group.</p>
              <p>The foreign talents are not the bosses of McDonald's, Hewlett packard, Sony or HSBC etc.</p>
              <p>The foreign talents more dredded are scholars from China, India and the rest of Southeast Asia directly competing with executives for the rice bowls.</p>
              <p>You see, executives can take up SPUR programs to get jobs but at the end of the day, it is still the employer's decision. He will say 'eh you no experience mah'.</p>
              <p>So, I feel sectors such as BANKING and CIVIL SERVICE should deter foreigners from being employed in the middle income positions. Not CONSTRUCTION or MARINE or ENVIRONMENT.</p>

Is there something really wrong with our degree holder, be in expectation or attitudes that employers find it better to take Indian or PRC? Or has the society been dominated by the Indian or PRC executives that they will employ their country men in preference to Singaporean?</p>
              <p>Can someone plse tell me because I am really amazed why than companies in China is willing to pay 5 to 10 times more salary than their local PHD or executives to employ SINGAPAPOREAN as expatriate???????</p>
              <p>So If I return to Singapore from my current PRC job it is likely that I will have to take Indian or PRC salary for job in Singapore???</p>

              <p>those in china are not permanent, in the 80s, i believe we also paid 5 to 10 times a western or japanese engineer or executive to work here with private house too, so china is seeing that in here, they need peoples to jump start their economy in a correct way, otherwise there will be alot of scandalous stuff like the milk and toy problem again. Foreign executives especially Singaporeans are actually in demand in China, firstly because most Singaporean chinese can speak mandarin well and very much cultured to chinese way of life, Secondly, because Singapore are effective and efficient in a way they do their jobs as proven here and third the most important, Singaporeans are mostly not corrupted.</p>
              <p>However, just like the Japanese here in Singapore being send back one by one, the day will come when Chinese students are graduated in Singapore, the Chinese had learned our skill and way of working with efficiency and effectiveness, then you will be send back. In the meantime, enjoy what you can there.</p>

              <p>new citizens means they are here to stay.</p>
              <p>I dread thinking about the next financial crisis which comes ever so earlier than the last, each time , bigger tsunami than the last. Can produce so many jobs or not? Bigger Ageing population or not (new citizens usually are also adults who can be in their 30's , 40's or even 80's)</p>
              <p>Lets brace ourselves. In the digital age. For more good years. As we head for swiss standard (i no guarantee the swiss pay) and achieve the world cup while increasing our Productivity becoming Cheaper Better Faster as we pay and pay the overpriced flat ( the lease), the cars (highest price in the world) and the hikes of ALL types.</p>

              <p>foreigners are everywhere.</p>
              <p>one need not look further as our very front door, singapore changi airport employs heaps of them. they are not cleaners. they are check in counters staff. WTF. generally, i think companies that employ more FTs will lead to lower staff morale and productivity. coz the employees dont feel secure in the company.</p>

              <p>I am all for foreigners living, working and studying in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it now seems like there are more foreigners than locals in the country these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An example - I go to a nearby fast food restaurant for some grub.  Along the short walk, I pass by no fewer than 3 couples who are foreigners (undeniable accents).  I reach the restaurant and am served by a foreigner (undeniable accent).  I take my food and sit myself on one of the tables.There are about at least 5 foreign students studying in the joint (undeniable accents).  A middle aged foreign couple joins a nearby seat (undeniable accent).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And guess what.  It is around 3am in the morning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
