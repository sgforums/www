            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to suggest the benefits of expanding our wealth of local expertise in government, to include foreign talent at the Ministerial level. This is so that we can ensure we get the best brains from global markets who will be competitive and experienced enough to represent Singapore in the economic and social policy processes. This way, in times of economic policy making, we will ensure that we are making strict decisions based on the criteria with which we suggest our workforce should be-- i.e. meritocracy, capability, IQ, highly trained, experience, and willing to work for market driven salaries. If, we agree that foreign talent will help our industries and sectors gain competitiveness and vibrancy. Why should it not help the process of government? How do we know now that we have the best brains in Government in a globally competitive way? How do we know the decisions are best, when it is not a gobally open environment? Inasmuch, I feel we should reach out to communities and news environments overseas to appoint the best educated and most experienced for government. The process should be as globally open as possible.<br><br></div>

I believe there are lots of people in key positions in MNCs etc who are not nationals. And most of us are barely recent nationals ourselves! How do you know we are getting the best now, if we have a closed door policy? Should it not be a competitive process....criteria which is practiced coherently across the board.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How do you know you dont have spies and double agents now? Its the law that prevents people acting in this way. Under the OSA the Ministers, whether local or foreign are bound to do their jobs. Thus, I feel it does not make any difference.<br><br>Besides if we cant find enough "quality" PAP and opposition in Singapore, we could look for talent overseas. If this is the criteria, it should be applied throughout. If there's a policy, it should be consistent.<br><br>As for the third comment about choosing government, and going there etc by 00126666, I can tell him/her that although he/she dreams to go everywhere, UK, US, etc these places DO NOT always want him/her.<br><br>But I think the question is not answered as yet. What are the reasons you think we should not have foreigners in Parliament and at the Ministry levels. If economic rationale is key, and the law protects in terms of the problems about national interests. What then is holding us back from making this good move?<br><br>eze</div>

Otherwise we will be re-colonised again. There is a huge distinction between inclusive (ie information) and exclusive (participation eg being a Minister or in our government). Things that represent our soverignty must be retained by Singaporeans!!!<br><br>As much as we like to be open to views and criticism from foreigners or even literary interference, it is a different thing altogether for foreigners have to have decision making powers or participation in direct actionable involvement.<br><br>If we allow this we would have to declare Singapore an OPEN STATE and no longer a sovereign state.<br><br>Singaporeans YOU NEED TO WAKE UP!!!<br></div>
