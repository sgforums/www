            <div class='col-md body'>Attracting FDI is probably the thing PAP does best.... because PAP can depress local wages, import foreigners and give minimal protection to workers. Something not many countries can do.<br><br><a href="http://www.okusi.net/garydean/works/fdising.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.okusi.net/garydean/works/fdising.html  </a><br><br>Of the NIEs that have taken conscious control of the national economy -- which is to say, all of them with the exception of Hongkong -- only Singapore chose to use FDI as its principal source of external capital.  Taiwan and South Korea, by stark contrast, chose a completely opposing route and in the main relied upon external borrowings and aid to support their developmental agendas. <strong>Consequently, 'technological deepening' and innovation is now far more apparent in Taiwan and South Korea.  These two economies have retained control of investments and developed the skills and infrastructure to innovate.</strong><br><br><strong><br>However, one important weakness in Singapore's approach is the question of technological innovation, considered the last stage of technology transfer.[10] For a variety of reasons, state-of-the-art R&amp;D by TNCs is nearly always concentrated in a few developed countries, and high technology tends not to be developed outside the TNC's home-base.  Cutting-edge R&amp;D in particular is usually undertaken close to management and decision-making centres where there exists a large local market, and a pool of advanced and specialist technical skills.[11] Another important weakness is that the very presence of strong TNCs can inhibit local companies from deepening their technological capabilities, preferring to import foreign technologies that are proven and ready-to-use, rather than invest in their own R&amp;D.[12] This is arguably what has already happened in Singapore as a consequence of their developmental path.</strong><br><br>With or without FDI, Singapore would have found it difficult to languish as an economic backwater.  Accidents of location, culture and history came together in Singapore, and given a modicum of political stability, such a country could only prosper. Singapore was lucky; its apparent 'success' was certainly not only due to its FDI policies, but also due to many other factors.<br><br>What FDI has done for Singapore is to assist in the creation of a nation with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, for what that is worth.  Singapore could be said to be wealthy in the same way that ancient Athens was said to be democratic. <strong>In both cases, a huge, anonymous underclass of cheap labour supported the superstructure; in the case of Singapore, Malaysians (of every race, not just Malays) and other Southeast Asians, who are offered only the barest of legislative protection by the government.</strong><br><br><strong>The cost in human terms of this success has been high: Singapore today is an authoritarian corporatist state that intervenes in virtually every aspect of citizen's lives.  Singapore has become a nation of functionaries who serve the interests of the TNCs and the Singaporean state elite.  Within such an environment there exists very little true entrepreneurship.  FDI has not assisted in the development of an innovative population;</strong> rather it has assisted in the creation of a self-satisfied, arrogant society that seems content to live off its natural advantages.[23] Singapore today resembles an enormous air-conditioned shopping mall, with squeaky-clean streets and traffic so orderly as to border on the bizarre.</div>
