There are even extensive safeguard against human error or negligence. Don't talk something you have absolutely no idea about.<br></blockquote>Now my question to you : Do you agree with his statement that refineries do not cause pollution at all or do not create pollution ?<br><br>The Yes or No answer is only required of you.<br><br></div>
