You were the one who asked for <strong>proof that refineries cause pollution.</strong> I gave proof via NUS researchers.  Period. Nothing more , nothing less. Your own fallacious quote below:<br><blockquote>You highlighted heavy petroleum industries, to substantiate your claim that petroleum industry is causing pollution. </blockquote>Claim substantiated. Ask any scientist if petroleum industry will have some form of  pollution - all will say yes.  Even Daddy!! agreed that oil refinery emits some form of <strong>pollutants</strong>.<br><br>And for questioning the environmental impact management - why not? No one has been answering the question but some of you choosing to go on the offensive.<br><br>Well , as far as I am concerned , with a person who claims to be Singaporean, you are a fine example of genetic pollution with your logic. <span style="font-style: italic;">Why did you think even another forumner , rooki ,went so kindly to explain to you what those industries emit </span>?<br><br>The reason why I asked is because I used to live in Jurong when I was young.<br>So until you live there everyday of your life .
