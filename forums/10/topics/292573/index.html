It is confident of running one at the Seletar Aerospace Park.<br><br>Rolls Royce is not new to Singapore's aerospace industry. Since 1995, Singapore Airlines has been a major customer of its engines.<br><br>Other customers include SilkAir and the budget carriers operating out of Singapore.<br><br>Right now, Rolls Royce accounts for more than 10 percent of Singapore's aerospace output.<br><br>Rolls Royce is expecting to hire at least 330 staff here to work on engines for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. Currently, it has about 1,000 employees in Singapore.<br><br>The company said that even though other Asian countries may have lower capital costs, Singapore is better poised for the aerospace sector in terms of skilled labour and infrastructure.<br><br>Jonathan Asherson, Regional Director, South East Asia, Rolls Royce International, said: "Another criteria was the US dollars, in the mitigation against the exchange rate. And also being close to our customers, and Asia is a hugely growing part of our business."<br><br>The aerospace industry in Asia is booming, with the number of aircraft in the region set to double by 2015.<br><br>Singapore is keen to tap into the growth, and the Economic Development Board said it will be announcing more investment deals for the Seletar Aerospace Park over the next few months.<br><br>Manohar Khiatani, Assistant MD, Industry Development, Economic Development Board, said: "There'll be opportunities to attract engine component manufacturers who supply Rolls Royce... systems suppliers who provide systems for aircraft engines, as well as our local supporting industries eventually, for the component activities."<br><br>The new Rolls Royce plant is expected to be up and running by the end of 2009.<br><br>Asia accounts for about 27 percent of the revenue at Rolls Royce.<br><br>Meanwhile, Rolls Royce also announced another engine facility for corporate aircrafts in the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA. - CNA/ms<br><br></div>

It is seeing steady growth in its business.<br><br>The company is one of the leading industrial gas manufacturers in the region, specialising in production of oxygen, nitrogen and argon.<br><br>However, it is keen to expand. It plans to plough more capital into investments and increase manpower.<br><br>Shigeto Umatani, Managing Director, National Oxygen, said: "We are planning to invest not only in Singapore, but in Malaysia Indonesia and Batam.<br><br>"We are going to start with a new refilling station for downstream business in Batam, Indonesia, and we are planning to set up a new on site gas plant in Malaysia. We are also going to set up a new carbon dioxide plant in Malaysia. These projects will be completed by the end of next year."<br><br>NOX expects to spend a total of S$40 million on these projects. In Singapore alone, it has so far invested a total of S$175 million.<br><br>It booked a revenue of S$87 million last year, and this is expected to grow, as the third plant in Jurong kicks into full gear.<br><br>NOX said gas manufacturing will stay on a uptrend, as the economy grows.<br><br>Mr Umatani said: "I think for the past three or four years, Singapore's economy has been expanding very rapidly - between, I guess, 6-8 percent per year.<br><br>"This year's economic growth is over 8 percent and I think, I'm sure, this growth will stay for the next couple of years, and in that sense, we believe that there is strong growth in this business (gas manufacturing) for the next few years at least."<br><br>With the numerous projects NOX has in the Singapore industry, the company is hoping to attain a one third total of market share in the budding sector. - CNA/ms<br><br></div>
