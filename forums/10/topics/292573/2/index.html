Over the years, factories came in and out as we overhauled the industries to replace labor intensive and pollution prone industries with high value added and cleaner industries. The towns in Jurong East and West were developed much later. You think we never knew the pollution issue before we developed the towns?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Jurong island was one of the greatest development in Singapore industrialisation. Besides better safeguard against possible terrorists attack, jurong island has infra structure to control pollution, such as using LNG which is safer and cleaner. Industrial waste water is channelled through underground sewerage to the new water plant. Solid industrial waste go directly to the rubbish dumping ground on an island.<br><br>ExxonMobil's ethylene plant uses feedstock that comes directly from its refinery nearby, any further cracking of CH only mean cleaner products and of course higher value added. What pollution?<br><br>The biodiesel fuel plant uses palm oil as feedstock, what pollution does it cause to the atmosphere, except when palm oil spill accidentally into waterways or reservoirs?<br><br>Industrial gas manufacturers produce gases through physical separation of atmospheric air, what pollution is it causing?<br><br>There will be emission into the atmosphere, even as your mother is looking. There will be waste water discharged into the sewer, even as you mother is washing, and there will be rubbish thrown away like you mother after she finish sweeping or vacuuming the house. Just because there are petro industries does not mean there is pollution! Just because your father got mustache does not mean everybody else got moustache is your father! understand the logic?<br><br>I visit clients in Jurong on regular basis and I play golf at JCC on alternate Saturday, I don't think I am about to die soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
