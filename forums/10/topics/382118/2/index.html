            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The TS asked only a simple question and deserve a simplified answer, as any ordinary layman is entitled to.</p>
              <p>We can show off our education, impress with full regurgitation of facts, copy and past onto this thread, but in the end, will it answer the ordinary layman's question?</p>
              <p>No,  thus it would be our responsibility to convert a complex issue into simpler form, so that more may understand and if interest is piqued, it may lead him to seek deeper understanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My personal insight is that inflation will always be here. Inflation in its basic form means more money to purchase an item than in the past. Example, a cup of kopi-O cost only 60cts 10 years ago, and yet today you will need to fork out 90cts.</p>
              <p>Inflation is irreversible.</p>
              <p>Each year, more resources are unearth and manufactured. With such wealth, it creates more employment ( not rise in wage ). With more people having money, lifestyle choices increases and the need for more better products creates a demand, resulting in a rise in prices by producers to sell to the highest bidder.</p>
              <p>Most democratic govts will use a Consumer Price Index CPI, to keep track of prices, using a basket of common essential goods as a GUIDE, and will attempt to use monetary policy to keep it under control, such as value the dollar lower, interest rate hikes, tightening or releasing money supply, etc.</p>
              <p>Planet Earth had not run out of resources, nor anytime soon. Furthermore, with our knowledge built up over time in science and technology, we had learnt to increase agricultural yields and improve land use for maximum optimal output. Thus, wealth will continue to be generated, and employment continue to grow, and mortality rates will keep the population size sustainable to match our productive and resources output.</p>
              <p>So, when you pay for that cup of kopi-0 at 90cts, it is an irreversible occurence. The only way out of this trap is to increase your wage by getting in higher value well paying jobs, either by education or experience with an attitude employer will employ.</p>
              <p>Again, this is only my perspective, made simple for easier comprehension, as best as I can. I make no claims that I am right, nor is my perception a final answer to TS question, for there are deeper and more complex levels of comprehension only a course in it can inflation and its mechanics be fully appreciated and be employed for jobs requiring an understanding for it.</p>

              <p>Since 2061D refuses to share his 'correct views' or the lack of it, then I feel responsible to share mine on the point of contention that 'inflation is irreversible'.</p>
              <p>The opposite or reverse of inflation is deflation. Deflation in simple terms means producers cutting the prices of existing goods to woo a stagnant demand ( or the lack of demand). When that happens, it means doomsday is at hand.</p>
              <p>Cutting prices is common, sometimes are gimmicks, sometimes due to prudent costings and better productivity.</p>
              <p>It real circumstances it occurs when companies are not doing well, so have to sell their goods at lower prices, sometimes to break even their costs and worse still in bankruptcy cases, way below costs. It means doom for the company.</p>
              <p>Pretty ok in isolated cases, but IF on the scale of total economies, its bye bye world.</p>
              <p>When everyone is hoarding their money, producers become desperate and sell cheaply, each outselling lower and lower. Companies everywhere fold, employees laid off, suppliers unpaid, etc, the vicious cycle of poverty occurs. Doomsday, even for the rich as they become targets of crime.</p>
              <p>No govt in the world worth their salt would allow deflation to occur. You can imagine the chaos. There are limits on how much govts can control, for their wealth are limited and not forever, not matter how much they have using it to prevent deflation from entrenching.</p>
              <p>Once confidence is gone, everyone will hide behind close doors and closed wallets, driving themselve deeper into the doom.</p>
              <p>Better to allow inflation to occur in manageable flutuating rates, with wise and prudent monetary policies to encourage wealth generation for everyone thru education, innovation and productivity, than to go cheap cheap cheap.

              <p>Is inflation Irreversible ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steps</span> :</span></p>
              <p>1.  Define inflation</p>
              <p>     Inflation is the inordinate, sustained and general increase in price level</p>
              <p>     ie the cost of basket of goods and services has increased over a period</p>
              <p>     of time usually monthly, quarterly or yearly.</p>
              <p>2.  Define irreversible</p>
              <p>     Irreversible means cannot change something back to what it was before</p>
              <p>3.  To rephrase the question</p>
              <p>     Is inflation irreversible ?</p>
              <p>     Can the increase in prices of the baskets of goods and services be changed</p>
              <p>     back to the original prices ?</p>
              <p>4.  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Theoretically, it is possible to change the prices back to the original prices</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">     ie inflation is NOT irreversible.</span></p>
              <p>5.  Empirically, there are few cases that the prices can be changed back to the</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span> </span></p>
              <p>Is inflation Irreversible ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steps</span> :</span></p>
              <p>1.  Define inflation</p>
              <p>     Inflation is the inordinate, sustained and general increase in price level</p>
              <p>     ie the cost of basket of goods and services has increased over a period</p>
              <p>     of time usually monthly, quarterly or yearly.</p>
              <p>2.  Define irreversible</p>
              <p>     Irreversible means cannot change something back to what it was before</p>
              <p>3.  To rephrase the question</p>
              <p>     Is inflation irreversible ?</p>
              <p>     Can the increase in prices of the baskets of goods and services be changed</p>
              <p>     back to the original prices ?</p>
              <p>4.  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Theoretically, it is possible to change the prices back to the original prices</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">     ie inflation is NOT irreversible.</span></p>
              <p>5.  Empirically, there are few cases that the prices can be changed back to the</p>
              <p>     original prices ie most countries experienced inflation over the years with some</p>
              <p>     countries experiencing higher inflation rate while some countries experienced</p>

              <p>Hey, why not? The value of the $ is arbitrary anyway. It's realistic enough. You should be asking this from the purchasing power perspective of an individual and not the normative value of $$...</p>

              <p>There are countries eg Brazil, Argentina, Zimbawee who encountered hyperinflation and hence the prices are very, very high.</p>
              <p>As a result, the governments issue higher and higher denomination currency.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Theoretically, the governments can issue new currency in smaller denominations ie the government will replace 1 billion old Zimbawee note with 1000 new Zimbawee note.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So, the prices of all goods and services in Zimbawee will fall but might not be of equal percentage. Theoretically, the prices of the basket of goods and services can be back to the prices of 20 or 30 years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">However, it must be noted that the wages and wealth will also be reduced proportionately when the old currency is exchanged for the new currency ie the purchasing power of money is bascialy still the same as before the new currency is introduced. </span></p>
              <p>So, theoretically it is possible to change back to the prices 20 or 30 years ago but no government will do so in practice. Indeed, it is meant to be an exercise question in economics textbooks to let the students know that inflation is not a problem if it is matched by an equal percentage increase in productivity ie a 5% infllation is matched by a 5% increase in money income for everyone.</p>
              <p>Inflation is only a problem when it is not matched by an equal increase in purchasing power and the fact that inflation affects different groups of people differently and different sectors of the economy differently </p>
