              <p>Since the Taiwanese "hum" is so anxious of being part of China - it should return to Taiwan, and leave Singapore for Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Your increases in production tend to be limited unless you invest proportionately because of diminishing returns to scale.</p>
              <p>Recession existed because of the bubbles in the economy. The prices grossly over-valued the goods and services and when the day of reckoning comes, boomz~!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Bubbles are not the same as the business cycle...</p>
              <p>Anyway, food is getting more expensive, that's for sure. Because of lack of investments. Fundumentally it would be because of the increasing pressure on the planet.</p>

              <p>Yet increased production must be supported by increased supply of raw materials in order to sustain itself. An increased population don't mean you can squeeze more rice out of an acre of farmland, or increase rainfall.Nor would it neccessarily give you more oil production or additional mineral mining.</p>
              <p>I think we have grown too accustomed to the idea of raw resources being unlimited for the later part of the last century and for this century. Or that production increase would naturally follow population increase. </p>

              <p>When you talk about oil, are you talking about specific inflation or general inflation. because I thought inflation like SBS2601D defined it was, "since inflation is defined as a rise in <strong>general</strong> price levels over a period of time".</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the increases in oil will be balanced out by decreases in other products and services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>General Equilibrium Model (unless you want to bring relexivity into the equation)</p>
              <p>Say your oil increased dramatically, most of your money is spent on paying for electricity and less on clothing. At the end of the month, the retailer will realised that he has lots of stocks left because of subdued demands, he will mark down his goods to clear his stocks rather than lose it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when you talk about supply shocks aren't you contradicting your earlier statement that population growth is the sole causation of inflation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why I said population growth is not the sole causative force, it's because population growth has been constant throughout, if it were to manifest itself in the inflation graph, you will have received constant inflation throughout and no recessions.</p>

              <p>Inflation is defined as the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">inordinate, sustained and general increase in price level</span></span> ie the cost of the basket of goods and services consumed by a typical household in a country increases over a period of time, usually monthly, quarterly or yearly as compared to the current period period to the base period.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any factors that can cause the prices of those goods and services in the basket to increase will lead to inflation.</span></span> The factors have been classified and given the heading as the different causes of inflation. There are as many as more than 10 main causes of inflation ie cost-push inflation, demand pull inflation, monetarist inflation, asset inflation, imported inflation, structural rigidities inflation, profiteering inflation and so on. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is to be noted that only the overall increase in the whole basket of goods and services will lead to inflation</span></span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span> :</span></p>
              <p>1. In economics, there is no specific inflation or general inflation. Specific inflation is incorrectly associated with the increase in price of one good or service over a period of time. General inflation is also incorrectly associated with the increase in prices of many goods and services over a period of time.</p>
              <p>There is just inflation ie the inordinate, sustained and general increase in the price level.</p>
              <p>2. It is to be noted that the definition of inflation as too much money chasing too few goods is ONLY partially correct as the excessive increase in money supply is ONLY one of the many causes of inflation. </p>
              <p>3. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Since the inflation rate is based on the cost of the basket of goods and services, inflation can be artificially lowered if the greater increase prices goods and services are replaced by the smaller increase prices goods and services or even by decrease in prices goods and services. </span></span></p>

              <p>Inflation is defined as the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">inordinate, sustained and general increase in price level</span></span> ie the cost of the basket of goods and services consumed by a typical household in a country increases over a period of time, usually monthly, quarterly or yearly as compared to the current period period to the base period.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any factors that can cause the prices of those goods and services in the basket to increase will lead to inflation.</span></span> The factors have been classified and given the heading as the different causes of inflation. There are as many as more than 10 main causes of inflation ie cost-push inflation, demand pull inflation, monetarist inflation, asset inflation, imported inflation, structural rigidities inflation, profiteering inflation and so on. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is to be noted that only the overall increase in the whole basket of goods and services will lead to inflation</span></span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span> :</span></p>
              <p>1. In economics, there is no specific inflation or general inflation. Specific inflation is incorrectly associated with the increase in price of one good or service over a period of time. General inflation is also incorrectly associated with the increase in prices of many goods and services over a period of time.</p>
              <p>There is just inflation ie the inordinate, sustained and general increase in the price level.</p>
              <p>2. It is to be noted that the definition of inflation as too much money chasing too few goods is ONLY partially correct as the excessive increase in money supply is ONLY one of the many causes of inflation. </p>
              <p>3. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Since the inflation rate is based on the cost of the basket of goods and services, inflation can be artificially lowered if the greater increase prices goods and services are replaced by the smaller increase prices goods and services or even by decrease in prices goods and services. </span></span></p>

              <p>When you talk about oil, are you talking about specific inflation or general inflation. because I thought inflation like SBS2601D defined it was, "since inflation is defined as a rise in <strong>general</strong> price levels over a period of time".</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the increases in oil will be balanced out by decreases in other products and services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>General Equilibrium Model (unless you want to bring relexivity into the equation)</p>
              <p>Say your oil increased dramatically, most of your money is spent on paying for electricity and less on clothing. At the end of the month, the retailer will realised that he has lots of stocks left because of subdued demands, he will mark down his goods to clear his stocks rather than lose it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when you talk about supply shocks aren't you contradicting your earlier statement that population growth is the sole causation of inflation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why I said population growth is not the sole causative force, it's because population growth has been constant throughout, if it were to manifest itself in the inflation graph, you will have received constant inflation throughout and no recessions.</p>

              <p>Talking about general inflation.</p>
              <p>I don't think i have ever said it would be the sole cause of inflation. But i believe that it IS a major factor that would become more prevalent when natural disasters or wars disrupts supply from a particular region of the world, where there just isn't any spare capacity anywhere to make up for the disrupted shortfalls. Or that a oil producing country would be forced to divert more of its oil production to domestic consumptions.</p>
              <p>Yes, as we have seen from the recent Financial Crisis that oil prices plummeled to 30 US. I did not ignore that fact, but my worry is because energy prices are the foundation of the global economy and that production is starting to peak we are going to see an increasing number of financial crashes and subsequent weaker rebounds  </p>
              <p>Even if population growth remains constant, it must be accompanied by an equally constant production of fossil fuels/food/water/minerals in order to sustain itself. What i'm saying is any disruption to that production would grow more and more devastating as the population increases, resulting in spikes of inflation.  </p>
              <p>You believe that the effects would balance itself out, i just don't think it's going to be that simple.</p>

              <p>Also diminishing returns is not static phenomenon, improvements in science and technology can negate diminishing returns (like GMO produce and vertical farming).</p>

              <p>GMO does have its potentials i would admit that.</p>
              <p>But GMO crops require that the farmer buy the "designer" chemical pesticides, fertilizers, fuels for required leases on equipment, and must BUY SEEDS every new season, or they are in violation of contracts...often leading to foreclosure.</p>
              <p>And if the bees (stupid insects that they are) decides to cross pollinate the GMO crops with the neighbouring non GMO crops, the GMO corporations have the right to sue that farm to oblivion. Effectively removing competitioners.</p>
              <p>So basically we give the corporations producing GMO food the equivalent power of a government ministry but with none of the accompanied checks and balances. And what happens when they become a monopoly?</p>
              <p>It's the same as saying technology gives Singapore the ability to be self sufficient in water but we forget that we actually need more fossil fuels in order to run the deslination plants and NeWater facilities.</p>
              <p>The solutions often create more problems than it was designed to solve.</p>
