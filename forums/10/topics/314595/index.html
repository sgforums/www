              <p> very happy to read your post above, such a good post.  Seriously, the present positions for pm and mm must be made vacant for we can't afford these sickos whose character are questionable to lead the nation.  pm underperforms and pay himself super high world class salary.   It is normal and reasonable for any company to sack or terminate staff like that.  </p>

WTF, who here (singaporeans i.e.) in the right mind wants to be a shampoo girl or kitchen helpers, if one can help it. this is true given the current pay scale on these jobs.</p>
              <p>the problem lies with the government. they need to impose a certain minimum wage for these entry level occupation. when singaporean finds it `worthwhile' to compete for these jobs, then the skills and standard of service goes up because the best person will get the job. now, it is rather the person who is willing to be the `cheapest' who are likely to fill these vacancies. no wonder one get pissed by the level of service received. i go to a restaurant and i get poor treatment because the chinese waitress is disinterested in her job. why? because she is paid `peanuts' and she probably is into her 2nd shift already. she has no motivation to excel. pay a fair wage and you see the instant shift.</p>
              <p>i am not saying the FT issue is non-existent. i myself is affected. but we need to look at it in perspective. in this case, i don't think this is a case of pro-FT overkill.</p>
