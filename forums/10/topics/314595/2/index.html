              <p>Yes, it is true. They are very good and cheap in this field.</p>
              <p>However, employers got eye to see one. Because of this practise...top managements are very reluctant to promote Indians beyond manager level.</p>
              <p>We have MBAs and PHDs Indians working for many years with the company.. but they will always get bypassed. So .. they are actually spoiling the markets for other well deserving Indians.</p>

              <p>i have malay IT ex-colleagues and till this day, worked for more than 8 years in the same position in *CS at the same position. why cant they trained and promoted to take on better roles, instead of balantly call in indian/PRC/china FTs to hold on better positions?</p>
              <p>one of the govt site that my GM used to run, had this indian FT tasked to monitor the entire enterprise backup system. everyday told my GM that the backup jobs where ok, but there was a crash with one of the mission critical servers and need urgent recovery. the FT couldnt do it.. and my GM found out that the backups had failed consistently for the past 3 months!</p>
              <p>their certification and training, according to my ex-indian IT colleague, are received in school compound with a trainer using an overhead projector to teach to a mass of 500-1000+ students at a fee of $100 per head. after which, they are presented a cert called "certified in java programming, or plsql programming"!</p>

              <p>1. all his indian ocean team gets reasonably new models of notebooks. somehow, for me, I get a worn out machine. full of weird noises from this machine. why? I asked for change and report the problem. Nothing done. the battery life is 5 mins.</p>
              <p>2. I am one of the rare locals in the team. suppose to report under him, he does not talk to me and place me under 2 similar or lower ranked staff from the indian ocean to give me work to do. They order me around like hand pointing to me asking me to go over whenever they have things for me to do. Usually, asking me do testing.</p>
              <p>3. They never talk to me from the start and distance from me not asking me to go lunch with them.</p>
              <p>I see that i have no future in this company : the boss , his assistant mgrs, his team all from the indian ocean.</p>
              <p>no chance to climb. difficult at best. bias.</p>

              <p>4. I tested and found a critical technical design issue in the solution developed by the indian ocean sub-con implementing the project. My boss works for our company who engage the consultants. I raised it and immediately the boss said they are not wrong. The problem was raised several months back also by someother tester.

              <p>i agree with u they should be reported for sedition acts and hopefully PAP can fine  them a 100   grand like what they did in AUS to to an Airline company. then use the money to spend on public.</p>

              <p>The decision makers in the govt and govt agencies are destroying Singapore with their almost everything pro-FT, pro foreigners and their deterence-sentence-trigger-happy-treat-Singaporean-lesser-than-foreigners policies and attitude.  Intentional or not, sometimes perceived, but most times real.  Singaporeans feel they are treated worse than second-class citizens in their own country where their sons, brothers, uncles, father, nephews, husband (with the support of their families, to look after their parents, children, brothers, sister, grandparents while they are in NS)  performed 2 long years of national service and many years of reservist duty so that Singapore can be safe and secured.  It is a sacrifice and opportunity cost that is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not , priceless.  Without which those top paying officers in govt  will not be able to continue to receive their gigantic pay package.  Some of our NS men have made the ultimate sacrifice.  Their mothers cried themselves dry.  I ask with a broken heart and soul, how can Singaporeans be treated as second class and sometimes even third class citizens by the people they risk their lives to protect?   Where is these decisions' maker conscience?   Whose interests are they protecting? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The way Singapore govt treats its people, in terms of its policies and actions, will give foreigners a good idea how they should treat Singaporeans.  It is no wonder then our govt-linked company's are treated as second class in some countries.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do these policies and decision makers know Singaporeans are loosing their souls, their sense of belonging, their pride and are suffering most of the time in silence?  Maybe not.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The culture of complacency may be so overwhelming that these decision makers may not even know or care how the grassroots feel.. until it is too late...  Sigh....</p>
