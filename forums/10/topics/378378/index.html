              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore cruise agents up in arms over extra charges</strong></span></span><br> <br> Marcus Hand, Singapore - Friday 9 October 2009<br> <br> CRUISESHIP agents are in uproar over a decision by the Singapore Cruise Centre to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>charge ships an additional docking fee of 10 times the usual amount</strong></span></span> if they are forced to berth at container terminals due to congestion.<br> <br> Singapore-based cruise line agents were informed officially a week ago
              of hefty new service charges to be levied in the October 2009 to April
              2010 cruise season <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>on vessels that will have to call at PSA’s container terminals due to lack of space during busy periods at the cruise centre.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The fee was not stated in the letter to agents</strong></span> informing them of the new charges, but agents who have enquired were told it would be an <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>additional S$3,600 ($2,587) per hour, compared with S$340 per hour docking charges previously.</strong></span><br> <br> Singapore Shipping Association cruise sub-committee chairman Frankie
              Tan said they were concerned that both the service charge was very
              high, and it was being implemented immediately.<br> <br> Mr Tan said it would affect the costs of cruise lines that had already
              published their programme for the next season and budgeted for their
              costs. International cruise lines normally plan their itineraries at
              least one year in advance.<br> <br> The new higher fees will affect 19 ships scheduled to call at the
              Singapore Cruise Centre between now and April 2010. An average call of
              12 hours for an affected vessel would cost an estimated average
              additional amount of S$41,392.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Costa Classica, due to stay in port in
              Singapore for 34 hours, will pay an estimated additional S$107,644 on
              top of the original docking fee of $14,756. In total the 19 affected
              calls are expected to cost an additional S$789,399.</strong></span><br> <br> The cruise centre has given no reason as to why the additional fees are
              being levied and the SSA expressed grave concerns over the lack of
              consistency of transparency of fees being charged for vessels calling
              at third party berths.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“It would be a shame if a lack of
              transparency irreparably damages Singapore’s reputation and credibility
              after all the work that has gone into developing Singapore as an
              International Maritime Centre and cruise hub,” </strong></span>said SSA president SS Teo.<br> <br> Mr Tan called for the fee to be postponed until at least next year to
              give cruise lines time to decide if they wanted to make alternative
              arrangements.<br> <br> Cruise line agents said it was too early to gauge the reaction of
              cruise lines although they are expected to be unhappy about the charges
              and unwilling to accept such a large additional charge.<br> <br> “Cruiseship operators may decide to divert their ships to other ports in the region in view of their lower costs,” said Mr Teo.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Singapore Cruise Centre is the only licensed
              cruise terminal operator in the city state, and Maritime &amp; Port
              Authority of Singapore does not allow cruiseships to anchor for
              passengers to be brought ashore by tenders.</strong></span><br> <br> Singapore’s second cruise terminal, which broke ground last week, will
              not be operational until the end of 2011. Cruiseship passenger arrivals
              in Singapore have grown by 20% this year and are expected to pass the
              1m mark before year end. <br> <br> ================<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>For more updates, pls visit <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a></strong></span><br> <br> .</p>
