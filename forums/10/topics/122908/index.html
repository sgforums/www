            <div class='col-md body'>I am really amazed at the "World Class" standards our EZ Link system has been hyping about themselves.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I took a 8 minutes bus ride yesterday night using my ezlink card. To my amusement, it charged me $1.43 while normally, its only 63 cents. Thus, I walked up to the lady driver and ask why is that so? She was puzzled and finally found out that the system in her bus screwed up. For some reasons, the satellite driven EZ system has malfunctioned and the stop that it dictated to the bus' computer system has "jumped" tremendously!<br><br>INteresting enough, I asked the bus driver what to do. She said go and claim from SMRT! That's a bit strange because I was taking a SBS bus! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, I took the trouble to go to the nearby MRT station and state my claim. To my surprise, they refused to refund me immediately and say they have to check. I ask them what is there to check? Didn't my EZ link card contains enough information like what time what place I board the bus, at what time I alighted the bus? Strange enough, the lady at the counter says she cannot see that information! She wanted me to come back one week later! Gosh! For some stupid mistake of their multi million dollar "World Class" system, I have to waste my time to come back to them?<br><br>I find it unacceptable. The whole system and customer service is all screwed up! The most funny thing is that when I say I will be out of town for a long time, they say they will send the 80 cents cheque to me! Hahahaha! For that little 80 cents, they want to waste money on stamps to mail me a cheque! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think the whole design of the systm is all screwed up. It didn't take into account of customer service and apparently, the database is not well designed. It cannot track any details on bus schedules as well as location information on timing basis. And for such small matters they need 7 days to settle, that's what "WORLD CLASS" system is all about? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, the EZ Link is anything but "World Class". It is just a badly designed junk to the IT world if it couldn't even use IT's advantage to solve simple problem like this.<br><br>Anyway, for those of you out there, please be careful when you use your EZ link card. Always check the amount deducted by the EZ link system. We should never trust this IT junk too much. In statistical terms, the error is quite high, sometimes even without people knowing! I have discovered numerous times how they over charge me for short ride but this time is really too much when they actually have installed the satellite tracking system.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

I addition, they boast to have 6 million card in circulation..... Singapore has a population of 4 million....... Why would people want to own so many cards...... They are stuck buy new cards cannot return...once return they will lose $5.... Why can't  they allow cards in good condition to be returned and reuse?</div>

Another issue is this. Let's say I board from the bus stop, the fare to the terminal/ interchange is $1.03. Ironically, the bus stop alighted fare deductable is $1.03, yet passengers complain to say that they are over-charged. Mind you, there are close to 200 dist - related fares services and all cases are dif.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>It seems that my own experience with EZ Link is not unique. The following<br>letter to ST forum has confirmed another over charge:<br><br>ST, April 5, 2005<br><br>Is fare updating system reliable for loop services?<br><br>LAST Saturday, at about 11.25am, my wife and I took an SBS Transit service 9<br>from Bedok Interchange to Eastpoint in Simei for lunch.<br><br>When the person in front of me alighted, I noticed that his ez-link card<br>showed a deduction of $1.53. Instinctively, I sensed that something was<br>amiss and checked the deduction for my card when I alighted. The amount also<br>showed $1.53.<br><br>As the distance from Bedok to Eastpoint is not very great, $1.53 seems a bit<br>too expensive.<br><br>The next day, I went to the ez-link website to check the deductions on my<br>card. Not surprisingly, a deduction of $1.53 was made on April 2 at 11.43am<br>on my wife's card as well as mine.<br><br>Not convinced that the fare was $1.53, I went to the SBS website to check.<br>It calculated my fare to be $0.83.<br><br>I noticed that SBS service 9 is a loop service to Airport Cargo Road.<br>Perhaps the auto fare updating system could have mistaken the bus to be at<br>the opposite bus stop at the point when I alighted.<br><br>The SBS website showed that the fare from Bedok to Eastpoint (opposite bus<br>stop) to be $1.53. This raises a number of questions:<br><br>How many passengers have been overcharged while taking SBS service 9 all<br>this while?<br><br>Is this a frequent occurrence on loop services?<br><br>How reliable is the auto fare updating system for loop services?<br><br>I would like to suggest a few ways to overcome this problem:<br><br>Incorporate into the system a means to countercheck the fare with the time<br>taken for the entire journey. It would have been impossible for me to have<br>travelled from Bedok Interchange to Airport Cargo Road to Eastpoint in a<br>span of 20 minutes.<br><br>Link the system to the bus odometer to countercheck the fare with the<br>distance travelled.<br><br>Chua Khee Seng<br></div>
