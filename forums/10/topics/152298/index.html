Pls talk to your parents, your siblings, your friends or teachers, someone you can trust!! If you really have fear for something in the dark, go find a church and talk to a pastor. You need to talk to someone face to face.<br><br>Death, when and how, is not our choice and we should not try to take such things in our hands!!<br><br>Get out of the house, have some fresh air and talk to somebody.<br><br></div>
