              <p>The 1940s was a turbulent time, more so for many whom had seen
              their protectors fled, their loved ones molested or murdered and
              kept in poverty. There can be no excuse for dishonour and loss of
               integrity, but such words are easily spoken today when you

              <p>Don't think they can increase GST any more, it's more or less maxed out. If they do increase somemore, citizens will make comparisons with other countries. Why is it that other countries have similar GST but provide more social welfare?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What they have done right now is means testing, depriving some citizens from benefits? Means testing to me is like, when you go to a foodcourt, the supervisor there assess your ability to pay, refuses you entry to the foodcourt and force you to dine in Pontini. When they reduce the so called medical "subsidies" it increases their surplus, the less they spend, the more they make. Maybe set up more ERP gantries, higher fines, petrol tax, HDBs, lengthening withdrawal age for CPF, etc.</p>

              <p>Well, what it was for me is actually quite simple.  Even as primary school kids you'd realise that while a chauffer looked pretty good driving a Mercedes, it was someone else's Mercedes that he was driving. </p>
              <p>Taking the same principle writ large, Singapore was making a real reputation for itself as a manufacturing base for foreign companies; sure, we looked great churning out those millions of TVs, radios and PCBs, but we were still doing the dogs' body work for someone else.  Japan started the same way, but by the 80's, countries like Singapore were manufacturing for them.  When was it going to be Singapore's turn to own the Mercedes instead of simply driving it?</p>
              <p>I started questioning what it would take for Singapore to move up, and that's when the cancerous quality of the Singaporean culture's obsession with control became obvious to me.  I'll be the first to point out that I was looking after number one in deciding that my effort was better spent doing my thing in a placewhere I had the freedom to think for myself, instead of trying to change the minds of people who were more than happy to trudge along to someone else's command and control structure.</p>

              <p>As I said earlier, to be fair, tight control was required during the early days to keep the ship afloat.  The problem is that by the 80's, such control went from being a necessity to being a liability, but few people noticed.</p>
