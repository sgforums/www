              <p>Look at US and Australia ( though Europe may be better) , their people are indisciplined, cry rights for every small thing to exploit, line up for social security money, to much power given to private corporations which in turn jack up prices leading to inflation. Their politicians argue in court to "fix" each other up and end up doing nothing. Decisions take a long time and their country budgets are on deficiets. They are on debt for billions and trillions</p>

              <p><strong><em>If I were in authority in Singapore indefinitely without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done, then I would not have the slightest doubt that I could govern much more effectively in their interests.” </em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong><em>- Lee Kuan Yew, 1962</em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>

              <p>Yeah, it's just so much more efficient in Singapore where the courts are just old Harry's strap-on to buttfuck anybody who's got the temerity to be an opposition member. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>By the way, read the dates on those quotes.  Can you really argue that things said so long ago apply to Singapore's current circumstances?  If they do, doesn't it mean that Harry fucked up and Singapore's no different than what it was 47 years ago? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Well, what LKY wanted (i beleive) is the enginnering of a disciplined society through his principles. If he allow too  much democracy , there will be rifts and different sections within society which will make social cohesion difficult. he wanted a society of common beliefs and values needed for a society to function in a stable and constant form. This was absolutely necessary in the 1960s to 80s.</p>
              <p>Of cos though, if he let an opponent crush him and take over power , then society will take a different turn and may even collapse.</p>
              <p>I also noticed that this worked up until the coming of the internet. The internet spread different ideas among people and now,  we see a more diversified thinking .</p>

              <p>i was discussing this issue with a friend a few months back.</p>

              <p>singapore is too small with too few resources. just a little bit of cock up, and we're all screwed over.</p>
              <p>that's why there can't be any protests etc.</p>
              <p>and why there can't be any strong oppositions, because if PAP has to keep concentrating on fighting the oppositions, they can't concentrate to develop singapore.</p>

              <p>i agreed with this. Having protests occur will lead to things like rerrorism, racial riots and other serious crimes already seen in other countries. E.g. the Black July in Sri Lanka which led to the civil war.</p>

              <p>You're kidding, aren't you?  Please tell me you're kidding.</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is that this iron grip is what's caused the current mess where the government is scrambling around on a ludicrous mission to teach people to be creative and to retool at last-minute notice.  They spent forty years beating every last ounce of original thought out of everyone to create a submissive population, and now they've realised that they've royally screwed the pooch by creating a society that's too expensive to compete with the Indians, Thais and such, and aren't bright enough to take Singapore in a direction commensurate with its price bracket.</p>
              <p>For the first 25 years, yes, the government did the right thing by pointing everyone in the same direction.  However, by the early to mid 80's, the economy had stabilised to the point where if people were given some free rein, they could have been on the cutting edge by now.  Instead, all we get is a whole lot of bullshit about hub this and hub that, and a shitload of foreign talents brought in because the government systematically bred all talent out of Singaporeans by controlling everything.</p>
              <p>It didn't start when the Internet came about, it started a helluva lot earlier, and guess what?  If the Singaporean government had been watching what had been happening in Japan by the early 80's, they would have realised that the manufacturing game upon which the economy was originally built was always a time-limited game, and they would have started trying to figure out what the nextstage of Singapore's evolution was.  But nooooo, they were too busy fucking around with people's lives and playing petty political games in court.</p>
              <p>If you want to know where all the current brouhaha about foreign talents came from, look at what happened between 1980 and 1986, and how it relates to growth over the subsequent 15-20 years.  Then come back and tell me how fucking smart Harry is.</p>

              population, and now they've realised that they've royally screwed
              the pooch by creating a society that's too expensive to compete
              with the Indians, Thais and such, and aren't bright enough to take
              Singapore in a direction commensurate with its price bracket.</p>
              <p>For the first 25 years, yes, the government did the right thing
              by pointing everyone in the same direction.  However, by the
              early to mid 80's, the economy had stabilised to the point where if
              people were given some free rein, they could have been on the
              cutting edge by now.  Instead, all we get is a whole lot of
              bullshit about hub this and hub that, and a shitload of foreign
              talents brought in because the government systematically bred all
              talent out of Singaporeans by controlling everything.</p>
              <p>It didn't start when the Internet came about, it started a
              helluva lot earlier, and guess what?  If the Singaporean
              government had been watching what had been happening in Japan by
              the early 80's, they would have realised that the manufacturing
              game upon which the economy was originally built was always a
              time-limited game, and they would have started trying to figure out
              what the nextstage of Singapore's evolution was.  But nooooo,
              they were too busy fucking around with people's lives and playing
              petty political games in court.</p>
              <p>If you want to know where all the current brouhaha about foreign
              talents came from, look at what happened between 1980 and 1986, and
              how it relates to growth over the subsequent 15-20 years. 
              Then come back and tell me how fucking smart Harry is.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A general observation made by anthropology and I tend to agree. So long as the elites of a country that suffers together with its people thru wrong policies and benefit thru Good policies. The chances of survivor are higher, it forces the decision maker/elites to push for the common good in order to survive.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>On the contrary If the political elites/ regime insulate itself to prevent collapsing and thereby distancing themselves from mistake. This type of regime will fail because it does not suffer thru mistake. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In recent years, We are witnessing major failure by ALL Political regimes globally, as the elites are better educated they create policies that sustained their political goal and existence thru inflated wealth creation.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Regimes – globally are headed into the wrong direction.<span>  </span>We are still pursuing resources, and wealth accumulation. While Civilians globally served towards Singularity.</span></p>
