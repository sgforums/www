              <p>The hum in fried kuay teow today is pathetic. The hum in fried kuay teow in the 80s were fresh, nice, big and JUICY. hum today machiam like rubber and tiny rubber.</p>
              <p>This is the REAL reason why we in Potong Pasir have been voting for Mr Chiam. It is a collective protest as to the state of the hum in fried kuay teow. All Mr Seetoh need to do is realise this fact and promise big fat juicy hum in fried kuay teow in Potong Pasir coffeeshops and he will WIN by a landslide I tell you.</p>

              <p>Gedankan, It is easier to look back on our past and judge based on HINDSIGHT, and condemn what went wrong, what should have been done and how our lives would be better today. BUT it takes great foresight for someone back then to do what they had to do to ensure we all survived. No one could have predicted the future.</p>
              <p><br>The 80s were equally of boom and bust stages. Recession and wars. Economic disorders. Japan and Taiwan expanded their entreprenuerships and was was caught in massive recession and the battle with US, a major importer, over inequality over their exports and dollar spending.</p>
              <p><br>We in SIngapore had only our port and tourism, which would hardly had paid for social spending of the likes we enjoy today.Malaysia was exerting and flexing its muscles and never failed to rattle its sabres at us.</p>
              <p><br>How many graduate and scholars were there in the 80s? How productive and educated were we back then, let alone to have an entreprenuerial mind in the face of better educated and progressive and matured societies such as Japan, Taiwan and korea?</p>
              <p><br>What could we do that can be cheaper and better than resource rich Malaysia or Indonesia?</p>
              <p><br>Had you ever and even ask yourself this fact?</p>
              <p><br>Things were no better in the 80s than anytime now in 2009. The only difference is that back then our treasury was only in millions, now it is billions. Somebody certainly sweated and saved it, instead of spending it lavishly the way US does each year.</p>
              <p><br>Had we not have this billions, it would have been tougher for many of us today. Point is, right or wrong, necessary decisions made in the past ensured our survival today and one must  give credit where it is due, not condemnation based on hindsight even a village idiot can mouthed out.</p>
              <p><br>More vital is our tomorrow. Where do we go from here? Is it too late for us to rebuild our billions for our next generation? All I know nothing is ever too late if we use what we have - our hands and our brains. So curb that angst and let us all crack our brains on how we can collectively improve our economy, what will work for us as a society, thru discussion and not finger pointing or ridiculing each other.</p>

              <p>All you people egging on for social help, do you want to pay
                  high taxes to support those that pay none? It has occured to me
                  that those that need all these extras are actually insufficient to
                  start with. All poor here? I doubt it.</p>

              <p>The 1940s was a turbulent time, more so for many whom had seen their protectors fled, their loved ones molested or murdered and kept in poverty.

              <p>Yeah, I have and I did.  By the time I was in JC something already struck me as being not quite right, and as I went along I looked at how excessive control was being exerted in a situation where the example of Japan's expanding economy had already shown five years prior that people needed to be pushed forward, not yanked back by leashes.  Yet Singapore's culture was one of adamant complacency that "yes sir, no sir, three bags full" was the way to go, and actively went out of its way to stamp out independent thought.</p>
              <p>That was 1992, and that's when I decided that my energy was better spent a place without control freaks who would evetually run the ship aground, and I started putting together my plans to leave.  I'm not going to rub it in by describing my circumstances in detail, but suffice to say I'm living very comfortably, and this is the product of foresight, not of the hindsight with which you assume I speak.  Let me know if you ever come to Melbourne and I'll show you exactly what I mean.</p>

              <p>You don't see it, do you?  After all of this talk about Singapore being an economic miracle, making it to First World status and all that jazz, don't you think that by definition, it's out of place for a First World country to be talking about mere survival?</p>
              <p>I do wish people would make up their minds - has Singapore made it, or has Singapore not made it?</p>
              <p>If Singapore has made it, it's time to get past the "we must do this to survive" nonsense because the name of the game need to be advancement, and not survival.</p>
              <p>If Singapore hasn't yet made it, then for the love of God can we stop drinking the "LKY made Singapore a miracle" Kool-Aid?</p>
              <p>Either way, you're right.  The past doesn't count.  You know as well as I do it's today, and the MoM figures I've posted already show that trouble's past brewing, it's spilling over the edge.  It's time to wake up and smell the coffee instead of falling back on rose-tinted recollections of the 60's - 80's.</p>
