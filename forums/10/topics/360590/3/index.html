              <p>Democracy is a form of government in which state-power is held
              by the majority of citizens within a country or a state. It is
              derived from the Greek δημοκρατÎ¯α (dÄ“mokratía (info)), “popular
              government”, which was coined from δá¿†μος (dêmos), “people” and
              κρÎ¬τος (krátos), “rule, strength” in the middle of the fifth-fourth
              century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some
              Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in
              508 BC.</p>

              <p>I am trying to make u understand, western liberal democracy was
                      found on christian principles. Christianity or similar religions
                      were the main foundation in that countries. So it took on a
                      civilised and stable form up till today, In ethnic singapore, we
                      have different religions, ethnic groups with their own set of
                      separate beliefs. We cannot establish the style of democracy seen
                      in western countries. Simply not possible. trying to do so will
                      have a negative effect as democracy itself will bring about chaos
                      and disorder with one set of beliefs ( religion, ideology or

              <p>Since when was "western liberal democracy" founded on "Christian Principles" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you not being ridiculous to bring in "religious precepts" into a "political form" - and contradicting yourself with the idea that "western liberalism" can be linked to some "Christian Principles" that are more conservative than being liberal ?</p>
              <p>Are you being confused or attempting to befuddle the situation with your ill considered thread that attempted to be provocative but now trying to salvage your untenable position when exposed for the very weak foundation that it intend to build itself on ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the style of western democracy cannot be accepted in Singapore, why should this supposedly pragmatic PAP Government attempt to continue with any semblance of the Westminster Parliamentary System ?</p>
              <p>Is this not an entire charade that has been continued since 1957 - the year that LKY took over the reins of political power and continue to manipulate the legislations to his own and his PAP's advantage ?</p>
              <p>If the concept of Democracy is a Western Liberal and Christian idea - why should this be continued by a politically secular state propounded by LKY, and forced onto  a multi-ethnic and multi-religious Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Why will this PAP Government then selectively implement a two-tier political system that he hoped will ease the hunger for more citizen "involvement" in the Singapore political process - by allowing Singaporean to have a bigger say on local politics at the Town Council level, and take any political sting from Singaporean's involvement at the National Level ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this whole idea of Democracy is a Western Liberal and Christian idea - why will Communist China even begin to attempt to institute democracy to be practiced at the village level, when the very concept of liberalism will undermine the authority of the long held acceptance to the singular domination of the CCP over all political affairs in China ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The concept of Democracy is to have each and every Citizen to participate and be responsible for all political events and decisions that affect the community which the Citizen is part of.</p>
              <p>It is supposed to be government by the people - especially rule of the majority - a government in which the supreme power is VESTED IN THE PEOPLE and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held FREE elections.</p>
              <p>It is neither liberal nor western nor Christian in its beginning, as the idea of Democracy had begun thousands of years ago - in the centuries Before Christ - in ancient Greece.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's practice of Democracy is only in form and not in substance - as can be seen by the single minded political attempt to cut down the development and support for any Alternative Political Parties, blocking citizen's involvement in the POLITICAL LIFE of Singapore, and the constant manipulation of the political process to ensure the ONE Party dominance of the PAP as the only Government in Singapore.</p>

              <p>You're kidding, aren't you?  Please tell me you're
              kidding.</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is that this iron grip is what's caused
              the current mess where the government is scrambling around on a
              ludicrous mission to teach people to be creative and to retool at
              last-minute notice.  They spent forty years beating every last
              ounce of original thought out of everyone to create a submissive
              population, and now they've realised that they've royally screwed
              the pooch by creating a society that's too expensive to compete
              with the Indians, Thais and such, and aren't bright enough to take
              Singapore in a direction commensurate with its price bracket.</p>
              <p>For the first 25 years, yes, the government did the right thing
              by pointing everyone in the same direction.  However, by the
              early to mid 80's, the economy had stabilised to the point where if
              people were given some free rein, they could have been on the
              cutting edge by now.  Instead, all we get is a whole lot of
              bullshit about hub this and hub that, and a shitload of foreign
              talents brought in because the government systematically bred all
              talent out of Singaporeans by controlling everything.</p>
              <p>It didn't start when the Internet came about, it started a
              helluva lot earlier, and guess what?  If the Singaporean
              government had been watching what had been happening in Japan by
              the early 80's, they would have realised that the manufacturing
              game upon which the economy was originally built was always a
              time-limited game, and they would have started trying to figure out
              what the nextstage of Singapore's evolution was.  But nooooo,
              they were too busy fucking around with people's lives and playing
              petty political games in court.</p>
              <p>If you want to know where all the current brouhaha about foreign
              talents came from, look at what happened between 1980 and 1986, and
              how it relates to growth over the subsequent 15-20 years. 
              Then come back and tell me how fucking smart Harry is.</p>

              <p>On a PAP ticket, Goh successfully contested the Kreta Ayer seat in the 1959 Legislative Assembly elections, and joined the first government of Prime Minister <a title="Lee Kuan Yew" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> as Minister of Finance. In this role, he was to assume stewardship of Singapore's economy, and in the following decade, Goh was to serve as the chief architect of the country's economic development.</p>

              <p>Politics is dirty, maybe the dirtiest of all trade or prof. Someone got to go to the top, hardly you find a nation run by 2 heads, sooner or later, chaos will take over. Even the thais disagree that thaksin runs the north and abhisit runs the south. No doubt Mr Goh and all other old guards which i read in nets and history do play an important parts in the making of Singapore, you have to agree that who dare wins. To me, Mr Goh is a economist, not a politician.</p>
