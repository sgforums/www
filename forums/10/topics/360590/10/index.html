              <p>Fantagf, you are not worth my time for any reply. But it
              become obvious that you do not have the ability to realise your own
              stupidity.</p>
              <p>Since the beginning, before independence, migrants came to
              Singapore and became Singaporean through the right given by the
              consititution, and their contribution to the country. The
              constitution of Singapore, is above all
              legitimate political parties of the country. Whether you like
              PAP or not doesn't really matter.</p>
              <p>It is the same way that Singaporean who migrate to Australia,
              Canada...are granted PR, citizenships of the countries, by the
              constitution of the countries.</p>
              <p>The big difference here is that the local born australian,
              canadian are gracious to accept new immigrants of any origins,
              races, as fellow australians, canadians....while some self
              righteous, naive, Singaporeans still think they own the land.</p>
              <p>You are pathetic.</p>

              <p>What has religion to do with prosperity ?</p>
              <p>Singapore's wealth is superficial and due to the high Per Capita - (whether GDP or GNP) - that is largely due to the small size of the population, much like the population in Brunei.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, on closer examination - numbers do not reflect reality in both countries, although Brunei's situation is far better than Singapore due to the fact that the Royal Family treats the Brunei citizens as a larger family.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How did you so admirably come to such a conclusion ?</p>
              <p>According to some research published in autobiographies about LKY - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Man-Island-Study-Singapores/dp/086861906X">‘No Man is an Island – James Minchin’  </a>- during his existence as a school boy, he was practically harmless but a domineering person, growing up in a family filled with frequent quarrels between his father and mother that led him to take side with his mother, and distancing himself from the father.</p>
              <p>His early working life as a young attorney during the 1950s was involved in legal representations of Trade Unions - where he learnt the workings of unions, and how the work force is mobilized as pressure groups to be potent political force to fit some agendas.</p>
              <p>His first taste of politics was when he represented Trade Unionists detained by the British Colonial Government, and fought for the Rights of the Workers - to gather, to strike for safe working environment and decent wages.</p>
              <p>No one knows when his political ambition came into fruition that led him to cross the line into political activism - by actually joining forces with Lim Chin Siong the leader of the Trade Union to form a political party called the People's Action Party.</p>
              <p>The rest has become recent history of double crosses, false referendums designed by LKY that drove us into a poorly thought out merger arrangement to be part of Malaysia - going against the best advices from local voices who understood the complex minds of the Malay aristocrats and politicians.</p>
              <p>Singapore could have been as vibrant as the private capital that developed Hong Kong to what it is today, without the odorous and ominous heavy hand of politicians playing the role of pseudo entrepreneurs, capitalists, and investors that stifled private enterprise through lop-sided competition.</p>
              <p>In the 1960s, independent Singapore saw Singaporeans forced from Primary Sector activities in agriculture, farming, and family businesses to become skilled workers laboring for foreign MNCs that have been given all the perks and protection against protests, strikes, riots, and assured cheap labor.</p>
              <p>Private enterprise was discouraged for reasons of poor economies of scale, and a waste of limited "national resource".</p>
              <p>In the 1970s, everyone was "whipped" into a singular national idealism based on the PAP concept of what nationhood should be - it was all about the nation not the individual creativity.</p>
              <p>It was a continuation of the 1960s politics of "dulling the mind with a full stomach".</p>
              <p>In the 1980s, the tune changed to one of idealism to attain <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2008/11/pushed-back-10-years.html">‘the Swiss Standard of Living’  </a> - which was less resilient then the real thing in Switzerland which remained rock steady during the economic crash of 1987 that spun South-east Asia out of orbit.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, the Swiss Standards was conveniently forgotten with the ascension of LHL to the PM's chair - and the struggles continue through the financial meltdown of 1997, the shock of 9/11, SARS in 2002, Bird Flu in 2004 - with First World Standards of Living melting as Singaporeans are told to live with short term employment contracts that are renewable every 3 or 5 years.</p>
              <p>In the midst of all these regressions, new legislations are now passed to refine the methods in dealing with dissident Singaporeans planning to have their voices heard.</p>
              <p>Public money lost are not accountable, while new schemes are created with the abandonment of pre-planned careful safeguards of the Second Key.</p>
              <p>If after all that has happened over the last 30 years, and you still have no clue as to what our potential could have been, or what could have been better - you will have to find some solace in seeing your next generations continue to struggle.</p>
