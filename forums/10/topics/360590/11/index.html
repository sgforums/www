              <p>How many ways can the word "prosperity" be defined and
              understood ?</p>
              <p>If Life basic needs of food, water, social stability and medical
              attention is prosperity, what possibly can "prosperity" be all
              about ?</p>
              <p>What is with all the mad academic paper chase and economic
              activities that is drummed into Singaporeans constantly ?</p>
              <p>Why will you compare ourselves with those Billions living near
              the poverty line that is in our region ?</p>
              <p>Is ambition so low that you do not dare to dream beyond what
               we have ?</p>
              <p>Why will you not compare ourselves with the Billions that enjoy
              Standards of Living that are higher than ours - like in
              Switzerland, Scandinavia, Holland, Germany, Spain, UK or even the
              USA ? </p>
              <p>By your standard of measure - "Any more than that is being
              greedy, and extremely vague" - that is a definition that fits the
              Singapore Elite Political Leadership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What has religion to do with prosperity ?</p>
              <p>Singapore's wealth is superficial and due to the high Per Capita
              - (whether GDP or GNP) - that is largely due to the small size of
              the population, much like the population in Brunei.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, on closer examination - numbers do not reflect
              reality in both countries, although Brunei's situation is far
              better than Singapore due to the fact that the Royal Family treats
              the Brunei citizens as a larger family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sweden is known for its high income tax and high cost of living
              - despite such conditions - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.scb.se/Pages/PressRelease____257312.aspx">‘Sweden’s population increase continues since 2004’
               </a>and certainly buck the trend of urban cities.</p>
              <p>If you want to know the reason for this - try googling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did you so admirably come to such a conclusion ?</p>
              <p>According to some research published in autobiographies about
              LKY - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Man-Island-Study-Singapores/dp/086861906X">‘No Man is an Island – James Minchin’  </a>-
              during his existence as a school boy, he was practically harmless
              but a domineering person, growing up in a family filled with
              frequent quarrels between his father and mother that led him to
              take side with his mother, and distancing himself from the
              father.</p>
              <p>His early working life as a young attorney during the 1950s was
              involved in legal representations of Trade Unions - where he learnt
              the workings of unions, and how the work force is mobilized as
              pressure groups to be potent political force to fit some
              agendas.</p>
              <p>His first taste of politics was when he represented Trade
              Unionists detained by the British Colonial Government, and fought
              for the Rights of the Workers - to gather, to strike for safe
              working environment and decent wages.</p>
              <p>No one knows when his political ambition came into fruition that
              led him to cross the line into political activism - by actually
              joining forces with Lim Chin Siong the leader of the Trade Union to
              form a political party called the People's Action Party.</p>
              <p>The rest has become recent history of double crosses, false
              referendums designed by LKY that drove us into a poorly thought out
              merger arrangement to be part of Malaysia - going against the best
              advices from local voices who understood the complex minds of the
              Malay aristocrats and politicians.</p>
              <p>Singapore could have been as vibrant as the private capital that
              developed Hong Kong to what it is today, without the odorous and
              ominous heavy hand of politicians playing the role of pseudo
              entrepreneurs, capitalists, and investors that stifled private
              enterprise through lop-sided competition.</p>
              <p>In the 1960s, independent Singapore saw Singaporeans forced from
              Primary Sector activities in agriculture, farming, and family
              businesses to become skilled workers laboring for foreign MNCs that
              have been given all the perks and protection against protests,
              strikes, riots, and assured cheap labor.</p>
              <p>Private enterprise was discouraged for reasons of poor economies
              of scale, and a waste of limited "national resource".</p>
              <p>In the 1970s, everyone was "whipped" into a singular national
              idealism based on the PAP concept of what nationhood should be - it
              was all about the nation not the individual creativity.</p>
              <p>It was a continuation of the 1960s politics of "dulling the mind
              with a full stomach".</p>
              <p>In the 1980s, the tune changed to one of idealism to
              attain <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2008/11/pushed-back-10-years.html">‘the Swiss Standard of Living’  </a> -
              which was less resilient then the real thing in Switzerland which
              remained rock steady during the economic crash of 1987 that spun
              South-east Asia out of orbit.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, the Swiss Standards was conveniently forgotten
              with the ascension of LHL to the PM's chair - and the struggles
              continue through the financial meltdown of 1997, the shock of 9/11,
              SARS in 2002, Bird Flu in 2004 - with First World Standards of
              Living melting as Singaporeans are told to live with short term
              employment contracts that are renewable every 3 or 5 years.</p>
              <p>In the midst of all these regressions, new legislations are now
              passed to refine the methods in dealing with dissident Singaporeans
              planning to have their voices heard.</p>
              <p>Public money lost are not accountable, while new schemes are
              created with the abandonment of pre-planned careful safeguards of
              the Second Key.</p>
              <p>If after all that has happened over the last 30 years, and you
              still have no clue as to what our potential could have been, or
              what could have been better - you will have to find some solace in
              seeing your next generations continue to struggle.</p>
