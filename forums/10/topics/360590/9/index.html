              <p>*Yawn* More sidestepping.  Okay, for a little more than amusement, let's filter out the flaccid chest-thumping from your most recent post and see what we're left with, shall we?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">I would have simply ignore you and let your opinions be judged
                      by others more discerning, and may they overlook your more
                      egoistical comments and not judge harshly. But for the sake of
                      clarity and to correct the blindness, overboard conceit, you had
                      overlooked in my initial response to you, i feel the necessity to
                      reply, to help others understand more of what you are attempting to
                      do and say.</span></p>
              <p><br> <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">You are presumptous to assume that you know it all and determined
                      the nature of the problem. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unfortunately, it is something which
                      even a village idiot can mouth today based on hindsight.</span></span></p>
              <p><br> <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">You foolishly claimed a time frame for progression and evolution of
                      society, but upon what foundations or political/socia economic
                      theory are you basing on?</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> Or was just something that  flew to
                      your mind, and in  your loneliness and rejection by your own
                      adopted countrymen, you foreigner rant and take it out on us
                      citizens?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><br> Even more critically, after boastfully claiming credit for voicing
                      out the 'nature' of our problem as perceived by you, </span>had you come
                      out with anything else constructive for the progress of our
                      nation?</p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> None, all i see are your continued egoistical rants, flagrant name
                      droppings to boost your inferiority complex, and typical vulgarity
                      resorting to ridicule when you are intellectually challenged by
                      others.</span></p>
              <p><br> <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">In case you miss this vital point, i will repeat in bold ( not in
                      anger ) so that you will not miss it - </span>WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION THEN
                      TO OUR CRISIS<span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> IN YOUR VAINGLORIOUS NARCISSISTIC VIEW?</span></p>
              <p><br> <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Foreigner, continue to live in your deluded hubris, for other
                      fellow citizens are not as foolish as you presumed or want them to
                      be. We prefer solutions, not condemnations, for we ourselves are
                      fully capable of making them without your help.</span></p>

              <p>You're a classic example of what ails the country, because the only thing you know is to respond to everything with, "No, it's not" - you're just like Monty Python's Argument Sketch.</p>
              <p>What's my solution?  Simple.  Singapore needs to get rid of people like you who waste precious air questioning irrelevancies instead of examining issues, and who have the tragically frail, itsy-bitsy little egos that compel them to use opposition of  any ideas as a smokescreen to cover up the fact that they're too frightened to come up with any ideas of their own.</p>
              <p>Get this into your head: either lead, follow or get out of the way because, frankly, your bleating about being betrayed is not only an obstruction to anything resembling reason, it's pretty fucking boring as well.</p>
              <p>Think I'm wrong?  Show me where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you've</span> proposed anything here to deal with the crisis.  Go on - I dare you.  I say you haven't, and I say you can't because you're just too scared to think for yourself instead of chanting the slogans, exhortations and general bullshit that the government has pumped through your ears.  You've gone so faroff the deep end that now you're taking a decision made in 1992, with the current circumstances to show the tinmeframe in which the decision was made, and tried presenting the ludicrous claim that it was hindsight.  I got a chuckle out of that one, I'll give you that much. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Oh, by the way, talking about your initial response, you wrote:</p>

              <p>Hmm.  In light of your latest post, I'd call you a hypocrite in court. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You've lost all control, perspective and logic, and while all I've done is present my opinions and experience, you seem to have fired up all of your little insecurities and worked up a lathering rabid one-man crusade here.</p>
              <p>Keep trucking right along, tiger -remember, you're the one whining about having to clean up this mess that your government created because it's you that's going to go down with the ship.  I've already made my decision and my profits out of that decision, so you're right in the sense that it's academic for me.  Does it make a difference to me if you succeed or if you drown while helplessly flailing about in a rabid frenzy?  Nope, but the rabies is somewhat more amusing.</p>
              <p>The damndest this is that, for all on his shenanigans, Minigun is actually providing more intelligent conversation than your spittle-filled rants.  Who'd have thunk it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Look, I'll be straight with you, you're boring me.  If you do want conversation, pick apart what I've said about Singapore pricing itself out of the manufacturing sector, or what I've said about the government needing to give people more free rein.  You asked for the solutions, but you're too blind to see that I've already addressed that - or are you simply too scared of the truth?</p>
              <p>Either way, until you come back to the real issues, you're just being a baby who's dropped his blankie in the mud, and frankly, that kind of crybaby bullshit just bores the heck out of me.</p>
              <p>So it's up to you - I've shown you what I've said, I've shown you how you're being childish, I've shown you how your posts are nothing but empty calories, and I've shown you what a hypocrite you are.  Now either grow up or stop wasting bandwidth.</p>
              <p>Now, I've got a rather nice discourse about Riemann's Hypothesis going on in another forum, so do pardon me if I have to leave you to blow your nose and wipe your arse by yourself.  I'll peruse this thread for amusing tidbits that might pop up, but you'll understand if I don't hold my breath waiting for a half-intelligent utterance from you.</p>

              <p>Ignoring your long winded rant again, is 'giving the people more free rein' your answer in response as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a solution out of our crisis</span>?</p>
              <p>If that is indeed your solution, then thank you. I guess we may be born equal, but intelligence is unequal in being given to each person, no matter how much education or experience one gains.</p>
              <p>I would have look forward to a fruitful discussion, even for the loud mouth uncouth vulgarity you display, even with a child, but i guess it would be an impossible hope with one as conceited as you, to find a solution.</p>

                          curiousity, I went thru all the posts &amp; here goes:</p>
              <p>Very interesting to read of the verbal punches &amp; counter
                          punches thrown by the debaters &amp; from what I can see the
                          coconut seems to have an edge over the banana in respect of the
                          logical, rational, realistic &amp; practical points being put
                          across, not forgetting to mention that the coconut is also
                          courteous &amp; not flamboyant in his words.</p>
              <p>It's just my opinion &amp; I know some of you will disagree with
                          me.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I do agree that the coconut is doing a fairly good job in the debate.</p>
              <p>Given the banana has unfair advantage with his age, phd, overseas experience.</p>
              <p>While I applaud coconut's brave counter.. he is limiting the element of persuasion when he attempts to sweep obvious issues under the carpet.</p>
              <p>In order to fix a problem.. one must first acknowlege it. Be more forthcoming.. and ye shall be the hero of the people.</p>

              <p>Perception is selective ha ha - what you said reminds me of some time ago when some one posted a pic of Uncle Yap favourite auntie - he calls her H.. Jinx (or something like that) &amp; it elicited so much negative comments re: the concept of beauty that I am sure this Yappie will be so satisfied that he must be laughing all the way to the Laughing Bank!!</p>

              <p>Hi Jojo thanks for the response but I think it's important that we must not be too much of an arm chair critic (so easy to do) - instead we should appreciate these 2 gentlemen for synapsing their brain cells extensively &amp; coming up with views in written repartee between  themselves in particular &amp; the public viewing in general.  Cheers!</p>
              <p>The political debate about how to manage Sg will be always on going but after all these years, the govt is slowing changing &amp; one aspect of this change is less restriction in your freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>Today you can read in the sgforum topic with the caption: "Lee Kuan Yew when are you going to stop taking public money?" which in the old days you are bound to be taken to task - and mind you this topic has been going for a long time with 24,000 plus hits.</p>
              <p>I totally dont have an idea who this coconut is but he seems to be cool, calm &amp; collected &amp; laced with civility - and if you notice, his response is very quick (like the banana).</p>

              <p>Our food - that are shared and eaten by all races (<span style="font-style: italic;">sans</span> the non-halal items to the Muslims) - but with particular exception to the "mee siam mai hum" dish.</p>
              <p>Our bonds with friends created from the comradeship that we found in schools and developed to new heights during NS days - from the commitment shown to each other in achieving shared responsibilities and missions.</p>
              <p>This is what hold us here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Our continued existence is due to our inherited ingenuity and creativity to survive by adapting and circumventing the arrogant policies in the self-serving politics of the ONE Party Government in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Our bonds with friends created from the comradeship that we found in schools and developed to new heights during NS days - from the commitment shown to each other in achieving shared responsibilities and missions.</p>
              <p>This is what hold us here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Our continued existence is due to our inherited ingenuity and creativity to survive by adapting and circumventing the arrogant policies in the self-serving politics of the ONE Party Government in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Fantagf, you are not worth my time for any reply. But it become obvious that you do not have the ability to realise your own stupidity.</p>
              <p>Since the beginning, before independence, migrants came to Singapore and became Singaporean through the right given by the consititution, and their contribution to the country. The constitution of Singapore, is above all legitimate political parties of the country. Whether you like PAP or not doesn't really matter.</p>
              <p>It is the same way that Singaporean who migrate to Australia, Canada...are granted PR, citizenships of the countries, by the constitution of the countries.</p>
              <p>The big difference here is that the local born australian, canadian are gracious to accept new immigrants of any origins, races, as fellow australians, canadians....while some self righteous, naive, Singaporeans still think they own the land.</p>

              <p>I guess it is with your definition of prosperity.</p>
              <p>I consider that easy access to food, water, relative social stability(jobs for one, though that is changing with the economic crisis) and medical attention as the hallmarks of prosperity. I won't say internet is a need, but it is handy to accquire information and knowledge.</p>
              <p>Any more than that is being greedy, and extremely vague. What more do you want? You certainly have more than what you physically need, that is certainly better than the 1 billion that did not have access to clean water and the 2 billion without electricity.</p>
              <p>Singapore has remained secular despite being surrounded by pre dominantly Muslim nations (though i suspect that would change with the strength and wealth of Christianity here).</p>
              <p>Your issue with Singaporeans marrying late is happening across Taiwan, Japan, HongKong, Shanghai..etc. As long as it is a highly urbanised population, it is an existing problem.</p>
              <p>We often argue that our youths are leaving the country because of the PAP, if not for my family i would have considered the same. However, Singapore is still responsible for making us attractive as immigrants in other countries, for the access to higher education and facilities.</p>
              <p>I may disagree what is happening now but i could hardly ignore the fact that it is given me the opportunities to access information and knowledge that allowed me insights on how the world works.  </p>
              <p>Your stance has always been that LKY's very existence and has from the moment he took office, suppress our full potential and that any leader could do a better job. My question is impending our potential to what? Is there a physical example of what you think we could have become?</p>
              <p>Would i agree or even want the example you give? Would i agree with your interpretation that it is better?</p>
