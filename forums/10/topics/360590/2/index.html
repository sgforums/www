              <p>The ironic thing here TS, is your name. The thing you posted goes against what your name means. I think you should change names.</p>
              <p>Socialism: A theory or system of social organization advocating placing
              the ownership and control of capital, land, and means of production in
              the community as a whole. </p>
              <p>Socialist: a political advocate of socialism  </p>
              <p>To push aside democratic values for economic gains does not benefit the society. It only benefits the elite group of people who controls the political and economic policies.</p>
              <p>What we have in Singapore is a political regime that is so full of itself that it no longer apologises for the mistakes they make. While mistakes are important so we could learn from them, leadership mistakes are leadership failures. Retaining politicians who make mistakes and are unwilling to learn from them will just set us all up for more mistakes.</p>
              <p>LKY is delusional when he says that he could decide our best interests. Whatever is going on in his fucked up brain might not be what we want for Singapore. So what we make economic gains? Are his policies are so timeless that it transcends future events and still ensure economic gains?</p>

              <p>I can't help but laugh at this topic, which TS has so bravely started. Doesn't he know that the general sympathy towards our Great Leader and his cronies aren't too friendly over the World Wide Web? By starting this kinda topic is akin to flying into a web and be devoured by thousands...millions of spiders.</p>
              <p>We have to agree that our Great Leader's stance on autocratic is correct in the past. Singapore wasn't stable and we were under constant threats. When faced with so much uncertainties, it was certainly right of the Great Leader to control us with an iron fist.
                          
                          However, times have changed. As rightly pointed out by some here, the evolution of the economy, coupled with technology has changed the whole ball game. Industrialisation is no longer the buzzword. People have learned more and seen more. We are no longer willing to be controlled like a bird. Even China is slowly opening up.</p>
              <p>Given Singapore's limited resources, our Great Leader has rightly pointed out that our citizens are the greatest assets. However, what has been instilled into our most precious asset? We have been trained to obey every commands without any doubts. Hence, we can only bow to the FTs. Hence, the needs to import FTs. This is because Singaporeans can't think for themselves. We need people to teach us how to do things. Those we really can think for themselves were branded as "Quitters" and publicly shamed in our media. Is this even right? We don't belong to the government you know. However, if you like to be treated like an animal, who are we to stop you?</p>
              <p>People do complain. This is the case with the whole world. However, have you stopped for a moment to really think why do people complain? Obviously, some things are wrong and we seek to improve them. However, the case nowadays is just to sweep everything under their royal carpet and blame the peasants instead. Is this even right? Who doesn't err? Even the sages can be wrong. However, the difference between a man and a coward is that the former dares to face up to his wrongs and correct them. To blame others for your mistakes is akin to a wussy.</p>
              <p>P.s. Diaspora shouldn't be something you should use here unless you wanna invoke the ISD to invite you for coffee. We are a multi-racial society. Even more so now with all the FTs. If you are ignorant, please study harder. If you choose to deceive yourself, then don't be afraid to be shamed.</p>

              <p>It may be an obscure fact that only a couple of billion people know about, but one of these aforementioned western democracies makes a really, I mean really, big deal about separation of church and state.  Care to guess which one it is?  Here's a hint - it's about four and a half times as old as Singapore.</p>

              Democracy is a form of government in which state-power is held by the majority of citizens within a country or a state. It is derived from the Greek Î´Î·Î¼Î¿ÎºÏ�Î±Ï„Î¯Î± (dÄ“mokratÃ­a (info)), "popular government", which was coined from Î´á¿†Î¼Î¿Ï‚ (dÃªmos), "people" and ÎºÏ�Î¬Ï„Î¿Ï‚ (krÃ¡tos), "rule, strength" in the middle of the fifth-fourth century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC.
