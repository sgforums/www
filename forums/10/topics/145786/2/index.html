He was formly CFO of JTC. He definitely managed hundreds of millions of dollrds for JTC so he could be one we can check out. The most important issue is that he is independent!<br><br>But of course, we have to check out his website and his campaigning efforts as well.<br><br>Let's keep an open mind!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew Kuan might be someone who has some problems with his jobs and is now trying to get a better of himself in life by running for presidency which in his own perception is a way to vindicate himself, he is still a human being.<br><br>As human being, he should be allowed to contest an election whether for presidency or MP. A hawker, an unemployed or a housewife can similarly run for office. People may reject him or her at the ballot but please do not follow the example of establishment to run down our dying breed of political participants. People are mature like what Nathan is now saying after 40 years of independence. If he is sincere in this remark, then he should advise the establishment to let people judge Kuan with their own uninfluenced sharp eyes and keen perception.<br><br>People will know and should be left alone without all the defaming suit or compulsion to judge any candidates for themselves without hitting below the belts which is just as bad as any poor job performance of Mr. Kuan.

One of the checks is calling the previous employer to find out how was the candidate's performance in his/her previous job. Therefore, if Kuan is really as lousy as what JTC purported him to be, JTC must have LIED to Hyflux!
