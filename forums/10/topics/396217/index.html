But the thing is that we are more passionate in some ways, and we have a different outlook on how policies can affect others." <br><br>Ellen Lee, Advisor, PAP Policy Forum, MP, Sembawang GRC, said: "It shows that they are more aware of what's going on in the world and how it impacts us as Singaporeans. And they will be the voice for the ground, so that with their input, the party would be able to harness all the views and all the sentiments so to speak." <br><br>The Pap Policy Forum was started in 2004 with the aim of giving rank-and-file members a platform to engage government leaders on policy issues. <br><br>Its 188 members are representatives of its 84 party branches as well as its youth and women's wings. <br><br>The forum's activities are open to all PAP members and Chairman Satwant Singh said he wants members to participate more actively. <br><br>He said: "Get members involved in the sub-groups and involved on the basis that look, ‘this is your contribution, this is what we have done and we put it into a working paper and send it up to the minister himself’. So these people would know that, whatever I have said actually goes up to the policymakers." <br><br>Besides Mr Satwant, two previous council members were also re-elected. - CNA/vm</span></p></div>

              <p>There are couple of issued involved here but I will bring the one. The Key question to ask is do we really want another Pap identical to run as opposition after puting one party for 40 yrs in the parliments?</p>
              <p>For Pap</p>
              <p>Well fundamentally what this means to me is that those young singaporean who want to work for singapore would either be limited by the political dogma within the domain of the party. Or those with view outside would not be part of the processed.</p>
              <p><strong>Therefore any changed will only be for the continuity of the party rather than transformation of the govt.</strong></p>
              <p> So personnally i would not agreed that we take the leaf of PAP recruitment process....I think It is timely for opposition to look at views outside the tradditional political party dogma and developed a different type of party that are more representative of the voters. Singaporean overseas, Singaporean growth up overseas, Overseas born 2nd generation Singaporean, Singaporean 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation in SG. newly entrench PR and citizen.</p>
              <p>Self renewal should be able to address transformation and reformed that is needed to move the Govt and society. You don't dish out the same dish as PAP....than why vote for opposition?</p>

              <p>I tend to be very brief, and thats why my point is easily missed.</p>
              <p>What I meant was that the opposition parties should also start recruiting, as the PAP is doing. And young blood at that.</p>
              <p>As for the character of the candidates, political parties are entities on their own. They vie to be the government, and if successful form the government. As citizens do we have a say on party matters.</p>
              <p>To illustrate it simply, the PAP signature all white dress code. Can we as citizen tell them to  change to red top and white bottom to better reflect the nations colours?</p>
              <p>They formulate their own strategies, on their own tried and tested formulars. And whether they succeed or blunder, its the party's problem.</p>
              <p>The party will select like minded candidates, that is not out of the ordinary, sadly.</p>
