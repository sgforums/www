              <h2>Companies from US, UK and Australia have the most concentrated financial power.</h2>
              <p>Aug 25, 2009</p>
              <p>By Lauren Schenkman<br> Inside Science News Service</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.insidescience.org/research/study_says_world_s_stocks_controlled_by_select_few">http://www.insidescience.org/research/study_says_world_s_stocks_controlled_by_select_few</a></p>
              <p>WASHINGTON -- A recent analysis of the 2007 financial markets of 48
              countries has revealed that the world's finances are in the hands of
              just a few mutual funds, banks, and corporations. This is the first
              clear picture of the global concentration of financial power, and point
              out the worldwide financial system's vulnerability as it stood on the
              brink of the current economic crisis.<br> <br> A pair of physicists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
              Zurich did a physics-based analysis of the world economy as it looked
              in early 2007. Stefano Battiston and James Glattfelder extracted the
              information from the tangled yarn that links 24,877 stocks and 106,141
              shareholding entities in 48 countries, revealing what they called the
              "backbone" of each country's financial market. These backbones
              represented the owners of 80 percent of a country's market capital, yet
              consisted of remarkably few shareholders.<br> <br> "You start off with these huge national networks that are really big,
              quite dense," Glattfelder said. “From that you're able to ... unveil
              the important structure in this original big network. You then realize
              most of the network isn't at all important."<br> <br> The most pared-down backbones exist in Anglo-Saxon countries, including
              the U.S., Australia, and the U.K. Paradoxically; these same countries
              are considered by economists to have the most widely-held stocks in the
              world, with ownership of companies tending to be spread out among many
              investors. But while each American company may link to many owners,
              Glattfelder and Battiston's analysis found that the owners varied
              little from stock to stock, meaning that comparatively few hands are
              holding the reins of the entire market.<br> <br> “If you would look at this locally, it's always distributed,”
              Glattfelder said. “If you then look at who is at the end of these
              links, you find that it's the same guys, [which] is not something you'd
              expect from the local view.”<br> <br> Matthew Jackson, an economist from Stanford University in Calif. who
              studies social and economic networks, said that Glattfelder and
              Battiston's approach could be used to answer more pointed questions
              about corporate control and how companies interact.<br> <br> "It's clear, looking at financial contagion and recent crises, that
              understanding interrelations between companies and holdings is very
              important in the future,” he said. "Certainly people have some
              understanding of how large some of these financial institutions in the
              world are, there's some feeling of how intertwined they are, but
              there's a big difference between having an impression and actually
              having ... more explicit numbers to put behind it."<br> <br> Based on their analysis, Glattfelder and Battiston identified the ten
              investment entities who are “big fish” in the most countries. The
              biggest fish was the Capital Group Companies, with major stakes in 36
              of the 48 countries studied. In identifying these major players, the
              physicists accounted for secondary ownership -- owning stock in
              companies who then owned stock in another company -- in an attempt to
              quantify the potential control a given agent might have in a market.<br> <br> The results raise questions of where and when a company could choose to
              exert this influence, but Glattfelder and Battiston are reluctant to
              speculate.<br> <br> "In this kind of science, complex systems, you're not aiming at making
              predictions [like] ... where the tennis ball will be at given place in
              given time," Battiston said. “What you're trying to estimate is … the
              potential influence that [an investor] has."<br> <br> Glattfelder added that the internationalism of these powerful companies
              makes it difficult to gauge their economic influence. "[With] new
              company structures which are so big and spanning the globe, it's hard
              to see what they're up to and what they're doing,” he said. Large,
              sparse networks dominated by a few major companies could also be more
              vulnerable, he said. "In network speak, if those nodes fail, that has a
              big effect on the network."<br> <br> The results will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review E.</p>
