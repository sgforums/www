            <div class='col-md body'>yeah if saddam were that honest to begin with they might have let him burn his own weapons.<br><br>But seriously we talking abt having weapons disarmament programs because you cant trust him, first inspectors have the old data how much raw material he imported the equipment that he used to manufacture those chems multiply by the number of years and use that quantity as a benchmark, next they had to search all the stockpiles of unused munitions sort out the ones that are chems to the ones that are not then tally it, then they have to estimate how much of it was used against the iranians and kurds. Then only they can arrive at the conclusion if he was telling the truth abt his stockpiles.<br><br>Next they have to burn it and guard it to make sure while they burning it the monkey dun try to steal it back when their backs are turned.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He actually wanted to compromise later, US ignored him and invaded..<br><br>What's wrong with not letting them gain full military access, esp from a determine party keeps accusing you.. They also must keep their military secrets also what. Anyway, Iraq does have chemical weapons left behind from Iranian war wat... wat if they use this and say " wa lao.. a few Arti shells of chemical weapon found in some old crates... become Chemical weapon cache found" you know the trick... lah. Anyway, The inspector might be mapping out target .. for all u know.<br><br>You are like Cheney.. the burden of proof lies with saddam... wah,, that is like "I can anyhow accuse you, but you must proof yourself innocent" .. communist..!</div>
