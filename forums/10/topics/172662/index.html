            <div class='col-md body'>We have to understand that some of these elderly drivers are very old and have poor eye sight and judgement.<br><br>instead of blaming them for road hogging, we should at least understand who they are and why they are doing that. So my point here is, should we make it compulsory that these elderly taxi drivers should not speed for the sake of the passenger, the driver and other road users?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not think that all older taxi drivers have poor eyesight.. But then again, I may be wrong on this point.<br><br>I do feel very strongly that taxi drivers should develop better driving habits. Some drive with blatant disregard for safety and other road users.<br><br>At junctions and traffic lights, many taxi drivers lean on their horns impatiently as they feel that the vehicle in front is taking too long to move off. They do not take into consideration the road conditions being negotiated by the vehicle in front.<br><br>Many taxi drivers also like to stop suddenly (to pick up passengers) with short notice to the vehicle behind. This causes the motorist behind to jam his brakes to prevent an accident. Furthermore, taxis do not care if they are blocking the road. As far as they are concerned, they have every right to stop any where they like.<br><br>In the clamour to pick up customers, many taxis swtich lanes drastically and dangerously. I've encountered a taxi on the right most lane, changing to the left most lane during the peak hour near eunos link. He just stopped his taxi on the right most lane, waiting for an opening to lane change left. Eunos link area can get very crowded, can you imagine 2 lanes blocked?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taxi drivers at that age, 70-80, will have no need for ego, pride, or impatience on the road. They have reached true MATURITY as a motorists; no amount of honking, flashing of headlights, will make them flinch. They have full control of their temperaments.<br><br>What Taxi companie should do really, is to ensure that these elderly taxi drivers, are road worthy in terms of eyesight and reasonably quick in reflex and alert.<br><br>To avoid annoyance, I always stay way back from a Taxi in front, overtake swiftly or let them pass quickly. If you're in slow and dense traffic with Taxis around you, watch out for non-signalled moves that they may make unexpectedly.<br><br></div>
