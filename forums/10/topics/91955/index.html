            <div class='col-md body'>tranquilice writes<br><blockquote>The MRT system opened in Nov 1987. </blockquote>Opps, I stand corrected. The initial 67km stretch was only fully functional in July 1990, but the company (as rightly pointed out to me) was incorporated and rolled out its first trains in 1987 (Toa Payoh to Yio Chu Kang only).<br><br>tpsg writes,<br><blockquote>Not all deaths on MRT tracks are suicides. Some may have been accidents..........The MRT is the back bone of our public transport system. Any delays due to accidents will cause a lot of disruptions to our transport system. </blockquote>Yes, some may have been accidents. But it does appear strange (if not spooky during the Chinese 7th month) that so many have occurred at the same time (within the same week even!). Do you not find it strange that "accidents" have appeared at the same time? Or do you rule out copycat 'accidents'? Or ask why people were standing near the edge of the platform in the first place? Or why 'accidents' <strong>only</strong> occur when there are incoming trains, or why no one ever has sufficient time to press the emergency alarm, or why there have been 100+ incidents when people were found walking on MRT tracks........<br><br>Of course, one cannot be prevented from fainting while waiting for the train. But if one stands behind the yellow line while waiting, the chances of fainting, or tripping and then having the energy/momentum to roll and drop onto the tracks can be minimized. Accidents are liable to occur in all sorts of ordinary situations. The onus is still on the individual to practise self-responsibility and caution.<br><br>I think the people who run the MRT are more sensitive and aware of the financial implications, and damage to company reputation than we are.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>But my point isn't really about what the SMRT should do, or have not done enough (indeed they are speeding up extra preventive measures now.) It is that if someone wishes to commit suicide, he or she will find a way regardless of technological advances, and there is no foolproof method to prevent it. Not even highly paid-professionals can guarantee accident/suicidal-free train services.<br><br>On a final note, it's interesting that people who want to commit suicide, or who do not observe personal safety escape from blame entirely (at least publicly in the media or public forums like this) when these occur....it's always 'the well-paid execs/govt/service providers haven't done enough'. (A bit like Americans who eat McDonalds regularly or smoke daily, find their health in trouble, and then blame someone else....or am I digressing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A new culture needs to be fostered with regards to courtesy on the MRT lines - not just to reduce the number of accidents on the train service, but as a general improvement to the quality of experience for all the commuters concerned.<br><br>People like to stand near the edge of the platform, even when a train is a few minutes away. The waiting lines drawn on the platform itself only serves as a marker for people to cloister around, since it is also a direct indication of where the doors of the train would be in open-air stations.<br><br>The stubborn-mindness of the bee-hive collective usually causes all to throw caution to the wind, and crowd even closer to the train doors even before the train comes to a complete halt. The train could suddenly accelerate, and cause people to be sucked into the tracks should they go too near (Benoulli effect). Also, blocking the train doors prevent alighting passengers from making their way out of the train itself, and forces them to elbow their way through the relentless crowd. Such inconsideration leads to stress for everybody concerned.<br><br>A better solution needs to be found to this bad culture on our train service. A good early education on coutesy not only helps save lives (you would probably not fall into the tracks so easily if you avoid standing near the edge of the platform), but also promotes an easier commuting experience for all the passengers concerned. Given the extreme cost of private transport in Singapore, trains are an inevitability in life. Let's make it a better experience for everyone.</div>
