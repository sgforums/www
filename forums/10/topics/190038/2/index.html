            <div class='col-md body'>I basically agree with the original poster.<br><br>Ever since Ah Bian came to power, everything is going downhill for Taiwan. Taiwan's economy is shrinking and unemployment rate is soaring. As a result, crime rate is also skyrocketing. Read here:<br><br>http://th.gio.gov.tw/show.cfm?news_id=8615<br><br>High unemployment rate also resulted in high suicide rate:<br><br>http://www.asianpacificpost.com/portal2/4028818208a0ac650108c0e0bbc5010f_Credit_card_slaves_turn_to_suicide_and_crime.do.html<br><br>As a result, more and more Taiwanese are losing confidence in the current administration and are migrating elsewhere. Mainland China, Canada, Australia and the USA are the favourite destinations for emigrating taiwanese. Here's an article about Taiwanese migrating to Shanghai:<br><br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14284-2001Apr27?language=printer<br><br>Many of those who can afford to migrate have already done so...<br><br></div>
