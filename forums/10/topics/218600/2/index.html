            <div class='col-md body'>HDB was a statutory board established under the Housing &amp; Development Act and given the power with taxpayers' monies to acquire lands for public housing.<br><br>So under such circumstance, will it be justifiable for HDB to sell its flats under the "Homeownership for the People Scheme" at market price i.e. S$94,000.00 as given in the Sim Lian development.<br><br>HDB should reimburse the citizen flat purchasers the costs computed into this price for the land. For example, if Sim Lian has bid the land cost at say $20,000 per unit of flat, people should be given a rebate of S$20,000 for the purchase namely purchaser should rightly be entitled to pay S$74,000 per flat in this example.<br><br>Originally in the late 1960s, it sold the low cost housing namely 3-room standard and 3-room improved flat built in Toa Payoh at construction cost at approximately S$6,900 and S$7,800 respectively.<br><br>So based on HDB role as low cost housing authority, has HDB the legal right to charge market prices like S$160,000 per unit of 3-room flat for its low cost housing since the late 1970s.<br><br>If HDB was to charge the low cost housing at market price, it may be asked: is the HDB not double-charging for lands acquired by them under the Land Acquisition Act since such lands were already owned and paid for by the taxpayers.<br><br>By charging HDB flats at market price, HDB on behalf of the government would be making an extra profit on the land over the market price unless the land costs and administrative grants paid to HDB from taxation were refunded to the people as taxpayers.<br><br>Similarly all essential public services like medicare and utilities were at one time or another funded by tax monies. So when government decided to corporatise such services into various GLCs like Singapore Power or Power Supply, will it be legal for SP or PS to charge the consumer taxpayers once more for infrastructures and networks or land costs which no doubt have been previously paid by the public.<br><br>Should the government continue to charge the citizens in such tax-and-recover and corporatise to rid itself of burdens or duties while accumulating the tax monies into surpluses from which to claim credit and paying themselves the highest salaries and bonuses and lifelong benefits.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact is that the HDB market is a false one. Held up by regulations that forces certain public to purchase only from resale market.<br><br>Policies like preventing singles below 35 to own their own unit (in foreign country, it is consider a shame to be still living with your parents if you're 30), prevent families with above $8000 from buying directly from HDB and preventing private property owners from owning HDBs.<br><br>HDB argues that the rules are in place to prevent speculation of flats. In the first place, people speculate because there is a false market that a certain group of people must  buy from. A steady demand with no other alternatives and huge profits to be made. Of course you attract speculations. So you have one lousy policy that creates a problem and you create more lousy policies to plug the problems created by the earlier. Our world class govt.<br><br>If the govt remove those rules, it would mean that everyone would be entitled to buy a flat from HDB directly. The resale market would collapse due to lack of demand and prices will fall. Following that, people will not speculate in HDB because the demands/profits are not there. Benefits are;<br><br>1) Empty new flats would be cleared<br>2) Cheaper housing for owners, means more savings for retirement<br>3) No more speculation<br>4) No more unfair rulings<br><br>Then you would see true market value of HDB.<br><br>Look at 3 rooms HDB earlier. Before HDB remove the ruling that singles can only buy 3 rooms, they are going for over 200K per unit (some as expensive as a 4 room unit in mature estate). When the ruling was removed, singles began buying larger units and the price is now balanced.</div>

In contrast to the private housing price determinants that have been identified in the international literature, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the prices of public resale housing in Singapore are largely determined by public policies rather than by economic variables</span>. This paper provides some empirical evidence on how and to what degree public housing policies affected the price dynamics of public resale housing in Singapore during the 1990s. The findings have additional implications of the wider consequences of public policies on the prices of private housing units</strong>."</span><br><br>From the trends observed over the years, the Singapore Government takes the view that if the Private Sector makes money from any item that it has created, the Government is entitled to take an immediate cut of the profit and not wait till the end of the transaction when annual tax is collected.<br><br>This can be seen from the HDB resale policy, where the HDB demands that a percentage of the sales price be returned to HDB if the concluded sales price is above HDB valuation.<br><br>With large scale private projects, the Government will impose Development Charge on the Private Developers, as they are seen to make hefty profit from the piece of vacant land on which the projects are built on - refusing to  realise that the profit will depend on the continuing favorable market conditions at the end of the construction.<br><br>Are HDB prices today based on costs, on based on the benchmark of similar private developments, and from the thresh-hold of pain that Singaporeans can bear ?<br><br>Is it any surprise that we have a new problem created by the greedy public policies, which leaves the retired Singaporeans to be <span style="font-style: italic;">'asset rich, but cash poor' </span> ?<br></span><br><br></div>
