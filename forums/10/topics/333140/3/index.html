              <p>Russia opposes USA global hegemony, for this reason I will support Russia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA DMITRY MEDVEDEV, Speech at World Policy Conference:</p>
              <p>... I think that the origins of the current situation
              can be found in the events that took place seven years ago. It was then
              that the world missed its historic chance, the chance to de-ideologize
              international politics and create a genuinely democratic world order.
              It let slip this chance <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because of the United States’ desire to
              consolidate its global rule.</span></p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">You will recall that in the aftermath of
              September11, 2001 Russia and many other states did not hesitate to show
              our solidarity with the United States. We did this not only for the
              sake of combating terrorism (this was only natural), but also for the
              sake of overcoming the divisions the Cold War had created in the world.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">However, after the overthrow of the Taliban
              regime in Afghanistan, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the United States started a chapter of
              unilateral actions which not coordinated with the United Nations or
              even with a number of the United States’ partners.</span> It is enough to
              mention the decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and the invasion
              of Iraq.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">The result was a trend of growing divisions in
              international relations. This was manifested in the unilateral
              proclamation of Kosovo’s independence and in the de facto revival of
              the policy of deterrence so popular in the twentieth century.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military bases have been established along our
              borders. </span>The third ABM deployment area is being created in the
              territory of the Czech Republic and Poland. Yes, the number of
              antiballistic missiles will be limited, but what are they for, why are
              they deployed? And, again, what prevented the United States from
              consulting first with its allies?</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">Of course, none of these countries in themselves
              are any threat to Russia. But when a decision is taken in this way,
              without consultations, including with its partners in NATO and the EU,
              that is to say, without consultations within Europe, we cannot but have
              the impression that tomorrow could bring yet further decisions to
              deploy yet more missile defence systems. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With this kind of unipolar
              decision-making process, there are no guarantees against this
              happening, no guarantees for the Russian Federation, in any case.   </span></p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">The Warsaw Treaty Organization ceased to exist
              twenty years ago, but to our regret at least, NATO’s expansion
              continues full steam ahead. Today, NATO is actively discussing the
              admission of Georgia and Ukraine. What’s more, it sees the issue in
              battle terms: admitting these countries would be victory over Russia,
              while keeping them out would be tantamount to capitulation.</p>
              <p class="RVPS706570">But the real issue is that NATO is bringing its
              military infrastructure right up to our borders and is drawing new
              dividing lines in Europe, this time along our western and southern
              frontiers. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No matter what we are told, it is only natural that we
              should see this as action directed against us</span>. But the moment we try to
              point out that this is objectively contrary to Russia’s national
              security interests everyone starts getting nervous. How else are we to
              interpret this behaviour? ...</p>

              <p>I don't think that is true.</p>
              <p>Here is an analysis of that move:</p>
              <p> 
              ...After it was all over, Director of Military
              Intelligence for the Pacific Theater of War Alfred McCormack, who was
              probably in as good position as anyone for judging the situation,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> felt
              that the Japanese surrender could have been obtained in a few weeks by
              blockade alone</span>: "The Japanese had no longer enough food in stock, and
              their fuel reserves were practically exhausted. We had begun a secret
              process of mining all their harbors, which was steadily isolating them
              from the rest of the world. If we had brought this operation to its
              logical conclusion, the destruction of Japan's cities with incendiary
              and other bombs would have been quite unnecessary. But General Norstad
              declared at Washington that this blockading action was a cowardly
              proceeding unworthy of the Air Force. It was therefore discontinued."...</p>

              <p>Ask the older generation.  You think they'd be able to starve the Japanese without starving the civilians?  That the Japanese were so noble to have fed their local population while starving themselves?</p>
              <p>The opposite was true.  They took food away from "Singaporeans."  Ask anyone who lived through the period and they can tell you how food was a problem.  </p>
              <p>The Japanese were prepared to go down fighting over Singapore.  An attack would have resulted in heavy collateral damage of civilians.  Street to street fighting would have been nothing but brutal.  </p>

              <p>my opinion of why are there so many bad news of muslims is because we as a <em><strong>commumnity</strong></em> has fail  to put into practice what we had been commanded to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for the many bombing incident i think it is link to the persecution that is happening around the world below is just a small example which is still happening on a daily basis.</p>

              <p>Great!  You do realize that the British would have had to
              invade Singapore and fight the japanese inch for inch in a FIBUA
              operation if the Americans didn't drop the bomb?</p>
              <p>I'm GLAD the yanks nuked the Japanese back then.  They
              didn't ask for the war.  Neither did my grandparents in
              Singapore. War is Hell. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does the US defame Muslims?  I don't know how to quantify
              that. I don't see muslims in the US getting stoned for their faith.
               If there are good muslims and bad muslims, we need to also
              hold the same scale and understand that there are good Americans
              and bad Americans.</p>

              <p>Sunday morning, nothing else to do, so here I go:</p>
              <p>Well, I still believe conventional weapons should be used instead of atomic weapons which are a threat to the existence of our planet because of the long term side effects of nuclear radiation.  Granted more lives will be lost without using nukes but then once they are lost - that's it - full stop, without further complications of long term nuclear radiation on mankind.</p>
              <p>War is always very serious, costly &amp; tragic in all aspects but if another price you have to pay is the very existence of planet earth, don't you think nukes should not be used in the future &amp; forever?</p>

              <p>Actually.. looking at Japan now.. it's probably a great idea to
              have them occupy us back then HOR ???</p>
              <p>We woulda have Japanese family names .</p>
              <p>And our Orchard road will be another Harajuku.</p>
              <p>Not bad eh</p>
              <p>We would be speaking Japanese and our mother tongue..</p>
              <p>And our teenagers will be ... cosplaying Singapore style.</p>
              <p>TCS wouldn't need Xiang Yun act in "Wu Xuo Nang Yang".</p>
              <p>And we will be bowing down to the Japanese Imperial Family
              instead of the LEes.</p>
              <p>Instead of MRT.. we'd be going JRT.</p>
              <p>Life woulda been really different .. don't ya think so ?</p>
              <p>Why fight them ?.. Wasted so many lifes...</p>

              <p>Secondly what scares me is not the terrorist who claim to be muslims... but the public in general who could not differentiate between a real muslim and someone who claim to be one... and what really frightens me that some Singaporeans are begining to think like american or begining to buy into American's anti-muslim propaganda... I tot the Singapore education system is sufficient enough to educate the general Singaporean to look beyond the propaganda and see the real truth about Islam... You want real proff?
