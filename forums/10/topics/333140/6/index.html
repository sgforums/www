              <p>there is no compulsion in religion according to what i have learn maybe the below will clear up your misunderstanding of the verse you quote</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">There
              are two kinds of jihad. The first is known as the lesser jihad and this
              is the duty incumbent upon all Muslims to fight in defense of what is
              right. This is defensive and it means fighting back where there is
              injustice or oppression.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such
              jihad must be called for by the legitimate authority. In other words,
              it cannot be called for just by any man in the street or even any
              Sheikh in the street.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also,
              and very importantly, there are strict rules which apply to this kind
              of jihad. For example, the Muslims must stop fighting as soon as their
              enemies call for peace. Similarly, no civilians may be hurt. Not even
              plants can be damaged in such fighting.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">The
              other jihad is known as the greater jihad. This would suggest how
              important it is compared to the other jihad. It means that each Muslim
              must struggle daily and exert his utmost efforts to struggle inwardly
              to combat all those things in his life and in his personality which
              keep him from being a good Muslim.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In
              the earliest days of Islam, when Muslims were constantly under threat
              of being wiped out, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) showed the
              early Muslim community how they should act towards those of other
              faiths.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In
              the city of Madinah, for example, which became the very first Muslim
              state, he drew up a treaty between the Muslims and the other two groups
              who lived there: the polytheists and the Jews. Each group was free to
              practice its own religion and each group was to defend the other under
              attack.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">There
              are also many quotations in the Qur'an which show how the Muslims have
              much in common with the "People of the Book," namely Christians and
              Jews, and even enjoin the Muslims to fight in their defense if they are
              being persecuted, or if their religious buildings or holy men are under
              attack.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">However,
              in those first days of Islam, not everyone kept to the terms of
              treaties they had signed. Different groups banded together to attack
              the early Muslim community, as they saw in it a great threat.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In
              such a circumstance, the polytheists and the Jews attacked the Muslims.
              On other occasions, Christian armies marched against the early Muslim
              community. In such particular circumstances, it was revealed that the
              Muslims should fight back against these groups. Therefore, the verse
              which reads:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">*{Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day.}* (At-Tawbah 9: 29)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">refers
              specifically to such circumstances. It most certainly does not mean
              that Muslims should always be at war with Christians and Jews. It was
              revealed for a particular situation. For it to mean otherwise would
              contradict everything the Prophet had done.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">If
              you look at what is known as the "Golden Age" of Islam in Southern
              Spain, where Muslims ruled for nearly eight hundred years, you will not
              only see a very refined civilization in which education and learning
              were promoted, but you also see that Christians, Muslims and Jews lived
              together in peace. Christians and Jews were free to practice their own
              religion.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">It
              was only in 1492, when the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella
              finally defeated the Muslims, that persecution began. Muslims and Jews
              were forced to convert and mosques and synagogues were ransacked and
              burned.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly,
              when Jerusalem was taken by Caliph `Umar ibn Al-Khattab he signed a
              treaty with the Christian Patriarch guaranteeing the rights of the
              Christians there to their lives, their property and their worship. No
              lives were lost.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">It was only when the Crusader armies retook the city that 70,000 men, women and children were indiscriminately slaughtered.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">So,
              you see, there are people who have deliberately chosen to twist the
              facts to make it seem as though Muslims are forever called upon to
              fight Christians and Jews. The quote the verse which reads:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">*{And slay them wherever ye catch them.}* (Al-Baqarah 2: 191),</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">but this is to quote out of context. It referred to the Muslims under attack and the same quote goes on to say:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">*{and turn them out from where they have turned you out.}* (Al-Baqarah 2: 191)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In
              travelling around the world to speak about the sweet and gentle message
              of Islam, you can be assured, in speaking with your family and friends,
              that Islam does not ask us to fight those who believe something
              different to us.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">How could the world's religion of peace do otherwise? The meaning of the word Islam in Arabic comes from the lexical root <em>s-l-m</em>, from which the Arabic word meaning "peace" is derived.</span></span></p>

              <p>there is no compulsion in religion according to what i have
              learn maybe the below will clear up your misunderstanding of the
              verse you quote</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are two kinds of jihad. The first is known
              as the lesser jihad and this is the duty incumbent upon all Muslims
              to fight in defense of what is right. This is defensive and it
              means fighting back where there is injustice or
              oppression.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">Such jihad must be called for by the legitimate
              authority. In other words, it cannot be called for just by any man
              in the street or even any Sheikh in the street.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">Also, and very importantly, there are strict
              rules which apply to this kind of jihad. For example, the Muslims
              must stop fighting as soon as their enemies call for peace.
              Similarly, no civilians may be hurt. Not even plants can be damaged
              in such fighting.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">The other jihad is known as the greater jihad.
              This would suggest how important it is compared to the other jihad.
              It means that each Muslim must struggle daily and exert his utmost
              efforts to struggle inwardly to combat all those things in his life
              and in his personality which keep him from being a good
              Muslim.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the earliest days of Islam, when Muslims were
              constantly under threat of being wiped out, Prophet Muhammad (peace
              be upon him) showed the early Muslim community how they should act
              towards those of other faiths.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the city of Madinah, for example, which became
              the very first Muslim state, he drew up a treaty between the
              Muslims and the other two groups who lived there: the polytheists
              and the Jews. Each group was free to practice its own religion and
              each group was to defend the other under attack.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are also many quotations in the Qur'an
              which show how the Muslims have much in common with the "People of
              the Book," namely Christians and Jews, and even enjoin the Muslims
              to fight in their defense if they are being persecuted, or if their
              religious buildings or holy men are under attack.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, in those first days of Islam, not
              everyone kept to the terms of treaties they had signed. Different
              groups banded together to attack the early Muslim community, as
              they saw in it a great threat.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In such a circumstance, the polytheists and the
              Jews attacked the Muslims. On other occasions, Christian armies
              marched against the early Muslim community. In such particular
              circumstances, it was revealed that the Muslims should fight back
              against these groups. Therefore, the verse which
              reads:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">*{Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the
              Last Day.}* (At-Tawbah 9: 29)</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">refers specifically to such circumstances. It
              most certainly does not mean that Muslims should always be at war
              with Christians and Jews. It was revealed for a particular
              situation. For it to mean otherwise would contradict everything the
              Prophet had done.</span></span></p>

              <p>there is really a lot of misunderstanding esp in western countries about islam and the muslims plus there is so many negative propaganda in the media so if i'm not converted and learn the pratices and teachings of islam.i will also think of lslam as a bad religion.america need a reason to invade iraq next is iran for the natural resoures so media always report that iraq is habouring terroist and iran for pocessing w.m.d.if one day saudi arabia decides to go against u.s policy u will see them next on the w.m.a+habour terrorist list</p>
              <p>my personal experience when i travel to india and bangladesh to learn the religion every midnight many people in the mosque will wake up do the midnight salat(tahajud) supplicate while crying to the Lord of the worlds for guidance for the mankind to be save from the hellfire no matter if he/she is a atheist polytheist jews or chirstian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even the holy prophet duty is just to convey the message as shown in the below verses</p>
              <p><span class="quran"><span class="quran">“So if they dispute with you, say ‘I 
              have submitted my whole self to Allah, and so have those who follow me.’ 
              And say to the People of the Scripture and to the unlearned: ‘Do you also 
              submit yourselves?’ If they do, then they are on right guidance. But if 
              they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message. And in Allah’s 
              sight are all of His servants.” [Sûrah Âl `Imrân: 20]</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="quran"><span class="quran">“If it had been your Lord’s will, 
              all of the people on Earth would have believed. Would you then compel the people 
              so to have them believe?” [Sûrah Yûnus: 99]</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="quran"><span class="quran">“The Messenger’s duty is but to proclaim 
              the Message.” [Sûrah al-Mâ’idah: 99]</span></span></p>
              <p>so there may be a few black horses in the muslim world but i hope you won't have a1 bamboo make the whole boat sink mentality</p>
