              <p>I don't believe because there are too many contradictions and inconsistencies.I've quoted a few verses in this thread and it's up to people to draw their own conclusion. Ignorance is not a bliss.</p>
              <p>While Muslim philosophers clearly acknowledged that there's a doctrineof abrogation because of the contradictions and inconsistencies, certain Muslims denied it. Isn't this confusing?</p>
              <p>Finally, I don't believe that Muslims can dominate the world.</p>

              <p>The 'invasion' of jerusalem</p>
              <p>In 637, after a prolonged siege of <a title="Jerusalem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>,
              the Muslims finally entered the city peacefully following the signing
              of a treaty by the Patriach of Elya Al-Quds (i.e. Jerusalem) and Umar
              himself. Several years earlier, the Patriach had announced that he
              would not sign a treaty with anyone other than the Caliph himself. For
              this reason, `Umar personally came to Jerusalem after Muslims had
              established control of all the surrounding territory. According to both
              Muslim and Christian accounts, `Umar entered the city humbly, walking
              beside a camel upon which his servant was sitting, due to the reason
              they share turns over it and it was his servant's turn when they happen
              to reach the city. He is said to have been given the keys to the city
              by the Orthodox Christian Patriarch <a title="Sophronius" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophronius">Sophronius</a>, after conducting the peace treaty known as the Treaty of Umar, the English translation of which is provided below:</p>

              Umar was shocked to find the site covered in rubbish, as the Romans had

              immediately, and began to clear the area with his hands. When the
              Muslims saw what he was doing, they followed his example, and soon the

              <p>`Umar was then led to the sites of the <a title="Foundation Stone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_Stone">Foundation Stone</a> by a rabbi, <a title="Ka'ab al-Ahbar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%27ab_al-Ahbar">Ka'ab al-Ahbar</a>, who had converted to Islam.

              <p>Upon taking Jerusalem, `Umar demonstrated the utmost respect for

              500 years since their expulsion from the Holy Land, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Jews" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">Jews</a> were allowed to practice their religion freely and live in the vicinity of Jerusalem. According to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Encyclopedia Judaica" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Judaica">Encyclopedia Judaica</a>, seventy Jewish families took up residence in the city. `Umar also agreed to several pacts, called <a class="mw-redirect" title="The Umariyya Covenant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umariyya_Covenant">the Umariyya Covenant</a>, with the local Christian population, determining their rights and obligations under Muslim rule.</p>

              <p>The first crusade</p>
              <p>While members of all three religions were living in peace 
                      and harmony in Palestine, the Christians in Europe decided to organize 
                      the 'Crusades.' Following a call by Pope Urban II on 25 November 1095 
                      at the Council of Clermont, more than 100,000 people from all over Europe 
                      set out for Palestine to 'Free the Holy land from the Muslims' and find 
                      the fabled wealth of the East. After a long and wearying journey, and 
                      much plundering and slaughter of Muslims, they reached Jerusalem in 1099. 
                      The city fell after a siege of nearly five weeks, and the Crusaders moved 
                      in. And they carried out a savagery the like of which the world has seldom 
                      seen. All Muslims and Jews in the city were put to the sword. In the words 
                      of one historian, '<strong>They killed all the Saracens and the Turks they 
                      found... whether male of female</strong>." <a class="dipnot" href="http://www.harunyahya.com/articles/32terrorism_middleeast_soc08.php#2">Geste Francorum, or the Deeds of the Franks

                        this was more merciful) cut off the heads of their enemies; others shoot 
                        them with arrows, so that they fell from the towers; others tortured 
                        them longer by casting them into flames. Piles of heads, hands and feet 
                        were to be seen in the streets of the city. It was necessary to pick 
                        one's way over the bodies of men and horses. But these were small matters 
                        compared to what happened at the Temple of Solomon, a place where religious 
                        services are normally chanted ... in the temple and the porch of Solomon, 
                        men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins.<a class="dipnot" href="http://www.harunyahya.com/articles/32terrorism_middleeast_soc08.php#3">August C. Krey, The First Crusade: The

              the 'Crusades.' Following a call by Pope Urban II on 25 November
              1095 at the Council of Clermont, more than 100,000 people from all
              over Europe set out for Palestine to 'Free the Holy land from the
              Muslims' and find the fabled wealth of the East. After a long and
              wearying journey, and much plundering and slaughter of Muslims,
              they reached Jerusalem in 1099. The city fell after a siege of
              nearly five weeks, and the Crusaders moved in. And they carried out
              a savagery the like of which the world has seldom seen. All Muslims
              and Jews in the city were put to the sword. In the words of one
              historian, '<strong>They killed all the Saracens and the Turks they

              <p>The 'invasion' of jerusalem</p>
              <p>In 637, after a prolonged siege of <a title="Jerusalem" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the Muslims finally entered the city
                  peacefully following the signing of a treaty by the Patriach of
                  Elya Al-Quds (i.e. Jerusalem) and Umar himself. Several years
                  earlier, the Patriach had announced that he would not sign a treaty
                  with anyone other than the Caliph himself. For this reason, `Umar
                  personally came to Jerusalem after Muslims had established control
                  of all the surrounding territory. According to both Muslim and
                  Christian accounts, `Umar entered the city humbly, walking beside a
                  camel upon which his servant was sitting, due to the reason they
                  share turns over it and it was his servant's turn when they happen
                  to reach the city. He is said to have been given the keys to the
                  city by the Orthodox Christian Patriarch <a title="Sophronius" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophronius">Sophronius</a>, after conducting the peace treaty known
                  as the Treaty of Umar, the English translation of which is provided
                  below:</p>
              <p>“ In the name of <a title="Allah" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah">Allah</a>, the Most Merciful, the
                  Beneficent.</p>
              <p>This is what the slave of Allah, Umar b.Al-Khattab, the Amir of
                  the believers, has offered the people of Illyaa’[1] of security
                  granting them Amaan (protection) for their selves, their money,
                  their churches, their children, their lowly and their innocent, and
                  the remainder of their people.</p>
              <p>Their <a title="Churches" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches">churches</a> are not to be taken,
                  nor are they to be destroyed, nor are they to be degraded or
                  belittled, neither are their crosses or their money, and they are
                  not to be forced to change their religion, nor is any one of them
                  to be harmed.</p>
              <p>No Jews are to live with them in Illyaa’ and it is required of
                  the people of Illyaa’ to pay the <a title="Jizya" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya">Jizya</a>, like the people of the cities. It is also
                  required of them to remove the Romans from the land; and whoever
                  amongst the people of Illyaa’ that wishes to depart with their
                  money together with the Romans, leaving their trading goods and
                  children behind, then they selves, their trading goods and their
                  children are secure until they reach their destination.</p>
              <p>Upon what is in this book is the word of Allah, the covenant of
                  His Messenger, of the Khulafaa’ and of the believers if they (the
                  people of Illyaa’) gave what was required of them of Jizya.</p>
              <p>The witnesses upon this were <a title="Khalid ibn Al-Walid" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_ibn_Al-Walid">Khalid ibn Al-Walid</a>,

              <p>Then Umar asked the Patriach to lead him to the place of the old

                  shocked to find the site covered in rubbish, as the Romans had
                  initiated the custom of using it as a dung heap. `Umar knelt down
                  immediately, and began to clear the area with his hands. When the
                  Muslims saw what he was doing, they followed his example, and soon
                  the entire area of <a title="Al-Aqsa Mosque" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque">al-Aqsa</a>, approximately 35
                  <a title="Acres" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acres">acres</a>, was cleaned up. Thereafter, commissioned
                  the construction of a wooden <a title="Mosque" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque">mosque</a> on the southern end of the site, exactly
                  where the present-day mosque of Al-Aqsa stands.</p>
              <p>`Umar was then led to the sites of the <a title="Foundation Stone" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_Stone">Foundation Stone</a> by a rabbi,

              <p><br> How can the invading army walk in peacefully and sign a treaty with the enemy? Unless the enemy had been defeated. They had surrendered after 4 months of seige and had to pay jizya, an unfair form of tax in exchange for protection. And are you sure that there was no battle before the seige? This was an invasion of the then Christian lands. This invasion is the first wave of Islamic conquests after the death of Muhammad. You don't read the history of the battle of Yamuq? The first crusade was to drive out the Invading Turks.
                  
                  I haven't quote the hadiths yet, which will open the eyes of many people who are ignorant about the religion of peace.
              I am puzzled why you post this article. <strong>It clearly says that the Al Aqsa mosque was erected on the ground of the Jewish Temple. To this day, the Arabs still denied it even after Jewish artifacts and remains of the Temple were unearthed around the Mosque.<br></strong></p>

              Facts are facts. The critics even quoted the names of the Muslim scholars and philosophers and their books. These authors were Arabs. The books are not easy to obtain, I must admit. Some can be found in Overseas Universities' libraries. Others can be obtained from Saudi Arabia, where Muhammad founded his religion, not easy to get copies unless one goes there to study Islam.
              In Singapore, probably PAP has copies of them but these will not be available to the general public in the name of religious harmony.
