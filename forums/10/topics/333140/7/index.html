              <p>there is really a lot of misunderstanding esp in western
              countries about islam and the muslims plus there is so many
              negative propaganda in the media so if i'm not converted and learn
              the pratices and teachings of islam.i will also think of lslam as a
              bad religion.america need a reason to invade iraq next is iran for
              the natural resoures so media always report that iraq is habouring
              terroist and iran for pocessing w.m.d.if one day saudi arabia
              decides to go against u.s policy u will see them next on the
              w.m.a+habour terrorist list</p>
              <p>my personal experience when i travel to india and bangladesh to
              learn the religion every midnight many people in the mosque will
              wake up do the midnight salat(tahajud) supplicate while crying to
              the Lord of the worlds for guidance for the mankind to be save from
              the hellfire no matter if he/she is a atheist polytheist jews or
              chirstian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even the holy prophet duty is just to convey the message as
              shown in the below verses</p>
              <p><span><span>“So if they dispute with you, say
              ‘I have submitted my whole self to Allah, and so have those who
              follow me.’ And say to the People of the Scripture and to the
              unlearned: ‘Do you also submit yourselves?’ If they do, then they
              are on right guidance. But if they turn away, your duty is only to
              convey the Message. And in Allah’s sight are all of His servants.”
              [Sûrah Âl `Imrân: 20]</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>“If it had been your Lord’s will,
              all of the people on Earth would have believed. Would you then
              compel the people so to have them believe?” [Sûrah Yûnus:
              99]</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>“The Messenger’s duty is but to
              proclaim the Message.” [Sûrah al-Mâ’idah: 99]</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-GB">In a
              mosque in the city of Kufa, Ali b. Abi Talib once saw people gathering around
              the judge, Abdur-Rahman. The judge was confusing that which is permissible with
              that which is not. Ali asked him whether he could tell the abrogative verses
              from the abrogated; he said that he could not. Ali then grabbed the man's ear,
              twisted it, and said: "you perish, and you make others perish. Do not
              judge in our mosque anymore.''</span></p>

              <p>the below is from a post earlier on.i don't know why u miss it</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">"In the earliest days of Islam, when Muslims were
                                      constantly under threat of being wiped out, Prophet Muhammad (peace
                                      be upon him) showed the early Muslim community how they should act
                                      towards those of other faiths.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the city of Madinah, for example, which became
                                      the very first Muslim state, he drew up a treaty between the
                                      Muslims and the other two groups who lived there: the polytheists
                                      and the Jews. Each group was free to practice its own religion and
                                      each group was to defend the other under attack.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are also many quotations in the Qur'an
                                      which show how the Muslims have much in common with the "People of
                                      the Book," namely Christians and Jews, and even enjoin the Muslims
                                      to fight in their defense if they are being persecuted, or if their
                                      religious buildings or holy men are under attack.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, in those first days of Islam, not
                                      everyone kept to the terms of treaties they had signed. Different
                                      groups banded together to attack the early Muslim community, as
                                      they saw in it a great threat.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In such a circumstance, the polytheists and the
                                      Jews attacked the Muslims. On other occasions, Christian armies
                                      marched against the early Muslim community. In such particular
                                      circumstances, it was revealed that the Muslims should fight back
                                      against these groups. Therefore, the verse which
                                      reads:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">*{Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the
                                      Last Day.}* (<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>At-Tawbah 9: 29</strong></span>)</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">refers specifically to such circumstances. It
                                      most certainly does not mean that Muslims should always be at war
                                      with Christians and Jews. It was revealed for a particular
                                      situation. For it to mean otherwise would contradict everything the
                                      Prophet had done."</span></span></span></p>

                                I don't like American foreign policy. Too hard and gungho. Like they are trying to show off all the time. Now that Bush is leaving soon then their foreign policy soften up a bit. Too hard how to communicate with people?

              <p>This is very true... One very real example is the 72 virgins for muslim myth... It is completely false, something made up by the danish cartoons and yet, no matter how many people try to correct it, people still believe the lie... Some people believe in the lie so much that they made up false evidence to support the false information</p>

              <p>the below is from a post earlier on.i don't know why u miss
                      it</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">"In the earliest days of Islam, when Muslims were
                      constantly under threat of being wiped out, Prophet Muhammad (peace
                      be upon him) showed the early Muslim community how they should act
                      towards those of other faiths.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the city of Madinah, for example, which became
                      the very first Muslim state, he drew up a treaty between the
                      Muslims and the other two groups who lived there: the polytheists
                      and the Jews. Each group was free to practice its own religion and
                      each group was to defend the other under attack.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">There are also many quotations in the Qur'an
                      which show how the Muslims have much in common with the "People of
                      the Book," namely Christians and Jews, and even enjoin the Muslims
                      to fight in their defense if they are being persecuted, or if their
                      religious buildings or holy men are under attack.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, in those first days of Islam, not
                      everyone kept to the terms of treaties they had signed. Different
                      groups banded together to attack the early Muslim community, as
                      they saw in it a great threat.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">In such a circumstance, the polytheists and the
                      Jews attacked the Muslims. On other occasions, Christian armies
                      marched against the early Muslim community. In such particular
                      circumstances, it was revealed that the Muslims should fight back
                      against these groups. Therefore, the verse which
                      reads:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0.5in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">*{Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the
                      Last Day.}* (<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>At-Tawbah 9:
                      29</strong></span>)</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #000000;">refers specifically to such circumstances. It
                      most certainly does not mean that Muslims should always be at war
                      with Christians and Jews. It was revealed for a particular
                      situation. For it to mean otherwise would contradict everything the
                      Prophet had done."</span></span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Quran -  2:106<br> al-Baqarah - The Cow</strong></p>
              <p> - <em>When we abrogate any miracle, or cause it to be forgotten, we produce a
                      better miracle, or at least an equal one. Do you not recognize the fact

              <p>Nothing in the quran specifically states that the faithful are allotted 72 virgins apiece. For this elaboration we have to turn to the <em>hadith,</em> traditional sayings traced with varying degrees of credibility to Muhammad. Hadith number 2,562 in the collection known as the <em>Sunan al-Tirmidhi</em> says, "The least [reward] for the people of Heaven is 80,000 servants
              and 72 wives, over which stands a dome of pearls, aquamarine and
              ruby."</p>
              <p>That these 72 wives are virgins is confirmed by Quran (55:74). Read through Quran chapter 55, verses 68 -77. Otherwise readers will be criticised for quoting out of context, again.</p>
