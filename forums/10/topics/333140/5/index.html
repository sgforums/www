              <p>Islam is an Arab religion. It was spread to other parts of the world mostly by the sword. Parameswara was a Hindu who converted to Islam, perhaps for political reasons. His pliant subjects followed.</p>
              <p>You have inherited the religion because of Parameswara, Unless you are Indian Muslim.</p>
              <p>Muslims cannot denounce Islam. Hence, Malays became associated with Islam. That's the problem.</p>

              The Spread Of Islam To Southeast 
                        Asia<br> <br> The spread of Islam to various parts of coastal India set the stage for<br> its further expansion to island Southeast Asia. As we have seen, Arab 
                        traders<br> and sailors regularly visited the ports of Southeast Asia long before they<br> converted to Islam. Initially the region was little more than a middle 
                        ground,<br> where the Chinese segment of the great Euroasian trading complex met the<br> Indian Ocean trading zone to the west. At ports on the coast of the 
                        Malayan<br> peninsula, east Sumatra, and somewhat later north Java, goods from China 
                        were<br> transferred from East Asian vessels to Arab or Indian ships, and products 
                        from<br> as far west as Rome were loaded into the emptied Chinese ships to be 
                        carried<br> to East Asia. By the 7th and 8th centuries A.D., sailors and ships from 
                        areas<br> within Southeast Asia - particularly Sumatra and Malaya - had become 
                        active in<br> the seaborne trade of the region. Southeast Asian products, especially 
                        luxury<br> items, such as aromatic woods from the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, 
                        and<br> spices, such as cloves, nutmeg, and mace from the far end of the 
                        Indonesian<br> archipelago, had also become important exports to both China in the east 
                        and<br> India and the Mediterranean area in the west. These trading links were to<br> prove even more critical to the expansion of Islam in Southeast Asia than 
                        they<br> had earlier been to the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism.<br> <br> As the coastal trade and shipping of India came to be controlled (from<br> the 8th century onward) increasingly by Muslims from such regions as 
                        Gujarat<br> and various parts of south India, elements of Islamic culture began to 
                        filter<br> into island Southeast Asia. But only in the 13th century after the 
                        collapse of<br> the far-flung trading empire of Shrivijaya, which was centered on the 
                        Straits<br> of Malacca between Malaya and the north tip of Sumatra, was the way open 
                        for<br> the widespread proselytization of Islam. With its great war fleets, 
                        Shrivijaya<br> controlled trade in much of the area and was at times so powerful that it<br> could launch attacks on rival empires in south India. Indian traders, 
                        Muslim<br> or otherwise, were welcome to trade in the chain of ports controlled by<br> Shrivijaya. Since the rulers and officials of Shrivijaya were devout<br> Buddhists, however, there was little incentive for the traders and sailors 
                        of<br> Southeast Asian ports to convert to Islam, the religion of growing numbers 
                        of<br> the merchants and sailors from India. With the fall of Shrivijaya, the way 
                        was<br> open for the establishment of Muslim trading centers and efforts to preach 
                        the<br> faith to the coastal peoples. Muslim conquests in areas such as Gujarat 
                        and<br> Bengal, which separated Southeast Asia from Buddhist centers in India from 
                        the<br> 11th century onward, also played a role in opening the way for Muslim<br> conversion.<br> <br> The Pattern Of Conversion<br> <br> As was the case in most of the areas to which Islam spread, peaceful and<br> voluntary conversion was far more important than conquest and force in<br> spreading the faith in Southeast Asia. Almost everywhere in the islands of 
                        the<br> region, trading contacts paved the way for conversion. Muslim merchants 
                        and<br> sailors introduced local peoples to the ideas and rituals of the new faith 
                        and<br> impressed on them how much of the known world had already been converted.<br> Muslim ships also carried Sufis to various parts of Southeast Asia, where 
                        they<br> were destined to play as vital a role in conversion as they had in India. 
                        The<br> first areas to be won to Islam in the last decades of the 13th century 
                        were<br> several small port centers on the northern coast of Sumatra. From these 
                        ports,<br> the religion spread in the following centuries across the Strait of 
                        Malacca to<br> Malaya.<br> <br> On the mainland the key to widespread conversion was the powerful trading<br> city of Malacca, whose smaller trading empire had replaced the fallen<br> Shrivijaya. From the capital at Malacca, Islam spread down the east coast 
                        of<br> Sumatra, up the east and west coasts of Malaya, to the island of Borneo, 
                        and<br> to the trading center of Demak on the north coast of Java. From Demak, the<br> most powerful of the trading states on north Java, the Muslim faith was<br> disseminated to other Javanese ports and, after a long struggle with a<br> Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in the interior, to the rest of the island. From 
                        Demak,<br> Islam was also carried to the Celebes, tha spice islands in the eastern<br> archipelago, and from there to Mindanao in the southern Philippines.<br> <br> This progress of Islamic conversion shows that port cities in coastal<br> areas were particularly receptive to the new faith. Here the trading links<br> were critical. Once one of the key cities in a trading cluster converted, 
                        it<br> was in the best interest of others to follow suit in order to enhance 
                        personal<br> ties and provide a common basis in Muslim law to regulate business deals.<br> Conversion to Islam also linked these centers, culturally as well as<br> economically, to the merchants and ports of India, the Middle East, and 
                        the<br> Mediterranean. Islam made slow progress in areas such as central Java, 
                        where<br> Hindu-Buddhist dynasties contested its spread. But the fact that the 
                        earlier<br> conversion to these Indian religions had been confined mainly to the 
                        ruling<br> elites in Java and other island areas left openings for mass conversions 
                        to<br> Islam that the Sufis eventually exploited. The island of Bali, where 
                        Hinduism<br> had taken deep root at the popular level, remained largely impervious to 
                        the<br> spread of Islam. The same was true of most of mainland Southeast Asia, 
                        where<br> centuries before the coming of Islam, Theravada Buddhism had spread from 
                        India<br> and Ceylon and won the fervent adherence of both the ruling elites and the<br> peasant masses.<br> <br> Sufi Mystics And The Nature Of Southeast Asian Islam<br> <br> The fact that Islam came to Southeast Asia primarily from India and that<br> it was spread in many areas by Sufis had much to do with the mystical 
                        quality<br> of the religion and its tolerance for coexistence with earlier animist, 
                        Hindu,<br> and Buddhist beliefs and rituals. Just as they had in the Middle East and<br> India, the Sufis who spread Islam in Southeast Asia varied widely in<br> personality and approach. Most were believed by those who followed them to<br> have magical powers, and virtually all Sufis established mosque and school<br> centers from which they traveled in neighboring regions to preach the 
                        faith.<br> <br> In winning converts, the Sufis were willing to allow the inhabitants of<br> island Southeast Asia to retain pre-Islamic beliefs and practices that<br> orthodox scholars would clearly have found contrary to Islamic doctrine.<br> Pre-Islamic customary law remained important in regulating social 
                        interaction,<br> while Islamic law was confined to specific sorts of agreements and 
                        exchanges.<br> Women retained a much stronger position, both within the family and in<br> society, than they had in the Middle East and India. Local and regional<br> markets, for example, continued to be dominated by the trading of 
                        small-scale<br> female buyers and sellers. In such areas as western Sumatra, lineage and<br> inheritance continued to be traced through the female line after the 
                        coming of<br> Islam, despite its tendency to promote male dominance and descent through 
                        the<br> male line. Perhaps most tellingly, pre-Muslim religious beliefs and 
                        rituals<br> were incorporated into Muslim ceremonies. Indigenous cultural staples, 
                        such as<br> the brilliant Javanese shadow plays that were based on the Indian epics of 
                        the<br> Brahmanic age, were refined, and they became even more central to popular 
                        and<br> elite belief and practice than they had been in the pre-Muslim era.<p></p>

              <p>Islam is an Arab religion. It was spread to other parts of the
              world mostly by the sword. Parameswara was a Hindu who converted to
              Islam, perhaps for political reasons. His pliant subjects
              followed.</p>
              <p>You have inherited the religion because of Parameswara, Unless
              you are Indian Muslim.</p>
              <p>Muslims cannot denounce Islam. Hence, Malays became associated
              with Islam. That's the problem.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So, you see the problem, Malay is a race, muslim is a religion that everyone can be involve, like the arab, turk and chinese. By indicating that Muslim take up those jobs is already a sense of grouping, you should say some of our good Singaporean Malays, nothing to do with religion, that is why contradication alway come into the picture.</p>

              <p><br> In singapore, i see malay working as policemen, civil defends
              and many other civil servant jobs. If you said muslim, can i said
              that they are many buddhist and taoist taking up post in civil
              servants, and many rich christian doing business in ORchard
              road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, you see the problem, Malay is a race, muslim is a religion
              that everyone can be involve, like the arab, turk and
              chinese. By indicating that Muslim take up those jobs is
              already a sense of grouping, you should say some of our good
              Singaporean Malays, nothing to do with religion, that is why
              contradication alway come into the picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All religions teaches good, they have my respect, just that
