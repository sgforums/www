              <h1>Vivian Balakrishnan: If need be, we can identify you. If we have to, we will prosecute you.</h1>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE : The Singapore government has been embracing and even adopting new media for its work. </span></p>
              <p>And while it is still some way from fully tapping the potential, the
              government said it will gradually evolve its policies with a light
              touch, as the Web2.0 revolution constantly throws up new challenges. </p>
              <p>Singapore is the most wired city in the world. And according to a
              survey, young Singaporeans aged 15 to 24 spend an average of
              eight-and-a-half hours a day being connected. </p>
              <p>And the government has been using new media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube and forums to hook up with citizens. </p>
              <p>Another new media outlet is the OnePeople Portal. </p>
              <p>The online resource on racial harmony was launched by the Community
              Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Saturday. </p>
              <p>While the government is gradually liberalising its approach towards
              online engagement with its citizens, the minister added that one has to
              be responsible and careful when posting their thoughts online.” </p>
              <p>Dr Balakrishnan said: “Anonymity in cyberspace is an illusion. You
              will remember in 2007, we prosecuted three persons under the Sedition
              Act because of the blogs they put up which denigrated the religion of
              one of our communities in Singapore. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“The reason we did that was to send the message that your
              words have an impact; if need be, we can identify you, and if we have
              to, we will be prepared to prosecute you.” </strong></span></p>
              <p>But there are some challenges in the government’s use of new media to get public feedback. </p>
              <p>Dr Milagros Rivera, member, Advisory Council on the Impact of New
              Media on Society (AIMS), said: “We expected people to give feedback.
              Nobody did. I think seven people posted comments on the AIMS website,
              and then the blogosphere went crazy with all kinds of comments and
              discussions about New Media. </p>
              <p>“You can have a very nice welcoming website for the government to
              give feedback. If people are not comfortable they will just stay in
              their little forums and in their blogs and they will do their thing.” </p>
              <p>And there is no doubt more challenges will crop up as cyberspace
              continues to evolve and change the way people communicate with one
              another. - CNA/ms</p>

              <h1>TOC Chief Editor Choo Zheng Xi to set up panel to regulate cyberspace</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>We should have seen it coming. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The PAP will not allow the strident
                  criticisms and attacks on its leaders and policies to continue unabated
                  in cyberspace for long.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Following the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> torrent of vitriol in cyberspace directed against PAP</strong></span> MP Seng Han Thong who was set upon fire by a 70 year old man which must
                  have stunned the PAP, Rear-Admiral Lui Tuck Yew dropped a hint in
                  Parliament <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>of the government’s “disappointment”</strong></span> at the reaction from
                  the ground which is a sign of further regulation to come.</p>
              <p>Realizing the futility of pouring in state resources to patrol the internet, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the
                  PAP has resorted to making use of “credible bloggers” in cyberspace to
                  disparage and discredit others who do not toe the official line</strong>.</span></p>
              <p>One of them is of course the unofficial spokesperson for Singapore’s blogosphere, <strong>ex-YPAP leader and TOC Chief Editor Choo Zheng Xi.</strong> Whenever the state media needs to spin a tale about netizens, he will be there to speak out on our behalfs.</p>
              <p>In an interview published on The Straits Times Insight on 21st February 2009 (read full article <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=2169">here),</a> Choo mooted the idea of community moderation to rein in on wayward bloggers who dare to stand up to the establishment:</p>
              <p><strong>“Mr Choo, a law undergraduate, is currently working on an academic paper on <span style="color: #ff0000;">community moderation.</span> He hopes it will result in a possible working model, or at least
                  advance the discussion. As a starting point, he is looking at
                  self-moderation measures that are working in the real world. He hopes
                  that at least one can be adapted for online use. One model he is
                  considering is that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">moderation by a panel of some sort</span>.”</strong></p>
              <p>Community moderation is still regulation, albeit under a different
                  guise. Given the spectacular failure of the Association of Bloggers,
                  Choo will probably have to move cautiously with his “TOC panel of
                  moderators” to entrap unsuspecting netizens.</p>
              <p>While the size of TOC’s readership should give it a certain degree
                  of clout over some bloggers, it is highly unlikely it will be able to
                  extend its reach throughout the divisive cyberspace with its myriad of
                  blogs and forums.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, it will be a different story if TOC is targeting only a
                  specific group of netizens to prevent them from falling under the
                  influence of “radical” anti-establishment blogs like ours - politically
                  neutral, apathetic and ignorant Singaporeans which form the bulk of
                  internet users.</strong></span></p>
              <p>That’s where the ingenuity of the PAP lies. Instead of offending the
                  entire online community by attempting to regulate their online speech,
                  why not appoint a few “credible blogs” like TOC to do the “community
                  moderation” for them ?</p>
              <p>Since it can never win over the hard core PAP haters, it will be
                  more prudent and wise to spend more time on the middle ground to win
                  their support and trust to prevent them from joining the other camp. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Their
                  real motive lies in stemming the tide of anti-establishment sentiment
                  in cyberspace and not to self-regulate online behavior.</strong></span></p>
              <p>TOC and the few other blogs on its panel will be constantly promoted
                  by the state media as credible, objective and desirable blogs. In fact,
                  it has already been doing so for the past few months. Without the
                  Straits Times’ constant promotion of TOC and Choo week in and week out,
                  it will not be able to reach out to a wider audience. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Have you
                  ever wondered why the TOC is the darling of the PAP mouthpiece and not
                  more reputable bloggers like Mr Brown, Mr Wang and Mr Ng E Jay of
                  sgpolitics.net ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Official acknowledgement and recognition will make TOC more
                  acceptable and appealing to “virgin” readers who seldom visit other
                  blogs or forums and come to know about TOC only through the state
                  media’s publicity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It will also create an erroneous perception
                  in them that blogs which do not subscribe to TOC’s wishy-washy brand of
                  gutter journalism to bootlick the establishment lack credibility and
                  objectivity.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Of course we know that while TOC claims to be politically neutral,
                  one of its writers have been making use of it as a platform to take
                  cheap pot shots at worthy opposition parties and politicians while
                  shamelessly marketing his own distorted version of a “constructive”
                  opposition party that is compliant to the wishes of the PAP.</p>
              <p>To quote from PAP MP Lee Bee Wah: “<strong>‘My view is that for the online media to be credible and attract readers (other than government critics), <span style="color: #ff0000;">what is written has to be objective, accurate and not slanderous. So, some self-imposed ‘professional ethics’ is desired.</span> Just like mainstream reporters, if what they are reporting is rubbish, they will find that the readership will drop.”</strong></p>
              <p>In spite of the mainstream media’s numerous attempts to protray us
                  in a negative light, our readership has increased by leaps and bounds
                  in the last few months and so clearly our criticism of the
                  establishment has been “objective and accurate”. Since the state media
                  has always alluded to TOC as a blog run with ”self-imposed professional
                  ethics”, why hasn’t its readership increased by much in the same span
                  of time ?</p>
              <p>We will resist all efforts by TOC to set up a panel to regulate
                  cyberspace with the tacit support of the PAP and we urge all netizens
                  to expose their nefarious motives in order to preserve the last bastion
                  of freedom in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is absolutely no need at all to set up a panel to regulate the
                  new media. The onus should be on every individual netizen to take
                  responsibility in what they post online. We do not need others to tell
                  us what to say and what not to say.</p>
              <p>If we have to keep looking over our backs before we post anything,
                  it will create an unhealthy climate of self-censorship driven by an
                  innate fear of running afoul of the rules set by the panel and being
                  ostracized by our peers.</p>
              <p>Nobody in this world can ever promise that every single word which
                  comes out from his or her mouth is perfectly “objective, accurate and
                  fair.” There will be times when we will make a mistake unintentionally
                  in the heat of the moment, even in real life. (I am sure you will
                  concur with me on this point, Mdm Lee Bee Wah)</p>
              <p>Introspection is a human quality which all of us possess. When we
                  look back and realize what we write is not appropriate, we can always
                  make amends by apologizing and removing the offending posts. The
                  aggrieved party should be gracious enough to accept the gesture and
                  move on instead of regurgitating his/her plight non-stop to the state
                  media like an old broken tape recorder.</p>
              <p>My proposal to Choo is very simple and straightforward: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do
                  away with the panel, cut down on the crap, stop being a media
                  slut, wake up from self-serving delusions of grandeur and stay out of
                  the business of others.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One PAP is oppressive enough, we do not need another TOC panel to watch over us.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">For Mr Au, something less formal might have value here. He is opposed
                    to approaching community moderation as the idea of some formal
                    superstructure sitting on top of the Web.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When he signed off on the community-moderation idea in the Bloggers 13
                    proposal, his idea was that it would take the form of a 'talk shop' - a
                    place where bloggers and Web administrators come together to discuss the
                    choices they make in moderating their own sites: 'What to allow, what not
                    to allow, how much space to give to something, these are problems everyone
                    faces. The talk shop would allow them to tap each other. The outcome would
                    be intelligent, consistent moderation.'</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></blockquote> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">I think I need to expand and explain what had been quoted. I basically
                    said that even without a superstructure, moderation can be alive and well.
                    The reason is that every website, whether a blog or a forum, has somebody
                    in charge. He is not going to be absent, because maintaining these things
                    takes work. But he's also human, and human beings are ultimately social
                    animals. They tend to get into similar patterns of behaviour as others.
                    This social instinct means their behaviour is amenable to change in ways
                    they are not even conscious of. Or when they are, it is entirely
                    voluntary.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The question then is how can we promote this possibility?
                    One is through
                    socialisation among owners of websites and producers of content. Which was
                    why I mentioned a talk shop where people could tap each others' experience
                    in handling issues or bounce ideas off each other.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">In contrast, erecting a superstructure means that webmasters will see
                    behaviour modification as an external force. It will be resisted.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br> <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>But there is community moderation even
                    now</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">I also said to the Straits Times that we can see moderation at work all
                    the time -- if we know how to look. The problem is, the elephant (the
                    government) comes into the room and tries to define what a moderated
                    internet should look like: It has to be civil, it has to be
                    "balanced", it must not contain "immoral" content and
                    so on. Then everyone puts on his best Sherlock Holmes outfit and goes
                    around with a magnifying glass looking for such a thing, only to find that
                    it's not there. Together we then conclude that since the expected result
                    is not evident, no moderation has taken place.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">What a farce!</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">To me, moderation is evident even now, if
                    only we know how to look for it. There are two kinds of moderation:
                    post-publication and pre-publication.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Post-publication</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> would include instances when either the webmaster or moderator intervenes
                    or when other commentators criticise the viewpoint of the original writer
                    or comment-maker.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A classic example would be when someone tries to
                    cite religious scripture to support an argument. You can bet that lots of
                    others would jump on him immediately. Singaporeans seem to recognise a
                    norm that religiously-based arguments cannot be valid in public discourse.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is not universally true, you know. In many
                    societies with a majority belonging to the same religion, it is quite
                    common for religious citations to be used and not objected to. For
                    example, I have for some time been observing the discourse about
                    homosexuality in Jamaica, one of the most violently homophobic countries
                    on earth, and the typical argument used is a scriptural one. Even the
                    pro-gay equality argument, on the rare occasions when it is surfaced, is
                    sometimes scripture-based.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Pre-publication moderation</strong> is when the
                    writer self-censors. It is much harder to spot. However, we can detect it
                    at work by looking for pattern. Organic self-organisation is usually
                    indicated by the presence of pattern.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">One that is quite obvious is the almost </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> dreary uniformity of viewpoint
                    in the socio-political cyberspace of Singapore -– anti-elite,
                    pro-opposition, and rather provincial. As Tan Tarn How, a media researcher
                    with the Institute
                    of Policy Studies, said recently, we don't see blogs taking strikingly
                    different ideological viewpoints; we don't see pro-communist blogs, for
                    example. Do people with pro-government views or unusual ideological
                    stances censor themselves, and not even put up their arguments?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Related to the above is the narrow range of topics
                    people discuss. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> We see
                    cost-of-living issues, government mismanagement issues and the like, but
                    we don't see much discussion of foreign policy, our attitudes to law and
                    order, our drugs policy, capital punishment, public health, corporate
                    behaviour, pollution
                    and the environment, for example. Might it be that content producers, even if they are
                    personally interested in these topics, have learnt that they get few
                    readers (and therefore little gratification) if they write about such
                    things?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">(I am a bit of a masochist to write the recent long article about
                    <a name="return2">Asean</a> <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/yax-990.htm#foot2">[2]</a>,
                    when I know full well it will get few eyeballs.)</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In the same vein, might it not be true that people
                    do hold themselves back before they say offensive things which they fear
                    would not be well-received by others? That what offensive speech we
                    currently see now is already a reduced amount, culled by self-censorship?
                    Could it be that what is noteworthy is NOT how much offensive speech we
                    see, but how little?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Coming back to the uniformity of viewpoints and
                    topics, I find the above evidence of self-moderation, or self-censorship
                    -- and you really can't separate one from the other -- somewhat
                    disturbing. It begs the question: Is moderation/self-censorship
                    necessarily a good thing? Does it not also drain vitality from public
                    discourse? Is Singapore cyberspace too uniform, too boring, in terms of
                    interests, viewpoints and writing styles?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">But what sticks in the craw of the government is
                    not that it is boring. What sticks is that it is not boring IN THE WAY
                    THEY WOULD WANT IT. The interests are not focussed on the GDP and
                    how to promote economic growth. The viewpoints are too oppositionist, and
                    the style nowhere near deferential enough for their egos. And so the
                    elephant says there is no moderation, and now we're all running around
                    like clowns trying to create a superstructure.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <br> <strong>Where moderation is needed</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">While I have raised the question above as to
                    whether the kind of moderation we currently see is always such a good
                    thing, we should also ask: Is there such a thing as worthwhile moderation?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I guess a case can easily be made for moderation
                    of speech that is malicious. Speech that is intended to inflict social and
                    psychological injury upon a target person or group. If anyone goes about
                    vilifying an ethnic group or bullying a fellow student, then reasonable
                    people would consider this out of bounds.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The problem may be that Singaporeans don't know
                    how to speak up against anti-social behaviour. It is not only in
                    cyberspace, where we are tongue-tied or over-reticent. Singaporeans do not
                    tick off the able-bodied person occupying a seat meant for the elderly or
                    pregnant, they do not speak up when they see people not queuing up, or an
                    abusive parent taking it out on a child.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It is a much more general problem than merely a
                    cyberspace one. I describe us as a society that understands and is
                    submissive to vertical authority, but has no clue about our responsibility
                    to our peers. That, however, is for a separate article.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The point that I think we need to take away is
                    that the more we rely on vertical authority to put things in order, the
                    more negligent we are about horizontal responsibility. So, pace the
                    headline used by Jeremy Au Yong in his article, and which, curiously, is
                    taken from the words of the free-speech advocate Choo Zheng Xi of the
                    Online Citizen -- "Moderate, so government can deregulate" --
                    the order should be the other way around: Deregulate, so people will see
                    the need to moderate.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <br> <strong>"New media" is really new</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Where the whole discussion also falls off the tracks is the use of the
                    word "media". We say "new media", "digital
                    media" and so on, and unthinkingly class the internet alongside other
                    "media" that come to mind, such as television, newspapers and
                    cinema. We then start asking ourselves what models of moderation in these
                    more familiar media can be replicated to serve new media.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Words are like blindfolds and we won't see where we're going if we do
                    not critique the way we use and understand words.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The internet is different from the other "media" in a crucial
                    way. While the rest are few to many -– that is, there are a relatively
                    small number of TV stations, newspaper titles or film studios providing
                    content for large numbers of information consumers -- the internet is many
                    to many. There can be as many producers of content as there are consumers
                    of it.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Even book publishing, which is characterised by millions of titles, is
                    not as "many to many" as the internet.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">"Few to many" media have choke points at which governments or
                    public opinion can exercise influence. The few can be leaned
                    on to abide by a code of conduct.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Imagine how difficult it will be to get the zillions of book authors
                    and publishers to do the same. Now multiply that difficulty for a medium
                    that is virtual, borderless, and which does not need editors, publishers
                    or bookstores as intermediaries, and therefore do not have these
                    chokepoints either.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">You'd be dreaming if you thought that any model of regulation or
                    moderation from the "few to many" media can be applied
                    effectively to the internet. The starting conditions are just so vastly
                    different.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Moreover, as Au Yong wrote in his report,</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><blockquote> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">In a medium where freedom is everything, the thought of someone telling
                    you what not to do is difficult to overcome. Netizens indeed seem
                    particularly sensitive, and the slightest hint of control triggers a need
                    to bite back.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></blockquote> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <br>  <br> <strong>Don't look at other media, look at the psychology of human behaviour</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">So we come back to the one sure thing we know: Content is created by
                    humans. And humans are social animals. Popularity, peer acceptance and
                    social esteem are perennial motivators. Thus, if we want to dwell on the
                    topic of moderation -- and I am not sure I do -- then think along those
                    lines.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Think also about the more general
                    question: Why do Singaporeans neglect their horizontal responsibility to
                    their peers? Is it, at source, a case of an over-controlling government
                    creating a culture reliant only on vertical authority, such that
