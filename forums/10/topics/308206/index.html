              <p> </p>
              <p>Oil was already on the high side before the GST increase. My take is, the inflation was caused by oil, GST and immigration policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The price of food and housing was stable the whole of 2007 till the implementation of GST and immigration policy (to increase population thru immigration to 6.5 million).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the GST increase, prices of all food rises; then with the increase in immigrant population and en-bloc sales (demolishment of existing housing to make way for high density housing), a shortage of housing caused an astronomical increase in housing prices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these issues are the result of oil? Not forgetting that most of our energy generation comes from natural gas, not crude oil. I can't see the logic of SingPower pegging it's electricity prices to crude oil prices. The price of natural gas has been more or less stable from 2003 to 2007 except for a spike at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006.</p>

              <p>When the economy is good and booming, they attribute the success of the economy to their foresight and planning.

              Well, maybe it has no control over the oil prices but it shouldn't add fodder to the burning prices by increasing the GST. For those who forget or choose to forget, oil prices were expected to hit $100 per barrel when gahmen increased GST in Jul 2007.

              <p>Oil was already on the high side before the GST increase. My take is, the inflation was caused by oil, GST and immigration policies. </p>

              <p>I suspect the world is going to start an anti PAP campaign soon because last year's GST hike and immigration policy is causing inflation to spread across the globe like wild fire. And last night, LKY cook supper for his family thats why oil pirce touches US$100 per barrel again.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The problem with Singapore, and the source of so much angst among fellow Singaporeans, is that it is both a city and a country. I’ve lived in both New York and London, and the fact is that a large proportion of people (at least half from my own personal experience) living in these 2 “global” cities were not born there specifically (though many of them were born in the country).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Vibrant cities attracts people to go there to live and work and play. But it also implies that there is a large turnover of population, as is indeed the case in both New York and London. People flock to these cities because the pay is higher, the lifestyle is more exciting, the career options are greater etc. Many of the people who flock there also do not stay forever. But it also means these cities are much more expensive and cramped than other territories just outside them. Just compare London prices to Nottingham prices, for instance.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In a broad sense, the situation in Singapore is actually not very different when seen from this perspective. What is different about Singapore is that it is both a city and a country.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You see a person born in London who might prefer a cheaper and less exciting lifestyle for whatever reason could escape to Wales or Cornwall without having to leave the country. In these places, a London pension or even small government handouts can go a long way because they are so much cheaper. Singaporeans do not have that choice. If you don’t want the city life, you have to leave Singapore or you’re forced into a marginal existence because you simply can’t afford to fully enjoy the vibrant but expensive lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So a Singaporean who wants a slower pace of life and a bigger house is forced to move to Australia or NZ, or if he doesn’t move he will constantly feel aggrieved about how “unfair” the government treats him. If Singapore were part of Malaysia, for example, this person could move to Trengganu or something. After selling his HDB in Singapore, he could buy a massive beach-front bungalow in Trengganu, and enjoy a much cheaper lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">So perhaps the practical way to solve the problem that Singapore is both a city and a country is maybe that we need to re-merge with Malaysia.</p>

              <p>I hope you have not offended anyone by saying that Singaporeans who wants a slower pace of life would move to Australia and NZ.</p>

              <p>I do agree with you that the best scenario is for Singaporeans to live in lower cost area such as JB or even Batam</p>

              <p>Hi I'm new here.</p>
              <p>There are so many negative voices here that stated their unhappiness about gahmen policy and unstable economy. Is there anyone can provide some suggestion and solutions ?</p>
              <p>I can only think of 2 ways:</p>
              <p>1. Increase income. Maybe get part time job or try to do business. But i work full time and no $$ to start business.</p>
              <p>2. Cut down expenses. Spend on the "Needs" rather than the "wants".</p>
              <p>If both method still can't solve the problems, what's next step? Anymore ideas?</p>
