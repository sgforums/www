Many Singaporeans are glad that foreigners like me have made Singapore our homes and are contributing actively to the country.<br><br>I have come across many individuals who have lauded us Indians for being ‘clever’ in IT and bringing specialized expertise which is unavailable locally.<br><br>But, as I had mentioned earlier, things have changed in the past few years. From being viewed as contributors of the society foreigners are now viewed as competitors in the society. The reason though being obvious to me seems lost among certain entities trying to justify the huge influx of foreigners.<br><br>Traditionally Singapore has welcomed foreigners for two reasons. The first would be to fill positions in fields that Singaporeans shun. Examples would be construction, ship building and other labor intensive jobs that do not pay enough to maintain a decent lifestyle in Singapore.<br><br>The second would be to fill positions where there is a dearth of locally available talent. Examples would be CEOs, scientists, professionals and other specialized jobs. These reasons are fully justified and have played a huge role in the Singapore miracle that has held the entire world in awe.<br><br>However Singapore has now adopted a third reason and it is this third reason that is causing so much resentment among the local population. And that reason being to make up for a population shortage prognosticated to occur in 10 years time.<br><br>Thousands of foreigners are brought in every month because Singaporeans are not producing enough babies to replace themselves. The question to be asked is this; are enough jobs being created for this influx in the present?<br><br>If not then we have a situation where an increased number of people are competing for a fixed number of jobs. Artificial and rapid population boosts without an accompanying and proportional increase in jobs will lead to detrimental side effects such as depressed wages, lowered quality of life, lack of social well being etc. And this precisely what is happening in Singapore.<br><br>The majority of the foreigners who are brought into Singapore do not create jobs per se, they are here to work. Essentially this means you have fixed number of jobs in the pool which is being contended for by an ever increasing pool of people brought about by rapid population boosts.<br><br>Foreigners who are semi-skilled, semi-professional and non-specialized do not bring anything extraordinary to Singapore that can’t be found locally. These foreigners end up competing with the local Singaporeans on what has traditionally been their economic turf.<br><br>Is there a lack of Singaporeans with fresh-mid IT skills? Or semi-specialized mechanical engineers or electrical &amp; electronics engineers? Or is it that enough Singaporeans can’t be trained in these areas?<br><br>Many bright and talented local graduates have now resorted to selling insurance or property or are wasting their valuable hard-earned skills in unrelated fields because their traditional economic means is now being challenged by a huge number of foreigners who if not for the forecasted population shortage have no reason to be here.<br><br>It is no wonder that Singaporeans have been expressing their displeasure and they have every reason to be so. Their earnings have steadily diminished, competition has steady risen, the cost of living has risen, they don’t have a place to fall back on unlike us foreigners and they have a minimum lifestyle to maintain.<br><br>The Singapore government’s policy of artificial population boosts is a brave and proactive one. But unless the influx is accompanied by a proportional increase in the relevant job sectors I am afraid the policy will do more harm than good and could seriously undermine the social apparatus of Singapore.<br><br>What would ensure Singapore’s continued success into the next decade is not just a population of 6.5 million but a population of gainfully employed, happy and hopeful 6.5 million people.<br><br>It is high time relevant entities realize this and work towards preserving a society that has always been proud of its multi-cultural and multi-national structure.</div>

              <p>Khaw Boon Wan is a good minister.</p>
              <p>He is the only Health Minister who has a complete knowledge of how the health sector works in Singapore. He is a not a "helicopter minister" from somewhere else. He shows genuine care for the poor, sick, elderly and the handicap and with a rational mind.</p>
              <p>True, he is earning millions of dollars and none of us here in the sgf has this ability to earn as much or anywhere near to it. So, don't be envious of him as we do not  have the same ability like him.</p>
              <p>He has to make very difficult decisions on how the Health budegt will be allocated to each competing medical needs. Should he allocate more funds to help AIDS patients, there will be less fund for Cancer patients who need the new Cancer drugs ? His decisions will affect the lives of the patients.</p>
              <p>He has many issues to ponder every minute and decisions to make. So, you think he is like many of the kids in sgf who will MSN, read emails, facebook, tweeters etc all the time ? Despite his busy work schedule, he is writing a blog in an effort to communicate and get in touch with the public. He does not want to make policies in an ivory tower.</p>
              <p>Once he finds out that patients have to queue outside the polyclinics at 7 am  to take numbers, and after a few days, he informs the polyclincs to let the patients to wait inside the clinic instead of outside.</p>
              <p>Also, once he knows that patients have to wait 6 to 9 months before they can see the specialist doctors in hospitals. He instructed the hospitals to shorten the queuue period and he also makes the firm decision to recruit more doctors and enlarge the enrolment for NUS medical faculty, the setting of new medical schools with the long-term view to shorten the queue period.</p>
              <p>He has also implemented many other policies that benefit the patients.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, he still has the difficulties from preventing the health cost from rising.</p>
              <p>Just hope that he can finds ways to slow down the rise in health cost.</p>
