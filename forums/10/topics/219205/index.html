            <div class='col-md body'>The GRCs were sub-divided into sections for ease of voting; in short, estates were carved into polling stations for convenience, but also to ascertain the voting statistics of sub-sections of GRCs.<br><br>Being a good ruling party, all these statistics would have prompted them which areas were predominantly 'for' or 'against'. All electorial parties have access to these statistics for their future planning and compaigning.<br><br>Clearly, sections in the Nee Soon south area must have contributed heavily to the 33% of WP; in any case, in all his years of being an AMK GRC incumbent MP, Lee junior has never visited the Springleaf garden-Nee soon South estate for meet the people sessions.<br><br>Why would he have the sudden urge to hold such a high profile visit with red-carpet treatment at a time when the elections are just over?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Is it correct for us to believe that with the precedence of others having done wrong and managed to circumvent the law, it becomes correct and prudent for our law abiding state owned corporation to follow such dubious arrangements ?<br><br>LHL should be asked if the Civil Service, the Police and the SAF will be neutral and respect the Constitutional Process in accepting the Election Results - in the event that an Alternative Party should be elected to form the next Government ?<br><br>Will the Ruling Party gracefully step down, or will it instigate a Constitutional Crisis ? Is our Elite from the Ruling Party politically mature to ensure that our Election System will allow for a peaceful and orderly transition and handing over of government between elected political parties ?<br><br>The Residents of Springleaf Estate are mostly professionals, businessmen, and are worldly wise; and unless they prefer to be "politically safe than sorry" - there is little to be expected from this LHL visit to this Estate.<br></span><br><br></div>
