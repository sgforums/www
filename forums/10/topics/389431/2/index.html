              <p>WHERE THE MONEY GOES</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>MONEY GOES INTO CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUNDS AND MEDICAL FUNDS AS A COMPULSORY GOVERNMENT MEASURE.BOTH ARE FROM THE SALARY OF THE EMPLOYEE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND:MONEY IS TAKEN OUT EVERY MONTH TO PAY FOR  THE COST OF A HDB APARTMEN AN APPROVED EDUCATION.</p>
              <p>MEDISAVE FUND:MONEY IS TAKEN OUT WHEN U ARE HOSPITALISED ONLY.SO THE MONEY STAYS UNTOUCHED BY EMPLOYEE ACCORDING TO STRICT LAW IMPOSED ON THAT MEDISAVE FUND UNTIL HE GETS SICK AND NEEDS TO BE HOSPITALISED,,,,,,ONCE IN 5 YEARS OR 3 YEARS ??NO ONE NEEDS TO BE HOSPITALISED EVERY DAY OR MONTH!AND EVERY SINGLE CENT BELONGS TO THE EMPLOYEE!</p>
              <p>HOW CAN SOME GOV TELL U OR FORCE U WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AND THAT MONEY IN MEDISAVE FUND IS STUCK THERE WITH NO FIXED DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES OR CANT BE USED IN ANYWAY TO MAXIMISE ITS RETUERNS!!</p>
              <p>SO IF YOU HAVE $10,000 IN THE MEDISAVE FUND&gt;&gt;&gt;U ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN FOR APPROVED NATIONAL MEDICAL OPERATIONS USE WHICH NEEDS HOSPITALISATION</p>

              <p>no need to mention mexico, just malaysia and indonesia, got free clinics, but if you see their doctors and medicine, the crowds and the waiting time, i think people who are not sick, go there also get sick. And after the free consultation, the docs will said that if you want better medicine you have to pay these and that, and surgery will need your insurance, and that if you dun want, we cannot help you further except go outside and take your cough or panadol medicine.</p>
              <p>But our is different, cure you all the way first, money can talk later ya</p>

              <p>It's the norm,nothing so fascinating about this announcement.Singaporean are numbed to increases already,what can we do?</p>
              <p>Taking away 10 percentage point out of the PRs medical subsidy is no big deal.</p>
              <p>Should do more for citizens instead.Foriegners must be charge more when they seek medical care here.No free medical fees,pls.Charge to the respective country gov if and when any of their citizens come here for special and emergency operations.It's not right for the taxpayers here to foot the bill.</p>
