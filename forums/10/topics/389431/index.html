              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Medisave contribution may go up as the need for long-term care increases with Singapore's aging population. 
              <br> <br> Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the current contribution rate of
              6.5% to about 9% does not build up enough reserves to pay for both big
              medical bills and long-term care.
              <br> <br>Medisave has been around for 25 years and was originally meant to
              pay for major hospital stays but its use has since been expanded to
              include some outpatient payments. <br> <br> Mr Khaw said the current contribution rate is not enough to cover long-term healthcare bills. 
              <br> <br> "We've never priced that into Medisave contribution rate. So that's a
              topic almost certainly I see a need for discussion during the upcoming
              Budget Debate," he said. <br> <br> Speaking on the sidelines of his visit to the Bloodbank@HSA on
              Thursday, Mr Khaw said the increase in contribution rate will depend on
              what the Members of Parliament are ready to support. <br> <br> Meanwhile, more money will be injected into the common health subsidy pool for citizens. 
              <br> <br> This follows the ministry's decision to reduce health subsidies given
              to permanent residents (PRs) from January 1 next year. The idea is to
              further sharpen the distinction between Singapore citizens and PRs.
              <br> <br>The Health Ministry said in a statement: "Citizens enjoy heavy
              subsidy in Class B2 and C wards. PRs receive significant subsidy while
              foreigners are not subsidised at all. The subsidy distinction reflects
              the privileges of citizenship, but there is scope for refinement."
              <br> <br> PRs now get 10 percentage points less in subsidy than citizens. This will go up to a 20-point difference by 2012. 
              <br> <br>With the revision, citizens are still entitled to an 80% subsidy
              for a Class C ward. But PRs will be entitled to 60% of cost, down from
              70%. <br> <br> And Mr Khaw explained how the cost savings from the move will be used. 
              <br> <br> "Our data suggests that about 6% of our patients are PRs, so this
              reduction in subsidy for them, will save us about seven million dollars
              a year, which we would then use to top up our growing subsidy for
              citizens." <br> <br> The minister said that it is only right for citizens to enjoy more subsidies than non-citizens. 
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw added that the move will mean PRs have to make some adjustments like getting additional health insurance. 
              <br> <br> "If you're not already insured with a private shield, then you should
              seriously think about taking up one because your basic MediShield is
              really aimed at the B2, C subsidy rates. So now that your subsidy will
              be less, I think you need to augment it with a private shield."
              <br> <br> To help the PRs affected by the policy to ease into the adjustments, the reduction will be carried out in stages. 
              <br> <br>From January 1 next year, the subsidy for PRs in the public
              hospitals (Class B2 and C wards) and specialist outpatient clinics will
              be reduced by 5 percentage-points.
              <br> <br>From July 1 next year, another 5 percentage-point reduction will
              apply in the public hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics. <br> <br> Also from July 1 next year, the subsidy for PRs in the intermediate and 
              <br> long-term care sector like community hospitals and nursing homes will be reduced by 5 percentage-points.
              <br> <br> From January 1, 2012, another 5 percentage-point reduction will apply in the intermediate and long-term care sector.
              <br> <br> By 2012, there will be a 20 percentage-point difference in healthcare subsidies between citizens and PRs.

              <p>Seriously I have no issues with Medisave, it did help me alot when my Father incur quite a sum of hospital bills. Although he eventually passed away, bills needed to be paid and most of it was being paid off by Medisave. Of cos there are arguments that hospital fees are too expensive in Singapore but thats another argument, Medisave did fulfill its use in my Father's case.</p>
              <p>What I cannot understand is how would this cut for the PR add value to me as a citizen? If it doesnt, then I am not being given more as a citizen, its just taking away from the poor PR and then tell us we, citizens are better off. This is like screwing both parties haha.</p>

              <p>Indeed, the medical cost for the same treatment has increased significantly for the past 2 years.</p>
              <p>A friend needs to have a spine surgery and the estimated cost is $18,000 for B1 class (cheapest private patient class which allows the choice of a surgeon, B2 and C class patients cannot choose a surgeon and the surgeon will be assigned by the hospital and the surgeon is most likely to be a surgeon who has just completed his or her specialist training, so no choice but the friend has to opt to be a B1 class patient) in Jun 2008 and she checks with the hospital again in Jan 2010, the estimated cost has increased to $27,000. She has still not decided to do the surgery yet as she is still worried about the danger, outcome, complications of the spine surgery.</p>
              <p>The percentage increase in surgery cost is more than 30% within a two year period.</p>

              <p>Reducing the PR's subsidy to 60 per cent is a move to placate
              the citizens but it doesnt really help us if the reduction in PR's
              subsidies do not translate directly into subsidies for citizens. If
              the subsidy for citizens is now raised to 85%, then the other 5%
              cut from PR side can be used for case by case basis, I think that
              will be more appreciated. Reasons like higher subsidies encouraging
              abuses from higher income citizens should not be an issue if the
              means testing are done diligently. Overall, I think this change has
              no up front value to citizens.</p>
