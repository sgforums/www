              <p><span id="bodytext" class="georgia md">
              </span></p><p>Arthur C. Clarke, a writer
              whose seamless blend of scientific expertise and poetic imagination
              helped usher in the space age, died Wednesday in his adopted home of
              Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he had lived since 1956. He was 90.</p>
              <p>The author of almost 100 books, Clarke was an ardent promoter of
              the idea that humanity's destiny lay beyond the confines of Earth. It
              was a vision served most vividly by "2001: A Space Odyssey," the
              classic 1968 science-fiction film he created with the director Stanley
              Kubrick and the novel of the same title that he wrote as part of the
              project.</p>
              <p>His work was also prophetic: His detailed forecast of
              telecommunications satellites in 1945 came more than a decade before
              the first orbital rocket flight.</p>
              <p>Clarke's influence on public attitudes toward space was
              acknowledged by American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts, by
              scientists like Carl Sagan and by movie and television producers. Gene
              Roddenberry credited Clarke's writings with encouraging him to pursue
              his "Star Trek" project in the face of indifference from television
              executives.</p>
              <p>In his later years, after settling in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka),
              Clarke continued to bask in worldwide acclaim as both a scientific sage
              and the pre-eminent science fiction writer of the 20th century. In
              1998, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
              <p>Clarke played down his success in foretelling a globe-spanning
              network of communication satellites. "No one can predict the future,"
              he always maintained.</p>
              <p>But as a science fiction writer, he couldn't resist drawing up
              timelines for what he called "possible futures." Far from displaying
              uncanny prescience, these conjectures mainly demonstrated his lifelong,
              and often disappointed, optimism about the peaceful uses of technology
              - from his calculation in 1945 that atomic-fueled rockets could be no
              more than 20 years away to his conviction in 1999 that "clean, safe
              power" from "cold fusion" would be commercially available in the first
              years of the new millennium.</p>
              <p>Arthur Charles Clarke was born on Dec. 16, 1917, in Minehead,
              England. While still in school, he joined the newly formed British
              Interplanetary Society, a small band of sci-fi enthusiasts who held the
              controversial view that space travel was not only possible but could be
              achieved in the not-so-distant future. In 1937, he began writing his
              first science-fiction novel, a story of the distant future that was
              later published as "Against the Fall of Night" (1953).</p>
              <p>Clarke spent World War II as an officer in the Royal Air Force. In
              1943 he was assigned to work with a team of American
              scientist-engineers who had developed the first radar-controlled system
              for landing airplanes in bad weather. That experience led to Clarke's
              only non-science-fiction novel, "Glide Path" (1963). More important, it
              led in 1945 to a technical paper, published in the British journal
              Wireless World, establishing the feasibility of artificial satellites
              as relay stations for Earth-based communications.</p>
              <p>Decades later, Clarke called his Wireless World paper "the most
              important thing I ever wrote." In a wry piece titled, "A Short
              Pre-History of Comsats, Or: How I Lost a Billion Dollars in My Spare
              Time," he said a lawyer had dissuaded him from applying for a patent.</p>
              <p>For the next two years Clarke attended King's College, London,
              graduating in 1948 with first-class honors in physics and mathematics.
              But he continued to write and sell stories, and after a stint as
              assistant editor at the scientific journal Physics Abstracts, he
              decided he could support himself as a freelance writer.</p>
              <p>Over the next two decades, he wrote a series of nonfiction
              bestsellers as well as his best-known novels, including "Childhood's
              End" (1953) and "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968).</p>
              <p>In "Childhood's End," a race of aliens who happen to look like devils imposes peace on an Earth torn by Cold War tensions.</p>
              <p>The Cold War also forms the backdrop for "2001." Its genesis was a
              short story titled "The Sentinel," first published in a science-fiction
              magazine in 1951. It tells of an alien artifact found on the moon, a
              little crystalline pyramid that explorers from Earth destroy while
              trying to open. One explorer realizes that the artifact was a kind of
              fail-safe beacon; in silencing it, human beings have signaled their
              existence to its far-off creators.</p>
              <p>In 1964, Kubrick and Clarke agreed to make the "proverbial really
              good science-fiction movie," based on "The Sentinel." This led to a
              four-year collaboration; Clarke wrote the novel, and Kubrick produced
              and directed the film; they are jointly credited with the screenplay.</p>
              <p>All told, he wrote or collaborated on close to 100 books. His works
              have been translated into about 40 languages, and worldwide sales have
              been estimated at more than $25 million.</p>
              <p>A statement from Clarke's office said that he had recently reviewed
              the final manuscript of his latest novel. "The Last Theorem,"
              co-written with Frederik Pohl, will be published later this year, the
              statement said.</p>
              <p>Clarke was briefly married in 1953 to an American diving enthusiast
              named Marilyn Mayfield; they separated after a few months and were
              divorced in 1964, having had no children.</p>
