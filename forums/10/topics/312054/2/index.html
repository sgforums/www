Under Dalai’s slavery <strong>SERF SYSTEM</strong>, Tibetans’ population never grew too much, yet after 1959, the population now is doubled to 2.6 million from 1.2 million under the Serf system. The number speaks itself, what genocide? When infant mortality in you favored Slavery Tibet is 460 per 1000, now is under 35 per 1000.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Yawning slogan and fabricating killing number do not make your CIA supported “Gov in-exile” any legal/moral high ground. Less than a quarter million Tibet offspring holding various foreign passports do not represent the Tibet with near 3 million people which is always under Chinese territory over thousands years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">I am not a big fan of CIA either.if that's the case why does Tibeteans want to be free from China?So u still say that 'Tibet under china' and not a chinese provice.</span></p>

              <p>"The population transfer of Chinese into Tibet, which the government in Peking pursues in order to force a "final solution" to the Tibetan problem by reducing the Tibetan population to an insignificant and disenfranchised minority in Tibet itself, must be stopped.</p>
              <p>The massive transfer of Chinese civilians into Tibet in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949) threatens the very existence of the Tibetans as a distinct people. In the eastern parts of our country, the Chinese now greatly outnumber Tibetans. In the Amdo province, for example, where I was born, there are, according to Chinese statistics, 2.5 million Chinese and only 750,000 Tibetans. Even in so-called Tibet Autonomous Region (i.e., central and western Tibet), Chinese government sources now confirm that Chinese outnumber Tibetans.</p>
              <p>The Chinese population transfer policy is not new. It has been systematically applied to other areas before. Earlier in this century, the Manchus were a distinct race with their own culture and traditions. Today only two to three million Manchurians are left in Manchuria, where 75 million Chinese have settled. In Eastern Turkestan, which the Chinese now call Sinkiang, the Chinese population has grown from 200,000 in 1949 to 7 million, more than half of the total population of 13 million. In the wake of the Chinese colonization of Inner Mongolia, Chinese number 8.5 million, Mongols 2.5 million.</p>
              <p>Today, in the whole of Tibet 7.5 million Chinese settlers have already been sent, outnumbering the Tibetan population of 6 million. In central and western Tibet, now referred to by the Chinese as the "Tibet Autonomous Region", Chinese sources admit the 1.9 million Tibetans already constitute a minority of the region's population. These numbers do not take the estimated 300,000 - 500,000 troops in Tibet into account - 250,000 of them in the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region. " from</p>

With diversity in terms of distribution, most people live in rural areas, and fewer in cities and towns. The population of the Tibetan nationality accounts for over 90% of the population, <strong>but that of the Han nationality and other ethnic groups is very small</strong>. Affected by nature, geographic conditions and climate, 80% of the population in Tibet is distributed mainly over the valley along the middle reaches of the Brahmaputra River valley and the deep valleys along three rivers (Lantsang River, Lujang River and Yangtse River) which are located in the eastern part of Tibet. There are few people in the northern part of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau because of its harsh climate. The southeastern part of Tibet is covered by primeval forests; there population density is low, transportation is inadequate and other conditions unfavorable. In 2000, the population density of Tibet was only 2.1 persons per square kilometer. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">U r fundamentally wrong as something against Chinese then u so conveniently read as “ Tibetans want to be free from China” ?? Anti-chinese riots are not uncommon these days. We saw them in Indonesia/South Pacific states/ Africa etc. using ur logic, do all those riots are those nations “want to be freed from China “?? More because of nowadays Chinese domination in business that make the locals uncomfortable, far from ur ideology, dude. Tell me why Tibetan rioters attack Muslim in Lhasa as well? Do the Muslims got anything to do with ur ideology? No, simply because Muslims in Lhasa also dominate some business alongside Han Chinese. <span> </span></span></p>
