              <p>To be fair, not all western media are biased. But as far as I know, those from US, UK are definitely biased against China. When UK is ruling HK, the media also never urging British colony to give democracy to the chinese there. But after HK is returned, all the funny news suddendly pop up.</p>

              <p>Gentlemen ... if you're wondering why the link on youtube.hk is slow ..... or some of the links on youtube.com is unaccessible from your place in china .....</p>
              <p>and why your favourite youtube videos cannot be found, or can't even be accessed from the internet in china, especially the certain sensitive contents on youtube.com, ..... don't be alarmed ..... it's I presume, only a temperory ban by the chinese goverment .... </p>
              <p>no worries ... hopefully, a proxy browser will allow you to view "objectionable contents" .... and that once this thing blow over, all will be well again ...</p>

              <p>some, of course, like the TS, would actually be overseas ... for the rest ? .... I'll let people draw their own conclusions ... </p>

              <p>It reveals the true face of Western media and their frenzied obsession with besmirching the image of China.

              <p>Of course for the sycophants whose lips are firmly placed on Uncle Sam's (metaphor for the West at large) buttocks, those lies are unquestionable truth.  Boy, they so would bend backwards to rationalize such lies on behalf of their ideological masters.  </p>

              <p>The recent troubles in Tibet are a replay of events that happened two decades ago. On Oct. 1, 1987, Buddhist monks were demonstrating peacefully at the Barkor -- the famous market street around the central cathedral in Lhasa -- when police began beating and arresting them. To ordinary Tibetans, who view monks as "treasures," the sight was intolerable -- not only in itself, but because it stimulated unpleasant memories that Tibetan Buddhists had been harboring for years.</p>
              <p>A few angry young men then began throwing stones at the Barkor police station. More and more joined, and then they set fires, overturned cars and began shouting "Independence for Tibet!" This is almost exactly what we saw in Lhasa two weeks ago.</p>
              <p>The fundamental cause of these recurrent events is a painful dilemma that lives inside the minds of Tibetan monks. When the Chinese government demands that they denounce their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, monks are forced to choose between obeying, which violates their deepest spiritual convictions, and resisting, which can lead to loss of government registry and physical expulsion from monasteries.</p>
              <p>From time to time monks have used peaceful demonstrations to express their anguish. When they have done this, an insecure Chinese government, bent on "annihilating unstable elements" in the "emergent stage," has reacted with violent repression. This, in turn, triggers violence from Tibetans.</p>
              <p>In recent decades, the Chinese government's policy for pacifying Tibet has been to combine the allure of economic development on the one hand with the threat of force on the other. Experience has shown that this approach does not work.</p>
              <p>The most efficient route to peace in Tibet is through the Dalai Lama, whose return to Tibet would immediately alleviate a number of problems. Much of the current ill will, after all, is a direct result of the Chinese government's verbal attacks on the Dalai Lama, who, for Tibetan monks, has an incomparably lofty status. To demand that monks denounce him is about as practical as asking that they vilify their own parents.</p>
              <p>It should be no surprise that beatings of monks and closings of monasteries naturally stimulate civil unrest, or that civil unrest, spawned in this way, can turn violent.</p>
              <p>Why aren't these simple truths more obvious? Phuntsog Wanggyal, a Tibetan now retired in Beijing who for years was a leading Communist official in Tibet, has observed that a doctrine of "anti-splittism" has taken root among Chinese government officials who deal with religion and minority affairs, both in central offices in Beijing and in Tibet. Having invested their careers in anti-splittism, these people cannot admit that the idea is mistaken without losing face and, they fear, losing their own power and position as well.</p>
              <p>Their ready-made tag for everything that goes wrong is "hostile foreign forces" -- an enemy that justifies any kind of harsh or unreasoning repression. When repeated endlessly, anti-splittism, although originally vacuous, does take on a kind of solidity. Careers are made in it, and challenging it becomes impossible.</p>
              <p><strong>I am a supporter of the Dalai Lama's "middle way," meaning autonomy for Tibet in all matters except foreign affairs and national defense.</strong> This arrangement eventually would have to mean that Tibetan people select their own leaders -- and that would be a major change from the way things are now. Tibet is called an "autonomous region," but in fact its officials are all named by Beijing, and are all tightly focused on their own personal interests and the interests of the Communist Party. Tibetans can clearly see the difference between this kind of government and self-rule, and there is no way that they will support bogus autonomy.</p>
              <p>It follows -- even if this is a tall order -- that the ultimate solution to the Tibet problem must be democratization of the Chinese political system itself. True autonomy cannot come any other way.</p>
              <p>It is time for the Chinese government to take stock of why its long-term strategy in Tibet has not worked, and to try something else. The old problems remain, and they are sure to continue, perhaps in places like the "Uighur Autonomous Region" of Xinjiang, if a more sensible approach is not attempted.</p>

Her cultural genocide on Tibet and her unscrupulous accusation of the Dalai Lama is just unbearable. She should stop her wicked act of violence on Tibet that has brought great sufferings to the Tibetians for decades. If She only  has a slight understanding of morality, she should have leave Tibet in peace and not attacking on her. she said wanted a peace talk but do nothing about it.The act of violence is evil and putting the blames on others and deceiving the truth is an unscrupulous act. Leave Tibets and the her culture alone. Leave Tibets to rule by herself.</p></div>

              <blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">the point u mentioned the country, when Tibet has never been an internationally recognized country historically? Shame on you even Marco Polo, the 1<sup>st</sup> westerner went to China has duly mentioned Tibet, apparently because it belonged to part of Yuan Dynast territory where he was visiting. That’s some 1000 years ago, much longer than some modern western countries’ histories combined.</span></blockquote>

Under Dalai’s slavery <strong>SERF SYSTEM</strong>, Tibetans’ population never grew too much, yet after 1959, the population now is doubled to 2.6 million from 1.2 million under the Serf system. The number speaks itself, what genocide? When infant mortality in you favored Slavery Tibet is 460 per 1000, now is under 35 per 1000.</span></p>

Less than a quarter million Tibet offspring holding various foreign passports do not represent the Tibet with near 3 million people which is always under Chinese territory over thousands years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">I am not a big fan of CIA either.if that's the case why does Tibeteans want to be free from China?So u still say that 'Tibet under china' and not a chinese provice.</span></p>

              <p>"The population transfer of Chinese into Tibet, which the government in Peking pursues in order to force a "final solution" to the Tibetan problem by reducing the Tibetan population to an insignificant and disenfranchised minority in Tibet itself, must be stopped.</p>
              <p>The massive transfer of Chinese civilians into Tibet in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949) threatens the very existence of the Tibetans as a distinct people. In the eastern parts of our country, the Chinese now greatly outnumber Tibetans. In the Amdo province, for example, where I was born, there are, according to Chinese statistics, 2.5 million Chinese and only 750,000 Tibetans. Even in so-called Tibet Autonomous Region (i.e., central and western Tibet), Chinese government sources now confirm that Chinese outnumber Tibetans.</p>
              <p>The Chinese population transfer policy is not new. It has been systematically applied to other areas before. Earlier in this century, the Manchus were a distinct race with their own culture and traditions. Today only two to three million Manchurians are left in Manchuria, where 75 million Chinese have settled. In Eastern Turkestan, which the Chinese now call Sinkiang, the Chinese population has grown from 200,000 in 1949 to 7 million, more than half of the total population of 13 million. In the wake of the Chinese colonization of Inner Mongolia, Chinese number 8.5 million, Mongols 2.5 million.</p>
              <p>Today, in the whole of Tibet 7.5 million Chinese settlers have already been sent, outnumbering the Tibetan population of 6 million. In central and western Tibet, now referred to by the Chinese as the "Tibet Autonomous Region", Chinese sources admit the 1.9 million Tibetans already constitute a minority of the region's population. These numbers do not take the estimated 300,000 - 500,000 troops in Tibet into account - 250,000 of them in the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region. " from</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Has the Chinese government killed the Tibetan race? Such kind of unfounded accusations is very dangerous. I don’t know how old are you and how you get this kind of extremist mindset. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Let me tell you what the Caucasians did to the Native Americans. When Columbus arrived in the north American continent, the population of native Americans was estimated at 54 millions, today, there are only about 2 millions Native Indians in America. That is more than what you said “killing off ur race”!! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today Tibetan population has increased, besides the 2.4 millions living in Tibet, there are another 2.6 millions ethnic Tibetans now in all part of China, in Gansu, Yunna, Qinghai, Sichuan,<span>  </span>living peacefully among the Han majority. Talk about culture aggression and reservation? Starbuck was allowed in the Forbidden City but never in the Jokhang temple. Many native Indians languages disappeared from America, but Tibetan language remains in Tibet. No native Indians religion exists now in America, but hundreds of Buddhist monasteries remain the attraction of Buddhists all over the world. Potola Palace remains the icon of Tibet, it houses a thousand shrines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tibetan is now opened even more to the outside world with the railway link. Don’t tell me this is to facilitate the “eradication of Tibetans”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Don’t give me that b ull s hit that the American genocide against the Indian does not give Chinese the right to rule over Tibet. What the Americans did were racial depopulation and cultural eradication. What the Chinese did in Tibet is far far from that. That’s a no brainer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am surprised the Chinese police still don’t equip themselves with rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas. I don’t totally approve of the way they handle the news. I am disappointed at the way Hu pointing finger at Dalai in exile. I am impressed with Dalai in exile for calling for restrains and reiterating his support for the Olympics. That doesn’t mean I support the PRC nor support an independent Tibet. As for the western media, I would be surprised if they report something that is neural.</span></p>
