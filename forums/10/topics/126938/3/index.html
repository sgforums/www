First, they started a long term preparation whereby students were systematically taught in schools to desire China's ShanTong Pears. The students were asked : Do you want Shanton pears. Psychologically, the whole generation were prepared to start a war ending with their fated invasion of China in WW II.<br><br>If one is to observe what has happened recently, their leaders' visiting of the war hero's shrine was not a chance occurrence. Re-writing of the textbook is a confirmation of the same nationalism to revive their military power.<br><br>Their active participation as an ally of US in the Iraq war is not an incidental act as well. This time, the Japanese will use both their economic power and with the help of US its military power to rule the world. The grand design of neo-Japanese Imperialism is unveiling...<br><br>All these moves are made subtly but steadily carried out. Let the US beware that the Japanese is on the war path slowly planning out the whole revival with their unwitting assistance and encouragement. Lately encouraged by US who needed Japan as partner in tackling terrorism, it is beginning to flex its military with more physical aggression.<br><br>If one is to care the Japanese actions in claiming islands in the China Sea, one will see more evidence of more deliberate attempt to use the war heros as rallying point to revive their past military aggressions.<br><br>This aggressive minds among their leaders are unspoken. Minds have now sharp and focused to manipulate their population in the Koitsumi era to shed their post war restraints.

            <div class='col-md body'>the japanese started the wars because of greed, they want take over the world. Yet greed is also their downfall, their troubles started when they tried to take over mid islands controlled by USA. When they are defeated, the 1st law they made in their constitution was "War is not desirable" ...and since then, they believe strongly against war. They have reformed to a certain extent, why not give them a chance?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think that the protests against the Japanese are against them [I]per se[/I], but a cry for the Japanese to acknogledge their wartime misdeeds, and apologise.<br><br>Honestly, I find it a totally logical extension towards the acceptance of the Japanese in the international community. When you are in the wrong, apologise, and we will get past it, and come out with a stronger relationship.<br><br>Instead, the hardcore nationalists there insist on obscuring the past (either they did that on purpose, or it is a result of their own delusions of Japan being a World War II victim  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ). Reading their history text books on Japan's role in World War II leaves me shaking my head. In fact, some of the untruths made my blood boil.<br><br>However, the past is past, we need to move on. Once Japan acknowledges its atrocities, we should seek to accept and forgive.<br><br>If Japan doesn't, then I am afraid we might be seeing even worse things than what is happening now, so worked up China and Korea are.</div>
