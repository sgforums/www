First, they started a long term preparation whereby students were systematically taught in schools to desire China's ShanTong Pears. The students were asked : Do you want Shanton pears. Psychologically, the whole generation were prepared to start a war ending with their fated invasion of China in WW II.<br><br>If one is to observe what has happened recently, their leaders' visiting of the war hero's shrine was not a chance occurrence. Re-writing of the textbook is a confirmation of the same nationalism to revive their military power.<br><br>Their active participation as an ally of US in the Iraq war is not an incidental act as well. This time, the Japanese will use both their economic power and with the help of US its military power to rule the world. The grand design of neo-Japanese Imperialism is unveiling...<br><br>All these moves are made subtly but steadily carried out. Let the US beware that the Japanese is on the war path slowly planning out the whole revival with their unwitting assistance and encouragement. Lately encouraged by US who needed Japan as partner in tackling terrorism, it is beginning to flex its military with more physical aggression.<br><br>If one is to care the Japanese actions in claiming islands in the China Sea, one will see more evidence of more deliberate attempt to use the war heros as rallying point to revive their past military aggressions.<br><br>This aggressive minds among their leaders are unspoken. Minds have now sharp and focused to manipulate their population in the Koitsumi era to shed their post war restraints. It is the unspoken minds of their leaders now that one can find all the future aggression and imperialism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

First, they started a long term preparation whereby students were systematically taught in schools to desire China's ShanTong Pears. The students were asked : Do you want Shanton pears. Psychologically, the whole generation were prepared to start a war ending with their fated invasion of China in WW II.<br><br>If one is to observe what has happened recently, their leaders' visiting of the war hero's shrine was not a chance occurrence. Re-writing of the textbook is a confirmation of the same nationalism to revive their military power.<br><br>Their active participation as an ally of US in the Iraq war is not an incidental act as well. This time, the Japanese will use both their economic power and with the help of US its military power to rule the world. The grand design of neo-Japanese Imperialism is unveiling...<br><br>All these moves are made subtly but steadily carried out. Let the US beware that the Japanese is on the war path slowly planning out the whole revival with their unwitting assistance and encouragement. Lately encouraged by US who needed Japan as partner in tackling terrorism, it is beginning to flex its military with more physical aggression.<br><br>If one is to care the Japanese actions in claiming islands in the China Sea, one will see more evidence of more deliberate attempt to use the war heros as rallying point to revive their past military aggressions.<br><br>This aggressive minds among their leaders are unspoken. Minds have now sharp and focused to manipulate their population in the Koitsumi era to shed their post war restraints. It is the unspoken minds of their leaders now that one can find all the future aggression and imperialism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>you are writing like a military analyst.  do you think that after having gone through so many wars (including the pearl harbour attack)  the americans will be so stupid to allow japan to re-arm and start imperialism all over again?  it is exactly your bias against the japanese that you see everything as a conspiracy.</div>

I am only trying to balance someone's ove-anxious defending of any views against Japanese's recent spats with its neighbouring countries but now I am being accused of stirring up things. Who was so anxious and put in the most views to fend off criticisms on Japanese recent aggressions every body should be able to see. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
