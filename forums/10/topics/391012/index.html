              <p><strong>By Choo Zheng Xi, Editor-at-Large</strong></p>
              <p>Why are Singaporeans unhappy, the PAP wonders.</p>
              <p>It is said that Singaporeans are a migrant stock. Coming and going, it’s in our blood. My own mother was born and raised in Hong Kong. She met my Singaporean father while he was helping out at my paternal grandmother’s restaurant in Kowloon in the early 80s. And then I was born.</p>
              <p>My parents brought me to Singapore in 1988, when I was three years old.</p>
              <p>Back then, there were only about 300,000 non-citizen residents in Singapore, out of 3 million people.</p>
              <p>All my mother’s blood relatives are still in Hong Kong, but we are Singaporean citizens now. We will always call Singapore our first home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still speak only Cantonese with my mother. She came here speaking very little English, but she now speaks decent English and Mandarin (though with a strong Cantonese accent), and some pasar Hokkien that she picked up along the way.</p>
              <p>My mother recently retired from her sales position at a 3-for-$10 stall near Raffles City where she happily worked for more than five years. She was tired of competing with the Mainlander that her boss had hired last year, who was willing to work longer for less money.</p>
              <p>Mum was hoping to quit after receiving the annual one-month Chinese New Year bonus. The bonus, which her boss usually pays along with her January wages, never came this year. Over the phone, she told me how relieved she was that I’d be starting work at a law firm later this year.</p>
              <p>Singapore now has more than 1.7 million foreigners out of 4.99 million people.</p>
              <p>My mother grew to love Singapore at a time when Singapore had more space to grow to love her.</p>
              <p>It scares me how little space Singaporeans have been left to integrate foreigners, and how visceral the xenophobic reactions are.</p>
              <p>Why are Singaporeans angry, the PAP wonders.</p>
              <p>Then there is my paternal granduncle. He was a bookish bachelor, and spoke a crisp Victorian English common among the English-educated of his time. He used to trundle down every weekend to the old National Library at Stamford Road, where he enjoyed reading everything from American thriller novels to Singaporean history books. He was such a loyal library member that the library used to send him commemorative coffee table books on their more significant anniversaries.</p>
              <p>He died a few years before they turned the Stamford Library into a tunnel. I guess in a way it was better he never found out, he would never have forgiven them.</p>
              <p>Why are Singaporeans angry, the PAP wonders.</p>
              <p>If our Ministers took crowded MRTs and buses, ate at neighborhood coffee shops, or worked as front line service staff, they might better understand Singaporeans’ anger.</p>
              <p>If they lived like us, ate like us — if they looked at us — they might know.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans aren’t inherently xenophobic or hateful, my family will be the first to attest. I trust that Singaporeans can remember a common humanity even as we condemn dehumanizing policies.</p>
              <p>But our country is changing so quickly that we now feel overwhelmed and displaced, angry, in a country which is becoming harder and harder to recognize.</p>
              <p>It is hard to believe the PAP doesn’t know why Singaporeans are angry, but what does our anger mean to them?</p>
              <p>Singapore is increasingly losing our physical and emotional space for love, and soon the only thing we will be able to call ours will be our Anger.</p>

              I know that living in Singapore are both expensive and hard. Even with what other people in States or Europe would call small fortune Singaporeans could only buy a relatively humbling property with that small fortune. everybody wants to own a car which is reasonable because a car gives you PRIVACY but the cost of a car is so expensive that I had a Singaporean whom I knew that took a five year lease on his brand new car . . .maybe he was kind of pushing it but it showed ho much Singaporean wanted their own car and privacy.
                                <br><br>
              But the worse of all having a government that builds a culture of fear and who are intolerable with dissenting and differing views and which tend to be arrogant and narcissistic.<br><br>
              The only reason why the government of Singapore haven't used the ISA for large number of Singaporean nowadays is that the typical Singaporean is already in JAIL.<br><br>
              Fear makes the smallest cell ever.<br><br>
              I stand from afar now but it looks like things have gone from bad to worse in the last decade for the common people of Singapore. I suggest those who value freedom to get out of the country altogether.
                                <br><br>
              Happy Chinese new year to you all. Persevere.

              That past has since long gone now. Singaporeans long time apathy towards politics have cost them dearly it seems now. Thanks to a govt which is paranoid about politics in the first place...I would be angry too if I were Singaporean looking at the inhibited influx of foreigners. . .my suggestion is if you can't stand it and can then get out. My guess is Singapore is in for a decline in the long term. The only way out is to rejuvenate the citizens to give them freedom which includes political freedom and real rule of law so that a vibrant happy society could thrive so that the engineers are happy being engineer, the artists are happy being artist, the dancers are happy being dancers, the writers are happy being writer. Of course the catch is not to descent into chaos after so long in bound.
              <br><br>
              Everything changes, the exact essence of time is change without which we cannot put a reference on it. The old ways will no longer work after a while, the old strategies cease being relevant, it is sad that Singapore govt is only interested in maintaining power and thus becomes a hindrance to progress itself. The irony is that they becoming a hindrance under the false pretense that it is being the main force of progress. The interests of the few or the one has or have beaten the interests of the many in Singapore. But makes no mistake that this actually will and already and will continuously hurt everybody in Singapore if the condition persists. It's a way when nature calls quit that worse and worse conditions starting to appear.

              <h1>Filipino FT facing competition from cheaper foreigners for limited jobs in Singapore</h1>

              <p>Singapore’s open door labor policy to foreign workers is causing intense hardship not only to Singaporeans, but to “foreign talents” who had arrived earlier.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Business Mirror interviewed a Filipino “foreign talent” who moved to Singapore nine years ago armed with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Mapua Institute of Technology in the Philippines who was retrenched last year and still looking for a job.</p>
              <p><em>“Until now, I’m still looking for a job. It’s been four months, and I’ve only had two interviews in this time. I think companies here give importance to the locals, but it’s the same in my country, so I can understand that,”</em> he lamented.</p>
              <p>Foreign workers made up more than one third of Singapore’s labor force, an indication of how dependent the Singapore economy is on foreigners.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, the relentless influx of foreigners over the last few years had depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Besides competing with Singaporeans, skilled labor like Luacan now has to face intense competition from other foreign workers who are willing to settle for less pay.</p>
              <p><em>“The market is spoilt. Some foreigners, from Burma, for example, are asking for a salary of S$2,000 (or some 50 percent less than the salary Rod expects for his qualifications, skills and years of experience),”</em> Luacan complained.</p>
              <p>Luacan should consider himself much more fortunate than Singaporeans. He can always pack his bags and return to the Philipines where the cost of living is much lower if he really cannot find a job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have no choice but to stay put and compete directly with the continued inflow of foreign migrant workers who are getting “cheaper”, but not necessarily better or faster.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Singapore males are hampered by their four week reservist obligations yearly unlike foreigners who are free from such restrictions and thereby more “attractive” to employers.</p>
              <p>Unlike other countries like Australia and Britain which are taking active measures to protect the livelihoods of their own citizens, the ruling party of Singapore continues to insist that foreigners are essential for the economy.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said lately that there will not be a sudden “turnaround” in the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy and the number of foreign workers may actually increase in the next few years.</p>

              <h1>Filipino FT facing competition from cheaper foreigners for
              limited jobs in Singapore</h1>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p><span>February 14, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Singapore’s open door labor policy to foreign workers is causing
              intense hardship not only to Singaporeans, but to “foreign talents”
              who had arrived earlier.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Business Mirror interviewed a Filipino “foreign talent” who
              moved to Singapore nine years ago armed with a Bachelor of Science
              degree from the Mapua Institute of Technology in the Philippines
              who was retrenched last year and still looking for a job.</p>
              <p><em>“Until now, I’m still looking for a job. It’s been four
              months, and I’ve only had two interviews in this time. I think
              companies here give importance to the locals, but it’s the same in
              my country, so I can understand that,”</em> he lamented.</p>
              <p>Foreign workers made up more than one third of Singapore’s labor
              force, an indication of how dependent the Singapore economy is on
              foreigners.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, the relentless
              influx of foreigners over the last few years had depressed the
              wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living,
              especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and
              led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Besides competing with Singaporeans, skilled labor like Luacan
              now has to face intense competition from other foreign workers who
              are willing to settle for less pay.</p>
              <p><em>“The market is spoilt. Some foreigners, from Burma, for
              example, are asking for a salary of S$2,000 (or some 50 percent
              less than the salary Rod expects for his qualifications, skills and
              years of experience),”</em> Luacan complained.</p>
              <p>Luacan should consider himself much more fortunate than
              Singaporeans. He can always pack his bags and return to the
              Philipines where the cost of living is much lower if he really
              cannot find a job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have no choice but to stay put and compete directly
              with the continued inflow of foreign migrant workers who are
              getting “cheaper”, but not necessarily better or faster.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Singapore males are hampered by their four week
              reservist obligations yearly unlike foreigners who are free from
              such restrictions and thereby more “attractive” to employers.</p>
              <p>Unlike other countries like Australia and Britain which are
              taking active measures to protect the livelihoods of their own
              citizens, the ruling party of Singapore continues to insist that
              foreigners are essential for the economy.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said lately that there will not be
              a sudden “turnaround” in the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy
              and the number of foreign workers may actually increase in the next
              few years.</p>
