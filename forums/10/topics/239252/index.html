            <div class='col-md body'>why they so like that? Well, this is one of the reasons:<br><br>Jakarta Post<br>Feb 26, 2007<br>By Huala Adolf, Bandung<br><br>The Indonesian government's attempts to coerce Singapore into signing an extradition pact have been met with a lukewarm response. Jakarta has used various means to push the island state to sign the treaty since the 1980s.<br><br>It has been widely reported that the sand export ban has been one of the means Jakarta has used to press Singapore to do it.<br><br>Using the sand export ban as a tactic to compel Singapore will be ineffective, or even backfire. Singapore's response that the ban was a "disappointment" indicates that this will continue to be the case.<br><br>Jakarta's expectation the extradition treaty will be signed is quite high. There is the expectation here that by signing the treaty, the assets of corrupt Indonesians being kept in Singapore can easily be returned home.<br><br>But is it true that the treaty would be a guarantee that this would happen?<br><br>One thing that is quite clear from Singapore's position is that the city state is always happy when the assets of its citizens, permanent residents or rich foreigners are saved in Singaporean banks, or invested in Singaporean property.<br><br>There is no data on the amount of money or assets owned by wealthy Indonesian being invested or saved in the city state. The true fact is that, to many corrupt Indonesians, Singapore has been a safe haven to hide their assets.<br><br>But we need to remember that the root of the problem is not the position of Singapore. The cool response of Singapore should not be regarded as showing that Singapore is not cooperative on this matter.<br><br>In fact, the root of the problem is at home. We should ask why the assets left Indonesia so easily, why official corruption is so rampant, and why enforcement is so weak.<br><br>There have been many cases where the suspects, despite having been arrested by law enforcement officers, have easily left the country.<br><br>Likewise, it is an open secret that a person banned from travelling out of the country can easily pass through many Indonesian ports to easily leave the country.<br><br>Another reason why the extradition treaty with Singapore will not be effective is those being targeted in anti-corruption efforts are mostly well-educated.<br><br>They are smart. Singapore is in fact not the only safe haven to conceal their assets. They could transfer their assets to any nation or foreign bank under their wife's, children's or relatives' names.<br><br>They could invest their money in a whole host of ventures, including buying shares or providing loans. They could even easily change their name on their passport.<br><br>There has been no convincing evidence that the extradition treaty will successfully return ill-gotten assets to Indonesia.<br><br>Indonesia has already signed a numerous bilateral extradition treaties with many countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong. There is no data to suggest the signing of these treaties has proven successful in bringing these assets back.<br><br>Another reason why an extradition treaty would not be easily effective is that it has to deal with the Singaporean legal system.<br><br>Even if the treaty does come into effect, the transfer of a criminal or suspect must first of all meet requirements for the transfer of prisoners set out in Singaporean law.<br><br>In this respect, the Singaporean executive must first get the approval of the Singaporean judiciary. As far as the Singaporean judicial system is concerned, the executive cannot interfere. This process should be understood by Jakarta.<br><br>An extradition treaty with Singapore will not be effective if the root problems of rampant corruption and weak legal enforcement are still out of control.<br><br>(The writer is lecturer in the Faculty of Law, University of Padjajaran, Bandung.)</div>
