            <div class='col-md body'>1)Respecting foriegner's in our own land and flooding foriegner's in our own land is two different thing.<br><br>2)By letting in more foriegners to fill up those jobs that local people don't want to work is different from letting in more foriegners to fill up jobs that locals want to work!<br><br>3)Knowing and accepting the truth that our accesstor came from China or India long ago when the British was still ruling Singapore, doesnt mean we Singapore are part of China or India.<br><br>4)When we invite our guests(foriegners) into our house(Singapore), we respect them and offer them our well wishes, but does that mean our house is open big big for them to come in and out as long as they wish?<br><br>5)By telling us that our accesstor came from China or India to Singapore and we must not forget our root, and now we must do the same thing, let them in in large numers so that our population can keep growing, is totally a different thing when most of them are here not to be part of Singapore but part of our Singapore jobs, not to love Singapore but to love our strong currency.<br>When our currency values drop, and rising costs keep on rising, even idiot will tell you foriegners are not to be trust than the locals.<br><br>6)Even those who are borned in Singapore but mother is from a foriegn country getting a PR, husband is from a foriegn country too and getting red ic,<br>can they be trust?Will they be loyal to our motherland?Nope is the answer as most of them can get back to their own country when one of their spouse still holding to their own country citizen.If worst come to worst, they can move all their families back to their country example Burma or China, because they got their families and home there, and no problem for them.This was told from one of my friend from Burma working in Singapore.But for us Singaporeans, what can we do?We can't go anywhere except die die must stay in Singapore, loyal to our home land because this is where we are born.<br><br>7)We need salt and pepper to spice up our food.We need abit of this and that ingredients to make our food taste better.But we don't need so many salt and pepper or else the orginal taste of the food will not be there anymore.Same as foriegn policy our government is making now.If the government is going to flood our land with all sorts of foriegner's without any strict rules to follow and did not balance the amount of them to the numbers of real locals people here,<br>our original Singapore culture or legacy will be gone in a matter of times.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">Finally, when we call ourselves Singaporeans, we mean it.We don't call it for fun.We don't call ourselves Indian or China when we are also Indian or Chinese.Why?Because we love ourselves as part of Singapore and being a Singaporeans.So, next time when you met someone who like to argue that please accept more foriengers into our society because we are part of them too.Our accestor came from there.We must flood our country with them because we need them.Please tell them we are Singaporeans with Singapore culture and we respect them doesnt mean we need to flood every corner of Singapore with them.<br><br>I hope to see more people debating here about flooding our little land with foriengers especially China PRC.The reason i aim at the China PRC most is because it's getting really serious in the current situation, i think i no need to elaborate you locals Singaporeans also can use your two eyes to see for yourselves. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Singapura!!!</div>
