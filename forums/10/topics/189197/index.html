            <div class='col-md body'>Clarke axed in Cabinet reshuffle<br><br>Charles Clarke has been sacked as home secretary as Tony Blair seeks to regain the initiative after a night of losses in English local elections.<br><br>He will be replaced by Defence Secretary John Reid. Margaret Beckett is the new foreign secretary, with Jack Straw becoming Commons leader.<br><br>John Prescott will stay as deputy prime minister but lose his department. Trade Secretary Alan Johnson gets education.<br><br>Labour came third in Thursday's polls, losing about 200 seats to the Tories.<br><br>The results, among the worst Labour has ever had in a local election, saw the party lose control of 18 local authorities.<br><br>CABINET RESHUFFLE<br>Foreign Secretary - Margaret Beckett<br>Home Secretary - John Reid<br>Education Secretary - Alan Johnson<br>Leader of the Commons - Jack Straw<br>Europe Minister - Geoff Hoon<br><br>Clarke defiant<br>Analysis: Heat on Blair<br>Reshuffle: At-a-glance<br><br>It has prompted the biggest reshuffle of Mr Blair's career, as he seeks to draw a line under the scandals that have rocked his government in recent weeks.<br><br>Mr Clarke's admission that he had lost track of 1,028 foreign prisoners is thought to have been particularly damaging on the doorstep.<br><br>Mr Blair said he was "sorry" to lose Mr Clarke but added: "I felt that it was very difficult, given the level of genuine public concern, for Charles to continue in this post."<br><br>Earlier, in a statement, Mr Clarke said he did not agree with the prime minister's judgement, but added he would remain loyal to the government when he returned to the backbenches.<br><br>Mr Prescott has also been accused of damaging the party after revelations about an affair with his diary secretary.<br><br>He will remain as deputy prime minister but will be stripped of many responsibilities. He will also continue as deputy leader of the Labour Party.<br><br>Trade Secretary Alan Johnson, a former postman and trade union leader, will replace Ruth Kelly as education secretary and Commons leader Geoff Hoon will become Europe minister.<br><br>Ms Kelly will take over many of Mr Prescott's government responsibilities, covering communities and local government.<br><br>The only senior minister to remain in his post is Chancellor Gordon Brown, who called the local election results a "warning shot", and said he would be speaking to Mr Blair over the weekend to plot the way ahead.<br><br>Conservative leader David Cameron said: "It will take far more than a reshuffle, what we need in this country is a replacement."<br><br>He said the Conservatives were "showing there is a broad-based alternative that is building while the government is collapsing".<br><br>Mr Cameron's party took control of 12 councils in Thursday's polls and gained 250 seats, although they failed to make hoped-for progress in Northern cities such as Manchester and Liverpool.<br><br>The Liberal Democrats failed to make predicted advances, gaining less than 20 councillors, but Sir Menzies Campbell insisted it was not a test of his leadership.<br><br>'Deckchairs on Titanic'<br><br>Some Labour backbenchers believe Mr Blair must go further than just overhauling his team.<br><br>Former Health Secretary Frank Dobson said a reshuffle would be like "rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic".<br><br>"Quite frankly we need the party under new management," said Mr Dobson.<br><br>If Thursday's polls had been held nationwide, the Tories would have gained 40% of the vote, Lib Dems 27% and Labour 26%. Turnout is estimated at 36% - down three points from 2004.<br><br>Among the smaller parties, the Greens have won 17 seats, with particular success in Norwich. The British National Party doubled its councillors, including winning 11 seats from Labour in Barking.<br><br>Some areas will not start counting their votes until later on Friday.<br><br></div>
