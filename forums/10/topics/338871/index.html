              <p>being posted so soon after someone's flight from sg, most would be able to link this thread to that case and with Chia used as a contrast.</p>
              <p>the question posted speaks for itself, asking forumers on their opinions on their own actions. atobe choose to reply with a taunt how then can this be considered well said?</p>

              <p>when dealing with people i usually believe in being more flexible but when it comes to myself and usually if it deals with personal beliefs i'm quite stubborn and have been know to be quite destructive.</p>
              <p>so what i can say is as long as i'm not forced into a corner i'm quite willing to sign. but if you're talking about taking everything away in exchange who would actually do so? even if i sign and get "freedom" do i still have the resources to enjoy my "freedom"?</p>

              just curious. does all the topics discussed here  have an ultimate motive or purpose? this is more of a point of view thing, so why not share your point of view on the action of Chia? Does everything have to be about anti PAP and PAP?
