              <div class="press_details_headline">Press Statement: Restriction on Chia Thye Poh lapse, 26 November 98</div>
              </div>
              <p>The Government has decided to allow
                  Chia Thye Poh's Restriction Order (RO) to lapse on 27 Nov 98. The
                  Internal Security Department had recommended this in Sep 98, and the
                  ISA Advisory Board had supported the recommendation.<br> <br> The Government has always adopted a measured and cautious approach to
                  Chia Thye Poh's case. Chia was moved from a prison to a home
                  environment of government half-way houses in 1982, when he was still
                  under detention.</p>
              <p>In 1989 Chia was released from detention and placed in
                  Restriction Orders (RO) to reside in Sentosa Island, where he was
                  allowed to move freely and receive visitors.</p>
              <p>In 1990 and 1992 this was
                  further relaxed to allow Chia to visit Singapore mainland daily, and
                  subsequently to reside on Singapore mainland.</p>
              <p>Since 1992, Chia's RO has
                  been renewed with progressively fewer restrictive conditions.</p>
              <p>This
                  allowed Chia in Aug 97 to go to Hamburg on a 1-year Hamburg Foundation
                  Scholarship.<br> <br> ISD has reported that Chia's conduct suggests he is unlikely to engage
                  in activities prejudicial to Singapore's security. Should Chia in
                  future re-involve himself in such activities, he will be dealt with
                  firmly under the law.<br> <br> <br> MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS<br> <br> 26 NOVEMBER 1998---end of quote</p>

              <p>Thats MHA fixed him ,making him stay long long inside.</p>
              <p>This is one of the explanations.</p>
              <p>I read a report interviewing him saying the same line of story below:</p>
              <p>He refused to sign a undertaking that he would not use</p>
              <p>violence after he would be released!!</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh</p>
              <blockquote>The other detainees were released eventually after they each signed a
              document promising to renounce violence and sever ties with the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Communist Party of Malaya" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Malaya">Communist Party of Malaya</a> (CPM).<sup id="cite_ref-mutalib_6-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh#cite_note-mutalib-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> However, he refused as he felt that signing such a document would imply
              that he was affiliated with the CPM and, in his own words:<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "to renounce
              violence is to imply you advocated violence before. If I had signed
              that statement I would not have lived in peace."</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh#cite_note-porter-2"><span>[</span>3</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh#cite_note-porter-2"></a></blockquote>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Did he put the priority right?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Lets assume it was his real reason that he refused to sign the undertaking.</p>
              <p>This made MHA extend his detention.</p>
              <p>(Lets say FBI catch a guy</p>

              Poh who was a BSS MP resigned from Parliament together with the other
              BSS MPs to take their struggle to the streets.<br> <br> Chia was therefore not an MP when he was arrested on 29 Oct 66. He had
              resigned from the office of MP to which he was elected to serve his

              arrested for his involvement in the CPM communist united front and to
              avert widespread unlawful demonstrations and violence.<br> <br> <br> MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</p>

              supported the recommendation.<br> <br> The Government has always adopted a measured and cautious approach
              to Chia Thye Poh's case. Chia was moved from a prison to a home
              environment of government half-way houses in 1982, when he was
              still under detention.</p>
              <p>In 1989 Chia was released from detention and placed in
              Restriction Orders (RO) to reside in Sentosa Island, where he was
              allowed to move freely and receive visitors.</p>
              <p>In 1990 and 1992 this was further relaxed to allow Chia to visit
              Singapore mainland daily, and subsequently to reside on Singapore
              mainland.</p>
              <p>Since 1992, Chia's RO has been renewed with progressively fewer
              restrictive conditions.</p>
              <p>This allowed Chia in Aug 97 to go to Hamburg on a 1-year Hamburg
              Foundation Scholarship.<br> <br> ISD has reported that Chia's conduct suggests he is unlikely to
              engage in activities prejudicial to Singapore's security. Should
              Chia in future re-involve himself in such activities, he will be
              dealt with firmly under the law.<br> <br> <br> MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS<br> <br> 26 NOVEMBER 1998---end of quote</p>

              <p>there is no island arrest. the definition of house arrest still holds, even if the boundary is an island. that's why in my very first post, i mentioned house arrest in sentosa.</p>
              <p>but whatever, they held him for a very long time, and that is for certain</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Chia
              Thye Poh, a political detainee for twenty-three years, was released conditionally on the 17th of May 1989. He now lives on the island of
              Sentosa. As a figure who evokes much interest, political or
              otherwise, an interview with him seems only appropriate in line with
              this issue's emphasis on political philosophy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> As such, here we have
              for you, a first hand, and exclusive insight into the life and ideals
              of the man himself. Chia Thye Poh, as a primary school student, had a
              taste of studying both in a Chinese as well as an English school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> His
              secondary education was obtained in Chinese High School.</strong></span> In 1958, he
              entered Nanyang University, majoring in physics. He was also
              vice-chairman of the university's Student Union. After graduation, he
              became a council member of the Guild of Graduates. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Chia then
              became a teacher. He taught in Chung Cheng High School for a short
              period before he went back to Nanyang University as a graduate
              assistant in the Physics Department. During this period, he was
              preparing to further his studies abroad.</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However, Operation Cold Store
              (Feb. 1963) and the subsequent Sept. 1963 general elections drastically
              changed the course of his life.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He stood for elections and won a seat
              under the banner of Barisan Socialis in the Jurong constituency.</strong></span> (At
              present, Barisan Socialis is integrated into the Worker?s Party). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The following
              interview with Mr Chia was carried out at his residence in Sentosa. The
              aim of the interview is to bring across a more distinct picture of Mr
              Chia?s ideals and aspirations. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Question: When did your political awakening begin and how did it begin? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Answer: My
              political awakening began when I was in Chinese High School. At that
              time, there was a strong anti-colonial movement in Asia and Africa. In
              Singapore, people were struggling for independence. And in Chinese
              schools, there was a feeling that Chinese education was discriminated
              against. There were incidents that Chinese school teachers were
              arrested and Chinese schools ordered to close down. These events raised
              the political consciousness of majority of students and I was one of
              them. We opposed the colonial education policy and later, became active
              in the struggle for independence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: What was/is your ideology? Has your years in detention altered your ideology? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: My
              ideology: to struggle for a fair, just and democratic society (freedom
              of speech, freedom of the press and more parliamentary representation
              for the people). When I was a parliamentarian, my close contact with
              the people, especially the lower income group, had strengthened my
              ideal. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My ideal has not been dampened after nearly 23 years under
              detention. In fact, prison life can only make a person more determined
              to fight against oppression and for a fair, just and democratic
              society.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: What are your current views regarding the running of Singapore? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Under the
              PAP rule, there is no genuine parliamentary democracy. In essence, it
              has been practising a one-party rule. </strong></span>It seems to want to remain as the
              sole, dominant party, with other small parties acting as marginal
              opposition and ?sparring partners? for new PAP MPs. The opposition
              parties will never be allowed to grow strong. Before past elections,
              potential opposition candidates had been arrested; so were some of the
              elected opposition MPs who were arrested after the elections. The GPC
              (Government Parliamentary Committee) feedback unit and introduction of non-elected MPs are merely improvements on the one-party rule. There
              is always the danger of one-party rule slipping into one-man rule, and
              worse still, into dynastic rule. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The PAP government does not like
              critical newspapers or publications, and is intolerant towards sharp
              criticisms. They seem elitist and arrogant, regarding themselves as the
              best and the most suitable to rule Singapore. And they rule it with
              iron-handed policies.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: What do you think of the opposition parties in Singapore? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: If the PAP
              itself laments the difficulties of getting good candidates for
              elections, one can imagine how much harder it is for the opposition
              parties to do the same. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opposition parties candidates risk not only
              loss of jobs, but also personal freedom.</strong></span> However, despite all
              difficulties, including little access to the media, the opposition
              parties had scored 37% of the popular votes in the last general
              election. To withstand the continual onslaught of the powerful PAP
              machinery and to make further headway, the opposition parties will need
              more co-ordinated efforts. They need to build up their branch
              organisations, so that, through their own network, party programmes and
              policies can be brought across to the people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: What kind of change would you like to see in Singapore? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: The last
              election shows that the people want more opposition members in the
              Parliament (37% popular votes went to opposition parties). However,
              there is only one opposition MP in the 81 seat Parliament. The
              discrepancies are too obvious and cry for correction. (In the 1963
              election, Barisan Socialis gained 33% of the popular votes, and there
              were 13 members in the 51 seat parliament). There should be
              proportionate representation of opposition voices in Parliament, so
              that there can be a real check and balance system. Basic human rights
              should be respected, the ISA (Internal Security Act) should be
              abolished. There should be freedom of speech and freedom of the press
              so that the people can have better access to information and can voice
              their feelings without fear. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: Do you feel that it is not essential to have the ISA? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: In 1955,
              when there was still a jungle warfare in Johor and the other states of
              Malaya, the PAP congress had adopted a resolution, calling for the
              abolition of Emergency Regulations. Yet, since its coming to power, it
              has never hesitated in using the ISA to arrest, detain and crush its
              opponents. The PAP government has openly stated that the ISA,
              periodical arrests and secret police are the mainstays for the security
              of the state. But, for a long time past, the situation in Singapore has
              been peaceful. And with other stringent laws well in place, the
              government is in fact more than amply equipped to deal with any
              security problem. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The ISA is a powerful weapon, but it is a remnant of
              the colonial rule. It tramples upon the basic human rights and hinders
              the progress of democracy.</strong></span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: What are
              your reasons for not leaving Singapore? If you could go into exile
              elsewhere at present, would you? If not, why not? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: In 1985,
              when the Home Affairs Minister said that the government allowed me to
              emigrate, my reply was that as I had been detained for nearly 20 years,
              the government should release me unconditionally, and not try to drive
              me out of my country. My stand on the issue has not changed and I have
              no intention of going into exile someplace else. My main concern is to
              achieve complete freedom. Whether a political prisoner should go into
              exile depends on whether he can contribute to the people's cause. It is
              the people?s struggle inside the country that can determine the course
              of events. And it is important for me to be close to the people and
              share their weal and woe. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: How is your life in Sentosa? Is it relatively comfortable? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My life in
              Sentosa is like an indefinite internal exile after 23 years under
              detention without trial. </strong></span>I am now under the restrictions of four
              conditions and am put under close surveillance in the island. Sentosa
              is a tiny island of 3.5 sq. km and a tourist resort with no residence.
              Thus, there are no provisions like shops for residential living. Most
              of my daily necessities have to be brought in by my family members.
              When I want to go to the mainland for medical check-up or a haircut, I
              have to apply for written permit from the ISD (Internal Security
              Department) and travel under escort. Sentosa, to me, is just like
              another prison. The scenery is good, but freedom is scarce. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Q: Do you see yourself being released unconditionally to the mainland? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A: I have
              never lost hope during me years under detention. I am confident that no
              matter how much difficulties I face, and how long it will take, the
              government will have to release me unconditionally one day. My struggle
              for personal freedom is not an isolated one. It is the people?s
              struggle for democracy. My partial release onto Sentosa is the result
              of collective effort. I hope that with continued support from the
              people, I can one day gain my complete freedom. </span></p>

              <p>and i don't think the small kids in school will be too pleased to learn more stuff in school. i remember i hate history in class. but than, i know about the racial riots and the communist parties, just that i didn't bother to dig deeper, cos i was lazy.</p>

              <p>I wonder why Lee Kuan Yew locked up Chia Thye Poh for so long, 32 years.</p>
              <p>Said Zahari locked up for 17 years only.</p>
              <p>Very strange.</p>
              <p>Did Chia Thye Poh posed such a great threat to Lee Kuan Yew's rule?</p>
