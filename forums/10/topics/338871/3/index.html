              <h1>The Long Nightmare, My 17 Years as a Political Prisoner of Lee Kuan Yew</h1>
              <p>by Said Zahari</p>
              <p><em>Said Zahari, formerly editor-in-chief of the Malay daily Utusan Melayu,
              was detained without trial in Singapore from 1963-1980. This is the
              second volume of his projected autobiographical trilogy and deals with
              the reasons why he was seen as a political threat, his sufferings in
              detention, his personal and political interactions with others involved
              both before and after his time in prison.
              Said Zahari has received the international Award for Press Freedom.</em></p>

              <p>in the first place, there is no need for the apology if he feels he is right - that's where the principle thing come in.</p>

              <p>why say sorry if you know you are right? afraid to go to jail..... that itself, is cowardice.</p>

              <p>Did Chia Thye Poh posed such a great threat to Lee Kuan Yew's rule?</p>

              <p>I wonder how such a man such as Lee Kuan Yew can come to power in the first place.</p>
              <p>Singapore last time mostly made up of dialect speaking chinese, this Lee Kuan Yew an ang moh educated fellow, can't even speak properly in dialect want to come and fight for chinese votes.</p>
              <p>Lim Chin Siong, Chia Thye Poh, these are chinese educated, dialect speaking politicians. The chinese voters can identify with them.</p>
              <p>Sad lah, all arrested jailed.</p>
              <p>It shows how much Lee Kuan Yew feared them.</p>
              <p>Now all the dialect suppressed, culture weakened.</p>
              <p>Sad.</p>
              <p><em>Operation Coldstore (sometimes spelled Operation Cold Store) was a security operation conducted by the government of Singapore in<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> February 1963</strong></span>, in which it arrested <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>at least 107 left-wing politicians and trade unionists</strong></span>, many of them were members of the political party Barisan Sosialis and the Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU).</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Coldstore">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...The 1963 state elections were the toughest and most critical the PAP ever faced in its history. Firstly, the PAP had already suffered two by-election defeats which reduced the number of their held seats in 1959 from 43 to 39. When the PAP expelled the pro-communist faction from within its ranks in 1961, this meant that 13 seat-holders had left the PAP and formed the Barisan Sosialis, reducing the number of seats the PAP held to 26 - holding a majority by just one seat.</p>
              <p>As with the 1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore, the Barisian Sosialis enagaged in a heated media campaign to sway voters, again with scathing attacks made by both sides. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, the Barisan Sosialis had already suffered a major blow as seven months before many of its members, including the secretary general Lim Chin Siong had been arrested and held without trial under Operation Coldstore...</strong></span></p>

              <p>Last time, I not anti-Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>But after I learned how this Lee Kuan Yew came to power, I really despise him.</p>
              <p>The thing that I despise the most about Lee Kuan Yew is that he suppressed the local culture of the chinese.</p>
              <p>So too bad, Lee Kuan Yew, you are nothing but a pile of shit to me.</p>

              <p><br> well, it depends on which angle you are looking at it.</p>
              <p>in the first place, there is no need for the apology if he feels
              he is right - that's where the principle thing come in.</p>

              <p>why say sorry if you know you are right? afraid to go to

              <p>the fact that if an apology is given inspite of one's personal
