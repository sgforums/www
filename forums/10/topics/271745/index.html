            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">The deplorable situation described has been the purposeful objective of LKY from Day ONE when his colleagues allowed him to take the PM's chair and accepted his Political Philosophy of - <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''Fill the stomach, and dull the mind.... ''</strong></span><br><br>During the 1950s, Singapore was still under Colonial Rule with not so many Singaporeans being without basic education, and making a living was not too difficult, with life was more leisurely with opportunities for anyone with the wit and resourcefulness.<br><br>Under those 1950s conditions, LKY would even venture to cry out so eloquently in the Legislative Assembly Debates April 27, 1955 : </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><blockquote><br>"But we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed... If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to right, and what it must know to be right... "<br><br>"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies - even those who do not subscribe to our views - as much(sic)constitutional rights as you concede yourself." </blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Even when Singapore was part of Malaysia, LKY had spoken so convincingly in the Malaysian Federal Parliament in Kuala Lumpur - especially when ultra-racist elements from UMNO manouvered to corner him : </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><blockquote><br>"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy?<br><br>That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views.<br><br>I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter.<br><br>If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion...<br><br>Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...<br><br>But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind." </blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Why will LKY change his views about democratic principles and individual freedom after Singapore was evicted from Malaysia in 1965 ?<br><br>It began with the shackling of student activists in the University of Singapore - Political Science Faculty, and its <span style="font-style: italic;">'Students' Political Society'</span> and the NUS Student's Union.
