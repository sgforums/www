I feel really disappointed whenever I hear them speak. They like to hang the words "we listen to the people" on their tongues, when in fact they don't. Everything my other frens throw at them are met with "I understand where you are coming from, BUT..."<br><br>Have you seen people who have suffered really badly? Have you understood the pains of those who were retrenched in the name of the greater good? I know of real life situations where our govt is bleeding money to Indian foreign talents coz they think we singaporeans can't match up to Indian foreign talents, and all these money are siphoned away by the indians to India. And becoz of these people (which I will tell you they are no foreign talent, I can beat any one of them in their work), a lot of Singaporeans lost their jobs.<br><br>The points is, it is useless to argue things with PAP supporters. I noticed that most of them enjoy using "I understand, but...", which literally means, "I don't want to hear about it. The govt is doing good things for you. So shut up". You guys simply don't understand the true pains of those who suffer in the name of the greater good.<br><br>At the end, what PAP is going to have is more anti-PAP citizens. Its a vicious cycle.<br><br>As for me, I AM an elite, coz I defeated all the young PAPs academically or career-wise. I wish them good luck in hankering for the MP post (part time job: 11k a month salary). I have no love for this country. I am a mercenary, all I care about is myself, to always beat the average, to always be the best, to consistently outperform the rest so that I don't need the govt. They can go ahead and brag about their small little kingdom of Singapore.</div></blockquote>So u r an elite.. Oh Really? Good luck to you.. go live yr little life in yr little Kingdom of Singapore as a slave also. There alot of people who is more mercenary than you.. at least you bother about our little country politics.<br><br>Good luck to you.</div>

Many people go into politics not to serve the people, but for the money. (That itself is very depressing).<br><br>A young PAP once asked me to join them, but I told him, if I cannot convince myself 100% that I am going in to serve the people, then I won't do it, coz I am just going to be another fake.
