I do not like traffic jams that are caused by street demos either; but I will tolerate them because one day, the reason for a street demo may actually be for something I believe in.</div>

Upgrading courses that train Singaporeans how to operate machinery that will clean roads more efficienctly than just using a broom will increase the productivity and allows employers to pay them better. FT can and will compete for jobs...that is a fact of globalisation. The way to respond to it is by increasing our competitiveness, not by ranting here.<br><br>Helping employed Singaporeans get a job cleaning the streets at $800 a month is still better than being unemployed. With job re-engineering and training, road sweepers can get up to $1k a month, according to a previous Straits Times report. It is not much, but it is better than relying on charity.</div>

The current leadership is being paid high pay for mediocre performance. I am being forced to pay for mediocre performance.<br><br>Take for eg, we have approx 20 ministers and on avg, they each earn 100k, our nation's bleeding an average of $2,000,000.00 a mth. And that's not counting the ministers of state and the MPs. Such a small country, so high costs.<br><br>You may talk about high pay = better integrity = less corruption, but, as one forumlite said, integrity is not to be talked about in money terms in the 1st place. Paying them high pay to ensure minimal corruption is akin to as the forumlite said, paying me during an examination to ensure I don't cheat. What logic is that?<br></div>
