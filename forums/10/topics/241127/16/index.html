Since when did I ask them to work for nothing? Your mentality is so- PAP. Take things to the extreme, and then say NO.<br><br>In the 1st place, is leading a nation something that is commercial and corporate? Why are we discussing serving the people or helping the people as a commercial or corporate perspective? I find this extremely degrading, and promotes all the wrong values for Singapore<br><br>Even our govt is promoting the paper chase, that only top notch 'talent' (I hesitate to use this, coz this is for god's sake, a government, NOT a corporation) can serve the nation. Whatever happen to those people who can relate better to the people, and thus able to bring the people forward collectively?<br><br>Again I state, that the term bleeding is used, because they are not worth that price. Name me achievements that are worthy of them. Go ahead. I am waiting for you to do that. Coz I am asking achievements for this bunch of people, NOT LKY's cabinet of the past.<br><br>Even in a corporation, is it necessary to have so many head of depts (20 ministers), 2 deputy CEOs (deputy PM), 1 CEO (1 PM), not to mention 1 MM, and 1 SM? If you want to run this nation as a corporation, then run it CORRECTLY. In every organisation, costs is an issue. If you want to hire more people, justify the costs first. Have they ever do this? Justifying why we need so many ministers (for a little dot of a country)<br><br><strong>and as for your example above, about Ms Yu Yingxi, here are my thoughts (and listen well). </strong>She MUST come back. Coz of her bond, she MUST honour it. Never mind whoever offered to break her bond, becoz as a person of integrity, she MUST honour it.<br><br>Again, I don't see anything to be proud of about her rejecting the buy-out, coz I think she should have that responsibility.<br><br>And you know why I said that? Coz I too was bonded, and I rejected an attempt to buy me out, coz the organization that gave me a scholarship had given me the opportunity for a university degree, and I SHOULD repay that debt.<br><br>You made the above sound SO honourable, when in fact, she SHOULD behave like that.<br><br>And please, Ng Eng Hen. I remembered he said "I work 10 times harder than a surgeon and paid 10 times less". Do you know what that means? If you use your head, (assuming work hours) it means that in a 24 hour day, divide by 10, a surgeon only works 2.4 hours a day. And that's assuming he is working 24 hours. Do you honestly believe that? Just coz he said it?<br><br>Either you or someone else in this forum called us Singaporeans who question the govt as a bunch of idiots. I find this statement more relevant to those who accept whatever the govt says, without even questioning it.<br><br><strong></strong></div>

Ms Yu is paid Â£50k to work in uk. whilst it's better than most grad there, it is by no means a `fantastic' pay. in UK, the cost of living and all else taken into consideration, it's an alright situation to be in. it's frivolous and naive to compare pay scale in isolation and then apply it in context of SG.<br><br>Ms Yu is smart to return home becos she now has the upper hand in the way things turn out for her. If there are naive civil service bosses who thinks like you and then give her a better than market rate pay here in sg becos of her S$150k pay package, then i `salute' those chaps for their `dumbass' reasonings, much like yours...</div>
