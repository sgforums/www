            <div class='col-md body'>I am glad that you are willing to explain yourself more, since this is going to be a more fruitful discussion<br><br>I am toning down my stance here, not coz I am fully agreeing to what you say but just to elaborate more on why I call myself an elite.<br>1) I am from NUS, and I am the type of Singaporean who likes to take the modules that he is interested in, NOT those that he can score in. And yes, I do score in my modules<br>2) I never liked the NUS University Scholars Programme. To me, it is an elitist programme, when they should be focusing more on helping the weaker students, like what my group of people did, on a PERSONAL basis.<br>3) I met several young PAPs, that had that sort of elitist attitude. Since I can beat them in whatever they do, so I call myself an 'elite'.<br><br>I am not against foreign talents. Personally I think the concept is right (my wife is a FT), but I just wish the govt learn how to selectively bring in foreign talent, and not just anybody they can find<br><br>You may be a good FT, but there are many out there (many I have encountered), that are treating this place as a stepping stone to another place. And when that happens, I don't like it, coz we are being taken for a ride.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Hamiltonian1125:</div><div class="quote_body">For a foreigner who stay in spore for more than 15 years I believe I DO understand sporean mindset. While it is true that some sporean are really much better than FT( really much better) and some FT are like "sheat", majority of the sporean I noe esp the young ones only knows how to take short cuts....and stupid short cuts....examples in nus, no no dun take this module, sure kena owned by PRC one----&gt;this show young sporean has no fighting spirit. In NS esp the clerks (bleddy jc students)--- why we care, only clerk mah...no need waste time how to do my job better----&gt;Show that young sporean bu qiu shang jing!<br><br>Btw even if statistic is manupulated...it do show more truth than u saying"oh I know that we are much better than FT...because I hav this fren ..that fren etc..." lame...I can do the same things ...words without figures are cheap.<br>I do understand ur frustration abt UR govt favouring the FT....Since spore population is so small, there is no doubts that U ppl need FT to bring success to ur nation...if u ppl are so "elite", how come nus ntu  researchers and profs are mainly made up of FT? Stop claiming urself to be elite...personally I tink u need some humble pies <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote></div>
