Look at some of the old opposition candidates for example. Its just one of their many strategies to ensure most voters can't get to vote:<br>(1) GRC tactic<br>(2) Lawsuits against the opposition to intimidate the opposition<br>(3) Change boundaries to ensure opposition can't contest in the SAME ward if that ward in previous election was nearly lost to opposition<br><br></div></blockquote>Do i count as a hardcore supporter??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>1) GRC is a multi racial initiative to prevent people from voting blindly against the other races if they complete in Single seats. As some people do vote only for chinese MP, It help to make it more fair. AS other races are smaller in size.<br><br>GRC consist of at least one or two other races MP. So its help to vote for them as a group to discrimate against other races. Opposition had also field alot of teams in GRC this time round so it is an non-issue. Must debunk the myth mah..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2) No la.. i never see Chiam See tong or Mr Low got any lawsuits against them as they never say anything wrong.
