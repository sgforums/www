Other times, they may get into more detail, but you can't assume all of them are shallow. Maybe there are those who forever in this forum only give one or two liner comments, fine, they may be shallow, but not everyone is. I know you feel frustrated about being flamed, but like i said, this is how the forum works, and it's not right to ask people to shut up, just ignore them and continue writing, that's the best thing to do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My apologies, i have been absent for a while.<br><br>Originally posted by Freakass:<br><br><blockquote>Selecting the government for a country is not as simple as "why should we not give the alternatives their chance?"... This is not like a job where you can try to employ a fresh grad with no experience and if he messes everything up, you fire him like nothing has happened before. The consequences for electing the wrong government is fatal and irreversible. A strong presence of opposition parties is preferable because it will force the ruling government to improve and keep up... However, to elect an opposition party as a new government is a big bad move. What they have is simply empty promises and lack of governing experience. Like I always say, a good movie critic may not make a good movie director. </blockquote>LetÂ’s forget the last 40 years and review the last 10 for a moment. What achievements have the government produced?<br><br>Micropolis turned out to be an expensive tuition fee, Marina Bay re-naming exercise turned out to be another example. WeÂ’ve had relative inflation of approximately 7-15% spanning 10 years but our wages have barely adjusted to match. Transportation costs have gone up and if the recent one is approved (formality), that will be the 3rd increase in 4 years.<br><br>Cost of living is skyrocketing and the ruling party seems content to provide a superficial budget to offset the upcoming GST hike, which coincidentally lines up nicely with the next election.<br><br>With the country suffering from monetary hikes, our ministers ironically sees fit to up their own salary.<br><br>Could a new party with fresh ideas be a Â‘big bad moveÂ’? Should we simply accept the aging MIW machine as the ONLY alternative?<br><br>It is simply not enough to just Â‘manageÂ’ the country; there must be value-add. When we were 3rd world and politics of the day were needed, then yes, it was indeed an achievement just to provide housing, a job that puts food on the table and basic infrastructure to develop the country. ItÂ’s time to see past history and re-evaluate our needs today.<br><br>We need people who are willing to think out of the box, to try new ideas and not just throw money at the problem and hope it vanishes. The party whip ensures the members toe the line; so how is this effective in voicing concerns? Even MPs like Tan Soon Khoon who spoke passionately were taken to task and had the yokes tightened around their necks. Charles Chong was reprimanded for his role in the Buangkok white elephant incident, one of the few who chose to act by crossing the line, but most are too afraid of the consequences.<br><br>One can only pretend to have Â‘preceivedÂ’ opposition in parliament, and using your own party to Â‘createÂ’ the opposition is a sham. More alternative voices in parliament is certainly a welcome slate; but so long as the number remains a minority, little can be accomplished.<br><br><blockquote>The government has explained time and time and time, over and over and over again the reasons for the GST hike. It's just that you people don't accept the explanations and insist that there is something more behind the screen... </blockquote>I certainly doubt the explanations Tharman provided because as a politician, he chose to speak on the merits of the GST hike, but avoided other options that could reduce pressure on the peopleÂ’s income and gave a benign excuse that corporate tax was being reviewed to offset the hike.<br><br>What alternatives were explored before they decided on the hike? Did he even bother to discuss them?<br><br>Most of his time was spending slamming the alternatives, with typical and dismissive Â‘do-your-homeworkÂ’ responses which are becoming the trademark rhetoric.<br><br><blockquote>How sure are you about the "perform equally well" part? We can't take chances you know. Let me repeat again. We're talking about the government of a country and not anything else where a trial period is permissible.</blockquote>You prefer to Â‘deal with the devil you know than one who is a strangerÂ’?<br><br>We took the plunge with the ruling party once. Are we so insecure that we are afraid to take another one? Which is precisely what we have become Â– domesticated sheep. If we want to make a difference, then we should dare to choose.</div>
