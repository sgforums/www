I don't know if Singaporeans are really better off from the restructuring, maybe some are, I only know that I am not among them. But I do not go cursing the government, because I still have my life, my home, my family, my health, and I am grateful for what I have. I am only poorer in this millennium than I was in the 1990's. I was driving a car then, now I ride a motorcycle.

These flats are then sold to Singaporeans at [b]cost</strong> price.<br><br>For the Singapore citizen, his flat is "something substantial" that he owns and has to pay instalments for.<br><br>"So he must have a job. If you change the government, you have no jobs, the house is taken back," Mr Lee said.<br><br>And as the flats become old after 20 to 30 years, the government upgrades the buildings, subsidising 80 per cent of the cost.<br><br>"suddenly, overnight your property goes up in value. Now you find another government that will do that. If you think you can, you try," he said.<br><br>The Americans try to prescribe democracy by saying governments should allow free association, demonstrations and free press, he said.<br><br>"Here you want to hold a demontration, you must have a permit first."<br><br>As for his critics who say he is authoritarian, Mr Lee had this reply:"I say,'never mind'.<br><br>"Do they vote for me? Do i stuff the ballot boxes? No. Is it a secret vote? Yes. Do i win?<br><br>"Do i win 99 per cent? No. I win by 61 or 65 or 67 per cent."<br><br>The highest percentage of votes he ever won was 88 percent, he recounted.<br><br>"That was the year the British decided to get out and sell everything. So i immediately held an election. i knew the people will be dead scared."<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I don't believe him.<br><br>Ask him to die first.<br><br>Then we will know if we can't live without him.<br><br>Hehehe.........</span></div>
