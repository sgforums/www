I also got flamed a couple of times previously, because my views were unpopular and people were biased against me because of that, i talked about the die hard anti-pap before, how they 'attack' those who go against their views...but it's how the forum works, if people themselves change their attitude then you will also see a change in the forum, but if people remain the way they are, things around here will still be the same. </div></blockquote>Your comments in this thread have not much contribution to this thread, honestly. What you did previously are one-line or 2-liners, or to make direct attacks at me.<br><br>I don't mind, coz I am not offended by what you do. However, I don't think your posting have made any expression of your views or opinions. IF that's the case, why do you post anyway?<br><br>I am making actual points on why I am so upset with the govt. Why don't you look at those points and talk about that, instead of making direct attacks? That's the point of this thread, not targeted insults or sarcastic remarks at other people</div>

It was vital in the early years, to ensure that the idea of affirmative racial representation is put into the hearts and minds of the electorate. However, one should ask if we still need artificial race quotas that inadvertantly hinder any chances of a national melting pot.<br><br>This in theory is good, but it hampers free elections through politics of the incumbent and does not act in an affirmative way that allows for fair representation given that the GRCs are seen to be used in a package deal where you throw in a minister or two, and it feeds on the "branding" of the minister to get the electorate's support.<br><br>Futhermore, a walkover is likely to happen because the GRC element coupled with strict political funding regulations and the climate of local politics mean that the recruitment of candidates by other political parties is hindered, thus developing a lop-sided field where the number of representatives required per voting district is too large and too costly for the other parties to afford to contest.<br><br>It is not as simple as to ask why they do not contest, one has to take into account the entire socio-political climate, structure and numbers of potential candidates who may be deterred by this seemingly rocky playing field.</div></blockquote>True.. anyway the political climate in SG is always unfair..</div>
