            <div class='col-md body'>Abstract from The Straits Time wednesday March 7 2007<br><br>Singapore's brand of democracy works because the Government gives the country's citizens every reason to vote for it at elections, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said yesterday.<br><br>The country has maintained the principal of British democracy, that the electorate can vote a government out peacefully.<br><br>"But we have engineered it so carefully that they must be very stupid to vote this government out" he added.<br><br>The government solved the housing problem by building public housing using Central Provident Fund(CPF) money. These flats are then sold to Singaporeans at <strong>cost</strong> price.<br><br>For the Singapore citizen, his flat is "something substantial" that he owns and has to pay instalments for.<br><br>"So he must have a job. If you change the government, you have no jobs, the house is taken back," Mr Lee said.<br><br>And as the flats become old after 20 to 30 years, the government upgrades the buildings, subsidising 80 per cent of the cost.<br><br>"suddenly, overnight your property goes up in value. Now you find another government that will do that. If you think you can, you try," he said.<br><br>The Americans try to prescribe democracy by saying governments should allow free association, demonstrations and free press, he said.<br><br>"Here you want to hold a demonstration, you must have a permit first."<br><br>As for his critics who say he is authoritarian, Mr Lee had this reply:"I say,'never mind'.<br><br>"Do they vote for me? Do i stuff the ballot boxes? No. Is it a secret vote? Yes. Do i win?<br><br>"Do i win 99 per cent? No. I win by 61 or 65 or 67 per cent."<br><br>The highest percentage of votes he ever won was 88 percent, he recounted.<br><br>"That was the year the British decided to get out and sell everything. So i immediately held an election. i knew the people will be dead scared."<br><br></div>
