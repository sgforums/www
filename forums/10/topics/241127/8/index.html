I feel really disappointed whenever I hear them speak. They like to hang the words "we listen to the people" on their tongues, when in fact they don't. Everything my other frens throw at them are met with "I understand where you are coming from, BUT..."<br><br>Have you seen people who have suffered really badly? Have you understood the pains of those who were retrenched in the name of the greater good? I know of real life situations where our govt is bleeding money to Indian foreign talents coz they think we singaporeans can't match up to Indian foreign talents, and all these money are siphoned away by the indians to India. And becoz of these people (which I will tell you they are no foreign talent, I can beat any one of them in their work), a lot of Singaporeans lost their jobs.<br><br>The points is, it is useless to argue things with PAP supporters. I noticed that most of them enjoy using "I understand, but...", which literally means, "I don't want to hear about it. The govt is doing good things for you. So shut up". You guys simply don't understand the true pains of those who suffer in the name of the greater good.<br><br>At the end, what PAP is going to have is more anti-PAP citizens. Its a vicious cycle.<br><br>As for me, I AM an elite, coz I defeated all the young PAPs academically or career-wise. I wish them good luck in hankering for the MP post (part time job: 11k a month salary). I have no love for this country. I am a mercenary, all I care about is myself, to always beat the average, to always be the best, to consistently outperform the rest so that I don't need the govt.

            <div class='col-md body'>I want to put in a few more points.<br><br>(1) The govt says we overdepend on them. We should do things ourselves<br>Ans:<br>How much is each of them paid? They are paid more than most other political figures in other countries.<br><br>I give you an analogy. If I stay in a 3 star hotel, obviously a lot of things I would do it myself, since I do not expect much service in a 3 star hotel.<br>it is DIFFERENT, if I stay in a 5/6 star hotel. They MUST provide excellent service, otherwise why do I pay them for?<br><br>Similarly, our govt is paid too much. Thus expectations increase. Simple as that. They brought it upon themselves<br><br>(2) The govt says 2% GST is for the poor, then immediately talks about increasing pay for ministers<br>Ans:<br>Do you really believe that Singaporeans will trust them after this fiasco? It looks more like paying the 2% GST to them<br><br>(3) The govt is quick to praise themselves when the economy is good, but is quick also to lay blame on others when the economy is bad.<br>Look carefully at what is going on. During recent years when economy is good, the GLOBAL economy is ALSO GOOD. So what is so great about their performance?<br>During bad economy, they are quick to lay blame on the global economy.<br>If they can generate a positive 1% growth during a global recession period, then I say they ARE GOOD.<br>Otherwise, they ARE MEDIOCRE.<br>And I don't like to pay for Mediocre performance<br><br>(4) MPs are parttimers, they have their own full-time jobs. Their MP pay is $11k/month.<br>I ask you, is taking care of the people's needs SO SIMPLE that they can do it PART-TIME? So the country is not impt, since you can do it part-time.<br>Look at your contract clause when you sign a job with the govt agencies or stat board. In it there's a clause that says that you cannot take up another job when you are doing this job, as you must focus fully on your job.<br><br>Isn't this DOUBLE-STANDARDS? So MPs can do two jobs?<br><br>Since you PAP supporters are so quick to say we are stupid, and we don't know the good of the govt, why don't u answer the points above?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh one more point, since someone said there might be PAP people in this forum.<br><br>Next time, ask the media NOT TO FILM the parliament proceedings, since they catch on camera hilarious moments when you see our MPs sleeping during the session. It is SO EMBARASSING<br><br>We pay them 11k/mth to fall asleep in the parliament?<br><br>See? Now we know why Moonlighting is prohibited in contracts. The MPs are too tired. Should not have them in parliament since they can't fully focus on their jobs, as they are too tired in their day jobs.</div>

Employers are not stupid and businesses are not charities. Singaporeans lose jobs because they cannot compete with foreigners who can do the same job for less money. That's why Singaporeans have to move up the food chain.<br><br>If you cannot compete, you lose out. That is just the facts of life.<br><br></div>
