I can do that too!!! Increase GST so that we can have more reserves; bring in more cheap FT so that they can depress our wages; make public housing expensive so that the serfs will end up working all their lives and not retire; increasing their own salary so as to "retain" talents.<br><br>The government based it's growth on the Solow's model of output with capital, like all models diminishing returns sets in as the capital stock increases. There is an optimum level of capital in any economy, this is when having too much of a good thing is a bad thing.<br><br>Price level is always sticky downwards, the government knows that the citizens would not decrease their expectations unless threatened with foreign workers. If you have always received $2,000 for salary, would you ever asked for $1,200? A company not doing well in it's sales will most often reduce it's production force rather than reducing price. Unless you are faced with other competing forces, that's why they imported so many FT, to depress the wages of Singaporeans to make wages cheap. But doing so means that we are no different from China and India, our labour force is unique, we should not import so much cheap foreign labour to depress our wages, our infrastructure and work ethics should be the main selling point.<br><br>Increasing GDP does not reap any benefits for the citizens. A GDP per capita is just the total production of the domestic economy divided by it's population. If the total economy produces a GDP of $1,000,000 with a labour force of 100, the GDP would be $1,000, but these workers could be making $100 of the GDP(which is way below the GDP), the increases in the total GDP does not benefit the workers. More often the extra GDP goes to the company in the form of extra profits. With the current trend of suppressing wages through the use of "foreign talents",  I guess whatever GDP increases would be useless. GDP is not a measure of the citizen's living standard or wealth.<br><br>Look at the whole country? It's depressing! Money going away bit by bit? Are you one of the "peanuts" guy? You have extended the meaning of "peanuts" from a few millions to afew billions.<br><br>Mee Siam Mai Hum!!!</div>

There is obvious lack of transparency in their goal to implement the GST hike. Alternatives in parliament have been brushed aside with arrogant disdain without so much as a proper explanation over their actions.<br><br>Claims by Goh Chok Tong that the party whip would be lifted to allow ruling party members to speak freely were silenced by Wong Kan Seng and the (in)famous 'retraction' by Goh; in parliament, these same party members offer subdued issues for discussion, none of them pressing home the real problem. Lip service is being paid far more with empty promises.<br><br>All this while they audaciously toss about the idea of upping the wages of cabinet ministers concurrently with the topic of GST hike, to the obvious chargrin of the people.<br><br>Will anyone 'cry' if the ruling party is voted out? With the gap in broad-based education standards reduced, it is more than likely an alternative party could perform equally well, if they were given a chance.</div>

Are our University not producing enough ??<br><br>While the govt can use foreign talents to suppress the income level of the general population, we are unable to USE foreign talent to replace our minister. That doesn't seem quite right, isn't it ? Perhaps we need to replace some of our highly paid for nothing ministers with foreign talents so that we do not have to increase GST to pay their ultra high salary.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think using Foreign talents to rule our country is a right decision. These is our country, only ppl who are born here will understand the needs of the ppl. But though you are right that the minister some ppl are really good for nothing but doesn't mean foreign talent will be any better. The result for minister to claim such high pay is that becos civil servant are not suppose to have their own business.. So they won't proft by using their power in the ministry. But i still think the minister pay are too high if they can't do anything.. What they do best to drain our money and put into their pocket. If really Singapore government wanna earn more money I suggest to cut cost.. In a healthy manner</div>

So how did the educational scene here become so bad that these students think they are losers? Because they were striving to be the privileged elites, not striving for the best education they can get. Being well schooled to get A's is not the same as being educated. Education arms you with a mindset to learn for the rest of your life, not a piece of paper entitling you to elite privileges.  Education is part of the political picture. Note how PAP uses it to advance its agenda?<br></div>
