            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by (human):<br><strong>Abstract from The Straits Time wednesday March 7 2007<br><br>Singapore's brand of democracy works because the Government gives the country's citizens every reason to vote for it at elections, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said yesterday.<br><br>The country has maintained the principal of British democracy, that the electorate can vote a government out peacefully.<br><br>"But we have engineered it so carefully that they must be very stupid to vote this government out" he added.<br><br>The government solved the housing problem by building public housing using Central Provident Fund(CPF) money. These flats are then sold to Singaporeans at [b]cost</strong> price.<br><br>For the Singapore citizen, his flat is "something substantial" that he owns and has to pay instalments for.<br><br>"So he must have a job. If you change the government, you have no jobs, the house is taken back," Mr Lee said.<br><br>And as the flats become old after 20 to 30 years, the government upgrades the buildings, subsidising 80 per cent of the cost.<br><br>"suddenly, overnight your property goes up in value. Now you find another government that will do that. If you think you can, you try," he said.<br><br>The Americans try to prescribe democracy by saying governments should allow free association, demonstrations and free press, he said.<br><br>"Here you want to hold a demontration, you must have a permit first."<br><br>As for his critics who say he is authoritarian, Mr Lee had this reply:"I say,'never mind'.<br><br>"Do they vote for me? Do i stuff the ballot boxes? No. Is it a secret vote? Yes. Do i win?<br><br>"Do i win 99 per cent? No. I win by 61 or 65 or 67 per cent."<br><br>The highest percentage of votes he ever won was 88 percent, he recounted.<br><br>"That was the year the British decided to get out and sell everything. So i immediately held an election. i knew the people will be dead scared."<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>so is it true that no PAO no survival for singaporeans?   hey, the winning percentage of PAP has been dropping, so??!!!<br><br>what they do for the nation sometimes (if not all times) cause people to question how sincere they are in helping singaporeans.  Just this week, a relative's wife gave birth.  he said what the baby bonus is about is just crap as he needs to pay before the govt will give him the $$ for the baby bonus.  Eg, if you deposit $500 in the account, the govt gives you $500 and if you deposit $100, the govt gives you $100.  Wa, must pay before get the baby bonus.

Why find an excuse to doubt them?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Selecting the government for a country is not as simple as "why should we not give the alternatives their chance?"... This is not like a job where you can try to employ a fresh grad with no experience and if he messes everything up, you fire him like nothing has happened before. The consequences for electing the wrong government is fatal and irreversible. A strong presence of opposition parties is preferable because it will force the ruling government to improve and keep up... However, to elect an opposition party as a new government is a big bad move. What they have is simply empty promises and lack of governing experience. Like I always say, a good movie critic may not make a good movie director. </span><br><br>Cost of living is soaring, with no apparent attempt by the ruling party to bring it down. There is obvious lack of transparency in their goal to implement the GST hike. Alternatives in parliament have been brushed aside with arrogant disdain without so much as a proper explanation over their actions.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The government has explained time and time and time, over and over and over again the reasons for the GST hike. It's just that you people don't accept the explanations and insist that there is something more behind the screen... </span><br><br>Claims by Goh Chok Tong that the party whip would be lifted to allow ruling party members to speak freely were silenced by Wong Kan Seng and the (in)famous 'retraction' by Goh; in parliament, these same party members offer subdued issues for discussion, none of them pressing home the real problem. Lip service is being paid far more with empty promises.<br><br>All this while they audaciously toss about the idea of upping the wages of cabinet ministers concurrently with the topic of GST hike, to the obvious chargrin of the people.<br><br>Will anyone 'cry' if the ruling party is voted out? With the gap in broad-based education standards reduced, it is more than likely an alternative party could perform equally well, if they were given a chance.<br><br><span style="color: red;">How sure are you about the "perform equally well" part? We can't take chances you know. Let me repeat again. We're talking about the government of a country and not anything else where a trial period is permissible.</span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Our PM salary is even higher than that of US president. Why is that so ? To fight corruption ?? To prevent corruption by paying super high salary?? I would rather have a few corrupt minister and give more power to the PEOPLE to watch over them than to have the govt raising GST so as to pay THEMSELVES SUPER HIGH SALARY. That is akin to LEGALSING CORRUPTION in a sort of ways.<br><br>Th<span style="color: green;">is is so damn funny.. Your argument is very very distorted...</span><br><br>Even CHINA, with it's corrupt practices and chaotic business world, offers more opportunities than Singapore. One suggestion is that we pay our minister by the land area of the country they manage. That should keep them in perspective than OUR COUNTRY is damn small. We do not need so many minister that waste taxpayers money and ministers that failed to empathise with the general wage earners in sngapore.<br><br><span style="color: green;">You cant compare opportunitites between China and Singapore. I dont wish to elaborate further on this. I will sound so stupid. I'm surprised that a university student like you don't even understand this. </span><br><br>We also need to put them to perspective that while we do indeed need foreign talents to grow and supplement our workforce, we should have a more discretionary policy to pick those talents that we need instead of opening the floodgate to the masses. Do we need so many PRC engineers or Indian engineers ? Are our University not producing enough ??<br><br><span style="color: green;">Our government is susidising hell of a lot of school fees for university students like you, give you opportunites for overseas industrial attachment... and come come back to Singapore to criticize the government (and in such a low standard kind of argument some more).. So we dont have enough local engineers... </span><br><br>While the govt can use foreign talents to suppress the income level of the general population, we are unable to USE foreign talent to replace our minister. That doesn't seem quite right, isn't it ? Perhaps we need to replace some of our highly paid for nothing ministers with foreign talents so that we do not have to increase GST to pay their ultra high salary.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I realised tht in this entire reply, you have mentioned many times about the high salary about the local ministers... and you would rather have a corrupted government instead...

In the past, PAP always have around 85% votes, but this has dropped to 66%. With the current policies, the next election will mean more votes for opposition. If they had not given out "progress package" this time around, I think the losses would have been more substantial.</div>
