            <div class='col-md body'>Russia's Ivanov Backs Arms Treaty Delay<br>34 minutes ago<br><br>By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer<br><br>MOSCOW - Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Wednesday that he supported legislators' attempts to postpone ratification of a key U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control treaty.<br><br>Ivanov stressed that he was not withdrawing support from the agreement, called the Treaty of Moscow, only that he felt it was not the right time for a vote with war going on in Iraq (news - web sites).<br><br>"Maybe now is not the right moment psychologically to bring this document up for ratification," Ivanov said.<br><br>"If we wait for some time, and concentrate all our efforts on ending the war and switching over to a political settlement (of the Iraq crisis), then at a more quiet moment we can quickly deal with this issue," Ivanov told legislators in the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council.<br><br>He said that the war, which Russia vehemently opposes, could lead to irrelevant issues clouding the ratification debate.<br><br>"This treaty answers Russia's interests. The Foreign Ministry believes that this document should be ratified and we will present it for a ratification," Ivanov said.<br><br>The treaty, signed in May by Russian President Vladimir Putin (news - web sites) and President Bush (news - web sites), calls on both nations to cut their strategic nuclear arsenals by about two-thirds, to 1,700 to 2,200 deployed warheads, by 2012.<br><br>The U.S. Senate unanimously approved the treaty earlier this month. The move was widely seen as part of a diplomatic effort to win Russian support for a tougher line against Iraq. But Moscow has only hardened its position.<br><br>U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow said Wednesday that Washington hopes Moscow won't drag out the ratification, the Interfax news agency reported. It quoted Vershbow as saying the rift over Iraq had led to "serious tension" in bilateral relations but adding that both Bush and Putin had agreed to work to minimize the damage.<br><br>The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had been expected to take up debate on the treaty last week, but it indefinitely postponed a ratification vote because of the threat of an imminent U.S.-led attack on Iraq.<br><br>The treaty is considered more advantageous to Russia than the now-defunct START II agreement, which specifically banned Russia from deploying land-based missiles with multiple warheads.<br><br>The new deal leaves it to each nation to decide which weapons it will scrap. That will allow Russia to keep its Soviet-built multi-warhead SS-18 and SS-19 missiles at the core of its nuclear arsenal.<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=518&amp;ncid=721&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20030326/ap_on_re_eu/russia_us" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=518&amp;ncid=721&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20030326/ap_on_re_eu/russia_us</a></div>

The Foreign Ministry delivered a statement of protest to the U.S. Embassy, accusing Washington of Cold War tactics.<br><br>"We have asked the U.S. to explain to us the need for such flights," the Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as saying. "The U.S. says such flights are necessitated by the fight against terrorism on Georgian territory. We cannot accept these explanations ... and will not accept them."<br><br>A senior U.S. diplomat said Washington had informed Moscow in advance about plans to conduct reconnaissance flights over Georgia and Azerbaijan.<br><br>"Aerial reconnaissance is one way to try to track the movements of terrorist groups," the diplomat said on condition of anonymity, adding that such flights could benefit Russia in its fight against Chechen separatists, who Moscow claims are aided by international terrorist groups.<br><br>But Ivanov said it would be impossible to spot terrorists from the high-flying U-2, but it would have no problem spotting Russian military installations.<br><br>The senior U.S. diplomat said the flights were far from the Russian border. Russia says the spy plane flew 12 to 20 miles from its territory.<br><br>The diplomat said Washington had not decided whether it would take up Georgia's offer to allow U.S. forces to use its air bases in the war against Iraq (news - web sites).<br><br>Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, who has tried to ally his Caucasus Mountains nation with the United States as a counterweight to its huge neighbor, last week expressed strong support for the U.S.-British attack on Iraq.<br><br>The United States has identified the Pankisi Gorge, a rugged border region of Georgia next to Russia's breakaway Chechnya (news - web sites), as a possible haven for Islamic militants linked to Osama bin Laden (news - web sites)'s al-Qaida network. Georgia, which turned down Russian offers to rid the region of fighters, last year accepted Washington's help in forming its own anti-terrorist units to fight the militants.<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=518&amp;ncid=732&amp;e=8&amp;u=/ap/20030327/ap_on_re_eu/russia_us_georgia" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=518&amp;ncid=732&amp;e=8&amp;u=/ap/20030327/ap_on_re_eu/russia_us_georgia</a></div>
