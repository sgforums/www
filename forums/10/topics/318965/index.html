              with Thailand and Singapore from selling fuel to foreigners, in an attempt to contain the spiralling cost of subsidies, reports said on
              Tuesday.
              <br> <br>"It's the question of principle because you are talking about
              taxpayers' money, and taxpayers' money being used to subsidise petrol
              for those not entitled to receive the subsidy," said Deputy Prime
              Minister Najib Razak.
              <br> <br> "Our level of subsidy is very high," he told a press conference </span></p>

              <p>Was it a mistake that you called yourself - a Malaysian - stupid ?</p>
              <p>Actually, the stupidity continues, as those Malaysians owning cars with Singapore License Plates - {and commuting daily to earn Singapore Dollars, and paying also Malaysian Taxes} - also cannot purchase petrol at all petrol stations within a 50 km radius from any border crossing.</p>
              <p>It will be interesting how the stupidity will be resolved to help those Malaysians who are bringing in the high valued Singapore Dollars into Malaysia, which has been fuelling the rapid development of Johor compared to all the other states except Selangor.</p>
              <p>Will it not be less stupid for the Malaysian Government to bite the bullet - like the Indonesian President Bambang Yudhoyono - and simply increase fuel prices to international levels, and hand back the profits annually in the same manner as the MIW Government in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Has this policy been thought through clearly, or was it a knee jerk response to pacify the growing perception of Malaysian disgust at losing Pedra Branca to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>By not allowing petrol to be sold to cars with Singapore Number Plates - how is the Badawi Government planning to encourage Singaporeans investors to help the Iskandar Project to take off ?</p>
              <p>Driving into the Iskandar Project and not being able to return to Singapore, and exposing one's stalled cars to robbers - that will be a smart prospect to be promoted for Singapore investors to transfer money to help with the project.</p>
              <p>Idwar - are the Malaysians generally stupid, or are you simply stupid in not pushing your government to stop subsidising the fuel prices to such an extent, but to adopt more progressive methods in helping Malaysia to develop ?</p>
              <p>The whole affair need not have developed into this sorry mess that has affected the Malaysians more then the Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Malaysia should consider herself lucky that if a Singapore car should fill up a full tank, he would have travelled a fair distance, and would have spent MORE then what is given in the subsidy for the full tank.</p>
              <p>Afterall, how many Singaporean cars can top a full tank, when the gas tanks are three-quarter full before leaving Singapore ?</p>

              <p>Dont worry. In few months time. Policy towards subsidising petrol of diesel and octane 97++ will cease. Only u92 below will be subsidised. Subsidy diesel to fishermen will still stay on the 1 dollar a litre mark . And the continuous use of 0.30cent subsidy cards on diesel will still continue. This the inside news i got last week.</p>
              <p>Soon , all prices will be same liaw.SG can pump in MY regardless.. cause prices will be same.  Unless u drive a real old and sh|t car that uses regular.</p>
              <p>Actually i think MY should continue subsidy and scrap useless mega projects to sustain the rising costs and try to find solution to slowly easy back on subsidy. ACA should start to do its job in retrieving billions of ringgit for corruption.</p>

              <p>malaysia govt is richer then singapore gov !!! they have oil and palm oil ..... just where the money goes !!!</p>
              <p>hello they spend US$14 billion - US$14 billion - is including - fuel for ships, planes, trains, factory , powerstation .  What portion is that 14 billion use by cars ? foregin cars - thailand also contribute to foreign cars. So Singapore cars is a small number !!!! You cannot use the whole country fuel comsuming figure and blame it to foreign cars.</p>
              <p>How many Singaporean go up north ?  Singapore again provided the majority of tourists to its northern neighbour, with 6.16mn arrivals over the first seven months. If full year - mean 12.2 mn singaporean visit </p>

              <p>The tourism ministry has estimated that the campaign brought in 20.7 million tourists, bringing the total receipt to US$13.7 billion.</p>

              <p>If singapore say contribute to 1/2 of the total tourist :)</p>
              <p>I will tell you where the fuel subsidies went !!! It got burn up - yep think of how much they burn to send their man into space :) yep burn up already.</p>

              <p>malaysia govt is richer then singapore gov !!! they have oil and palm oil ..... just where the money goes !!!</p>
              <p>hello they spend US$14 million - hello i would frankly assumpting 3/4 is use by local. 1/4 is share between thai and singaporean . So  US$1.75 is more the real figure the Singaporean enjoy.</p>

              <p>Yep if you take the totally number of 12.2 mn ... if average out the spending - think  the local business can make profit of  SGD$30 each visit - take that and 12.2 x 30  - SGD $336mn  - think that can cover more then what little subsidies we may happen to enjoy.</p>

              <p><br>If u say it this way, how many singapore tourist go Johor one? I can assume most go KL one or northern Malaysia are going by coach. So even with the fuel ban, they will only affect singapore tourist going in by car. Most singaporean still happy happy go tour in Malaysia by coach. It will not affect their tourist targeting sporean much.</p>
              <p>Btw, its US $14 billion not 14 million... And Spore gov is richer than Malaysia one cos they are not stingy like our gov. Do u know how much is spore reserve compare to malaysia one?</p>
