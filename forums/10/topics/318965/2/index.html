              <p>It's simple.</p>
              <p>In the long run, fewer and fewer Singaporeans would want to drive up to Johor. As the pump station owners in JB have complained... this harebrained ruling will very negatively affect their business.</p>
              <p>Heck, pump stations are just the tip of the iceberg. Now how many Singaporeans would want to drive to Johor for their weekly shopping if they have to drive all the way to Kota Tinggi just to refuel? Their economy is gonna go down.</p>
              <p>So in the grand scheme of things.... the Malaysian government is seriously screwing itself in its backside with this stupid ruling. They can simply just impose a small extra charge on Singapore-registered cars who want to refuel, but no....... they just have to come up with this stupid idea. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Why protest to WTO when we can sit back and enjoy watching them screw themselves?</p>

              <p>the answer to that is. can, because there is a means to, and a motive, and an opportunity.</p>

              <p>then it depends on individual and their own conviction and moral standing. my family won't.</p>

              <p>Dont worry. In few months time. Policy towards subsidising petrol of diesel and octane 97++ will cease. Only u92 below will be subsidised. Subsidy diesel to fishermen will still stay on the 1 dollar a litre mark . And the continuous use of 0.30cent subsidy cards on diesel will still continue. This the inside news i got last week.</p>
              <p>Soon , all prices will be same liaw.SG can pump in MY regardless.. cause prices will be same.  Unless u drive a real old and sh|t car that uses regular.</p>
              <p>Actually i think MY should continue subsidy and scrap useless mega projects to sustain the rising costs and try to find solution to slowly easy back on subsidy. ACA should start to do its job in retrieving billions of ringgit for corruption.</p>

              <p>seriously on a 3Q tank? what is a mileage per litre on a sunny? basic calculation, at a conservative 10km/l mileage, on a 3qtr tank full in a sunny, say 30litres in the tank, you can travel almost to seremban, no problem. you got a lemon! </p>
              <p>and in any case, singapore cars CAN fill up in JB, even within the 50km radius. there is no restriction per se. you just pay the rm2.80 per litre like all malaysian. my JB friend just confirmed that with me a while ago.</p>

              Singaporean got spend so much inside Malaysia meh??? Don't forget ,
              they subsidise rice, cooking oil too and we last time go in buy buy
              buy.. Add another few billion.. No wonder Malaysian Gov not as rich

              <p>the us$14 billion subsidise is for all the fuel sold in msia and not for the fuel sold to sg cars only.</p>
              <p>i think for the fuel subsidise we received we spend more in return. we contribute quite a fair bit to the economy of johore. just look at the many eating outlets and shops that have popped up to cater to sg tourists.</p>
