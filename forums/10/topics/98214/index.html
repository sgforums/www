Poly forum I think it was called<br>First , u meet the guest MPS ...then they mingle around the group and talk about issues. Like any conference. Mine was 2. The first one (let's call him MP1) was a very nice guy. The second one (MP2) was telling every young persons in my group " You must speak before you think - that's where ideas are generated". Then u mingle until they lead the guest MPs into the hall and declare it open<br><br>Now u proceed to the forum ....they open with a speech . Then q&amp;A sessions start. We queue at any available microphone stands and then the MPs pick which one to start the ball rolling. At first there won't be much competition for the stands. People will start with questions regarding the theme of the forum and some will voice support , some will voice dissent while some will just ask what is going on. You have 5 minutes to say what u want.<br><br>I think the forum was about 2hrs. I was the 4th speaker . At first I started voicing some inadequacies in their policies ... ....MP1 was listening and he seem to be joting some points , he smiled and asked me how it can be improved and questions to clarify. I suggested some pointers which suddenly MP2 jumped in and started a sort of  questioning regime which seem more like an interrogation rather than an open discussion. So of course being a student  and naive then , I was not afraid to fling his comments back into his face. MP1 interjected and said he wanted to know what I think . I ignored MP2 and gave my views . MP2 jumped in again and questioned me like he was interrogating me . Finally I got so fed up , so I dropped all diplomatic tones and went on a rampage about the weakpoints of what he had said. Other students were getting stirred up and some were yelling yeah , some were clapping . So MP2 got so cheesed off and asked me for my ic/name which I did give him and I asked him if he also wanted my address. MP1 was trying to stiffle his laughter by covering the mouth. I was the only one who took approx 15 mins .<br><br>Following me , the students started to ask questions similar to mine - some were to the stage of flaming ....some were asking reasonably .<br><br>Then the end of the forum, you mingle again. Some people came and said they agree with me . One student however told me that I had guts but I should think why MP2 took my ic/name down - along the lines of I am in trouble thing.  MP2 came up to me , his face quite black , shook my hands and said " we had a good discussion" , his smile look more like a smirk.   After he left , MP1 came up and chatted with me the finer details of what I think and said he would look into it.<br><br>That was my first forum experience which was followed by several. In the other forums , Some Ministers/MPs give u a run around the question or say there is not enough time to answer your question if u diplomatically ask them to come straight to the point. Some give very good and reasoned answers. But the first one was the most memorable one. That was the first and last time I heard my ic/name was being written down.<br><br>I only know this MP2 is a minister now.  So that is why I don't want to mention his name</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All this talk about the government asking youths to participate in politics is just plain BS. From fymk's experience, it is not surprising that today's youth are ignorant about local politics. Who wants to speak up if ic/name is goin to be written down?</div>

FOr example, last year, newly-sworn-in chief of the WP Sylvia Lim revealed in an interview by the ST<br>that her parents had consistently scolded her and railed at her when she informed them that she had been selected for her role. Apparently, her parents did not want her to parttake in politics. And unfortunately, in our culture, letting thoughts be heard by teh government is nearly identical to parttaking in politics.<br><br>Always remember, politics is perception.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>
