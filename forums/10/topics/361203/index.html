              <p>Nowdays, people tend to think that after Mas Selamat kena capture, we can all relax a bit more. But we forget that even with Mas Selamat gone, there are others like him, others able to attack Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For years, we have all seen all those "stop terrorism" kind of posters in buses, trains, etc. But when has the government ever made a speech addressing the terrorist threat? When have they ever shown us how to cope with a terrorist attack? They always assume that all these "stop terrorism" posters are effective. But for us, they have become part of the landscape, part of the normal way of life. We see them so often that we never stop to think of the implications for ourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrorism is attacking a country on its civilian front, where it is more vunerable than its military front. Civilian awareness is therefore important in combating this threat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The last terrorist attack in Singapore was in 1991 (the hijacking of SQ 117). The younger generation, those born 1990-2000, probably have not even heard of this. The las major terrorist attack on Singapore was even further back, during the <em>Konfrontasi during the merger with Malaysia. Singaporeans are therefore unaware of the danger, simply because they have not experienced it yet.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, we are forgetting that Singapore is an important terrorist attack. As one of the only developed countries in Southeast Asia, we are a symbol of the Western powers, a symbol of the Western oppression toward the Muslim world. Of course, from our point of view, we see none of this. We see only that we are a good place to live in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So my question here is: Is the Government of Singapore doing enough to protect us from terrorism?</p>

              <p>In order to battle the roots of terrorism, we only need to understand its roots, where it springs from and how it grows.</p>
              <p><br>There are many ways it can grow, but the very root of terroism in any form grows from disenchantment with an environment leading to hatred and sowing its seeds selfishly to others, to support such hatred, right or wrong, regardless the welfare of its followers and espacially to society at large.</p>

              <p>Misery loves company and when united and led by the more violent who believe arm struggle or rejection of our constitutions is the answer out of their misery, they may be a formidable challenge to a peaceful society.</p>
              <p><br>Terrorism begins with one.</p>
              <p><br>Therefore, if we truly want to be protected from terrorism, such help will have to come from us ourselves first.</p>
              <p><br>Attempt to talk to those who are dis-satisfied and try to find solutions for them, or give them physical attention whereby they can get help. It will nip the growing radical bud, for our Singapore society will always do what we can to help each other, either immediately or in time.</p>
              <p>For every man-made problem, there will always be another man-made solution.</p>
              <p><br>The more worrisome will be the ones whom put on masks and hide within our society. But never fear masked men because it gets tiresome after some time.

              <p><br>It is often good to inform the authorities if one becames aware of radical changes, but Singapore is not a police state whereby we inform on each other. It would be better if we can change their perceptions first, and helps more rather than authoritative figures.</p>
              <p>However, if there is clear and irrefutable evidences of radicalism that may endanger the lives of others, then we must make that call.</p>

              <p>Fighting terrorism begins with you, me and our friends. Combined, our network is bigger than any national govt on Earth. We must no longer turn a blind eye in the face of threats, for it may be our loved ones who will get hurt if we do.</p>
              <p>The question rather is - Have we ourselves, through positive engagement, done enough to prevent radicalism and terrorism ?</p>

              <p>Its true that we have not experienced terrorism first hand since the Confrontation days. But how are we supposed to reinforce the message to the public? By conducting frequent mass scale terrorist reaction drill like Northstar V. Think about the economic repercussions caused due to having disrupt mass communication, recalling crucial assets so on.. Even that is not countering terrorism, it is a reaction to a terrorist event.</p>
              <p>Countering terrorism means we must have timely crucial intelligence. To have that its either we have moles inside the terror organizations or get up to date intelligence from foreign nations who have the intelligence. When that fails, our security apparatus must be secure enough not to let in the elements into Singapore. Even so, sometimes certain things might slip through due to human error or fatigue. That leaves us to the general populace who are not trained but only informed on how to spot and detect potential terror.</p>
              <p>We are not like Israel where they face terror for years even the civilians are well informed and suspicious enough to raise alarms. A man with a huge coat or backpack in a cafe will raise alarm in Israel. But in Singapore it won't. How many people would actually bother if a backpack is left behind in a cafe or train? Has it been tested? Therefore we must rely on the first line of defence to be successful, ie intelligence. Good rapport with neighbouring countries is a must if not crucial to the whole set up.</p>

              <p><br>I am not sure you can totally "lock" ur info. People are inqusitives in nature, and they will search out the propaganda.

              <p>To counter terrorist propaganda is to openly discuss Terrorist goals and educate by bringing Day 2 day interest of your neighbors and friends so that Singaporean understand why and what is their role on the subject of terrorist hurting SG.</p>

              Thats y the various Northstar exercises are staged to prepare Singaporeans to deal with any terrorist attacks.  Singapore is the safest conunrty in the region.  In any emergency, Singapore just need to seal its causeways, sea ports &amp; airport and no one can get in &amp; out.
