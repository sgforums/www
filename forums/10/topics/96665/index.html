Shd efforts be made to plant more trees ?<br><br>Evapotranspiration<br><br>Trees have great potential to cool cities by shading and by "evapotranspiration."<br><br>Evapotranspiration occurs when plants secrete or "transpire" water through pores in their leaves--in a way, plants sweat like people do. The water draws heat as it evaporates, cooling the air in the process. A single mature, properly watered tree with a crown of 30 feet can "evapotranspire" up to 40 gallons of water in a day, which is like removing all the heat produced in four hours by a small electric space heater.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>URBAN CLIMATE<br><br>By Sam C M Hui, Ph.D., Department of Architecture.<br>Urban areas have particular climatic conditions with a higher temperature than exposed country-side, weak winds and an amount of sunshine that varies according to the degree of pollution, the urban density, the orientation of the streets and the shade provided by other buildings.<br><br>Urban Microclimates<br>Urban microclimates are complex because of the number and diversity of factors which come into play. Solar radiation, temperature and wind conditions can vary significantly according to topography and local surroundings. In addition, layout density can provide further constraints: the precise plot division, the need for access and privacy, and the noise and impact of atmospheric pollution must all be taken into account.<br><br>In winter, most urban microclimates are more moderate than those found in suburban or rural areas. They are characterised by slightly higher temperatures and, away from tall buildings, weaker winds. During the day, wide streets, squares and non-planted areas are the warmest parts of a town. At night, the narrow streets have higher temperatures than the rest of the city. In summer, green spaces are particularly useful in modifying the environment during the late afternoon, when the buildings are very hot inside.<br><br>Strong local winds can modifiy the temperature distribution described above. Usually winds in towns are moderate because of the number and range of obstacles they face. However, a few configurations such as long straight avenues or multi-storey buildings can cause significant air circulation. Tall buildings rising above low-rise building can create strong turbulent wind conditions on the ground as the air is brought down from high levels. Strong winds can flow through gaps at the base of tall buildings. To protect pedestrians from this, the turbulent flow has to be prevented from descending to street level, for example by modifying the building form or by using wide protective canopies. In semi-open areas, adjacent buildings can be used as protective screens against some winds.<br><br>Urban Heat Island<br>Visit any city on a hot summer day, and you will feel waves of blistering heat emanating from roads and dark buildings. Stay in the city past nightfall, and you will notice that the streets are still radiating heat, while surrounding rural areas are rapidly cooling.<br><br>Almost every city in the world today is hotter - usually between 1 to 4 deg C hotter - than its surrounding area. This difference between urban and rural temperatures is called the "urban-heat-island" effect", and it has been intensifying throughout this century. During hot months a heat island creates considerable discomfort and stress and also increases air-conditioning loads and the incidence of urban smog (do you notice this in Hong Kong!). Research shows that for every degree of increased heat, electricity generation rises by 2% to 4 %, and smog production increases by 4% to 10%. People also believe there is a direct link between global warming and urban heat islands. First, the greenhouse effect could aggravate rising urban temperature significantly. Second, heat islands may contribute to the greenhouse effect.<br><br>In general, there are three main factors causing the urban heat islands:<br><br>Surface - The characteristics of the surfaces in urban and rural areas are different and their thermal properties also differ a lot. As compared with rural areas, urban districts have high absorption (of the heat of the sun and atmosphere), low reflection, low evaporative heat loss and fast transmission of heat.<br><br>Heat emission - "Artificial heat" emitted in urban districts is much higher than that in rural areas.<br><br>Air quality - Air pollution in urban areas is high and the particulates will form a shield for trapping heat.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's some facts I have been noting over the past 5 years.<br><br>Each year, local temperature rises by about 1 degree, starting from year 2000, highest temp was usually between 31 - 33. Now a days we're looking at 34 and higher.<br><br>Coastal tides rises higher now then compared to 5 years ago. Rainy season don't come around the expected time of year, and have "shifted" somewhat to sometime around December and drags on till January/February.<br><br>Our polar ice-caps are melting an inch a year, this adds to total sea level increments. Venice is the first one to eventually become submerged.<br><br>Maybe some of you will be tempted to ask me for proof, but simply do a search with Googles on "global warming", and you'll see scientific data collected through various on-going research on global warming, and therein, you'll see the disturbing truth.<br><br></div>

You not only feel the heat, you feel baked in between the tall buildings, your "pi sai" is black after standing on the streets for a while. But, Hong Kongers will say, where can we go, Hong Kong is so small? It should be a global effort but who can tell the American to follow the Kyoto Protocol to reduce waste emissions? I often wonder why america with its value of democracy and human right cannot see the need to protect environment in which human live? This is a big, global issue.<br><br>After I return from Shanghai and Hong Kong in August, I am actually convinced that singapore is not that hot. But with 4 seasons, people in shanghai can take the heat much better because they know a few months later they would have their balls frozen.
