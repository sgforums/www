              interest after it joined Tasmania in losing a AAA credit
              rating.</em></p>
              <p><em>The slip to a AA+ credit rating comes after Queensland Treasurer
              Andrew Fraser yesterday revealed the outlook for a $1.573 billion
              budget deficit for the current year, just two months after the

              the global financial downturn.</em></p>
              <p><em>Just one month ago, major ratings agency Moody's affirmed the
              state's AAA credit rating, a development greeted warmly by
              Treasurer Andrew Fraser at the time.</em></p>
              <p><em>"The confirmation of our AAA credit rating is important - in a
              world where frightened markets are searching for sound, safe
              investment opportunities," Mr Fraser said in January.</em></p>
              <p><em>But another ratings agency, Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P), has
              revised down the credit rating of Queensland Treasury Corporation,

              <p>its the bloody howard and rudd who make immigration so hard for people . if they can get more foreigner to pay tax,</p>
              <p>Dont know what the fark they trying to prove. First have welfare system, 2nd need tax to pay for that, 3rd making it so hard for immigrant to gain residency , find work ect. So where are they going to get the tax money to support welfare systems?</p>
              <p>btw the tax system in aus is actually taking money from rich corporations to give to poor.</p>
              <p>and that needs people to work for them.</p>

              <p><em>''There was some movement at Immigration following our <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20090226-Immigration-may-be-about-to-deport-head-office.html">story</a> last week on rumours of impending large staff cuts. Secretary Andrew
              Metcalfe sent out an email to staff on Friday explaining the financial
              pressures his Department was under and that he had established two
              separate reviews to identify savings.</em></p>
              <p><em>While the rumoured figures
              of 10-15% reductions were not mentioned, Metcalfe said executives would
              be seeking ideas from staff “on where savings could be made. I
              encourage you to discuss with your managers any ideas or queries you
              may have, including the possibility of voluntary redundancies or
              flexible work practices such as part-time work or extended leave.”</em></p>
              <p><em>In
              the Public Service, when management issues a general call for voluntary
              redundancies, it’s pretty certain large cuts are on the way. Canberra’s
              restaurants and builders might think about preparing for another
              1996-style boom.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Community and Public Sector Union has pro-actively launched a <a href="http://www.cpsu.org.au/campaigns/news/12251.html">campaign</a></em> against public sector job cuts. The CPSU is particularly focussing on
              the efficiency dividend, which cuts departmental allocations by 1.25%
              annually. Last year, the new Government upped it to 3.25%, which made
              for hard times for small agencies with no fat and limited capacity to
              reallocate staff.</p>
              <p><em>The efficiency dividend is part of the Public
              Service furniture, having been introduced by the Hawke Government. The
              theory is that it maintains pressures on agencies to continually seek
              efficiencies, rather than having the Department of Finance spend its
              time hunting through other departments counting paper clips, conducting
              headcounts and checking travel budgets. It became redundant in the last
              term of the Howard Government when departments had more money than they
              could spend and recruitment and retention of staff became difficult.
              Now it is biting again........''.</em></p>

              <p>why get so upset?</p>
              <p>for my friends and i including forumers like Genie99a, mid9sun, reddustt etc.. all have migrated to oz easily and it was under PM Howard's or in Rudd's era. I dont understand how you can bomb out on the emigration process. Did u try to migrate on business visa? that could have explained your difficulty in getting a PR here in oz.</p>

              <p><br>Indeed it was pretty painless for me for the visa application. It took about 6 mths before I they approved and I did all the paper work without going thru those immigration agents.</p>
              <p>In addition, the officer in charge, Ms Patsy was very helpful and understanding despite the fact that I been calling her often with various questions and concerns lol..</p>

              <p><em>''COMMONWEALTH Bank chief <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about Ralph Norris  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=5013951&amp;as=news&amp;ac=money&amp;q=Ralph%20Norris">Ralph Norris </a> yesterday warned that the Rudd Government's first home-buyer grant
              could lead to a residential property bubble if it became a permanent
              fixture in the housing market.</em></p>
              <p><em>Most home lenders and brokers are pushing for an extension to the
              incentives, which include grants of $21,000 for new dwellings, beyond
              June when they are due to end.</em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Norris warns that such a move could tempt borrowers with little capacity to repay debt to enter the market.</em></p>
              <p><em>"I think the first home buyer grant has provided quite a stimulus to the market," he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>"But we've got to be careful this doesn't become an open-ended offer.</em></p>
              <p><em>"If you look back to the sub-prime issues earlier in this decade
              they were largely brought about by people being encouraged to borrow
              who couldn't afford to borrow."</em></p>
              <p><em>CBA has enjoyed record mortgage volumes in January and February mainly because of the incentives.''</em></p>
