Mr Tan says that he finds the alternative programme "to be quite sensible". <br><br>Mr Tan writes his own blog and, in one of his <a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2010/06/vision-for-egalitarian-economy.html">posts</a>, he highlighted the high cost of living in Singapore, widening wage gap, and stagnant incomes as problem areas in the current state of our economy. "What is the alternative?" he asked and pointed to the SDP's programme.<br><br>Mr Tan came into prominence in the local scene when he championed the cause of investors who were hit by the toxic mini-bonds saga in 2008. He organised weekly meetings at the Speakers' Corner which attracted hundreds of participants.<br><br>Mr Tan is of the view that Singapore needs an egalitarian economic system. This is also the Democrats' position. Singapore must work towards an economy where everyone benefits. At present we have the PAP's unsustainable elitist system where the super rich keep on getting richer at the expense of the rest of society. <br><br>The key elements of the SDP's programme are:<br><br>

              <li>changing the way we measure economic growth by using other indices of well-being of the people rather than just relying on the GDP. A high GDP figure does not indicate how the poorer segments of society benefit, if at all,  from the growth. The SDP proposes using the <a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/the-party/our-manifesto/3381-the-sdps-alternative-economic-programme-part-3-a-comprehensive-set-of-measures-">Genuine Progress Index</a> instead of, or in conjunction with, the GDP.</li>

These policies provide a safety net for those who fall through the economic crack. They also give people greater spending power which ultimately benefits the economy.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 20px; list-style-position: inside; padding: 0px;">
              <li>moving away from being overly dependent on <a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/the-party/our-manifesto/3412-the-sdps-alternative-economic-programme-part-5-the-mnc-glc-syndrome">multinational corporations</a> (MNCs) and start to cultivate homegrown entrepreneurs. To achieve this we also need to dismantle our Government-linked companies (GLCs) which are monopolising the domestic commercial sector. Our dependence on MNCs and GLCs is a main reason why the income gap is so wide.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>The PAP often accuses the opposition of not being able to offer Singaporeans a viable alternative. This is completely untrue. The Singapore Democrats have been and will always be a party that is constructive and offers solutions for our nation's problems.<br><br>This elections the SDP will focus on our economic platform which is workable, realistic and necessary for our country.

              <p>So how long is the retrenchment entitlement be valid for? 1 mth, 6 mths, 1 yr, 5 yrs? Then where's e $$ going to come from? Slowly draining out e reserves to bankruptcy?</p>
              <p>Money is not easy to be saved into reserves yet it's so easy to be drained off overnight. Many ppl failed to realise how we came from <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">. It took 25 yrs to get e amt.</p>
              <p>As for the MNCs... It's doing more harm as w/o them we would not have survived. Having said tat, it's a double engine propelled drive to develop local brands into big international players at e same time.</p>

Lee Kuan Yew's son, the Prime Minister speaks to pre-university students.</a></h3>

He was speaking to graduating High School students, telling them to remember their obligations to society by either joining the one party dictatorship's Government Service Sector or do charity work. <br><br>By this, he was implying that as the state has given them an education, it was only just for them to repay the community.<br><br>But really is this all correct? Has his father, Lee Kuan Yew really done something good for these students, or has he in fact damaged their minds by turning them into cowardly servile robots, only capable of blindly following Lee Kuan Yew's orders? <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education, we would all agree is meant to open the minds of students, enabling them to think openly and fearlessly for what is right and the courage to execute it. But if this was in fact what education was meant to be, these students have not been educated at all; they have been brainwashed into submission and complete obedience to authority. Singapore has in fact damaged their minds, resulting in fact in their being handicapped in any other society other than Singapore. <br><br>The Singapore government has caused these students by years of indoctrination to become consumed in fear, unable to think openly and act upon their ideas. For instance, every single one of these High School students is fully aware that in Singapore there is no freedom of speech, no human rights whatsoever. Had these students been in any other country, they would have protested against this denial of rights a long time ago, and held nationwide protests to demand them. <br><br>Yet, these Singapore students have no courage to do any of that, thanks to Lee Kuan Yew style education which has turned every single one of these people into literally robots, only capable of obeying orders but incapable of having any opinions about anything.<br><br>If these students are aware of how much Lee Kuan Yew and his son have damaged their minds, they would would be so enraged as to tell both father and son to stop this immediately. But no, these students did not have anything to say. As expected of Lee Kuan Yew's students, they knew no better, quietly listened to the son's speech and went home to their HDB government apartments, to another day of the same old boring, submissive, uncomplaining existence. </span></strong><br><br>No, these students did not have an education. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What they have had in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore is a brainwashing. </span></span></strong><br><br>Those whose minds have been damaged beyond redemption, will perhaps stay behind and join Lee Kuan Yew's government service as his son desires. Others who are still able to realise the harm that is being done to them, would in all probability pack up and leave Singapore permanently.</div>

              <p> He is shameless enough to try to say that no one benefit from english as dominant language as it is a "neutral" language.</p>
              <p>he himself, a peranakan all speak english as first language in order to serve the british colonialists.</p>
              <p>You got to give it to lee kuan yew for being able to tell big lies.</p>
