              <p>I don't think it is biased. PAP policies and their organisation of society stifled creativity, innovation and <span style="font-size: 15px;">chinese entrepreneurial spirit.</span></p>

              <p>It's not biased.</p>
              <p>Autocratic societies like ours are not creative, innovative societies.</p>
              <p>Basically, societies where people are living in fear of the state are not innovative societies.</p>

Lee Kuan Yew's son, the Prime Minister speaks to pre-university students.</a></h3>
              <div style="line-height: 1.3em; margin: 0px 0px 0.75em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore's state owned and controlled newspaper the Straits Times online edition of June 1, 2010 has the story "Remember your obligations". He was speaking to graduating High School students, telling them to remember their obligations to society by either joining the one party dictatorship's Government Service Sector or do charity work. <br><br>By this, he was implying that as the state has given them an education, it was only just for them to repay the community.<br><br>But really is this all correct? Has his father, Lee Kuan Yew really done something good for these students, or has he in fact damaged their minds by turning them into cowardly servile robots, only capable of blindly following Lee Kuan Yew's orders? <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education, we would all agree is meant to open the minds of students, enabling them to think openly and fearlessly for what is right and the courage to execute it. But if this was in fact what education was meant to be, these students have not been educated at all; they have been brainwashed into submission and complete obedience to authority. Singapore has in fact damaged their minds, resulting in fact in their being handicapped in any other society other than Singapore. <br><br>The Singapore government has caused these students by years of indoctrination to become consumed in fear, unable to think openly and act upon their ideas. For instance, every single one of these High School students is fully aware that in Singapore there is no freedom of speech, no human rights whatsoever. Had these students been in any other country, they would have protested against this denial of rights a long time ago, and held nationwide protests to demand them. <br><br>Yet, these Singapore students have no courage to do any of that, thanks to Lee Kuan Yew style education which has turned every single one of these people into literally robots, only capable of obeying orders but incapable of having any opinions about anything.<br><br>If these students are aware of how much Lee Kuan Yew and his son have damaged their minds, they would would be so enraged as to tell both father and son to stop this immediately. But no, these students did not have anything to say. As expected of Lee Kuan Yew's students, they knew no better, quietly listened to the son's speech and went home to their HDB government apartments, to another day of the same old boring, submissive, uncomplaining existence. </span></strong><br><br>No, these students did not have an education. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What they have had in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore is a brainwashing. </span></span></strong><br><br>Those whose minds have been damaged beyond redemption, will perhaps stay behind and join Lee Kuan Yew's government service as his son desires. Others who are still able to realise the harm that is being done to them, would in all probability pack up and leave Singapore permanently.</div>

              <p>Can.</p>
              <p>singapore soil is quite suitable for the growth of rice and it can support a population of 100,000 people based on a study.</p>

              <p>Well, I think the early days of PAP was heading in the right direction except the chinese language policy and PSLE / streaming issue. If anyone insist that PAP was heading in the wrong direction, then they should pray for communism in Singapore, which might be better instead.</p>
