            <div class='col-md body'>This is interview by TIMEasia with FLG leader Li HongZhi in 1999<br><blockquote>TIME: Have you seen human beings levitate off the ground?<br>Li: <strong>I have known too many.</strong><br><br>TIME: Can you describe any that you have known?<br>Li: <strong>David Copperfield. He can levitate and he did it during performances.</strong><br><br>TIME: You have said that this type of qigong should not be used to cure illness. Why is that?<br>Li: Healing illnesses belongs to the lower level of qigong. A person with an illness cannot practice to a higher level. One has to purify one's body in order to have gong. Healing and fitness are for laying a foundation at a lower level of practice.<br><br>TIME: Would you use qigong to cure an illness?<br>Li: I can do all of this, but I won't do it.</blockquote>I smell a common street con job. He just couldn't or wouldn't do it... take a guess<br><br><blockquote>TIME: Where do they come from?<br>Li: <strong>The aliens come from other planets. The names that I use for these planets are different .</strong> Some are from dimensions that human beings have not yet discovered. The key is how they have corrupted mankind. Everyone knows that from the beginning until now, there has never been a development of culture like today. Although it has been several thousand years, it has never been like now.<br><br>The aliens have introduced modern machinery like computers and airplanes. They started by teaching mankind about modern science, so people believe more and more science, and spiritually, they are controlled. Everyone thinks that scientists invent on their own when in fact their inspiration is manipulated by the aliens. In terms of culture and spirit, they already control man. Mankind cannot live without science.<br><br>The ultimate purpose is to replace humans. If cloning human beings succeeds, the aliens can officially replace humans. Why does a corpse lie dead, even though it is the same as a living body? The difference is the soul, which is the life of the body. If people reproduce a human person, the gods in heaven will not give its body a human soul. The aliens will take that opportunity to replace the human soul and by doing so they will enter earth and become earthlings.<br><br>When such people grow up, they will help replace humans with aliens. They will produce more and more clones. There will no longer be humans reproduced by humans. They will act like humans, but they will introduce legislation to stop human reproduction.<br><br>TIME: Are you a human being?<br>Li: <strong>You can think of me as a human being.</strong><br><br>TIME: Are you from earth?<br>Li: <strong>I don't wish to talk about myself at a higher level. People wouldn't understand it. </strong><br><br>TIME: What are the aliens after?<br>Li: The aliens use many methods to keep people from freeing themselves from manipulation. They make earthlings have wars and conflicts, and develop weapons using science, which makes mankind more dependent on advanced science and technology. In this way, the aliens will be able to introduce their stuff and make the preparations for replacing human beings. The military industry leads other industries such as computers and electronics.<br><br>TIME: But what is the alien purpose?<br>Li: The human body is the most perfect in the universe. It is the most perfect form. The aliens want the human body.<br><br>TIME: What do aliens look like?<br>Li: <strong>Some look similar to human beings. U.S. technology has already detected some aliens. The difference between aliens can be quite enormous.</strong><br><br>TIME: Can you describe it?<br>Li: You don't want to have that kind of thought in your mind. </blockquote>See.. a nut case.<br><br>Avoid epochtimes or Clearwisdom.net ... think of your children. The clearwisdom site (for western propaganda) obviously reads different from their chinese site ..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><a href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990510/interview1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990510/interview1.html</a></div>

The FLG is probably under the financial support of the C!A to undermine the ccp. This could be seen from their oraganisation structure and support. Their leader is living very well in US, flee as fast as superman, and the recent FLG heckling of Pres HU in his US visit<br><br>The Church are restricted in China, in part due to the C!A well known used of Missionaries to started uprising and spy rings... this is a fact. This occurred a few times in southern China, the Urghur uprising was suspected as a result of them, though they are muslim... See the problem (they were later classified as terrorist ). On the matter of faith, well if it is Buddhism, the CCP has no problem (Tibet is another issue, different buddhism way and is political). So why Catholic and christian churches are restricted, it's because of historical colonial issue and the western way of ideas that comes with it and priest/pastors getting involve with politics (especially the Catholics). In a way, it does post a potential threat to the CCP.<br><br>Let's look at the FLG. (as far as my knowledge)<br><br>The leader is a peasant name Li hongzi, he changeg his birthday to the birth date of Buddha, and procliam himself the recarnation of him. Along came the idea of Alien ruling Earth, power of healing and express pass to heaven.<br><br>He instructed 10,000 members to suround the leadership of CCP, and instructed members to immolate themselves at the Tianament Square, included a 12 yrs old girl.. she died. Telling them that it would bring them expressly to Heaven. When this sh!t hits the fan, He procliam that they were the spies of CCP. Presently, he is said to be living in a mansion in the US. Epoch times is a FLG establishment that very much brings the ignorance west with all the bad and false news to their media. Many Media in the US seems to support them... pointing to C!A involvement. What their English site and Chinese site version tells different things... propaganda... which fit's the US govt very well.<br><br>All in all, it is a cult by any standard.  </div></blockquote>I agree</div>
