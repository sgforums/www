But an interesting point to note is that in China, they practise execution by sending a round into your head. But, your family member will not be allowed to retrieve your body, until u r cremated in a state crematorium, u knoe why huh..........</div>

She also says that church groups are restricted because of its potential threat to communists called FAITH. I agree to a certain extent, but i think Falungong is not considered a religion, but rather a propaganda or something, as i have seen people practice Falungong at midnight when they have cancer, eventually died and people who say that computers are invented by aliens after practicing Falungong. Damn sad lar. I think it should be banned, and in fact the Singapore govt already took legal actions against the group, according to The Straits Times.

She also says that church groups are restricted because of its potential threat to communists called FAITH. I agree to a certain extent, but i think Falungong is not considered a religion, but rather a propaganda or something, as i have seen people practice Falungong at midnight when they have cancer, eventually died and people who say that computers are invented by aliens after practicing Falungong. Damn sad lar. I think it should be banned, and in fact the Singapore govt already took legal actions against the group, according to The Straits Times. It is such a disgrace to China that she produced such a group.</div></blockquote>On the FLG being a threat to the CCP is true.. then again it is a threat to any government under it's agenda. The FLG is probably under the financial support of the C!A to undermine the ccp. This could be seen from their oraganisation structure and support. Their leader is living very well in US, flee as fast as superman, and the recent FLG heckling of Pres HU in his US visit<br><br>The Church are restricted in China, in part due to the C!A well known used of Missionaries to started uprising and spy rings... this is a fact. This occurred a few times in southern China, the Urghur uprising was suspected as a result of them, though they are muslim... See the problem (they were later classified as terrorist ). On the matter of faith, well if it is Buddhism, the CCP has no problem (Tibet is another issue, different buddhism way and is political). So why Catholic and christian churches are restricted, it's because of historical colonial issue and the western way of ideas that comes with it and priest/pastors getting involve with politics (especially the Catholics). In a way, it does post a potential threat to the CCP.<br><br>Let's look at the FLG. (as far as my knowledge)<br><br>The leader is a peasant name Li hongzi, he changeg his birthday to the birth date of Buddha, and procliam himself the recarnation of him. Along came the idea of Alien ruling Earth, power of healing and express pass to heaven.<br><br>He instructed 10,000 members to suround the leadership of CCP, and instructed members to immolate themselves at the Tianament Square, included a 12 yrs old girl.. she died. Telling them that it would bring them expressly to Heaven. When this sh!t hits the fan, He procliam that they were the spies of CCP. Presently, he is said to be living in a mansion in the US. Epoch times is a FLG establishment that very much brings the ignorance west with all the bad and false news to their media. Many Media in the US seems to support them... pointing to C!A involvement. What their English site and Chinese site version tells different things... propaganda... which fit's the US govt very well.<br><br>All in all, it is a cult by any standard.</div>
