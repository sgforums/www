              <p>I had said tis earlier. China officials r still corrupted to a certain degree and the promises and policies can change overnight. U can invest in china and the very next month, all their promises r broken and u end up with a losing investment. In singapore, there is no such signs since the gov is not corrupted, the gov does not change and the gov favors companies greatly. All tis means there is more reliability and predictabilty. Tis is political stability which few countries in the region can give. Everybody such as foxtrot, singapore tyrannosaur and jhanjhan can understand but u seems to have a wekaer comprehension skill compared to them and i have to repeat and explain multiples times for u</p>

              <p>Cheap shot number 10. Wow seems all your replies r just hurling verbal abuses. It sure make u look good isn't it ? If u ever become a politican, I wonder r u gonna be "right minded" or give out "lies" and "wild guesses" out and hoping no one sues u. In fact, u just convince me tat even u r not right minded, u dish out wrong facts and u do verbal abuses and tat actually justifies why people deserved to be sued for libel or slander.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking I do not understand wat r u trying to say here. Is it wrong to say gov do listen, they heed complaints, they invite staff to suggest improvements, they heed international criticism and they implement a lot of such measures. But obviously not all suggestions should be heeded. It is like the fable of bringing a donkey to the market. It is pointless and impossible to heed everybody advise</p>

              <p>SOuth korea protest on US beef ? I find tat amusing. Personally, I feel tat importing beef and able to ink the free trade agreement is good for the overall economy of south korea. They could simply label the beef they buy either from US or from other countries and let the consumers decide. But just because of one decision they do nto like, they protest, make economic losses and tat one small thing seems to be able to bring down a popular president who is just elected. They can keep changing gov all they want and I do not believe a person, no matter how perfect of how brillant, can make all policies where everybody will like on a matured economy.</p>

Fact is, it is proven with many examples tat despite being in a modern economy, being in a democratic nation and being educated doesn't make u "right minded". U can say 50,000 people in korea to be "minority" but it proves tat in a society there r people who do and say anything for politics. So much so even presidents themselves r deemed by u to be not "right minded" by u. Then how do u expect singaporean to be right minded ?</p>

U accuse me of making wold guesses on china corruption holds no water. U accuse me saying tat I claimed china is gonna collapse under its corruption holds no water. U shift your argument saying I use too colorful analogies tat make u confuse holds no water (since u r the one tat started the analogy). And now u shift the argument saying tat copyright law should be included in my description of china problem.

              <p><br>My sentiments as well.</p>
              <p>Thus, I predict that Singapore's future can be quite Predictable.</p>
              <p>Your next 10 years as follows :</p>
              <p>No major change, some casinos - more foreign talent ladies come here work parttime,  casino-related crimes and social ills, some new buildings. a few more MRT.</p>
              <p>Many more ERP gantries, I suspect, price hikes on many items, I assume, public transport very the public oriented, as usual, Transport giant shares keep on going up, I predict.</p>
              <p>Medical fees increase further, HDB price increase further after 3 years time.</p>
              <p>Even More FTs and foreigners on work / special permit / employment pass , than now. </p>
              <p>Annual touring car championship events to be held, maybe more F1 events, marina barge opens, orchard road some facelifts, but not major, oil price continue to be even more expensive or held steady at expensive levels.</p>

              <p>No major change, some casinos - more foreign talent ladies come here work parttime,  casino-related crimes and social ills, some new buildings. a few more MRT.</p>
              <p>Many more ERP gantries, I suspect, price hikes on many items, I assume, public transport very the public oriented, as usual, Transport giant shares keep on going up, I predict.</p>
              <p>Medical fees increase further, HDB price increase further after 3 years time.</p>
              <p>Even More FTs and foreigners on work / special permit / employment pass , than now. </p>
              <p>Annual touring car championship events to be held, maybe more F1 events, marina barge opens, orchard road some facelifts, but not major, oil price continue to be even more expensive or held steady at expensive levels.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. Yes, Hong Kong and India having more millionaires were examples of two politically democratic countries compared to Singapore. How did you bring China into the discussion ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2. China not being a Politically Democratic country and was left out of the comparison when India and Hong Kong were first brought up to be compared to Singapore. The details posted about China came after you insist on China being drawn into the discussion, which even studies made have treated China and Hong Kong separately for certain purpose, and even when placed together - Hong Kong was still specifically identified as such.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. Are you being willfully dishonest that I had mentioned : "<em>Hong Kong is China"</em> - when I had only said "<em>Is Hong Kong not part of China</em>" ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you lost focus and got confused with yourself having said that <span style="color: #000000;">"<em>Hong Kong is part of China, but China is not Hong Kong"</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4. Since when has anybody disputed the fact that <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China is more then Hong Kong</span></em> ? Has it not been yourself being cornered that you decided to flip-flop your way out by digressing into other areas, and confusing even yourself with new arguments that are not relevant to the current issues ? The Reports that I have made reference to are by professionals, who had reported the data according to their requirements, and the same data was presented at the appropriate time according to the relevance. It was your own "stupid-is-smart" character that messed up the situation and distort the picture to suit your own perverse agenda.</span></p>

              <p>Did I lose sight with my reply ? In another of your own report, it states tat hong kong is trying to attract foreigners who r millionaires into the economy as well.

              <p>Is civil servants singapore citizens ? They r. Do they take complaints seriously. They do. R the people making complaints singaporean. They r too. Do the gov takes other organisation recommendations (such as improving creativity and high tax). They do.</p>
              <p>Now u r saying the gov did not listen to singaporean. U r the one tat flip flop your argument ba... Lets go back to the start of tis argument</p>
              <p>1. u claim the gov do not listen, and your reason is simply because they say they have a good team of people in the government.</p>
              <p>2. When i state the many instances where advises were taken, u just implied civil servants r not singaporean (initially u even imply they do not take staff suggestion), u did not mention anything about heeding complaints and other advises from other organisation.</p>
              <p>3. U states past mistakes made as instances where the gov did not listen</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I think the crux of the argument rest on your referenced report.

When u read it, u probably get the idea they r not attracting people over. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> I cut out some thing from there</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The title is</span></p>
              <p><em><strong>Hong Kong attracts talent, capital through successful immigration policies</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Approximately $900 million (USD) in investment and a wide range of talented people have called Hong Kong their home through the region's immigration policies, according to the Immigration Department.</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>...</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>The Director of Immigration, Lai Tung-kwok, said the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, begun in 2003, has been popular and has attracted a wealth of new migrants and capital.</em></p>
              <p><em>...</em></p>
              <p><em>In the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, another immigration category launched in June of 2006, 586 applications were received by the end of the year. The scheme is designed to attract talented people from overseas and the Chinese mainland to settle in the region.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">From your own report, they r <strong>trying hard</strong> to get people to come over to hong kong to settle. Tis is the same as your impression of wat singapore is doing. SO since they r both trying to grab millionaires over, wat conclusions can u achieve ? (your point 9) U failed to read properly, even your own report u attached</span></p>

              <p>In your reply, u have carefully ignored my part on "complaints made by singaporean". Now r the complainants civil servants or taking gov salary ? Nope. U purposefully ignore tis portion and yet can go around scolding people about flip flopping. U have nothing to say about your flip flopping actions in the earlier points ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, civil servants r citizens. They vote. They have the right to vote. And it is unfair to say they r biased and something lesser than other citizens with no courage to vote who they believe in. And u r flip flopping out of point again. The point is about whether is gov listening to the people. They listen to civil servants, outside commentaries and complaints from citizens. Tis is something u cannot deny</p>

              <p>Let me tell u the fable of bringing the donkey to the market.</p>
              <p>In the past, a father and a son wanna bring a donkey to the market to sell. They both sit on the donkey since it is more comfortable for both of them. Halfway through, they LISTENED to a man who remarked "cruelty to animal.. the poor animal is overworked". They then DECIDE to let the father sit on the donkey and the son walk . Halfway they LISTEN to a girl who remarked "shame on the father to let the son walk" and they DECIDE to let the boy sit instead while the father walks. Halfway through, they LISTEN to another guy saying "unfillial son letting the father walk". They DECIDE to both walk instead after tat. Next they LISTEN to a merchant saying "stupid people who do not know how to use a donkey". With no other option,they finally DECIDE to carry the donkey to the market instead.</p>
              <p>So wat is my point ? The gov listens. They had implemented many policies based on wat they listened. But they cannot blindly implement all policies just because it is suggested. There is still a decision and they make the decision based on wat they think is right. Just because they do not follow all advises (like your seperation example ) doesn't mean they do not listen. So wat is wrong with the words I said ? is there any contradiction in it or u failed to comprehend ?</p>

              <p>Because tis is an undefined question. Wat is your definition of "live" ? If i tour to british for a week, am i living in a democratic country ? If I go to exchange for a month, is tat living ? So I answer I lived in a democratic country for six months which leave u to decide if it is relevant to your standard. But apparently, u did not live in a democratic country</p>

              <p>I see a lot of insults in tat paragraph and a lot of avoidance when all I ask is whether have u lived in a democracy or not. U r not me, u do not know my purpose of asking u the question but it shows u r scared to answer it, like the many questions I had posed. The questions u had asked, I had answered but the question I posed is always left unanswered. Do u lack the courage or confidence to answer such a simple question u asked yourself ?</p>
              <p>BTW, since u r the one tat asked the question first, the spitting analogy can be used on u.</p>

              <h1><em>Judiciary-Led Reforms in Singapore: Framework, Strategies, and Lessons</em></h1>
              <p>by Waleed Haider Malik</p>
              <blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>About This
              	Book</h3>
              <p>This book from the World Bank
              explores the strategies and lessons of Singapore's judicial reform
              experience from a management perspective. Judicial reform in Singapore
              has been successful on many counts. Its courts are now regarded as one
              of the most effective in the world. The subordinate courts are more
              efficient and responsive to citizens' needs and have gained the
              confidence of local users and private investors.</p>
              <p>Describing how the nation's success was achieved in just a decade and a
              half, the author highlights how extensive planning prior to initiating
              reforms and broad-based stakeholder participation throughout the
              process was critical to the reform's success. The reform process also
              benefited from a unique political and economic context. The combination
              of these factors suggests possible avenues along which modernisation
              efforts could be targeted.
              The lessons learned from the Singapore experience can provide a guide
              to judicial reform in other countries.</p>
              <p>This book will be useful for
              policy makers, those working to achieve judicial reform and government
              officials. The appendices present the judicial work plans, the
              management concepts used, and a description of Singapore's judicial
              institutions and stakeholders. With references and index.</p>

              <p>Nice try, but I don't think you'll go very far on this line of reasoning.</p>
              <p>Firstly the main reasons are not political, they are cultural. A Chinese migrating to India will face many cultural barriers which are a significant factor. It's such a no brainer I am surprised you even try to go down this line of reasoning.</p>
              <p>What about this. Even more Singaporeans will consider migrating to Australia, which is the most attractive place for Singaporeans to migrate to, then China, why?</p>
