              <p>Depends on whether u encourage people to make false claims or not.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now are you going back one full circle ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We did begin with identifying that in a Democracy, respect and tolerance are the required keys for co-existence that leads to a gracious democratic society to exist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Attitudes that have been ingrained into Singaporeans have led to a situation of intolerance, pettiness, and imaginary wounds that are self-inflicted based on some preferred narrow interpretations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Would any right minded persons make false claims ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Statements based on "available up-to-date information" towards persons holding public office should be seen as "fair comment" - as spelled out in the IBA Report Page 27 of 72, in which it clearly mentioned the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provision in the ICCPR I(VIII)(37): </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"<span style="color: #800000;"><em>A limitation to a human right based on the reputation of others <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall not</span> be used to protect the state and its officials from public opinion or criticism</em></span> "</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.legislationline.org/legislation.php?tid=219&amp;lid=7155&amp;less=false">The Siracusa Principle is accessible from LegislatiONline  </a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">According to the IBA Report had an interesting highlight of a little known fact that Singapore had acceded to parts of the UN Declaration of Human Rights guidelines, but prefer to defer on others (see Page 24 to 26 of 72 in the IBA report) - and can only be seen as the Ruling Political Party protecting their own Political Interests at the expense of the Rights of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given the situation in Zimbabwe, or the Congo, or even Timbuctoo - as I had mentioned, it depends on the viability of the offer from any of these "pariah countries".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">U talking about zimbabwe under hyperinflation, break promises and silence opposition by assasination ? Man u really is a good CEO to invest a printing firm there. They can give u any "offer" but do u really trust them ? As said before, CEO take calculated risk, and singapore is a safe bet</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Obviously you are not CEO material based on your own narrow outlook in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are a CEO interested only in the bottom line of your company, will you want to get involved in the politics ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you can negotiate with Mugabe to provide you with an iron clad security, cheap labor, and a captive market - and in return allow you to extract natural resources from Zimbabwe - will you not consider such an offer, if you can negotiate from a position of power ?</span></p>

Why do u refuse to answer tis question despite me repeating multiple times. I said political stability is an important consideration and CEO being risk taker don't purposely take risk as well.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As I have stated - is there any relevance to your question pertaining to any reason for me to decide in favor of investing in Singapore or China ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given your statement about the situation in Zimbabwe - where political promises are broken, political persecution takes place, and opposition is silenced, I am surprised that you will still select Singapore with similar politics being practised ? </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The problems expressed by Hu Jin Tao is no different from those expressed by LKY in the early days of Singapore, and all throughout his political career making public statements in some grand standing display.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is a matter of course in your references made at different points in your response that hop around, and attempts to link unrelated events to sew your arguments together with words that allow alternative interpretations of your intent - you cannot possibly blame anyone for the opportunity you gave.</span></p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Conversely, Singapore is facing a long list of problems - the top of the list being an overpaid Government that is indifferent to the pressing economic situation of the average "Lower-Middle-Income" and the "Lower-Income" Families.</em></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely you are not serious in taking yourself so brilliantly to believe that a democratic and open society do not produce more millionaires ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Try reading the following 2007 report - </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1413615.php/Number_of_millionaires_surges_in_Asia">Number of millionaires surges in Asia – India leads the way  </a><span style="color: #0000ff;">. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After reading this article, you will note that India - the leading democracy in Asia - has seen a surge of about 25,000 persons gaining millionaire status in the US$ denominated qualification. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hong Kong saw an addition of more then 9,000 persons to boost its millionaires to a new high of 95,000 - followed by South Korea Indonesia and Singapore - all three countries preceding Singapore being more democratic compared to Singapore.</span> </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As far as this Government is concerned, complaints are attended based on several factors - firstly, who makes the complains, followed by the impact of the publicity that the complaint will generate, the effects on its own political interests.</span></p>

              <p>I think u must be joking. Almost everybody will lie and make false claims in politics. Even Presidents can make false claims to support their stand. Bush himself have asked his advisors to rewrite reports to justify their stand in attacking Iraq. Chen Shui Bian probably fabricated his own assasination. South korean believed they r more susceptible to mad cow diesease based on a paper which the writer denied. Obama got many untrue attacks on him being racist during his campaign. Would any right minded people make false claims ? Yeah ! Unless u wanna say they r all mad...</p>

              <p>U r still beating around the bush and refuse to answer tis question which I asked for 5 times in a row. If u r a CEO and u want to invest in singapore, wat r the reasons tat make singapore shine out ? Why do u refuse to answer tis question ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, Mugabe is not known to keep his promise. He take back all the farmland from the caucasion just because he feels like it and he kill his opposition to win the election. U still wanna invest in there knowing he does not keep his words ? Wat is the use of negotiation with someone who don't keep his words ? Singaporean have tis mentality tat people will keep to their words, and tat is why they r branded as naive.</p>

              <p>I am trying to point to the fact tat singapore attract companies over for their political stability. And tis is something u refuse to answer.

              <p>Democracy is not just about having more oppositions in Parliament. It's more complex than just voting for the MP in your constituency. Democracy can mean you get to choose the policies that will affect your life.</p>
              <p>However.. if you have no confidence in your life choices.. then yes.. autocratic rule is very suitable for you. No need the commoners to think much.. just follow instructions from your ruler.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">" <strong>Stop planning so much - and Singapore will make the next economic leap</strong>."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This Singapore Government is more communist than the central planning methods practised by the old Communist China, which is loosening its grip on the population - by allowing local economic, social and cultural initiatives. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">China has even embarked on some cautious political reforms that allow local democracy to be practised at the village level, as well as from the provincial to the national level.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is obvious that like India's liberalising policies, China has also benefitted by leaps and bounds in seeing its treasury gaining strength to allow China to exert political clout on the international stage.</span></p>

They can screw u up big time as they can backtrack on their previous promises or copy all your design and sell in another name. U can see such symptoms like opposition favourite example of suzhou industrial park or the LV factory there. Singapore does not have such signs.

              <p>Hong kong is a city of china. China, like shanghai and beijing etc have a high number of millionaires themselves but u r not mentioning it at all. In your article u have referenced, they also seperate the 2 entities.</p>

              <p><em><strong>China</strong> gained the number two spot with a 20.3 per cent in the number of millionaires to 415,000, the report said. </em></p>
              <p>Hong kong is part of china but china is not hong kong. Despite u saying so much thing, in your reply u left out china and tat is a fact. All those question should be directed back to u.</p>

              <p>As said, complaints r heeded, staff r invited for suggestions, implementation had followed and international criticism have been applied here and there. WHen they say singaporean r not creative enough, they changed the whole syllabus.</p>
              <p>I think u have mistaken "listening" to "decision". As a prime minister, he can listen to advises but he acts in the way he think it is right. Just like the casino decision. LHL can listen to feedback and advises but he acts wat he thinks it right. During tat time, does anybody know wat is gonna happen in the future ? U only have the benefit of hindsight now then u make comment based on past decisions.</p>
              <p>If tat is the case, if a democractic country like america listen to others, they would not attack Iraq. Does democracy make any difference ? Nope.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even if the ministerial pay is reduced, it will be substantially higher than the highest paid local Singaporean CEO working for GLCs - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prior</span></strong> to their wages being pegged to the Executives working for Western Multi-nationals.</span></p>

              <p>I think u r really out just to confuse people. U feel tat their pay is too high, then your ideal state of situation should be that they keep their wage ? If it is too high, your ideal remedy will be to lower their pay isn't it ? Reducing to the "highest paid local singaporean CEO working for GLC" is still reducing their pay substantially. Otherwise wat is your other possibilities ? U say it is black and white thinking, then state me another possible outcome.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, why does it have to be pegged to something 10 years ago ? Do u think the minister have a problem trying to find a job as a CEO working for western multi-national ? So u r advising they should get a pay cut to come and work in politics ?</p>

              <p>Sat, Jul 12, 2008 - AsiaOne</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S Law Society has replied to criticism from the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute that it does not speak out enough on law reform issues here.</p>
              <p>It does, said the society, on issues the government refers to it. It has been consulted in at least 30 instances in the last three years. Examples it cited included proposed amendments to the Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act in 2006, and the proposed amendments to the Penal Code in 2007.</p>
              <p>The Law Society issued its statement after its executive council, headed by Senior Counsel Michael Hwang, met yesterday.</p>
              <p>In essence, the society said the Human Rights Institute's comments, made in a report issued on Wednesday, were based on 'an incomplete appreciation of the position of the society and its relationship with the Government'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A self-regulatory body for the 3,500 practising lawyers in Singapore, the society's powers are governed by the Legal Profession Act, in particular Section 38(1)(c).</p>
              <p>The latter is 'commonly interpreted to mean it does not have the statutory right to comment on matters not submitted to it,' said the society. The current shape of Section 38 dates back to 1986, after the government curbed the society's powers to comment on legislation by limiting them to 'legislation submitted to it'.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics. -   ==&gt;</span><span style="color: #000000;">  Question:  This statement is from MM Lee or the lawyers ? -   I have doubt.   If it is from the lawyers, the lawyers are proving that they are narrow minded and can't handle the truth reveals by outsiders.    Singapore has no hope with such quality of lawyers and a dictator who die die must serve his own purpose.   What is so difficult for these people to accept the report by IBA, what are stated on the report are facts and IBA did give good recommendations.    MM Lee might as well turn Singapore into a communist country.    Getting million dollar salary but the attitude they (ministers) have is appalling.  </span></p>

              <p>Sat, Jul 12, 2008 - AsiaOne</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S Law Society has replied to criticism from the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute that it does not speak out enough on law reform issues here.</p>
              <p>It does, said the society, on issues the government refers to it. It has been consulted in at least 30 instances in the last three years. Examples it cited included proposed amendments to the Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act in 2006, and the proposed amendments to the Penal Code in 2007.</p>
              <p>The Law Society issued its statement after its executive council, headed by Senior Counsel Michael Hwang, met yesterday.</p>
              <p>In essence, the society said the Human Rights Institute's comments, made in a report issued on Wednesday, were based on 'an incomplete appreciation of the position of the society and its relationship with the Government'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A self-regulatory body for the 3,500 practising lawyers in Singapore, the society's powers are governed by the Legal Profession Act, in particular Section 38(1)(c).</p>
              <p>The latter is 'commonly interpreted to mean it does not have the statutory right to comment on matters not submitted to it,' said the society. The current shape of Section 38 dates back to 1986, after the government curbed the society's powers to comment on legislation by limiting them to 'legislation submitted to it'.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics. -   ==&gt;</span><span style="color: #000000;">  Question:  This statement is from MM Lee or the lawyers ? -   I have doubt.   If it is from the lawyers, the lawyers are proving that they are narrow minded and can't handle the truth reveals by outsiders.    Singapore has no hope with such quality of lawyers and a dictator who die die must serve his own purpose.   What is so difficult for these people to accept the report by IBA, what are stated on the report are facts and IBA did give good recommendations.    MM Lee might as well turn Singapore into a communist country.    Getting million dollar salary but the attitude they (ministers) have is appalling. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The statement that you have marked in red - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics"</em></span> - is from the Law Society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the 1980s, when JBJ gained his seat in Parliament, he was also active in the Law Society, and had Francis Seow and a group of lawyers keen to help him to get the Law Society to perform its social and national duties - as was defined in the constitution of the Law Society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For its dedicated persistence to contribute its expertise to review new Bills presented to Parliament for passage into Laws, the Government rejected the Law Societies's social responsibility as political interference in government affairs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In particular, Francis Seow - as President of the Law Society in 1986 - was accused by the Government of using the Law Society as a political platform to steer it into a collision course with the government. [see reference 1 below]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The challenge resulted in a clash in the High Court, in which several outspoken lawyers clashed with then PM LKY - which saw court rules and decorum disregarded when LKY rode roughshod over everyone, even revealing the private NUS records of a lawyer cheating in his university examination.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">About a year later, in 1987 - some of the lawyers were nailed as Communists, when they were found to be social activists in the Catholic Church, and had also offered their legal training to represent some foreign industrial workers. [see references 2 to 5 below]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Their idealistic actions were seen to be threading on the exclusive grounds of the Trade Unions - an area which the Government saw as their exclusive preserve, and from which they know that any politcal activism amongst the labor force can be detrimental to their political position. [see reference 6 below]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The result of the clash with the Law Society, saw the birth of the Academy of Law created by then PM LKY - to rival the Law Society. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Academy of Law was touted as the social place for the <em>creme d'la creme</em> or the upper crust from the legal community.</span></p>

              <p><br>to sue or not to sue doesn't depend on how many lawyers one side has got. it is whether you got a water-tight case or not.</p>
              <p>if the suit is tried here in singapore, then it is a foregone conclusion. however, singapore may not have the legal muscle to push IBA to stand trial here.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The statement that you have marked in red - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"The society had irked the Government with its criticisms on laws curbing foreign publications that comment negatively on domestic politics"</em></span> - is from the Law Society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the 1980s, when JBJ gained his seat in Parliament, he was also active in the Law Society, and had Francis Seow and a group of lawyers keen to help him to get the Law Society to perform its social and national duties - as was defined in the constitution of the Law Society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For its dedicated persistence to contribute its expertise to review new Bills presented to Parliament for passage into Laws, the Government rejected the Law Societies's social responsibility as political interference in government affairs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In particular, Francis Seow - as President of the Law Society in 1986 - was accused by the Government of using the Law Society as a political platform to steer it into a collision course with the government. [see reference 1 below]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The challenge resulted in a clash in the High Court, in which several outspoken lawyers clashed with then PM LKY - which saw court rules and decorum disregarded when LKY rode roughshod over everyone, even revealing the private NUS records of a lawyer cheating in his university examination.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">About a year later, in 1987 - some of the lawyers were nailed as Communists, when they were found to be social activists in the Catholic Church, and had also offered their legal training to represent some foreign industrial workers. [see references 2 to 5 below]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Their idealistic actions were seen to be threading on the exclusive grounds of the Trade Unions - an area which the Government saw as their exclusive preserve, and from which they know that any politcal activism amongst the labor force can be detrimental to their political position. [see reference 6 below]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The result of the clash with the Law Society, saw the birth of the Academy of Law created by then PM LKY - to rival the Law Society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Academy of Law was touted as the social place for the <em>creme d'la creme</em> or the upper crust from the legal community.</span></p>

              <p><br>Thanks for your reply.   Now we can confirm that Mafia Lee and his triad gang are in control of Law Society.    Shake my head.   Nothing escapes Mafia Lee, he is always on his guard to wipe out anybody,  any external parties which pose threat to him. </p>
