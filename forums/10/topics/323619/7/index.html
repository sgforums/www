I am finding this exchange to be more entertaining then the previous crack-pots with a fetish for animal names.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you shown me to flip-flop, or have my replies not merely follow your flip-flop meandering ways of arguing your points ? There is no point in this kiddy blame game, as each time when you slip up into a flip, I will show you where you have flop.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your displayed ability in differentiating between "<em>stupidity</em>" and "<em>smart</em>" - "<em>implosion</em>" and "<em>explosion</em>" - and your ability to create "<em>untrue lies</em>" - can anyone be safe with your expert observations and interpretations of anything ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already explained why i use the word implosion instead of explosion and u seems to have forgotten about it. Tis is an analogy I chosen based on your description but u just clearly ignore it</span> </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I ignored your point made on this subject, or any other points that you have made when I have very carefully addressed each of your item posted - especially with the exchanges on this item receiving our comments from Pg 3 to Pg 5 of this thread ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your first introduction of the word "<em>implosion</em>" was on Pg 3 - 10 Jul 08 10.22AM, and it is in your use of the word "implosion" as an inaccurate replacement for my phrase "Karakatoa volcanic outburst". This caused the current friction when you refused<span style="color: #0000ff;"> to allow me to link your "china's severe corruption" to an implied China's collapse.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Having suggested China's severe corruption, you did not give any conclusion as to what will happen from the severe corruption - as you prefer to elaborate the many unethical, unreliable practises when dealing amongst themselves or with others.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If implosion does not result in collapse where does it lead to in its final destructive form compared to a "Karakatoa volcanic outburst" of pent-up Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;">emotion</span> ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where can Singapore pent up emotion released in a "Karakator volcanic explosion" lead us to - have you any past experience to fall back on to know its outcome ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you choose the word "<em>implosion</em>" that clearly will result in collapse ? Do you know what is an implosion, and how an implosion takes effect, and its results ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you believe that squeezing will result in an implosion, have you seen what happens when you squeeze a tube of tooth paste - does it result in an "implosion" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Having made your cursory comment with your Singapore <em>"implosion</em>" - you continue with y</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">our ingeneous argument that "China's high level of corruption"  can "screw up big time"; digressing into its various unreliable and untrustworthy trade practices, and infringements with copy rights - all this said and done without referring to its final social or political consequences, even when your assumed Singapore "implosion" suggests alot more destructive results.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet you will make comparison of China's corruption and trade practices to some unrelated comparison with Singapore's glowing "political stability".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your efforts are no more then some Ingenius comparison and incoherent-relating of events that flip-flop as you meander from one end to the other - without coming to any clear conclusion even in some dubious ways.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you believe that China's serious corruption will not result in a collapse of the system, your should try digesting the following extract from Pg 5 of 25 of a report - "<em>Anticorruption and Building a Harmonious Society</em>" :</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://louisville.edu/asiandemocracy/01-zhou.pdf">Chinese official corruption, at least, was one of the main grienances of the Tiananmen Square Incident of 1989. It should be noted that many Chinese corruption has become the principal affliction leading to social upheaval…poins out that corruption among the Chinese government and party officials is a major reason for dissatisfaction among 1.3 billion Chinese people during the transition from socialism to a market economy. The CPC cannot survive without the triumph of anti-corruption.  </a></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">All tis while I have refrained from making conclusions with justification but it seems u just love to keep using it. Is okie, makes your replies more wordy and less people to read it</span></span></p>

There is one tat say a "democratic economy" is making economic decisions just to be popular. Your explanation seems to be twisted to suit your indian and china example. In fact it doesn't make sense why "democratic" and not "non intervention" is used since it is not about voting or majority rules or anything to do with democracy.</p>

              <p><em>In the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, another immigration category launched in June of 2006, 586 applications were received by the end of the year. The scheme is designed to attract talented people from overseas and the Chinese mainland to settle in the region.</em></p>

According to a report from Atobe, several billion of dollars of investors dollars r still coming to singapore despite the high cost. Why is tat so ? If u talk about HQ, the number of people is obviously not as high as industrial. However they still spend money, need staff and people and tis is still good for our economy.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am surprised that you are such a fan of Atobe to remember some report that was referred by him that had investors dumping several billion of dollars into Singaopre  ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely you are not so desparate for Atobe to accept your "black &amp; white" way of thinking that conclude with a perverse "Stupid-is-smart" maxim ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You did not say as much that "<em>cost of production is important</em>" or "<em>doubt tat or say tat is wrong</em>" - but you surely did emphasise that Political Stability is all important, almost the primary factor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Despite the "political stability" that Singapore provide, there are investments that made concious decision to stay away from Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Investments from </span><span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GK16Ae01.html">UK Warwick Universtity and Australia’s New South Wales University  </a><span style="color: #0000ff;">were decisive in not investing in Singapore despite the "political stability" - and which made a dent into Singapore's ambtion to be an 'Educational Hub'.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are other investments that also have decided not to invest in Singapore despite all the favorable factors that include Political Stability - and this is due to the size of the domestic market.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that the varous Bio-Tech Industries will stay any longer in Singapore when the R&amp;D funds or Tax Holidays have expired ?</span></span> </p>

And if u cannot compete, cannot have a high training, then your life is gonna be terrible since the rich poor gap has increased.

              <h1>Raising the bar</h1>
              <p class="info">Jul 17th 2008<br>From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>
              <h2>A rare slip-up in court by Singapore’s elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew</h2>
              <p>MEMBERS of Singapore’s government are notorious sticklers for legal exactitude. So it has been interesting to watch the reaction after the country’s elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew—a British-trained lawyer before he became a politician—gave inaccurate testimony in the trial of two opposition leaders.</p>
              <p>In May Mr Lee testified in a hearing to decide damages against Chee Soon Juan, the leader of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and his sister, Chee Siok Chin, for defaming the former prime minister and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, who is now prime minister himself. Mr Lee senior claimed that after the London-based International Bar Association (IBA) held its annual conference in Singapore last October, its president sent a letter to the Law Society of Singapore praising the country’s justice system. It has since emerged that there was no such laudatory letter.</p>
              <p>Mr Chee (who along with his sister was briefly jailed for contempt for accusing the judge in his case of bias) tried unsuccessfully to have the hearing reconvened in the light of Mr Lee’s incorrect testimony. Mr Lee’s counsel, Davinder Singh, wrote to the court on July 9th admitting that his client was wrong about the letter but noting that the IBA’s president, Fernando Pombo, had praised Singapore’s “outstanding judiciary” in a speech at the start of the conference. Mr Singh argues that what matters is that the IBA did praise Singaporean justice, not whether it did so in a speech or a letter. Mr Chee says there is a difference: the speech was made before the conference, where criticisms of the justice system were aired. Mr Lee was claiming, in effect, that the IBA was still impressed after this.</p>
              <p>By coincidence, on July 9th the IBA’s Human Rights Institute issued a report criticising the use of defamation suits by the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) to silence the opposition and the press, and expressing concerns about the independence and impartiality of Singapore’s judges. The law ministry has rejected the IBA’s report, pointing out that Singapore’s legal system has won excellent ratings in other international surveys. Indeed, in cases not involving the country’s leaders, there is no dispute about its quality. As for the IBA’s worries about cases involving PAP figures, the law ministry claims that the IBA failed to substantiate its “grave” allegations with evidence, though its report does discuss several worrying cases.</p>
              <p>America’s State Department, which is in rather less danger of being sued by the PAP than are the opposition or newspapers, has expressed concern about judicial independence in political cases in Singapore. In its latest human-rights report, in March, the department noted that the PAP’s consistent success in defamation suits against critics “led to a perception that the judiciary reflected the views of the ruling party in politically sensitive cases.”</p>
              <p>According to the <em>Straits Times</em> newspaper, Mr Lee on July 11th accused human-rights organisations of “a conspiracy to do us in”. He said that they saw that Russia and China had been studying Singapore’s success, and hence regarded it as a threat. Mr Lee and the government argue that doing things their way has made Singapore prosperous, orderly and corruption-free, and has earned international respect. The threat of defamation proceedings may make opposition politicians weigh their words more carefully than they do elsewhere. But Singaporean voters continue to buy the PAP’s argument that such constraints are a price worth paying—so far.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Let the show begins then. Lets see who is the one doing all the flip flopping</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Your first introduction of the word "<em>implosion</em>" was on Pg 3 - 10 Jul 08 10.22AM, and it is in your use of the word "implosion" as an inaccurate replacement for my phrase "Karakatoa volcanic outburst". This caused the current friction when you refused <span style="COLOR: #0000ff">to allow me to link your "china's severe corruption" to an implied China's collapse.</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually I am amused at u, still looking at the word implosion despite explanation on my side. Wat r your challenges against me ? One word differences, one number difference and tat is your most serious allegation on me while I pointed out your dishonesty, your refusal to answer any questions, your flip flopping of points as well as fill to the brim with insults and name calling. If u insist on being so unhappy tat I choose the word implosion to signal the collpase under pressure of the society, then so be it lor</p>
              <blockquote><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Having suggested China's severe corruption, you did not give any conclusion as to what will happen from the severe corruption - as you prefer to elaborate the many unethical, unreliable practises when dealing amongst themselves or with others.</span></span><br></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U r arguing out of point. I state tat "singapore is more political stable than china because china has corruption". Tis statement is similar to tis "A is lighter than B because B is fatter". Now the irony is tat, why does B being fatter means I have to extrapolate the end state of B ? R u forcing me to state tat B must have diabetes in future, B cannot do exercise, B will collapse because of its weight etc etc which is totally out of point. The fact is A is lighter than B because B is fatter. Tat is it. Wat happened to B in the end has nothing to do with A</p>
              <blockquote><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">If you believe that squeezing will result in an implosion, have you seen what happens when you squeeze a tube of tooth paste - does it result in an "implosion" ?</span><br></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think u r again trying to lie on wat I am claiming. I said tat society implode like a how a submarine can implode if the outside pressure is more than it can handle. It is failure under high pressure, which is wat u r describing for the society example. Did I mention toothpaste or squeezing out toothpaste ? Implosion is a more violent reaction to high pressure, much like explosion which collpase out while implosion is collpase in</p>
              <p><br>I read the rest of your passage, it just dwells on these 2 points. The use of the word "implosion" and forcing me to make a conclusion which is irrelevant to my discussion. Is the the only thing u can say about the argument on china etc ? Now let me show my displeasure at your debating in tis topic<br><br>1. The stand which I had stated is always the same, summarised in the reply on 15 Jul 1028 am<br><em>I said tat political stability is a plus point and tat is why singapore still attracts investors. I say tis political stability is better than china and other countries in the region. <br></em><br><em>But I did not say singapore got more investment than china. There r many other factors china have which singapore do not, such as a large market and low cost etc. But singapore still manage its own niche area and still attract investors because they r better in political stability.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><br>Have u ever shown tat I flip flop from the original stand I made ? No. U r just playing with words and number all the while</p>
              <p><br>2. I had posed a question repeatedly which is left unanswered. According to u, singapore still attract a lot of investors. Since cost is a big issue now, why does singapore still succeed in attracting investors ? However u repeatedly ignore tis question which shows your sincerity in discussing</p>
              <p><br>3. U start to claim tat singapore is not political stable because it can<span style="color: #000000;"> lead to a "krakatoa volcanic eruption". It is basically a hypothesis which u can never  prove since it is looking into the future, which u clearly cannot, and society now is not showing such signs. Tis is wild guesses which I point it out and u seemed to be unhappy about it. U claimed I made wild guesses on china corruption which i can prove using the words from Hu jintao. Tis shows your accusation as wrong. </span></p>
              <p><br>4. Then u lie and claimed I conclude china is gonna collapse. There is nothing I had said tat suggests tat and u give up trying to prove it <br><br>5. When it is clear u failed to read properly, u accused me of writing badly. Tis again has never been substantiated except for the single word "implosion". Let me question u staight. Does tis single word totally deviate the whole meaning in the sentence ? All these r metophors, and implosion or explosion r violent processes. Just because we view the collapsing differently according to your example, u cannot comprehend the whole sentence ? <br><br>6. Then on the reply u stated on 10 Jul 1243 u claimed china is not gonna collapse<br><br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Fortunately, present measure have been taken to stop the spread of corruption, clear and systematic laws have been passed to deal with this problem, and the machinery to investigate, prosecute and sentence the corrupt have been put in place.</span></em><br><br>then on the reply earlier at 18 jul 144 am</p>
              <p><br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">If you believe that China's serious corruption will not result in a collapse of the system, your should try digesting the following extract from Pg 5 of 25 of a report -</span></em><br>U had flip flopped on your stand on china corruption and whether will it collapse or not<br><br>7. Then now u r forcing me to make a conclusion on the effect on corruption on china eventually. Tat is totally out of point to the fact i wanna bring it out. <br><br>Lets see how u answer to these charges on tis discussion</p>
              <p><br>Now lets see your argument on "right minded"</p>
              <p><br>1. The argument on right minded started when u state <br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Would any right minded persons make false claims ?</span></em><br>Tis is in response to the sentence which I said tat<em> </em><br><em>Depends on whether u encourage people to make false claims or not</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><br>2. Then I said, in the world now almost everybody make flase claims in politics. I show the example of rumors on obama, south korea's beef issue, president of USA and Taiwan. If all these abundance of example of people who make false claims r not right minded, how can u trust singaporean to be right minded ?<br><br>3. U response <br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Are these instances - that you have given - the works of "right minded persons" ?</span></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><br>Tis shows your sincerity again by not answering whether do u believe all singaporean can be right minded. <br><br>4. I state tat presidents r already not considered right minded according to u, then the men on the street will be worse. It is impossible for everyone in society to be right minded</p>
              <p><br>5. Again u refuse to answer whether do u think singapore population can all be right minded and u just repeat the point on geroge bush being not "right minded"<br>Tis type of exchanges repeated. My point is "can u believe all singaporean to be right minded" and your answer is always "George bush etc r all not right minded". U r simply repeating an old point which doesn't answer the underlying question tat I asked. Wat is tis ? Dishonesty and again a lack of courage to answer the questions posed</p>
              <p><br>6. Then u issue a challenge for me</p>
              <p><br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">What examples have you given to prove - <span style="COLOR: #000000">tat despite being in a modern economy, being in a democratic nation and being educated doesn't make u "right minded"</span> ?</span></em></p>
              <p>I am not a coward like u and refuse to answer question or quote examples. Since u wanted examples of people being in a modern economy, democratic nation, educated and not right minded, I give u a ton of examples (which u accused of not right minded before) such as george bush, chen shui bian, dick cheney etc. Can u tell me which area these examples r not relevant to the ones u seek ? They all r in modern economy, they all r in a democratic nation and they all r educated. According to u yourself, they all r not right minded. Wat is wrong with these examples ?</p>
              <p><br>7. And then now wat ? U just hurl a mountain of verbal abuses out. U twist words, hurl insults and give no points except to use it to dismiss other people point. Tat shows u r uncivilised by using verbal abuses to other people points.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Is it not obvious that the "right-minded" ones will know how not to be manipulated ?</span><br><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Is it the right thing to do to be "<em>standing up against the many fuel subsidies removal from democratic countries</em>" ?</span><br><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Do you think there are no one opposing the 50,000 ?</span><br><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Is not obvious that the "right minded" people knows what is right in not confronting the volatile 50,000 ?</span><br></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In reality, u have not shown any right minded people doing anything. U have not shown tat all or most singaporean r right minded, given your stringent requirement  tat even presidents failed. U have not show tat tis right minded people can stand up against the people who r not "right minded" as u claimed in<br><br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">This require</span></span> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/right-minded"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“right minded”.  </span></span></a></span><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">persons to stand-up and resist those who are wilfully wrong, perverse, misguided, - and those determined to control by deceit, avarice, double-dealings. ?</span></span></em></p>
              <p><em></em><br>U stated tat right minded people do not dare stand up against the 50,000 'wrong minded' individsuals, then your above point tat they will stand up and resist them is hogwash.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Did I lie, or have you forgotten where you flop after you did your infamous flip ?</span><br></blockquote>
              <p> </p>

              <p>U r getting out of point here again. Earlier u claim tat there is a term called "democratic economy" and u define it as</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><em>Democracy in economics is to allow the citizens to exercise their rights to achieve their economic goals with as little governmental interference as possible - that limit the business or entrepreneurial potentials; while the government's responsibility is to provide all the assistance possiible</em></span></p>
              <p>Which basically means no intervention by the gov when starting business. Then u paste the below text with a report behind</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/papers/economic-goverance.htm"><em>For governance is really a notion to convey what government is for and how it is best carried out. In other words, it implies a close association between the political domain and, first, the economic domain for which it is meant to deliver the 'what', and, secondly, the social domain via which it is meant to achieve the 'how'.  </em></a></p>
              <p>Let me see... is there anything here tat talk about non gov intervention ? No. Did the report define the term "democratic economy" ? Nope. I have searched all the word democratic and economy and they never use tis term at all. The above further confirms my theory tat u r just giving out a new term and confusing everybody.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.syl.com/bc/briefreviewofautocraticanddemocraticmanagementstyles.html"><em>According to researches, employees are very sensitive not only to what orders are given, but also to how they are given. Management theories embody four main leadership management styles. Those are autocratic, democratic, laissez-faire and exceptional management styles.</em>  </a></p>
              <p>Lets look at tis one. We r talking about "democratic economy", but u give out "democratic leadership". Democratic leader make sense since decision is taken by voting of the people. But democratic leader is NOT equal to democratic economy. U r trying to confuse people here.</p>
              <p>Hereby I can conclude, there is no such thing as "democratic economy", it is a term u imagined out, then twist to watever u want and it just confuse everybody. It shows again u r a lier</p>

              <p>Lets not lose focus on the discussion of the above up till now. </p>
              <p>1. U leave out the name of china from the list of millionaires in the region</p>
              <p>2. When I ask u why do u leave it out, u started to accuse me saying tat hong kong is china and tat I did not understand the situation. U say tat u mention hong kong is equal to mention china. And u had put in china inside the list by putting in hong kong</p>
              <p>3. When i point out tat your report had listed china differently from hong kong, u accuse me of not knowing hong kong is part of china and even quote out sentences trying to sound as though I write hong kong is not part of china. Tis turn out to be either a lie of yours or your weak comprehension skill</p>
              <p>4. Then suddenly flip flop and say tat u purposely leave out china because it is not democratic, which it turns out tat I am originally right about u purposely leaving out china and reporting half truth</p>
              <p>Wat is your comment on tis ? It is clear as day u have flop flop in your stand and then u should be brave enough to acknowledge it. Otherwise u have to explain explicitly why u made such a contradictory remarks.</p>
              <p>I have found another flip flop in your reply</p>

Wow... then the state and economy of the country is largely independent of the gov since even a country, with no resources like us and having a terrible gov can climb to such a high position. Then from your remarks, it can be concluded the success of a country is largely independent of the gov. U know why switzerland and japan r better than singapore. Because singaporean suck. Do u know why iraqis and zimbawean r in poor state now ? Because they suck. Since the gov is so useless, then why not the whole world sack their gov and go anarchy ? </span></p>

              <p>Actually I am amused at u, still looking at the word implosion despite explanation on my side. Wat r your challenges against ? One words differences, one number difference and tat is your most serious allegation on me while I pointed out your dishonesty, your refusal to answer any questions, your flip flopping of points as well as fill to the brim with insults and name calling. If u insist on being so unhappy tat I choose the word implosion to signal the collpase under pressure of the society, then so be it lor</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you been able to point to any dishonesty on anyone's part - without pointing at your own ? Or have you been avoiding the real issues by beating around the bush ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are the words insults filled to the brim, or simply the truth about the perverse style that reflects your character that begin in the nick that you have chosen - "stupid-is-smart" ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Having suggested China's severe corruption, you did not give any conclusion as to what will happen from the severe corruption - as you prefer to elaborate the many unethical, unreliable practises when dealing amongst themselves or with others.</span></span></p>
              <p>U r arguing out of point. I state tat "singapore is more political stable than china because chian have corruption". Tis statement is similar to tis "A is lighter than B because B is fatter". Now the irony is tat, why does B being fatter means I have to extrapolate the end state of B ? R u forcing me to state tat B must have diabetes in future, B cannot do exercise B will collapse because of its weight which is totally out of point. The fact is A is lighter than B being B is fatter. Tat is it. Wat happened to B in the end has nothing to do with A</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is my argument out of point ? Or are you attempting to avoid the real issue by obfuscating the issue in your typical disingenuous way ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You did suggest that my character "A" is lighter and with the organs starving of nutrients and whose "outburst" will result in your preferred "implosion" - that will result in your preferred "collapse" from sheer weakness.  Having been so quick and able to diagnose the final end to Character "A"  - why will you hesistate to conclude that Charater "B" severe overweight will surely lead to diabetes with kidney failure and early death as the final end ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do I have to force you to state, or should it not be a logical comparison of both Characters "A" being starved and light weight that you insist will "implode"- but will not come to any conclusion with Character "B" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not flip-flopping your way out of your own hole that you have been digging yourself into ?</span></p>

              <p>I think u r again trying to lie on wat I am claiming. I said tat society implode like a how a submarine can implode if the outside pressure is more than it can handle. It is failure under high pressure, which is wat u r describing for the society example. Did I mention toothpaste or squeezing out toothpaste ? Implosion is a more violent reaction to high pressure, much like explosion which collpase out while implosion is collpase in</p>
              <p>I read the rest of your passage, it just dwells on these 2 points. The use of the word "implosion" and forcing me to make a conclusion which is irrelevant to my discussion. Is the the only thing u can say about the argument on china etc ? Now let me show my displeasure at your debating in tis topic<br><br>1. The stand which I had stated is always the same, summarised in the reply on 15 Jul 1028 am<br><em>I said tat political stability is a plus point and tat is why singapore still attracts investors. I say tis political stability is better than china and other countries in the region.<br></em><br><em>But I did not say singapore got more investment than china. There r many other factors china have which singapore do not, such as a large market and low cost etc. But singapore still manage its own niche area and still attract investors because they r better in political stability.</em></p>

              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">You did suggest that my character "A" is lighter and with the organs starving of nutrients and whose "outburst" will result in your preferred "implosion" - that will result in your preferred "collapse" from sheer weakness.  Having been so quick and able to diagnose the final end to Character "A"  - why will you hesistate to conclude that Charater "B" severe overweight will surely lead to diabetes with kidney failure and early death as the final end ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Again a dishonest claim u made. The description I am talking about A is my impression of your claims on A. Lets look back at history again</p>
              <p>1.  <em>I think your theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses</em>.</p>
              <p>on the reply 10 jul 1022 am. Tis is the first "description" of A on implosion. Notice the word "your theory", Atobe's Theory</p>
              <p>2. Which is derived from your reply on 10 Jul 123</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><em>The <strong>pent-up social pressures</strong> may lead to a Krakatoa volcanic outburst, when social, economic and political stresses takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to sudden political swings that are unpredictable.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="color: #000000;">3. In here, if u have extreme pressure on u, it implodes, which is something u do not agree. All the while we r arguing on the choice of word on "implosion"</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="color: #000000;">So did I ever claim tat A is gonna "implode" or "collapse" ? I only claim my interpretation of your wild guess. I never claim A is dead or something. Similarly, I never claim B is gonna die from diabetes as well. All tis r your claims. And u flip flop and claim B has different outcomes as well. Your argument of forcing me to come out with a conclusion of B is groundless and lacking of sincerity. It seems u have not answered my previous points which I had proved and brought up. Why don't u try to answer them first ? BTW, U add a number 8 in tis reply</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">1. The stand which I had stated is always the same, summarised in the reply on 15 Jul 1028 am<br><em>I said tat political stability is a plus point and tat is why singapore still attracts investors. I say tis political stability is better than china and other countries in the region.<br></em><br><em>But I did not say singapore got more investment than china. There r many other factors china have which singapore do not, such as a large market and low cost etc. But singapore still manage its own niche area and still attract investors because they r better in political stability.</em></span></p>
              <p><br>Have u ever shown tat I flip flop from the original stand I made ? No. U r just playing with words and number all the while</p>
              <p><br>2. I had posed a question repeatedly which is left unanswered. According to u, singapore still attract a lot of investors. Since cost is a big issue now, why does singapore still succeed in attracting investors ? However u repeatedly ignore tis question which shows your sincerity in discussing</p>
              <p><br>3. U start to claim tat singapore is not political stable because it can <span style="COLOR: #000000">lead to a "krakatoa volcanic eruption". It is basically a hypothesis which u can never  prove since it is looking into the future, which u clearly cannot, and society now is not showing such signs. Tis is wild guesses which I point it out and u seemed to be unhappy about it. U claimed I made wild guesses on china corruption which i can prove using the words from Hu jintao. Tis shows your accusation as wrong. </span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #000000;">4. Then u lie and claimed I conclude china is gonna collapse. There is nothing I had said tat suggests tat and u give up trying to prove it<br><br>5. When it is clear u failed to read properly, u accused me of writing badly. Tis again has never been substantiated except for the single word "implosion". Let me question u staight. Does tis single word totally deviate the whole meaning in the sentence ? All these r metophors, and implosion or explosion r violent processes. Just because we view the collapsing differently according to your example, u cannot comprehend the whole sentence ?<br><br>6. Then on the reply u stated on 10 Jul 1243 u claimed china is not gonna collapse<br><br><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Fortunately, present measure have been taken to stop the spread of corruption, clear and systematic laws have been passed to deal with this problem, and the machinery to investigate, prosecute and sentence the corrupt have been put in place.</span></em><br><br>then on the reply earlier at 18 jul 144 am</span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">If you believe that China's serious corruption will not result in a collapse of the system, your should try digesting the following extract from Pg 5 of 25 of a report -</span></em><br>U had flip flopped on your stand on china corruption and whether will it collapse or not<br><br>7. Then now u r forcing me to make a conclusion on the effect on corruption on china eventually. Tat is totally irrelevant to the discussion or the point which I wanna bring out</span>
              </p><p><span style="color: #000000;">8. Then u claim I made conclusion on singapore collapse. Tis is again another fabricated lie since I never claim singapore is collapsing and it is all derivation from your wild guess</span></p>

They all r in modern economy, they all r in a democratic nation and they all r educated. Accoridng to u, they all r not right minded. Wat is wrong with these examples ?</p>
              <p>7. U claim tat "right minded people" will "stand up" against people who r not "right minded" in a democracy. I asked u where r the people during the korea beef standoff u have no reply. I ask u where r the right minded people when democratic countries people r asking for fuel subsidy and u have no reply</p>
              <p>8. U also flip flop when u first mention tat the korea who r protesting in the US beef issue not being right minded. Then u later try to support these group of people when they protest. Doesn't tat give the conclusion u r not right minded ? U also make a lot of false claims as well, from the many examples I have shown. Then u have shown u r not right minded as well isn't it ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were you wrongly accused ? Were the words so simply put in the manner that you have stated ? Am I so careless to mention - "<em>hong kong is equal to mention china</em>" </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>Would you believe that China was intentionally left out as bait for an expected outburst from you ?</strong></em></span></p>
              <p>So explain tis sentence u had made. U claim u had put china into the picture by stating hong kong. Did u or did u not mean tat ?  Hong kong is part of china is a fact no one is disputing. The dispute is on u purposefully removing china from the name and u claiming u have put china's name in by listing only hong kong. China is more than hong kong and your report had listed them differently as well.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If u r gentlemanly enough to acknowledge u should have put china inside the list, or u purposefully not put in the name becaue it is not democratic then there will be no conflicts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The problem is, u claim u had put china name in by listing hong kong.

Your point 9 and 10 explicitly say I make a mistake about your report and "flip flopping" my way out. However I clarify my position by telling u your report is stating hong kong is trying its very best to pull in millionaires as well, which can only give a inconclusive conclusion since no one knew how many singapore immigrants r pulled in. After tis, u never mention about your so called "10 points" of evidence again. In fact u begin to fight in another tangent based ont he report.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I did not say tat the 66660 millionaires r all home grown. Did I ever state tat all the millionaires r home grown ? NO. Another lie which u fabricated on my replies. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I only state tat Hong kong and singapore r both trying their best to attract millionaires over.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Again I rope in complaints from the public, staff suggestion and even listed following certain international criticisms</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">13 jul 1232</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Frankly speaking I do not understand wat r u trying to say here.

              <p>Again I am trying to tell u complaints from NORMAL citizen r taken. U still ignore it</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you know what is the meaning of the term : "<em>pent-up</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Further, from the same paragraph that you have extracted - can you discern the choice of words which reflect the present day situation in Singapore - where current <em>"social, economic, and political stresses</em>"<em> </em>and that these will "takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to <em>"sudden political swings that are unpredictable</em>". </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for Character B, you certainly did not say B will die from diabetes, in the same way that you have not been saying that China's high level of corruption will result in her collapse - but iinstead you prefer to indicate that China will "screw up big time" by indulging in some "daylight raping" of intellectural properties and patent rights</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you can claim that Singapore will "implode" - which means "collapse" - as your external pressure will squeeze flat the Singapore vessel, causing its shape to collapse; why will you not dare say that China's high level of corruption will cause it to collapse too ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On Pg 5, 15Jul'08 8.06PM - my reply from this date alone will show several instances that showed you losing track in "who said what" - that also dealt with the investments that you claim China's severe corruption has made Singapore's stability to be more attractive for foreign investors - and which I showed that FDI into China is greater than Singapore despite your claim to China's severe corruption.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is another one of your typical out-of-focus point where you forget that it was your own claim that Singapore remain an attraction for investors.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We have been down this road before, in which your claim of political stability was deem by you to be a primary factor, and which you disputed the claim that the term "stability is a primary factor" was your term of reference, and which I had listed the frequencies of your replies that continuously emphasised "Singapore's stability".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why are you rehashing this matter again - by insisting that I have ignored replying your question, when I had also said that investors do not necessarily need to come to Singapore as in the case of HP, Canon or Epson printer manufacturers, or any other businesses that may find Singapore's cost too high for their business ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I have stated this before and repeating it again - and you seem to be satisfied only when a reply fits the mould and form that you expect : in which you insist that Singapore's stability is attractive to the high value industries such as petroleum, chemical, bio-tech industires. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I have stated that this is nonsense as the tax incentives and government grants given  in the initial stages may have attracted these industries here, but you disputed this claim.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any purpose to belabor this point by being misleading in your claim that I continue to ignore your question - which is mischieviously juvenile at best ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>3. U start to claim tat singapore is not political stable because it can <span style="color: #000000;">lead to a "krakatoa volcanic eruption". It is basically a hypothesis which u can never  prove since it is looking into the future, which u clearly cannot, and society now is not showing such signs. Tis is wild guesses which I point it out and u seemed to be unhappy about it. U claimed I made wild guesses on china corruption which i can prove using the words from Hu jintao. Tis shows your accusation as wrong. </span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #000000;">4. Then u lie and claimed I conclude china is gonna collapse.

Tis again has never been substantiated except for the single word "implosion". Let me question u staight. Does tis single word totally deviate the whole meaning in the sentence ? All these r metophors, and implosion or explosion r violent processes. Just because we view the collapsing differently according to your example, u cannot comprehend the whole sentence ?<br><br>6. Then on the reply u stated on 10 Jul 1243 u claimed china is not gonna collapse<br><br><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fortunately, present measure have been taken to stop the spread of corruption, clear and systematic laws have been passed to deal with this problem, and the machinery to investigate, prosecute and sentence the corrupt have been put in place.</span></em><br><br>then on the reply earlier at 18 jul 144 am</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. Can you be so sure that the PAP should lose more seats by Election 2010, and the Opposition Parties gaining more seats in the Singapore Parliament as time progresses ? Does this need to be proven, or should it remain as a hypothesis ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4. Did I lie by stating that you had "<em>concluded tat china is gonna collapse</em>", or have I not stated that I have done you a favor by projecting your line of argument towards this end, since your conclusion had avoided stating the obvious - when comparing Singapore's collapse by "implosion", while refusing to state China's final outcome with her state of "severe corruption" except to digress into "China will screw up big time, as she indulges in patent right infringements and abuses" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">5. Was it poor reading on my part, and poor wrriting on your part - or was it not a matter of your wilful intellectual dishonesty, when you will make a "decisive assumed conclusion" for Singapore, but will not do the same for China ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">6. Now you are being disingenious by extracting small sections of the exchanges that we had on this subject - which began with your infamous remark about China's severe corruption level {but refusing to give any conclusion despite giving one implosive remark for Singapore}, and with this continuing into a FDI comparison between China and Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">7. Your reply confirms my statement that you are intellectually dishonest - when you can claim Singapore consequence to be implosive {obviously destructive}, but will not given any eventual conclusion for China's state of "severe corruption".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">8. Does anyone need to make any "<em>wild guesses</em>" from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your conclusion</span> with the choice of word - "<em>implosion</em>" - to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my statement</span> about "<em>pent-up social pressures may lead to a Karakatoa social outburst</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not defined "<em>implosion</em>" as some outside pressure crushing inwards ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you now denying the use of the word "<em>implosion</em>" with its intended meaning that Singapore is crushed from some outside pressure ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The problem is with your reading skill - which you refused to accept - in grabbing some headlines, and missing out on other parts of my text - {"see the tree but losing sight of the forest"}.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span></strong> believed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> "<em>Karakatoa outburst</em>" from "<em>pent-up pressures"</em> will lead to an "<em>implosion</em>" - a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conclusion that you assumed</span> that I have intended - but you failed to read the end of my paragraph which had stated: "...<em>that leads to sudden political swings that are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unpredictable</span></em>". </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is the word "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unpredictable</span></em>" comparable to your word "<em>implosion</em>" that surely leads one to think of a very decisive and conclusive end for Singapore ?</span> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I lied in any way about your claims ? You seem to be fixated with making me into a liar through your creative delusionary interpretations to my replies.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now are you not dishonestly mixing two different points into one, simply to create confusion to allow yourself to be extricated from a hole you have dug yourself into ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The first point was concerning Singapore's "Karakatoa explosion" with your very conclusive definition to the word "implosion", which was followed by your coyness in giving a similarly conclusive or possible outcome for China's severe corruption.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The second was about your CEO decision to invest in Singapore, or Zimbabwe or the Congo.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why are you now lumping this two points into one issue ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Again another unjustified conclusion followed by mud slinging. Is tat all u can do now ? Making unjustified conclusions ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Your first point is invalid because it is derives from your interpretation of singapore. I never claimed a conclusion for singapore nor china simply because I cannot see the future which u always appear to do.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Congo and zimbabwe are examples of the other extreme end of political stability. Generally CEO of firms do not go about investing in countries with low political stability to safeguard themselves. And political stability is the point i wanna bring out</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now you are such a genius in arguing that I am making unjustified conclusions - is it not due to the fact that my reply do not fit your preferred agenda ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I give you the appearance of my ability to see the future even when I had made the following end remark to my statement concerning Singapore's "<em>pent-up emotion</em>" will lead to "<em>sudden plitical swings that are unpredictable</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So it is also to be my fault for your conclusion that Singapore will "<em>implode</em>" due to the "<em>pent-up pressures leading to a Karakatoa outburst</em>" ? Or should it not be due to your poor and careless reading skills in grabbing the emotional phrase, and missed out the less exciting end remark ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not due to your poor skills in argument that result in my point to become invalid ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You have now disinegeously elevated yourself from not only being "Stupid-is-Smart" but also to become "Stupid-is-Genius"</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even as Hong Kong attempt to draw foreign talent, they are not as vigorous as to increase their population by 50 per cent, and they have shown that there are only 1,910 migrants who are determined as millionaires.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am surprised that you will not risk making some reasonable assumptions from Singapore's immigrant numbers, but you will make an "authoratative <em>wild guess</em>" that Singapore will "<em>implode</em>" - based on my clear statement that "<em>pent-up pressures and Karakatoa outbursts will lead to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unpredictable</span> political swings</em>".</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The problem is, u claim u had put china name in by listing hong kong. U also make tons of verbal abuses over sentences which u failed to read properly and u flip flop on your stand by stating u purposely not put in china. All tis is simply to show your flip flopping nature and your lack of understanding to other people statement and your own report.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On Pg 4 - 11Jul'08 4.45AM - I had posted the following statements:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Quote]</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Surely you are not serious in taking yourself so brilliantly to believe that a democratic and open society do not produce more millionaires ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Try reading the following 2007 report - </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1413615.php/Number_of_millionaires_surges_in_Asia">Number of millionaires surges in Asia – India leads the way  </a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1128060"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1128060</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">After reading this article, you will note that India - the leading democracy in Asia - has seen a surge of about 25,000 persons gaining millionaire status in the US$ denominated qualification.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Hong Kong saw an addition of more then 9,000 persons to boost its millionaires to a new high of 95,000 - followed by South Korea Indonesia and Singapore - all three countries preceding Singapore being more democratic compared to Singapore.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">[UnQuote]</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Both India and Hong Kong are considered democracies in Asia - politically, and as stated India had transformed its autocratic bureaucracy into a more democratic form to manage its economy in a more liberal and democratic ways than before. </span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">This was stated in my replies to you from Pg 3 to Pg 5 - why will you persist to justify your position taken in insisting a reply to suit your own agenda ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Should China be considered with India and Hong Kong - when the initial standard of measure was Political Democracies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Anticipating your habit of "arguing for the sake of argument" - I was expecting you to find some reasons to chip at my statement, and it was obvious that you will bring in the subject of China's millionaires.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You will note that China's political system may not be democratic at the national level, even as it attempt to introduce political responsibility at the village level by allowing villages to elect their own officials.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You will also note that even as China's national political system is not democratic, it has liberalise its economic management, successfully transforming the Stalinist Central Planning economy to a Market Based Economy. This has resulted in wealth creation to the masses, and saw millionaires amongst the more entrepreneurial and resourcefull Chinese.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you want to pursue your own argument - {about China being included} - outside of the terms of reference in my statement - {which only included millionaires from Asian democracies} ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I agreed on anything with my reply ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I print anything in the blank space between each lines with words as expressed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, you cannot be so desparate to this end ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">U remember your so called 10 points "evidence" of me "flip flopping" ? Your point 9 and 10 explicitly say I make a mistake about your report and "flip flopping" my way out. However I clarify my position by telling u your report is stating hong kong is trying its very best to pull in millionaires as well, which can only give a inconclusive conclusion since no one knew how many singapore immigrants r pulled in. After tis, u never mention about your so called "10 points" of evidence again. In fact u begin to fight in another tangent based ont he report. Isn't tat already u conceding your ten points r flukes</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">This has been argued in the paragraph above, and I cannot see any reason for you to return to this point again - but if you insist, I will give you additional reasons why you are wrong in your thinking.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Is Hong Kong targetting millionaires specifically, or are they targetting talents to help them establish Hong Kong as a Financial Hub ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Is Hong Kong's immigration policy as aggressive as Singapore's plans to increase our population size by 50 per cent from the present size ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">According to reference reports - given in the paragraphs before this - Singapore is reported to be targetting specifically foreign talents who are entrepreneurs, and also the successful professionals : in the field of Bio-Tech, Financial Market Managers or Consultants, Bankers, Specialist Lawyers, and mainly those from the Upper Income Bracket who are basically the million dollar wage earners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">Can Hong Kong immigration policy be comparable to Singapore's ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was there any flip-flop, when it was you who insisted that Singapore had 66,660 home grown Singaporean millionaires - and will not accept that many of these 66.660 are NOT home-grown Singaporeans - which led you to dispute that the larger number of  Hong Kong millionaires are similarly attracted from overseas ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I did not say tat the 66660 millionaires r all home grown. Did I ever state tat all the millionaires r home grown ? NO. Another lie which u fabricated on my replies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I only state tat Hong kong and singapore r both trying their best to attract millionaires over. Your report shows only f</span></p></blockquote>
