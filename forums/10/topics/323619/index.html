              <p>if this is a reply to my question, i don't think you are answering my question. i agree with all you said here, but is having `more' freedom individually impinging on economic progress. for instance, in HK, people do demonstrate occassionally on on certain issue, is HK any less competitive than singapore?

              <p>LOL, please if you want to come up with some retort, at the very least put a bit of thought into it instead of coming up with such a reply that not only takes nothing away from your opponent's position, but reflects poorly on your own ability to even make a basic rebuttal in any discussion.</p>
              <p>In any case, you don't seem to have read our chinese newpapers.</p>

              <p>The <a title="Informal fallacy" href="/wiki/Informal_fallacy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">informal fallacy</span></span></a> of <strong>false dilemma</strong> (also called <strong>false <a title="Dichotomy" href="/wiki/Dichotomy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">dichotomy</span></span></a></strong>, the <strong>either-or fallacy</strong>, or <strong>bifurcation</strong>) involves a situation in which only two alternatives are considered, when in fact there are other options. Closely related are failing to consider a range of options and the tendency to think in extremes, called black-and-white thinking. Strictly speaking, the prefix "di" in "dilemma" means "two". When a list of more than two choices are offered, but there are other choices not mentioned, then the fallacy is called the fallacy of false choice.</p>
              <p>When a person really does have only two choices, as in the classic short story <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="The Lady or the Tiger" href="/wiki/The_Lady_or_the_Tiger"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">The Lady or the Tiger</span></span></a></em>, then they are often said to be "on the horns of a dilemma".</p>
              <p>False dilemma can arise intentionally, when fallacy is used in an attempt to force a choice ("If you are not with us, you are against us.") But the fallacy can arise simply by accidental omission—possibly through a form of <a title="Wishful thinking" href="/wiki/Wishful_thinking"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">wishful thinking</span></span></a> or ignorance—rather than by deliberate deception.</p>
              <p>When two alternatives are presented, they are often, though not always, two extreme points on some spectrum of possibilities. This can lend credence to the larger argument by giving the impression that the options are <a title="Mutually exclusive events" href="/wiki/Mutually_exclusive_events"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">mutually exclusive</span></span></a>, even though they need not be. Furthermore, the options are typically presented as being <a title="Collectively exhaustive events" href="/wiki/Collectively_exhaustive_events"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">collectively exhaustive</span></span></a>, in which case the fallacy can be overcome, or at least weakened, by considering other possibilities, or perhaps by considering a whole spectrum of possibilities, as in <a title="Fuzzy logic" href="/wiki/Fuzzy_logic"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">fuzzy logic</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p><span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></p>
              <p><a id="Morton.27s_Fork" name="Morton.27s_Fork"></a></p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Morton's Fork</span></h3>
              <p>Very often a <a title="Morton's Fork" href="/wiki/Morton%27s_Fork"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Morton's Fork</span></span></a>, a choice between two equally unpleasant options, is a false dilemma. The phrase originates from an argument for taxing English nobles:</p>
              <dl><dd><em>"Either the nobles of this country appear wealthy, in which case they can be taxed for good; or they appear poor, in which case they are living frugally and must have immense savings, which can be taxed for good."</em> <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></span></a></sup> </dd></dl>
              <p>This is a false dilemma, because some members of the nobility may in fact lack liquid assets.</p>
              <p><a id="False_choice" name="False_choice"></a></p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">False choice</span></h3>
              <p>The presentation of a <em>false choice</em> often reflects a deliberate attempt to eliminate the middle ground on an issue. A modern example of this is <a title="George W. Bush" href="/wiki/George_W._Bush"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">George W. Bush</span></span></a>'s speech of September 20, 2001, in which he said</p>
              <dl><dd><em>Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.</em><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></span></a></sup> </dd></dl>
              <p><a id="Black_and_white_thinking" name="Black_and_white_thinking"></a></p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Black and white thinking</span></h3>
              <p>A common form of the false dilemma is <strong>black-and-white thinking</strong>. Many people routinely engage in black-and-white thinking, an example of which is feeling boundless optimism when things are going well and suddenly switching to total despair at the first setback. Another example is someone who labels other people as all good or all bad.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since June 2008">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">citation needed</span></span></a></em>]</span></sup></p>

              <h3><span class="mw-headline">There is no alternative</span></h3>
              <p>The assertion that there is no alternative is an example of the false dichotomy taken to its ultimate extreme, in which the options are reduced to one, the proposal of the speaker. Of course the speaker does not believe there are no alternatives otherwise he would not bother to argue the point; rather he opposes the alternatives and seeks to dismiss them by denying their existence.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"This was the mantra chanted by 'dries' during the prime ministerial reign of Margaret Thatcher, by which they demonstrated their belief that free-market capitalism was the only possible economic theory. It was said so often amongst them that it was shortened to TINA. The hard-right Thatcherites called themselves 'dries' to demonstrate their opposition to the 'wets', i.e. the One-Nation Tories whom Thatcher despised. Wet was the public school nickname for any boy who showed any sign of caring for his fellow beings."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since December 2007">[</span></sup></p>

              <p>Let me guess, u r trying to say tat we can have economic growth and complete political freedom at the same time. However from the viewpoint of some examples of countries, it do suggest tat political freedom can bring about economic woes. Let me ask u straight, if u r the CEO of a big organisation, will u invest in singapore (semi conductor, regional headquarter, biomedical, fuel processing) ? If u invest, why ? My only reason is because there is political stability here</p>
