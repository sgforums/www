              <blockquote>Response to IBA Human Rights Institute's Report
              <p>    The Ministry of Law has received
              various media requests for the Singapore Government's comments to the
              report released by the International Bar Association Human Rights
              Institute on 8 July 2008. It is a 72-page report.</p>
              <p>2. From a quick perusal of the Executive Summary, we note that IBAHRI has not taken into account <a href="http://notesapp.internet.gov.sg/__48256DF200173A1F.nsf/LookupMediaByKey/GOVI-7GDC4T/%24file/IBAHRI%20Singapore%27s%20response%209%20April%2008.pdf">our comments on their draft report</a>,
              sent on 9 April 2008. We release a copy of our comments previously
              given to the Chairman of the IBAHRI on the draft report, for your
              reference.</p>
              <p>3. The IBAHRI Report questions the independence of
              the Singapore Judiciary. This is contradicted by Mr Fernando Pombo,
              President of the IBA, who stated in his opening speech at the IBA
              Conference in Singapore last October that lawyers the world over were
              coming to Singapore because:</p>
              <p>"this country has an outstanding legal profession,
              an outstanding judiciary, an outstanding academical world in relation
              to the law".</p>
              <p>4. Other independent observers agree. The Political
              and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC), which rates Asian countries on
              their business and legal environments, regularly rates the Singapore
              judiciary highly. PERC's Asian Intelligence Report 2006 explained that
              this was because the Singapore judiciary demonstrated three essential
              elements of judicial independence. First, the courts and individual
              judges within the system are publicly perceived to be impartial in
              their decisions. Second, judicial decisions are accepted by contesting
              parties and the larger public. Third, judges are perceived to be free
              from undue interference from other branches of government. The IBAHRI
              Report failed to acknowledge these facts.</p>
              <p>5. The IBAHRI Report did acknowledge that "Singapore
              has a good international reputation for the integrity of their
              judgments when adjudicating commercial cases", but it alleged that for
              cases that involve "the interests of PAP members or their associates",
              there were "concerns about an actual or apparent lack of impartiality
              and/or independence". Instead of substantiating this grave allegation
              with evidence, the Report argued that "regardless of any actual
              interference, the reasonable suspicion of interference is sufficient".
              This is a feeble justification.</p>
              <p>6. The cases brought by PAP members usually relate
              to scurrilous and completely untrue allegations of corruption made
              against them. Providing clean and efficient governance is a
              longstanding cornerstone of the PAP Government's policy. Thus
              defamatory allegations cannot be allowed to rest. The accuser has to
              prove his allegations. The decisions of the Courts in these cases are
              matters of public record, and can be analysed. Anyone questioning these
              verdicts should try to do so by examining these decisions properly,
              rather than making vague unsubstantiated allegations. What the western
              media continually criticise is that Singapore does not adopt Western,
              i.e. American, defamation laws that give the media freedom to report
              libellous untruths without liability to pay damages. It is also absurd
              to suggest that honourable and upright judges in commercial cases
              become compliant and dishonourable when dealing with defamation cases
              involving government ministers.</p>
              <p>7. The human rights allegations in the Report also
              have no substance. Singapore had responded in detail to them in our 9
              April response to the draft report. Singapore, like nearly all
              countries, subscribes to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
              Human rights are interpreted and implemented according to the specific
              histories, cultures and circumstances of each country. Every society
              must find and decide the appropriate balance between rights and
              responsibilities for themselves. Human rights groups in IBAHRI have
              closed ranks with other Western human rights NGOs to prescribe for
              Singapore and all new countries, especially China, Western norms of
              liberal democracy as the only way to bring stability and prosperity.
              They believe that free market policies cannot succeed without Western
              liberal democracy, and it is their mission to make other societies
              adopt the Western model.</p>
              <p>8. No NGO has greater interest and understanding of
              Singapore's history and internal balance than Singapore's leaders, to
              be able to set norms that will work for Singapore. Whatever the
              shortcomings of the Singapore government, from our record no one has
              doubted that our overriding objective has been to get Singaporeans
              better educated, to understand and be exposed to the globalised world
              we are now in. So we adjust our laws and systems to maximise the
              benefits from global forces to make Singapore a thriving cosmopolitan
              city, where Singaporeans and foreigners live and work in a peaceful,
              safe and open environment. We listen carefully to all advice and then
              decide the right balance for ourselves. So far we have not done badly.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The :"right mix of Democracy" is the basic respect and tolerance that there are more then one view in Politics - (noting that criticising the Ruling Political Party is NOT being disloyal to Singapore); and that in a Democracy - politics is not necessarily the specialist trade nor the exclusive Holy Ground of politicians; as Politics is the basic survival instinct of Humans living together.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let me guess, your paragraph suggests tat PAP should not sue other people for slander or libel etc right. First thing is, u already can say anything u want in the internet. U r already criticising all u want here. I think tat is a sign of opening up of the political scene here. </span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">If u feel tat some members of the PAP have sued too regularly and for too trivial the reason, I agree with u on tis. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">If u talk about whether should people have the right to sue others for making deflamatory remarks, I believe everybody, no matter who they r have the right to do tat. Tis helps the public too because it make sure everybody does not make claims tat is totally imaginary.</span></span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As a CEO - would you consider yourself as an entrepreneur - a risk taker - out to make pofits from the lowest cost possible given some acceptable risk conditions, or are you a politician first before being an entrepreneur ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Then wat is your answer on why u will want to invest in singapore ? A CEO is a risk taker, but he take calculated risk. He is not a gambler. Otherwise he might as well invest in zimbabwe or congo. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously think that Singapore is politically more stable than China - if you believe that China's corruption will lead to instability ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I think your theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses. Lets look at the situation analytically now without making wild guesses on the future. In china, there is a high level of corruption. They can screw u up big time as they can backtrack on their previous promises or copy all your design and sell in another name. U can see such symptoms like opposition favourite example of suzhou industrial park or the LV factory there. Singapore does not have such signs. In fact, singapore seemed to favour companies more than the people... Tat is in a way, political stability which few countries in the region can offer. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Liberal democracy is just a label that some of the more irrational people in here use to scream out warning about chaos and disaster the moment people suggest even moving the OB markers an inch. As if moving towards more openeness means needing to have slugfests in parliment or what have you not.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If u wanted to have more openess and not opting for the fully liberal democratic countries like the example I have listed, I have already agreed with u tat singapore should give up more control and opt for more freedom. U find tat it is the "other extreme" but tis extreme is taken up by a lot of countries. Why is it ridiculous to refer to them especially when <em>other people r the one giving these examples</em>? However if u suggest going to become fully liberal, I find it is not a good governance. I have already asked, and u seemed to have not replied, wat is the level of openess u desire ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I tell u mine. I just hope the PAP do not go about suing other opposition members. If they make stupid comment, just publicised it out </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The :"right mix of Democracy" is the basic respect and tolerance that there are more then one view in Politics - (noting that criticising the Ruling Political Party is NOT being disloyal to Singapore); and that in a Democracy - politics is not necessarily the specialist trade nor the exclusive Holy Ground of politicians; as Politics is the basic survival instinct of Humans living together.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let me guess, your paragraph suggests tat PAP should not sue other people for slander or libel etc right. First thing is, u already can say anything u want in the internet. U r already criticising all u want here. I think tat is a sign of opening up of the political scene here.</span></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">If u feel tat some members of the PAP have sued too regularly and for too trivial the reason, I agree with u on tis.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>If u talk about whether should people have the right to sue others for making deflamatory remarks, I believe everybody, no matter who they r have the right to do tat. Tis helps the public too because it make sure everybody does not make claims tat is totally imaginary.</strong></span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any reason for your narrow interpretation - of the "right mix in democracy" as given in my explanation - to view to mean only "<em>not to sue other people for slander or libel, etc</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can one respect someone else's view when one insist that the other's view is slanderous or libellous when it is based on some wilfull narrow interpretation that result in the slander or libel being self-injurious ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the kind of "gracious society" that Singapore is meant to be, when politicians set the standards of pettiness ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If LKY had expected high standards from public officials, why will he not subject himself to the same public scrutiny, and will depend on his Judiciary to sue others - who challenge him in more decent manner, then that shown by him in scandalously charging others in some truly libellous ways ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As matters stand, the events in Singapore have exposed the pettiness and displayed opportunism - in seizing anything said to be libellous or scandolous simply to give the Politicians in Government the opportunity to remove the other side from being able to challenge them politically.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If libel or scandalous remarks are personal in nature, why should the Ruling Politicians make it into a criminal offense, which besides having drawn punitive financial compensation from the accused or defendants, it will also forfeit the political rights of the accused or defendants ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The IBA report has spelled clearly what Singaporeans have seen, but prefer to be reticent to the situation for obvious reasons as marked out by the Politicians in government..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It will be interesting if the Singapore Government will not sue the IBA for the contents that is printed in the 72 page reports, in the usual ways that this Singapore Government has characteristically been known to do - simply to defend their position in deceitfully ways to propagate its own double image.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As a CEO - would you consider yourself as an entrepreneur - a risk taker - out to make pofits from the lowest cost possible given some acceptable risk conditions, or are you a politician first before being an entrepreneur ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Then wat is your answer on why u will want to invest in singapore ? A CEO is a risk taker, but he take calculated risk. He is not a gambler. Otherwise he might as well invest in zimbabwe or congo.</strong></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your reply clearly disqualify you from being a CEO - and surely will not help you to be an entrepreneur.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were you not comparing China with Singapore in your previous post ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you brilliantly arrive at Zimbabwe or Congo ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that a CEO being a shrewd entrepreneur will not hedge his bets if given the right condition for his investment to be placed in Zimbabwe or Congo ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are more then one way to eat an apple, it depends on how the apple is made to be edible - and when face with hunger, surely you will know how to remove the bad parts of the apple before consuming the remaining parts ?. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously think that Singapore is politically more stable than China - if you believe that China's corruption will lead to instability ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I think your theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses. Lets look at the situation analytically now without making wild guesses on the future. In china, there is a high level of corruption. They can screw u up big time as they can backtrack on their previous promises or copy all your design and sell in another name. U can see such symptoms like opposition favourite example of suzhou industrial park or the LV factory there. Singapore does not have such signs. In fact, singapore seemed to favour companies more than the people... Tat is in a way, political stability which few countries in the region can offer.</strong></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the basis of your analysis that there is a high level of corruption in China ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not your own wild guessing that you depend in attempting to "<em>look at the situation anaylytically</em>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As matters stand, corruption exist in almost every country and takes different forms - some even legitimise the raiding of the National Rserves by passing legislation to authorise the payout of huge sums - and done with such ease with the Parliament or People's Congress dominated by their own people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that a country will collapse simply on corruption - and no other factors are more pressing then corruption ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If China's leadership have not and did not respond to the situation of corruption, it will surely lead China to destruction. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fortunately, present measure have been taken to stop the spread of corruption, clear and systematic laws have been passed to deal with this problem, and the machinery to investigate, prosecute and sentence the corrupt have been put in place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Conversely, Singapore is facing a long list of problems - the top of the list being an overpaid Government that is indifferent to the pressing economic situation of the average "Lower-Middle-Income" and the "Lower-Income" Families.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Ruling Politicians will allow themselves the large million dollar wages that they depend as a "crutch to prevent their own corruption" - but will not extend any million dollar social welfare support to the desparate, for fear that these folks will "depend on social welfare as a crutch".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need to make any wild guess in analysing this fact to be another form of corrupted political ideology practised only in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liberal democracy is just a label that some of the more irrational people in here use to scream out warning about chaos and disaster the moment people suggest even moving the OB markers an inch. As if moving towards more openeness means needing to have slugfests in parliment or what have you not.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>If u wanted to have more openess and not opting for the fully liberal democratic countries like the example I have listed, I have already agreed with u tat singapore should give up more control and opt for more freedom. U find tat it is the "other extreme" but tis extreme is taken up by a lot of countries. Why is it ridiculous to refer to them especially when <em>other people r the one giving these examples</em>? However if u suggest going to become fully liberal, I find it is not a good governance. I have already asked, and u seemed to have not replied, wat is the level of openess u desire ?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I tell u mine. I just hope the PAP do not go about suing other opposition members. If they make stupid comment, just publicised it out</strong></span></p>

              protest till no end if any small minority get to suffer. Few months
              ago the prime minister is popular and withina few month he is
              nearly out. And for doing something which is not wrong</p>
              <p>Japan is not much better. The government r changing and the
              opposition opposes everything. The president cannot even set the
              man he want to be in key position then when things fail he get all
              the blame</p>
              <p>Although US has a lot of advantages WW2 only super power
              survivor and no natural enemy nearby. Even though so, they r also
              facing problems and woes now. If u look at the governance, george
              bush is not an ideal governor as well. They r also declining with
              respect to the world</p>
              <p>Europe is worse... they used to be the most powerful countries
              in the world but now only a handful of cities and countries r good.
              If u look at the governance, they r always stuck with trying to
              implement some policies and fail. The people just seemed to be
              enjoying changing of the government regularly and putting all their
              problems on them instead of themselves.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is too easy and convenient for you to take umbrage in quoting government propaganda to defend the high Ministerial salary, and switching track to ask for solutions to a Singapore problem that has haunted Singaporeans since self-rule from 1957.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The two problems are different - why will you mix ministerial salary with the problems faced by Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singaporeans may not necessarily be all millionaires but did everyone aspire to be a millionaire ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Not everyone aspire or even believe that being stupid-is-smart, does it mean that being stupid is not smart ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are solutions offered even in this Speakers' Corner, and some have even been offered by the various Alternative Parties - unfortunately, politics in Singapore is based on the petty principle of "only one can win, the other must lose".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the political mindset propagated by the Ruling Party that all solutions can only be capably thought out by them, and all others are incapable to compare to their talents - can there be any solutions that can be heard through the enforced sound of silence ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Democracy or a more open political system will allow the voices of the people to be heard, and the Government will not be able to wilfully turned deaf and continue with their ways.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is anyone forcing you to take any pills, or even to choose any sides to be taken by you or anyone based on the present circumstances ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">All that is being discussed is the perceptions of a more open political system, where everyone is allowed to say their piece, and I will guard and guarantee your rights to your view, and will expect the same protection and guarantee from you to my rights.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Whereas in the present situation, our rights that are guaranteed by the Singapore Constitution have all been removed by new Amendments made to the Constitution - that have placed the Guaranteed Rights to be subject to the pleasure of the Minister to dispense at his leisure; and who will expect Singaporeans to believe that such Rights are a privilege and no longer a Guaranteed Right as enshrined in the Singapore Constitution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not been able to digest the two eloquent speeches made by Lee Kuan Yew that reflects the same in a span of approximately 10 years - the first speech made in 1955, and the second in 1964, both occassions when LKY was representing an oppressed minority of which he was also a member ?.</span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">The noisylion has surely proven himself to be a noisy joke in this Speaker's Corner, with his continued hair brain  defense of the Ruling Party a.k.a the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does CSJ need to give a "bias" copy when the copy has been in wide circulation outside Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If not for the copy being printed in the SDP site, will this Government even bother to pay any attention to this issue and raise its profile to to the attention of the Singapore Public ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did the "noisy court jester" make any attempt to browse through the entire Report before coming with a foolish remark that surely confirm himself to be a true joker ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If any attempt has been made to read - and not merely browsing - the contents of the IBA Report across its entire 72 pages, a reasonable person will find it amazing that IBA did not refine it further based on the local knowledge of what has been witnessed as travesty of justice - as it is seen trampled by the Ruling Party to preserve its own position of political strength.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The IBA has at least given the Singapore Government and the Singapore Law Society advance copies of the Report for their comments to be included in the final prints - which has faithfully included the responses by the respective parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is shameful that the Singapore Law Society has failed in its role to protect Public Interests in being more assertive in its defined role to serve the Public, and has allowed this Government to wilfully curtail the role of the Law Society in serving the Public interests on new Bill and Legislations being drafted before these are presented to Parliament for their passing into Law.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The shameful comments made by the Government in their own defense - as broadcasted by the official broadcast media - has clearly deflected the criticism with side issues that do not present the reality of the Singapore situation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has come to the point now that Singaporeans cannot speak the truth, as the truth is now considered too defamotory and scandolous in its encompassing reality, and cannot be spoken.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can dust be swept under the carpet without any residue settling onto some other places that reveal itself sooner or later ?</span></p>

              <p>Political stability is one of the original reasons why foreign investors invested. Low labour costs (in 1960s-70s), good education, good infrastructure, low taxes/investment benefits were also key reasons. by today, political stability would be one of the last few remaining reasons for investments as we see the other benefits being eroded by an increasingly competitive region. correspondingly, we see the outflow of investments. so while big co. CEOs might still invest in setting up a HQ here, the big job producers such as the manufacturing plants have gone. even then, Singapore is less and less attractive as a regional HQ because places like HK and Shanghai can also provide the same perks which is closer to their area of operations e.g. plants and markets.</p>

              <p>I have raised the same question three times and u still refuse to answer them. If u r a CEO, wat factors in singapore will make u invest a plant here ? Why do u refuse to answer tis question despite me repeating multiple times. I said political stability is an important consideration and CEO being risk taker don't purposely take risk as well.

              <p>Let me see, in your earlier reply</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Conversely, Singapore is facing a long list of problems - the top of the list being an overpaid Government that is indifferent to the pressing economic situation of the average "Lower-Middle-Income" and the "Lower-Income" Families.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">U r mixing the two problems together here isn't it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></span></p>
              
              <p>As said before, CEO need a high pay to attract them over. If we reduce the pay of minister, we can immediately get the following conclusions</p>
              <p>1) some minister will leave their portfolio</p>
              <p>2) there r lesser selection of people for the job since the pay is not as enticng as before</p>
              <p>3) we can get worse people for the job than when there is a higher pay</p>
              <p>Tis is the conclusion no matter wat job u r talking about. If u ask me whether is their pay too high, I will tend to agree with u. But if u felt minister should all have low pay, then i am sorry tat is not wat i think is best</p>

              <p>First thing I have to say, like all forum, some of the ideas r stupid. Some idea just use money without substantial returns.

              <p><em>Liberal democracy is just a label that some of the more irrational people in here use to scream out warning about chaos and disaster the moment people suggest even moving the OB markers an inch. <strong>As if moving towards more openeness means needing to have slugfests in parliment or what have you not</strong>.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>That's also the problem in seeing in black and white in an issue like this, just because people call for the ruling party to level the playing field and allow an opposition to trive does not mean they are calling for a liberal democracy or that we need to go to the other extreme</strong>.</em></p>
              <p><em>Only people with black and white thinking will think that asking for more freedom for the individual in Singapore means having a <strong>western style liberal democracy</strong>, this is a diversion of the issue. The question is can much more be done to improve on the current system in Singapore in regards to allowing an increase of personal responsibility and freedom?</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then wat do u suggest now.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you accept democracy, should you not accept it in its totality </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Previously I got blamed when I point to the liberal democracy then suddenly now it is implied if we want, we have to get the full liberal democracy and no halfway mark or blance point. If there is no halfway mark etc, then democracy does not work for singapore or work at all. I don't care wat LKY said etc. Just because I don't think democracy work doesn't mean I am LKY idol worshipper. </span></span></p>

              <p>Political stability is one of the original reasons why foreign investors invested. Low labour costs (in 1960s-70s), good education, good infrastructure, low taxes/investment benefits were also key reasons. by today, political stability would be one of the last few remaining reasons for investments as we see the other benefits being eroded by an increasingly competitive region. correspondingly, we see the outflow of investments. so while big co. CEOs might still invest in setting up a HQ here, the big job producers such as the manufacturing plants have gone. even then, Singapore is less and less attractive as a regional HQ because places like HK and Shanghai can also provide the same perks which is closer to their area of operations e.g. plants and markets.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Despite all these reasons, some plants do come to singapore to invest in these few years as well. Why do u think tat is the reason ?</p>

              <p>But...they are all still richer than us...standard of living higher than us...and most importantly...happier and have a lower migration rate than singapore...which means, despite all the terrible problems caused by democracy that they have to face, they somehow find it more fulfilling...and more patriotic.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Firstly, they have a naturally large market, larger land, more people and more resources. I am looking at the policies they made and the governance they r using. Who is a better player ? A person with good hand but fails to win big or a person with a lousy hand but have make a good job minimising loss ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, r they having a better quality of living copared with us ? Tat is debatable.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, singaporean being able to be accepted by other countries means they r viewed pretty highly by them. Singapore is also one of the more culturally globalised country compared with the others.</p>
