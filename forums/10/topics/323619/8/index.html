              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Let me summarise wat is your claim</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1) U have a great misunderstanding of the passage</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"> </span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">I think your theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses. Lets look at the situation analytically now without making wild guesses on the future. In china, there is a high level of corruption. They can screw u up big time as they can backtrack on their previous promises or copy all your design and sell in another name. U can see such symptoms like opposition favourite example of suzhou industrial park or the LV factory there. Singapore does not have such signs. In fact, singapore seemed to favour companies more than the people... Tat is in a way, political stability which few countries in the region can offer.</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">And u give many unfair and invalid conclusions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.1) U claim tat I said singapore is gonna "collapse" in the first line</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">I think </span></em><strong><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">your theory</span></strong><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"> tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Any proper person reading tis line can conclude tat I am disagreeing with your hypothesis tat singapore is gonna collapse. I am mentioning on YOUR theory, and I conclude it is a wild guess. And u can interprete tat as me agreeing singapore is gonna collapse ? Your attempt to discredit me is pretty juvenile and borders on poor comprehensive skill</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.2) U have a problem with the word "implosion"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Let me ask u one thing, tell me the differences in the idea between</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">I think your theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">I think your theory tat singapore is gonna explode is probably just wild guesses</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Any fair person reading tis 2 sentences can get the same idea and conclude the same result. However since u do not have any good points to argue, u just focus on the choice of word "implosion" and talk about tis for nearly 7 pages of replies. Tat is really childish. Your foolishness has really led u into dedicating thousands and thousand of words just dwelling on the choice of word "implosion" and "explosion". And tis word is simply a metaphor and strictly speaking singaporean r not gonna "explode" nor "implode". It really show u have nothing much else to say and tis is lame to the extreme</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.3) U do not agree with the choice of words "wild guess"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Lets look back at your previous statement on page 2</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Do you seriously think that Singapore is politically more stable than China - if you believe that China's corruption will lead to instability ?</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">The pent-up social pressures may lead to a Krakatoa volcanic outburst, when social, economic and political stresses takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to sudden political swings that are unpredictable.</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">It is the unpredictable and the unknown that will posed a bigger risk to CEO of large companies, and with the strong hand of the Government to prevent citizens from voicing their various social and political frustrations, every Election will be a major problem for the incumbent political party.</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Now wat is your claim in the above reply. First, u claim tat the pent up pressure is gonna result in a "krakatoa volcanic outburst", resulting in sudden political swings tat become unpredictable. Tis resulting in singapore having a poorer political stability than china and pose a bigger risk to CEO tat invest in singapore compared with other countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">U see, tis is nothing but a hypothesis, a prediction of the future. U have no evidence tat support your stand and u blurted it out as though it is a fact. Since it is a hypothesis tat has no justification, it is a "wild guess". Unless u can prove out your hypothesis with concrete evidence now, it is a wild guess</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.4) And this exchange prompted u to claim I make a "wild guess" on china political system being corrupted. </span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">What is the basis of your analysis that there is a high level of corruption in China ?</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Is it not your own wild guessing that you depend in attempting to "look at the situation anaylytically" ?</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">When I explained that it is not a wild guess and even Hu Jintao acknowledged to the problem, u begin to attack on me claiming I have made a conclusion on china collapse. And the line is </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">They can screw u up big time as they can backtrack on their previous promises or copy all your design and sell in another name. U can see such symptoms like opposition favourite example of suzhou industrial park or the LV factory there. </span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">This sentence merely say tat business tat invested in china faces probems before such as backtracking of promises (suzhou industrial park) and copy of design and sell it in another name (LV). There is no statement here tat claimed china is gonna collapse. "They" in the statement represent china official and "u" represent a fake CEO which u implied yourself to be. There is no other way u can understand from the above statement. I have been pointing out tis fact repeatedly but u r just not honest and sincere in your debate and just repeat and repeat without reading at all.  </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.5) After which u come out with a report claiming tat china had more investment in singapore, then u claim tat I said political stability is the most important primary consideration for industries to invest. </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">My stand has always been below</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">I said tat political stability is a plus point and tat is why singapore still attracts investors. I say tis political stability is better than china and other countries in the region.</span></em><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br><br><em>But I did not say singapore got more investment than china. There r many other factors china have which singapore do not, such as a large market and low cost etc. But singapore still manage its own niche area and still attract investors because they r better in political stability.</em></span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Throughout the whole thread, I have never said tat political stability is the most important consideration and there r also important such as market size and low cost. I also never claimed singapore got more investment than china. In many of the replies, u try to discredit me with some of the replies I had made but obviously u fail since "particularly important" and "important" is not equal to the most important considerations. U also claimed I had flip flop from my stand which u again never proved it out. </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"> I have also repeatedly asked u why does industries still relocate to singapore despite many disadvantages which I had asked since page 3 and u never reply until possibly page 7. Does tat show your sincerity in the debate ? </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.6) After 7 pages and tons of insults, verbal abuses and flip flopping, u finally come out with one relevant point. U reply tat singapore attract many industries because they offer tax cut and other initial bonus. However one need to realise tat despite the tax cut, singapore is still more expensive to invest than other regional countries. Then why do investors still choose singapore ? </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">1.7) U have repeatedly deny tat political stabilty had any importance in attracting business. Tis is an absurb stand tat already sounds ridiculous. I bring out the example of zimbabwe which had poor political stabilty and almost no companies ever invest in it. However u twisted the whole example by stating china had invested in it. I pointed out to u repeatedly tat china is a powerful country and had more leverage compared with an ordinary company such as providing arms, UN veto, south african influence and many others. U did not mention on the contrast of powers and dwell instead on whether will china attack or not. Do u know china fight with tibet and vietnam in recent history ? Do u know why US is able to attack Afghanistan legally ? DO u think china can never do the same thing if a lot of their people r killed in zimbabwe ? Unless u can predict the future, how do u know they will never use force on zimbabwe ? Another wild guess of yours ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Looking at the business in zimbabwe, the latest report shows EU had adopted sanctions against companies investing in zimbabwe on the 22 Jul</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSL2222029._CH_.2400">http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSL2222029._CH_.2400</a></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">So u think the companies which u stated in jun, and a lot of them r charged before or providing arms from china, r gonna be safe ? U probably give a classic example of wat happened when u invest in countries tat r not political stable</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Then u bring out printer firms investing in malaysia and thailand etc. U r again arguing out of the original context. It is impossible for ALL companies to invest in singapore. Just because u name some companies not investing in singapore doesn't means singapore is not attractive. I can also name hundreds of companies tat does not invest in china. Does tat means china is not attractive as well ? There r always some companies tat decidecd to invest in other countries and according to your report, it is the third in attracting investment over. Tat is already an impressive figure for a country tat small</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2) Right minded </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.1) I have stated the argument on your right minded repeatedly however u refuse to comment on it. Even when I have given the definition of right minded in the dictionary, u still insist tat I did not understand the phase. <strong>R u gonna tell me your "definition" of right minded people is completely different from the dictionary ?</strong> Since the definition from the dictionary is given, wat is stopping u from discussing tis topic ? Have u even read the below replies ? <strong>The question is never on "wat is right minded", but "can all singaporean be right minded"</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.2) Surprisingly, throughout the exchange u just use my log in name as a basis of attack. Tat is not only childish, it is also lame. I like to use the name "stupidissmart", and wat has tat got to do with u ? Do u think a rational debater will literally use "name calling" during debate like u did ?  However u seem to be proud of using such a low class attack on people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"> </span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.3) The argument on right minded started when u state<br></span><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Would any right minded persons make false claims ?</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br>Tis is in response to the sentence which I said tat<br><em>Depends on whether u encourage people to make false claims or not</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.4) Then I said, in the world now almost everybody make flase claims in politics. I show the example of rumors on obama, south korea's beef issue, president of USA and Taiwan. If all these abundance of example of people who make false claims r not right minded, how can u trust singaporean to be right minded ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span><em></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>These are all your assumptions - based on your own beliefs that everybody make false claims in politics. </em></span></p>
              <p>Then how do u explain the examples above ? I can really come out with tons of false claims used in politics and surprisingly u did not know<br><br>2.5). U response</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Are these instances - that you have given - the works of "right minded persons" ?</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br></span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Tis shows your sincerity again by not answering whether do u believe all singaporean can be right minded.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you suggesting that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>most</em></span> Singaporeans cannot be "right minded" - based on the dictionary explanation of what "right minded" is that you should have concluded much earlier ?</span></p>
              <p>Whether is "most" people right minded, tat is very hard to say since your standard of right minded people is set pretty high. In fact, if according to your standard of right minded, they do not make any false claim, stand up against false claims etc, even president and senior officers failed,</p>
              <p>then most people in the world r not right minded including singapore<br><br>2.6). I state tat presidents r already not considered right minded according to u, then the men on the street will be worse. It is impossible for everyone in society to be right minded</p>
              <p><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br></span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.7). Again u refuse to answer whether do u think singapore population can all be right minded and u just repeat the point on geroge bush being not "right minded"<br>Tis type of exchanges repeated. My point is "can u believe all singaporean to be right minded" and your answer is always "George bush etc r all not right minded". U r simply repeating an old point which doesn't answer the underlying question tat I asked. Wat is tis ? Dishonesty and again a lack of courage to answer the questions posed</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br></span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.8). Then u issue a challenge for me</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br></span><em><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">What examples have you given to prove - tat despite being in a modern economy, being in a democratic nation and being educated doesn't make u "right minded" ?</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">I am not a coward like u and refuse to answer question or quote examples. Since u wanted examples of people being in a modern economy, democratic nation, educated and not right minded, I give u a ton of examples (which u accused of not right minded before) such as george bush, chen shui bian, dick cheney etc. Can u tell me which area these examples r not relevant to the ones u seek ? They all r in modern economy, they all r in a democratic nation and they all r educated. According to u yourself, they all r not right minded. Wat is wrong with these examples ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">U claimed the r not right minded, and they r examples of people tat fit into the challenge earlier. So wat is your answer to tis ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.8) And then now wat ? U just hurl a mountain of verbal abuses out. U twist words, hurl insults and give no points except to use it to dismiss other people point. Tat shows u r uncivilised by using verbal abuses to other people points.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">2.9) U also flip flop when u first mention tat the korea who r protesting in the US beef issue not being right minded. Then u later try to support these group of people when they protest. Doesn't tat give the conclusion u r not right minded ? U also make a lot of false claims as well, from the many examples I have shown. Then u have shown u r not right minded as well isn't it ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">And wat is youir reply to these allegation ? U just ask me to reread and no explanations is given. I re read and come out with the same conclusion. WHy don't u try to elaborate ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">3) India, Hong Kong and Singapore millionaire</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">3.1) First, u did not put in china's name int helst with the most number of millionaire in the region. Sure, u can choose not to put china in the example. However u claim tat putting hong kong is equivalent to putting china's name in the infamous reply</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Are you not being petty about China being left out ?</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Is Hong Kong not part of China ?</span></strong><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Would you believe that China was intentionally left out as bait for an expected outburst from you ?</span></em><span style="color: blue; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Now if u read the above statement, u can conclude it implies tat u did not put in china name in because hong kong is part of china. The important sentence is the one in bold. If u had meant otherwise, why do u put in tat sentence ? I have repeated ask u to elaborate another logical explanatino to the above statement which u refused repeatedly refused. Furthermore the third sentences is asking a question. It can be "Yes I intentionally left it out and it is used as a bait" and "No, I did not leave it out and it is there because hong kong is there"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">3.2) People wanted democracy because it can lead to good lives. However in the case between china and india, u remark tat india slow economic growth is because it does not use democratic practises on its economy while china do. Then isn't tat an irony ? A "democratic economy" is absent in india while a "democratic economy" is present in china and tat result in china being richer and more influential. Then wat is the point ? Tat is the reason for the below statement which u refuse to understand</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">3.4) It is on the definition of "democratic economy" which u readily give your definition as </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">U also provide 2 reports tat u tried to link with your example of "democratic economy". As stated previously, there is no link with your definition of "democratic economy" at all. U also pasted another 3 reports on "democratic economy" on the previous reply. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">In your first report</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><em>This work includes the promotion of the democratization of decision-making and government policies that lead to inclusion and participation, especially of the most vulnerable. It includes defending the rights of people for access to resources for their livelihoods. These processes aim to re-establish the power and accountability of governments to set national social and economic policies that protect and promote the interests of all citizens.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">It did not give the idea of "gov" to do as little as possible to the economy. Instead it argues for the gov to do as much as possible to help the people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">On your second report, it again do not reflect tat gov should not intervene in society </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><em>There are many core areas of production and many decisions to be made. Could directions in all areas of the economy be subjected to a national referendum? A lot of them could be. This is especially true for decisions concerning the creation or expansion of a new area of production. For example, when nuclear power or genetically engineered food is first being developed, it is eminently practical to have a national (or planetary) referendum on whether citizens want it. <br></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">It actually proposed the gov to intervene in decisions making for the country. It also encourages the workers to be more involved in the decision making for the company</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Your thirds report cannot be opened.Your fourth report is on zimbabwe and does not even mention the word democratic economy.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">So unless u can point out to specific section in your multi reports tat support your definition of "democratic economy", u r just being dishonest and come out with your own definition of the word and twist and turn on it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">3.5) Another point of comtempt is u trying to use your report to show there r more millionaires in hong kong than singapore while I manage to prove tat singapore had a greater proportion of millionaire. Then u pulled out a report claiming hong kong is trying their best to attract millionaires over. During tis time, u have claimed I make a flip flop in mentioning abut your report which it proven to be u reading wrongly into my replies. Since both hong kong and singapore r pulling in millionaires, how do u know who has more millionaires tat r native born ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">U can say tat singapore do pull in more foreigner to be the citizen, however hong kong also pulls in china businessmen into their folds. Chinese from china r not considered to be foreginers but "locals" however they r not natively born in hong kong as well. And the foreigner residing in singapore r more normal people who r not millionaires and come over to seek a better life. So again wat conclusions can we derived ? Nothing. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">4) Misc</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">4.1) Wat happened to the question on whether had u lived in a democracy or not ? Why do u refrained from answering the same question u posed for others ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">4.2) Wat happened to your civil servants discussion ? U claimed tat all civil servants r not allowed to vote and tat is your ideal democratic society. Tis is obviously a wrong conclusion and an unfair mindset. Wat is your comments on tat ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">4.3) Certainly from the posts, one can see tat u give verbal abuses, flip flop between stands, refuse to answer questions which u yourself posted, failed to read other people replies and a complete dishonest person in your debate. U also claimed tat I have not lifted all your passages out. Do u know why ? Because most of your passages r just verbal abuses and a waste of server storage. </span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Democracy in economics is to allow the citizens to exercise their rights to achieve their economic goals with as little governmental interference as possible - that limit the business or entrepreneurial potentials; while the government's responsibility is to provide all the assistance possiible.</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><em>"A democratic politics system does not give a "democratic" economy. An un-democratic politic system can provide a "democratic economy". And "democratic economy" is the more important characteristic to get rich. Then wat is the use of democracy in politics "</em></p>
              <p>3.3) It is also surprising tat u readily wanna compare countries like hong kong, india with singapore... then feel it is not right to compare hong kong, india with singapore, china... Isn't the latter the more fair comparison since u r comparing between democratic and not democratic economies ? The reason is probably because if u pull china into the picture, u get no conclusion.</p>

              <p><span>Any fair person reading tis 2 sentences can get the same idea and conclude the same result. However since u do not have any good points to argue, u just focus on the choice of word "implosion" and talk about tis for nearly 7 pages of replies. Tat is really childish. Your foolishness has really led u into dedicating thousands and thousand of words just dwelling on the choice of word "implosion" and "explosion". And tis word is simply a metaphor and strictly speaking singaporean r not gonna "explode" nor "implode". It really show u have nothing much else to say and tis is lame to the extreme</span></p>

Then u pulled out a report claiming hong kong is trying their best to attract millionaires over. During tis time, u have claimed I make a flip flop in mentioning abut your report which it proven to be u reading wrongly into my replies. Since both hong kong and singapore r pulling in millionaires, how do u know who has more millionaires tat r native born ?</span></p>
              <p><span>U can say tat singapore do pull in more foreigner to be the citizen, however hong kong also pulls in china businessmen into their folds. Chinese from china r not considered to be foreginers but "locals" however they r not natively born in hong kong as well. And the foreigner residing in singapore r more normal people who r not millionaires and come over to seek a better life. So again wat conclusions can we derived ? Nothing.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your continued emphasis to Singapore's stability in all your replies across 7 pages, if this "stability" is not a primary factor, what else is there for Singapore to attract foregin investments ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now are you being dishonest in your statement ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I not given you any reply, or was the reply given not the required answer that you wish will come from me ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not attempting to push your answer concerning "Singapore's political stability" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, you will be dishonest to claim that this is NOT the PRIMARY FACTOR - which you will even push in your reply which I have quoted in the preceding quote made above ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you NOT flip-flopping on this point alone - as shown in my under-lining of the flip-flop statements in your reply given in the preceding extract of your reply as shown above ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now are you being purposefully stupid with your answers</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Replying this part of your response from the last point upwards -</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. Can China project its military power in the same manner as the US military ? Does China have the same global reach with its military capability being on par with the USA ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2. China was able to attack Vietnam and India {ove Tibet} - as these two countries share the same common land border, with China's military simply moving across the land frontier. Was there any need for China to cross half-way around the globe ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. Did you missed in my reply on Pg 7 that showed reports about UK companies wanting to invest in Zimbabwe - and not China as a country but commercial firms ?</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4. Here again, at the beginning of this reply that I have quoted - you have again insisted that "political stability" is an IMPORTANT FACTOR. Are you still denying that you are being misquoted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were the companies given as references in my last reply - and repeated in the preceding paragraph - supplying military arms, or were they already in Zimbabwe before the EU even began to indicate their intention to impose sancetions after the recent Election fraud in Zimbabwe ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did these UK companies provide arms from China, or was it not Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe's own preference to deal with China that got his arms deal pulled through ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now, are you giving these private commercial companies more credibility when you looked down on them when suggesting that China's investment is due to its own political power compared to the private commerical enterprises ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you now back-tracking on your insistence that CEO's must invest in Singapore due to its "Political Stability" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So are you claiming that despite Singapore's "Political Stability" being a PLUS factor - it is NOW "impossible for ALL investments to invest in Singapore" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you now decided to accept that Singapore's "political stability" being a PLUS FACTOR is not necessary a deciding point that all CEO's must consider ?</span> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You must be deluded to read that in my reply on Pg 7 24Jul'08-5.42AM - to state that I have refused to comment on your issue.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you missed the main part of the argument - that was stated as:- "Can 'Right minded' persons - with qualities that are 'correct, honest, or good opinions or principles' - make false claims, or 'encourage people to make false claims' ?"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the question is never on "wat is right minded" - how do you intend to see if "singaporeans can be right minded" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you proving yourself to be truly "stupid" without being "smart" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is not so much the name that is selected, as there are countless names that begin with "Gazelle" or "DeerHunter" - and yours happened to be "Stupidissmart".</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The jarring parts in the names seem to reflect the personna in the chosen names - such as - the "Gazelle" proving himself expertly to be a sniffer even with his dismissive arguments that sniff at others as much as he sniff at his friend's sister's garments; "DeerHunter" turned out to be a "Duh-Hunter" with his self-opinionated intelligence; and your arguments are simply "stoopid" without even attempting to be "smart" - as seen in your indecision in your arguments about "political stability" and your supreme inability to even be coherent with your understanding of being "right minded".</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are "right minded" can you be pushed to make false claims ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I claim that "everybody make false claims in politics" - or is this not your own conclusion as usual ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you "can really come out with tons of false claims used in politics, and surprising" I did not know - how did you so brilliantly conclude that it is MY CLAIM that "everybody make false claims in politics" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you attempting to be smarter then your "Stoopid-is-Smart" personna in this Speakers' Corner ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you accept "rumours of obama" as proof of "right minded" people making false claims ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you consider the 50,000 Korean protestors as "right minded" against the backdrop of a larger population who did not protest ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously consider George Bush-Dick Cheney as being "right-minded" in their decision to invade Iraq, or Chen Shui-bian's persistence to fight for Taiwan's independence as "right-minded" policy for Taiwan ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your answer - in any direction - will already reveal what my answer will be about your question about "who is or what being right-minded" is all about ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you afraid to answer your own question ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can my standard of "right minded" be any higher than the preferred definition picked by your Dictionary.com  </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I disputed your choice of definition given in your preferred Dictionary.com ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you proving to be dishonest again in your reply to what I had posted on Pg 7 23Jul'08-6.15PM to your earlier reply on Pg7 20Jul'08-1.44PM ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">My response concerning "right-minded" Singaporeans was in reply to your Point 3, and the reply on President George Bush-DicKCheney was in reply to your Point 4.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both were quoted as a pair of your questions to be replied, and I had replied to the two issues in separate paragraphs.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you so brilliantly think that I mixed the reply - when the fault is clearly your own for not accurately quoting my entire reply ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As usual your "stupid-is-smart" exaggeration shine through in your dishonest reply - did I challenge you to state make the following ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On Pg 4 13Jul'08-1.23AM - I replied you :</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As I have said, do you think those people - whom you accused of making up all the lies as stated in your previous post - are all "right minded persons" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously think that George Bush is a "right minded person" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What makes you think that Communism will work only for "right minded people" ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not to the contrary that Communism can exist due to stupid people allowing the smarter autocrats to implement Communism in a make-believe world of a Classless Society ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not a fact that the Communist Autocrat Rulers became an invisible Class that do not actually exist as a Class in a Classless Communist Society ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your reply on Pg 7 13Jul'08-12.32PM is evident in your wilfull display at misintepreting the issues in your juvenile mischevious ways.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">My rebuttal on Pg 7 14 Jul'08-6.27AM dealt separately the issues that you raised concerning issues that you claimed were raised by Americans about Obama, about Presiden George Bush-Dick Cheney, and about the South-Koreas 'beef import' protestors; and also in a separate paragraph the issue concerning "right minded" persons whom you claim are prime candidates towards Communism.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The answer to the issue was obscured by your own obstinate attempt at seeing what you want to see, and ignoring the facts that were already clear - in that "right minded" people do not make false claims, nor succumb to events to make false claims..</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You insisted in back-tracking by stating that my standards are too high even for George Bush-Dick Cheney, and Chen Shui Bian to qualifty - when you had repeated in the quote above - that these characters are NOT "right-minded".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not arguing for the sake of argument - as I have stated that are you not coming back to one full circle ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As I have said in the beginning  - you possess a great propensity at pursuing your own creativity.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your persistence with idiot-logy clearly demands a more robust shake-down of your false position - as examplified in your preferred idiot-logic choice of "true lies" . </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I supported the Korean "beef import" protestors in their position, or have I supported the South Korean democratic practices that allow a minority to be able to voice their protest ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This reply from you clearly shows that either you have not taken my advise to re-read the exchanges that developed in our replies; or that you were too embarrassed after re-reading - especially when you discover a different meaning after re-reading my replies that you had extracted partial statements, which resulted in your statements being made in a skewed "out-of-context" manner.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even your preceding response had asked - "</span><span style="color: #333333;">Also u r purposefully removing china from the number of new millionaires tat the region see in tis year.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In my reply to you on this date, I had also indicated that India did not have any large number of millionaires before PM Mamohan Singh liberalised the autocratic hold that its bureaucracy had over the economy.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it critically significant in the counting of millionaires amongst democracies by leaving China out ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This surely must confirm your argument for the sake of argument.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Now let me provide some of the paragraphs which your reports had claimed</span></p>
              <p><span><em>This work includes the promotion of the democratization of decision-making and government policies that lead to inclusion and participation, especially of the most vulnerable. It <strong>includes defending the rights of people</strong> for access to resources for their livelihoods. These processes aim to re-establish the power and accountability of <strong>governments to</strong> <strong>set national social and economic policies that protect and promote the interests of all citizens</strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">It did not give the idea of "gov" to do as little as possible to the economy. Instead it argues for the gov to do as much as possible to help the people.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">On your second report, it again do not reflect tat gov should not intervene in society</span></span></p>
              <p><span><em>There are many core areas of production and many decisions to be made. <strong>Could directions in all areas of the economy be subjected to a national referendum?</strong> A lot of them could be. <strong>This is especially true for decisions concerning the creation or expansion of a new area of production</strong>. For example, when nuclear power or genetically engineered food is first being developed, it is eminently practical to have a national (or planetary) referendum on whether citizens want it.</em></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">It actually proposed the gov to intervene in decisions making for the country. It also encourages the workers to be more involved in the decision making for the company</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wat do u have to say for the above 2 paragraphs from your own report ? It is</span> <span style="color: #000000;">completely different from your definition of "democratic economy". SO doesn't tat make u a lier ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wat is the bottomline ? u claim tis "volcanic eruption" is gonna de-stabilise the nation and make it political instable and CEO had made unnecessary risk investing over here.

Management theories embody four main leadership management styles. Those are autocratic, democratic, laissez-faire and exceptional management styles.</em>  </span></span></a> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wat does your para says ? It claims there r 4 different leadership styles bla bla bla and it has nothing tat suggest gov do not intervene into economy</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Now let me provide some of the paragraphs which your reports had claimed</span></p>
              <p><span><em><em>This work includes the promotion of the democratization of decision-making and government policies that lead to inclusion and participation, especially of the most vulnerable. It </em><strong>includes defending the rights of people</strong><em> for access to resources for their livelihoods.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">It did not give the idea of "gov" to do as little as possible to the economy. Instead it argues for the gov to do as much as possible to help the people.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">On your second report, it again do not reflect tat gov should not intervene in society</span></span></p>
              <p><span><em><em>There are many core areas of production and many decisions to be made. </em><strong>Could directions in all areas of the economy be subjected to a national referendum?</strong><em> A lot of them could be. </em><strong>This is especially true for decisions concerning the creation or expansion of a new area of production</strong><em>. For example, when nuclear power or genetically engineered food is first being developed, it is eminently practical to have a national (or planetary) referendum on whether citizens want it.</em></em></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">It actually proposed the gov to intervene in decisions making for the country. It also encourages the workers to be more involved in the decision making for the company</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wat do u have to say for the above 2 paragraphs from your own report ? It is</span> <span style="color: #000000;">completely different from your definition of "democratic economy". SO doesn't tat make u a lier ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">U cannot answer. I had already told u my justification why I choose the word "implosion". Tis is because I picture overwhelming pressure acting on society which u mention will cause implosion instead of explosion. However u felt overwhelming pressure results in "explosion". Is there anything wrong with either of the word chosen ? It is just a matter of personal preference. U do not like the word I choose, I cannot help u. U can interprete the word as "explosion" if u want but I stick with the word "implosion".  </span></span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">The bottomline is I never claim singapore is gonna "collapse". I paste back point 1.1.1 etc here again for u to ponder</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.1) U claim singapore is gonna "erupt like volcano"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.2) I say <em>your</em> theory about singapore is just a wild guess</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.3) U say it is <em>my theory</em>, and says I claim singapore is gonna "collapse" just because i use the word implosion to replace your "krakatoa volcanic eruption"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.4) I said all the while tis is your theory about singapore "collapsing'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.5) now u ask when have u ever claim singapore is gonna "collapse"</span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tis is part of your claim following the "volcanic eruption" </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>Do you seriously think that Singapore is politically more stable than China</strong> - if you believe that China's corruption will lead to instability ?</em></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The pent-up social pressures may lead to a <strong>Krakatoa volcanic outburst</strong>, when social, economic and political stresses takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to <strong>sudden political swings that are unpredictable</strong></em></span></span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>It is the unpredictable and the unknown that will posed a <strong>bigger risk</strong> to CEO of large companies, and with the strong hand of the Government to prevent citizens from voicing their various social and political frustrations, every Election will be a major problem for the incumbent political party.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">U see the idea we r fighting for is about "stability". The opposite of stability is "unpredictable". U r fighting for a case where u claim singapore is not stable but unpredictable, which result in giving CEO risk in investing over here and singapore having less stability than china. Tis is obviously a look into the future which u cannot do and it is a wild guess. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">And saying I claim singapore is gonna collapse based on tis one line is just incredible</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only did I explicitly mention "your theory", I also conclude it with "wild guesses". And based on tis one line u can conclude I claim singapore is collapsing !?! Don't u find tat too ridicuous ? And your only defense ? "implosion" "implosion"... and tat is it... </span></span></p>

              <p>Again another groundless conclusion. I placed emphasis tat political stability is important because tat is wat we r debating over. No where did I mention it is the primary factor. And wat is the charge ? Just because I say it is important many times means it must be the "most important" ? Just because the geography teacher keep repeating geography is an important subject means geography is the most important subject ? U r making a groundless conclusion again. Up till now, u still cannot prove I claimed it is the "most important" factor in attracting business.</p>

              <p><span>U should answer tis point because it is important to distinguish the powers of a powerful country and an ordinary company.

              <p> </p>

A particular person in your report who invested in an unstable region in africa had been charged in court and had all its possession confiscated.

              <p><em>First, u did not put in china's name in the list with the most number of millionaire in the region. Sure, u can choose not to put china in the example. However u claim tat putting hong kong is equivalent to putting china's name in the infamous reply</em></p>
              <p><span><em>Are you not being petty about China being left out ?</em></span></p>
              <p><strong><span><em>Is Hong Kong not part of China ?</em></span></strong></p>
              <p><span><em>Would you believe that China was intentionally left out as bait for an expected outburst from you ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Now if u read the above statement, u can conclude it implies tat u did not put in china name in because hong kong is part of china. The important sentence is the one in bold. If u had meant otherwise, why do u put in tat sentence ? I have repeated ask u to elaborate another logical explanatino to the above statement which u refused repeatedly refused. Furthermore the third sentences is asking a question. It can be "Yes I intentionally left it out and it is used as a bait" and "No, I did not leave it out and it is there because hong kong is there"</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I have shown my points tat your reports is not following your model on hw a "democratic economy" works. If u think it do, then u have to quote out the relevant passages from your report tat supports such belief. Otherwise u again had shown yourself to be dishonest since u claim a definition of a word which is wrong and twist and turn it to watever u want.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat about the many reports u pasted before ? All of them contradicts your idea ? Why not give the relevant passage from the 4 reports u yourself provide ? And the link u give for your</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the present economic climate, even Singapore PM LHL will not even want to show the actual number of the millionaire migrants that have been attracted, and must surely be at the expense of the Singapore Citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is disingenious to claim my opinion to be guesses, when your own conjectures fared no better - as seen in your conclusion in the "theory of singapore's implosion".</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In the end wat ? No statistic data and it is just wild guesses. The only statistic data shows singapore had more proportion of people who r millionaires compared with hong kong.</p>
              <p>It is saddening to see u harping on the word "implosion". Is tat all u can complain about ? I probably got more than 10 different things I can talk about</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How would you know those car washers are "ordinary" migrants, and not merely work permit holders ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Besides those "car washers" - are there any others that you see can possibly be settled migrants, and how many of those that you see form what percentage of migrants in the Department of Statistics ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And how do u know these car washers can't be ordinary migrants ? I already told u before. I see them working in coffeeshops, driving buses, washing cars, taking public transport, in the IT line, study in university and generally working like normal people. If tis group of people r not your so called 50% of the migrants, then where do tis big group of people go to ? Adding 50 % of the population is a big amount. Out of 3 person u see, 1 is a migrant. And then u claim they r not ordinary people who r seen to work ordinary.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should there be no relationship ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not highlighted in at least two of my earlier replies ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U mean u claiming they r not here as ordinary citizen ? I don't see the hightlight.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>U claim singapore attract a lot of foreigners I also say hong kong also attract a lot of chinese into the territory. Chinese r not considered forreigner and it is not within your report scope</p>

              <p>It is just funny tat u refuse to answer even your own question. If it is a plot, u r the one devising it. U r the one tat ask tis question first</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it was so, why did you not initiated the charge ?</span></p>

              <p>I already reply u previously, u did not reply. So obviously I can conclude u concede. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I not mention that even as India was a political democracy, its economy was under the autocratic control of its bureaucracy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it was not until PM Mamohan Singh's decision to liberalise India's economy from autocratic control that saw India blossomed and produced all the millionaires.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r not answering to the point. Then isn't it obvious tat democracy in politics had nothing to do with "democracting" the economy ? U claimed tis indian PM liberalise india economy. But the fact is he done it too late. China who is not democratic yet had "democrat" their economy. Tat is why their economy is better and they r more influential. So wat is the point of democracy in politics when it is mutually independent to economy ? U refuse to answer the above point and talk about other stuffs. I put it in number form for u</p>
              <p>4.3.1) India is democratic for many years. China is not democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.2) U claim india economy is not "democratic" in the past and surprisingly claim china economy is for many years. Tat is your explanation why china's economy is better than india despite india being democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.3) Then the question is, Wat is the point of democracy in politics, if it does not lead to it to be a "democratic" economic ? Why people choose democracy is simply because they should get a better life. They should not choose it because the westerners sing praise of it.</p>
              <p>And now u talk about something completely different. U r claiming we should not compare with china since it is not a democratic country. Why not ? Why compare</p>
              <p>Singapore Versus India + Hong Kong</p>
              <p>and not</p>
              <p>Singapore + China against Hong Kong + India ?</p>
              <p>U r again out of point</p>
              <p>I also realise u refuse to answer on your civil servant reply. I pasted it again for u to reply</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I got to ask also... wat happened to your civil servant reply ? u claim all civil servants cannot vote and they do not deserve to vote in your ideal model of democracy. So it is no longer one person one vote anymore. So wat is your stand on tis matter now ?</strong></span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Sure, I can remove all the unsults and verbal abuse from my post. I always support tis action. Then u can see if atobe will continue his verbal abuse or not</p>
              <p>U r just repeating. The "Theory" is the whole idea u presented</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The pent-up social pressures may lead to a <strong>Krakatoa volcanic outburst</strong>, when social, economic and political stresses takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to sudden political swings that are unpredictable.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">The whole thing in blue above is the theory u r presenting. How do anyone know I am refering to your paragraph ? The keyword is "your" from below</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span><em>I think <strong>your</strong> theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">I already explicitly mention it is about your statement. And the only reason u r denying it is your theory is simply because of the word "implosion". I have already mentioned many times tat the implosion is simply derived from your "</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Krakatoa volcanic outburst".</em></span> <span style="color: #000000;">However u choose to attack the word "implosion" instead of anything else. As said before, tis is a metaphor. The only idea tat is desired to be presented is some catastrophic failure. I have already questioned u upteen times on the difference between the 2 statements</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">U cannot answer. I had already told u my justification why I choose the word "implosion". Tis is because I picture overwhelming pressure acting on society which u mention will cause implosion instead of explosion. However u felt overwhelming pressure results in "explosion". Is there anything wrong with either of the word chosen ? It is just a matter of personal preference. U do not like the word I choose, I cannot help u. U can interprete the word as "explosion" if u want but I stick with the word "implosion". </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">I think your theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses</span></em></span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">The bottomline is I never claim singapore is gonna "collapse". I paste back point 1.1.1 etc here again for u to ponder</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.1) U claim singapore is gonna "erupt like volcano"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.2) I say <em>your</em> theory about singapore is just a wild guess</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.3) U say it is <em>my theory</em>, and says I claim singapore is gonna "collapse" just because i use the word implosion to replace your "krakatoa volcanic eruption"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.4) I said all the while tis is your theory about singapore "collapsing'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1.1.5) now u ask when have u ever claim singapore is gonna "collapse"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tis is part of your claim following the "volcanic eruption"</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>Do you seriously think that Singapore is politically more stable than China</strong> - if you believe that China's corruption will lead to instability ?</em></span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>It is the unpredictable and the unknown that will posed a <strong>bigger risk</strong> to CEO of large companies, and with the strong hand of the Government to prevent citizens from voicing their various social and political frustrations, every Election will be a major problem for the incumbent political party.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The pent-up social pressures may lead to a <strong>Krakatoa volcanic outburst</strong>, when social, economic and political stresses takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to <strong>sudden political swings that are unpredictable</strong></em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">U see the idea we r fighting for is about "stability". The opposite of stability is "unpredictable". U r fighting for a case where u claim singapore is not stable but unpredictable, which result in giving CEO risk in investing over here and singapore having less stability than china. Tis is obviously a look into the future which u cannot do and it is a wild guess.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">And saying I claim singapore is gonna collapse based on tis one line is just incredible</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span><em>I think <strong>your</strong> theory tat singapore is gonna implode is probably just wild guesses</em></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only did I explicitly mention "your theory", I also conclude it with "wild guesses". And based on tis one line u can conclude I claim singapore is collapsing !?! Don't u find tat too ridicuous ? And your only defense ? "implosion" "implosion"... and tat is it...</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Surprisingly after a lot of vernal abuses, u cannot answer your mistake of claiming ST "less of a pull factor" to become "no longer a pull factor". So u agree u made a mistake in your conclusion ? Did u wonder if u also make a mistake with concluding I said "singapore" and "china" is gonna collapse ? Or u just refuse to acnkowledge your mistake and keep going and going ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Jan 2008 is definitely better than 1980's</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">U know to make a by election, it take a lot of trouble and cost to the economy etc. U have to give a public holiday to the voters in order for them to cast their vote. And watever the outcomeis, it does not change the fact who will hold the majority of the seat. So u think it is worth it ?</span> <span style="color: #000000;">U got to follow the law on wat happened if a holder of a position pass away, and not watever u like.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">On CSJ, historically tis is not something new. Why don't u see the forming of "reform party" and the JBJ coming back to serve the opposition without being stopped as a sign of confidence from PAP. If they really wanna hammer the last nail, they should do it on JBJ and not the infamous CSJ. BTW, CSJ really did commit libel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If the gov has no confidence, he will not increase the tax of the people or their own pay. If they r so "un-confident" of themselves, why will they do such an unpopular measure ? U think they r not gonna run for the next election ?</span></p>
              <p>Did I conclude someone had died from the same symptoms ? Whenever I claim something, I show the evidence. Whenever u claim something, u just "claim". If u really wanna support your conclusion, prove it. Furthermore, u cannot defend yourself from having "black and white thinking" since u have nothing to say about</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>why did you not progress forward with China's high level of corruption will lead to China's collapse if corruption is left unchecked ?</em></span></p>
              <p>U on one hand claiming china is gonna collapse and the other says china is gonna thrive despite corruption. Tis is also a flip flop. Surprisingly u become guilty of all the charges u have framed me</p>
              <p>Again another groundless conclusion. I placed emphasis tat political stability is important because tat is wat we r debating over. No where did I mention it is the primary factor. And wat is the charge ? Just because I say it is important many times means it must be the "most important" ? Just because the geography teacher keep repeating geography is an important subject means geography is the most important subject ? U r making a groundless conclusion again. Up till now, u still cannot prove I claimed it is the "most important" factor in attracting business.</p>
              <p>Furthermore the reason why I repeat the importance of political stability is due to u just trying to be difficult.</p>
              <p>Again after saying so many things, u still refuse to accept the below</p>
              <p><span><strong>I pointed out to u repeatedly tat china is a powerful country and had more leverage compared with an ordinary company such as providing arms, UN veto, south african influence and many others. U did not mention on the contrast of powers and dwell instead on whether will china attack or not.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>U should answer tis point because it is important to distinguish the powers of a powerful country and an ordinary company. However U refuse just confirms tat u r not here to discuss, but to insult. If u r sincere about discussion, then u will try to answer other people enquiries tat help to establish the truth and wat the other party try to say. U refusing shows your lack of sincerity. I have always answered all your question. U have repeatedly refuse to answer questions.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again china is a country. Comparing a powerful country with a company is just out of point. Is EU the entire world ? Well, it is your entire examples of companies investing in zimbabwe</p>
              <p>Well, u know u can always help to launder money for murderers, mafia, loah sharks, kidnappers, corrupt officers and they will really treasure u since lesser people r willing to deal with them. If u think tis sort of income is stable , then u r wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is about china having more powers than a company. China has the option of attacking zimbabwe which an ordinary company can never do.</p>
              <p>Can u prove I said it is the "most important" factor ? No ? Then end of your story.</p>
              <p><em>U see, the point is now they may be facing problems over it. So wat is the conclusion for investing in a country with a bad political stability ? U may get to be in trouble before u knew it</em></p>
              <p>Let me rephrase and extend then. The people in your report r facing problems when they r investing in region tat r politically unstable. A particular person in your report who invested in an unstable region in africa had been charged in court and had all its possession confiscated. Otherwise u can face economic sanction like the one in place now. Wat is the conclusion ? U can get into serious trouble when u invest in a politically unstable region. And tat is why political stability is a factor to consider when u invest</p>
              <p>These is just insult with no content in it</p>
              <p>I don't really see your point is tis passage. If u ask me, it is a diversion from the real topic at hand. I already told u "assuming right minded people do nto make false claims". But not everybody is right minded in the society. Since they can be such a low number, then wat is the point of u talking about "right minded" people when in the end there will still be lots of false claims</p>
              <p>So u r telling me u r judging people based on their handwriting and their name ? And u r basing your attack in people because of trivial unprovable hypothesis ? And tat give u a reason to say "stupid is smart here" "stupid is smart there" ? Aren't u judging a person by its cover, or judging me based on my log in name ? Tat is really shallow and I must say tis, lame.</p>
              <p>Dodge my error ? From the look of things, don't u agree with me tat the person sniping the word "almost" away is probably... u ?</p>
              <p>U r not reading my reply</p>
              <p><em>Considering nobody actually protest against tis people, 50,000 is a lot. Tis is particularly true since u claim right minded people "will stand up against" other people's false claims. Nobody stand up. So it is 50,000 to nothing.</em></p>
              <p><em>I don't know why u can claim people who do nothing and sitting on the side of the fence to be "right minded" people. They can very well wanna be pro towards beef protesters</em></p>
              <p>I put in number form again</p>
              <p>2.9.1) In the protest by the south korean on the US beef issue, 50,000 protest on the street regularly tat lead to resignation of certain gov officials and prompted the president to apologise repeatedly</p>
              <p>2.9.2) U claim tat there r more right minded people because there r more people tat do not protest than people who do</p>
              <p>2.9.3) However people who do not protest doesn't mean they agree with the president. Tis group of people r considered to be unknown, and not automatically classified as beef supporters and right minded. They can very well be againstthe president and against the beef issue</p>
              <p>2.9.4) Tis is confirmed by u claiming tat right minded people will stand up against the lies and false claims made by other people.</p>
              <p>2.9.5) Fact is, nobody make a counter protest against the beef protesters. It is 50,000 compared with 0</p>
              <p>U r just hurling insults and not answering the question</p>
              <p><em>It is not about whether is george bush, chen shui bian or dick cheny being right minded. It is about even the US president, Taiwan president and a high gov officials considered to be not "right minded". Wat do u think the man on the street fared ? U just refuse to answer tis point repeatedly.</em></p>
              <p>Again u refuse to answer tis point. It shows u r not sincere in discussion at all. U just want to win and u do nto want to see the truth. Otherwise u will answer the question posed</p>
              <p>The question is never on the definition of the word, but how many people can follow the standard</p>
              <p>These 3 person r significant since they r the top people of  the country and represent someone much higher than the man on the streets. Even clinton who initially claim he have no relationship with monica is also making a false claim. Furthermore 50,000 people from korea on beef issue r not right minded and people spreading rumors on obama r also considered not right minded. There r other examples of people who r not right minded like Nasir OR Anwar from malaysia, myanmar leaders, official statements from china tat is proved to deviate from the truth, extremist terrorists, Thaksin corruption charges , phillipines impeachment charges against the president, North korea, Zimbabwe, Iran, leaders from some african nations and many other examples where false claims r made r not right minded. In fact a lot of countries leaders r not right minded. So u expect the people to be right minded ?</p>
              <p>Wat r u trying to say here ? Just insults again isn't it ? Why don't u face it, if everyone is right minded, then the society and its people r perfect and communism could have worked. Other than insults, can u actually discuss properly ?</p>
              <p>Hurling more insults without elaboration or justification of your stand. I paste the above again</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Have I supported the Korean "beef import" protestors in their position, or have I supported the South Korean democratic practices that allow a minority to be able to voice their protest ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>U claim u support democratic practises but in actual fact your reply is supporting their cause of protest.</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Did you manage to <strong>appreciate the issues behind the protests</strong> ? Are your thoughts more capable then the South Korean President-Elect's decision to fire his ministers for the <strong>wrong advise in signing the Free Trade Agreement with the controversial US Beef issue</strong> included as a package ?</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>So u have flip flop in your stand and u r not right minded</em></span></span></span></p>
              <p>Now the point I wanna discuss is already different, as stated previously. It is the interpretation of the 3 sentences u put in. If u again refuse to elaborate on the statement, then u proved u had flip flop in your stand about putting china in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>First, u did not put in china's name in the list with the most number of millionaire in the region. Sure, u can choose not to put china in the example. However u claim tat putting hong kong is equivalent to putting china's name in the infamous reply</em></p>
              <p><span><em>Are you not being petty about China being left out ?</em></span></p>
              <p><strong><span><em>Is Hong Kong not part of China ?</em></span></strong></p>
              <p><span><em>Would you believe that China was intentionally left out as bait for an expected outburst from you ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Now if u read the above statement, u can conclude it implies tat u did not put in china name in because hong kong is part of china. The important sentence is the one in bold. If u had meant otherwise, why do u put in tat sentence ? I have repeated ask u to elaborate another logical explanatino to the above statement which u refused repeatedly refused. Furthermore the third sentences is asking a question. It can be "Yes I intentionally left it out and it is used as a bait" and "No, I did not leave it out and it is there because hong kong is there"</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have shown my points tat your reports is not following your model on hw a "democratic economy" works. If u think it do, then u have to quote out the relevant passages from your report tat supports such belief. Otherwise u again had shown yourself to be dishonest since u claim a definition of a word which is wrong and twist and turn it to watever u want.</p>
              <p>Wat about the many reports u pasted before ? All of them contradicts your idea ? Why not give the relevant passage from the 4 reports u yourself provide ? And the link u give for your</p>
              <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sandersresearch.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;amp;id=1089">“Why a Democratic Economy would be more efficient economy” . </a></p>
              <p>IS DEAD. How do u expect me to comment on a dead link ?</p>
              <p>In the end wat ? No statistic data and it is just wild guesses. The only statistic data shows singapore had more proportion of people who r millionaires compared with hong kong.</p>
              <p>It is saddening to see u harping on the word "implosion". Is tat all u can complain about ? I probably got more than 10 different things I can talk about</p>
              <p>And how do u know these car washers can't be ordinary migrants ? I already told u before. I see them working in coffeeshops, driving buses, washing cars, taking public transport, in the IT line, study in university and generally working like normal people. If tis group of people r not your so called 50% of the migrants, then where do tis big group of people go to ? Adding 50 % of the population is a big amount. Out of 3 person u see, 1 is a migrant. And then u claim they r not ordinary people who r seen to work ordinary.</p>
              <p>U mean u claiming they r not here as ordinary citizen ? I don't see the hightlight.</p>
              <p>U claim singapore attract a lot of foreigners I also say hong kong also attract a lot of chinese into the territory. Chinese r not considered forreigner and it is not within your report scope</p>
              <p>It is just funny tat u refuse to answer even your own question. If it is a plot, u r the one devising it. U r the one tat ask tis question first</p>
              <p>I already reply u previously, u did not reply. So obviously I can conclude u concede. </p>
              <p>U r not answering to the point. Then isn't it obvious tat democracy in politics had nothing to do with "democracting" the economy ? U claimed tis indian PM liberalise india economy. But the fact is he done it too late. China who is not democratic yet had "democrat" their economy. Tat is why their economy is better and they r more influential. So wat is the point of democracy in politics when it is mutually independent to economy ? U refuse to answer the above point and talk about other stuffs. I put it in number form for u</p>
              <p>4.3.1) India is democratic for many years. China is not democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.2) U claim india economy is not "democratic" in the past and surprisingly claim china economy is for many years. Tat is your explanation why china's economy is better than india despite india being democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.3) Then the question is, Wat is the point of democracy in politics, if it does not lead to it to be a "democratic" economic ? Why people choose democracy is simply because they should get a better life. They should not choose it because the westerners sing praise of it.</p>
              <p>And now u talk about something completely different. U r claiming we should not compare with china since it is not a democratic country. Why not ? Why compare</p>
              <p>Singapore Versus India + Hong Kong</p>
              <p>and not</p>
              <p>Singapore + China against Hong Kong + India ?</p>
              <p>U r again out of point</p>
              <p>I also realise u refuse to answer on your civil servant reply. I pasted it again for u to reply</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I got to ask also... wat happened to your civil servant reply ? u claim all civil servants cannot vote and they do not deserve to vote in your ideal model of democracy. So it is no longer one person one vote anymore. So wat is your stand on tis matter now ?</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It began with you throwing a challenge in questioning that no CEO will invest in Zimbabwe, and I showed that you had no CEO talent to be in any position to take any decision to invest in Zimbabwe, and showed that even China will invest in Zimbabwe like Singapore Inc does globally. You disputed the fact that even China will invest in Zimbabwe and Congo, and facts were presented - which got you to reject these as being State investment that are incomparable to private Corporate investments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now I moved on to show you that even private UK companies have planned or even returned to trade in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe - and you bring up the subject that EU sanctions will stop these from happening.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that you are simply determined to win in this argument to insist that no one will invest in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now you change tact again by claiming that China have the means of ensuring business deals will be followed by Zimbabwe as it has the capacity to attack Zimbabwe - which I questioned your expertise in geo-politics in understanding China's present military capacity compared to the military power of the USA.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you miss this point stated previously - and will claim at this stage - "</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>U did not mention on the contrast of powers and dwell instead on whether will china attack or not</strong></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">" ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your brilliant reply was that China had shown its propensity to have attacked India and Vietnam, and will also be in a capacity to attack Zimbabwe, which I had stated that both India and Vietnam shared a common land border that allowed China to cross easily and assert their position. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why are you hiding behind the fact that China is a country and should not invest in Zimbabwe ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When I mentioned that China had invested, I had also mentioned that it had done so like Singapore Inc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The decision was not made by Hu Jin Tao or Wen Jia Pao, it was some mid-level political personality given the authority as a CEO to invest state funds - much like Singapore Inc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I mention anywhere that EU is the entire world, or is this not another of your juvenile outburst in throwing another tantrum when you have already been cornered ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">With less and less countries prepared to trade with Zimbabwe, do you believe that Robert Mugabe will not treasure those who will be prepared to put money into Zimbabwe ?</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It began with you throwing a challenge in questioning that no CEO will invest in Zimbabwe, and I showed that you had no CEO talent to be in any position to take any decision to invest in Zimbabwe, and showed that even China will invest in Zimbabwe like Singapore Inc does globally. You disputed the fact that even China will invest in Zimbabwe and Congo, and facts were presented - which got you to reject these as being State investment that are incomparable to private Corporate investments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now I moved on to show you that even private UK companies have planned or even returned to trade in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe - and you bring up the subject that EU sanctions will stop these from happening.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that you are simply determined to win in this argument to insist that no one will invest in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now you change tact again by claiming that China have the means of ensuring business deals will be followed by Zimbabwe as it has the capacity to attack Zimbabwe - which I questioned your expertise in geo-politics in understanding China's present military capacity compared to the military power of the USA.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you miss this point stated previously - and will claim at this stage - "</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>U did not mention on the contrast of powers and dwell instead on whether will china attack or not</strong></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">" ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your brilliant reply was that China had shown its propensity to have attacked India and Vietnam, and will also be in a capacity to attack Zimbabwe, which I had stated that both India and Vietnam shared a common land border that allowed China to cross easily and assert their position. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why are you hiding behind the fact that China is a country and should not invest in Zimbabwe ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When I mentioned that China had invested, I had also mentioned that it had done so like Singapore Inc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The decision was not made by Hu Jin Tao or Wen Jia Pao, it was some mid-level political personality given the authority as a CEO to invest state funds - much like Singapore Inc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I mention anywhere that EU is the entire world, or is this not another of your juvenile outburst in throwing another tantrum when you have already been cornered ?</span></p>

              <p>And how do u know these car washers can't be ordinary migrants ? I already told u before. I see them working in coffeeshops, driving buses, washing cars, taking public transport, in the IT line, study in university and generally working like normal people. If tis group of people r not your so called 50% of the migrants, then where do tis big group of people go to ? Adding 50 % of the population is a big amount. Out of 3 person u see, 1 is a migrant. And then u claim they r not ordinary people who r seen to work ordinary.</p>

              <p>U mean u claiming they r not here as ordinary citizen ? I don't see the hightlight.</p>

              <p>U claim singapore attract a lot of foreigners I also say hong kong also attract a lot of chinese into the territory. Chinese r not considered forreigner and it is not within your report scope</p>

              <p>It is just funny tat u refuse to answer even your own question. If it is a plot, u r the one devising it. U r the one tat ask tis question first</p>

              <p>I already reply u previously, u did not reply. So obviously I can conclude u concede. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I not mention that even as India was a political democracy, its economy was under the autocratic control of its bureaucracy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it was not until PM Mamohan Singh's decision to liberalise India's economy from autocratic control that saw India blossomed and produced all the millionaires.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r not answering to the point. Then isn't it obvious tat democracy in politics had nothing to do with "democracting" the economy ? U claimed tis indian PM liberalise india economy. But the fact is he done it too late. China who is not democratic yet had "democrat" their economy. Tat is why their economy is better and they r more influential. So wat is the point of democracy in politics when it is mutually independent to economy ? U refuse to answer the above point and talk about other stuffs. I put it in number form for u</p>
              <p>4.3.1) India is democratic for many years. China is not democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.2) U claim india economy is not "democratic" in the past and surprisingly claim china economy is for many years. Tat is your explanation why china's economy is better than india despite india being democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.3) Then the question is, Wat is the point of democracy in politics, if it does not lead to it to be a "democratic" economic ? Why people choose democracy is simply because they should get a better life. They should not choose it because the westerners sing praise of it.</p>
              <p>And now u talk about something completely different. U r claiming we should not compare with china since it is not a democratic country. Why not ? Why compare</p>
              <p>Singapore Versus India + Hong Kong</p>
              <p>and not</p>
              <p>Singapore + China against Hong Kong + India ?</p>
              <p>U r again out of point</p>
              <p>I also realise u refuse to answer on your civil servant reply. I pasted it again for u to reply</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I got to ask also... wat happened to your civil servant reply ? u claim all civil servants cannot vote and they do not deserve to vote in your ideal model of democracy. So it is no longer one person one vote anymore. So wat is your stand on tis matter now ?</strong></span></p>

              <p><br>Yes. But if you make long paragraphs and text, its more prudent to try to write so that it seems interesting so that people will read right? I hope I have not offended you in any way. Just that like few people reading it. I thought I say something about it.</p>
