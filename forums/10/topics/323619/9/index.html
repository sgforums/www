              <p>all the more you should be more economical with your words, becos the forumers will start reading again. hence, your case will more likely be heard/read (whether right or not)</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am amaze that you will reply to "Mostwanted5125" remarks - {in Italics} - into your present reply to my last response ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If I am petty, I would look at this as an added insult to the verbal assault towards "common sense" that you have preferred to adopt from the moment that you registered your "nick".- which is further seen in your wilful ways in arguing against common sense.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am even more surpirsed that you will see this as a test of patience, when you have persisted in using idiocy to prove your position.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can there be any objectivity in this exercise to prove your idiocy is wrong, when you insist on its correctness ?</span></p>
              <p>Who had wrote a law saying tat I cannot reply to another person within the same reply ? The message actually is for u to see and the important point is to <strong>reduce verbal abuses</strong>. However u completely skip tis main point and jump to silly issues like reply to 2 people within the same reply or just insult my log in name. U really lost objectivity and u act just like a turtle snapping on anything. It is a surprise u refuse to treat yourself and act like a gentleman and prefer to become a low class person working only on verbal abuses</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I would not put it pass you to understand good manners and simple courtesy, judging by your expertise in debunking conventional wisdom by twisting even your kind of logic on its head.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since there are no 'laws' that you will respect except those that you create - or those that you find convenient to take shelter when necessary, it is not surprising that you will expect me to follow your kind of "Law in Stupidity is Smart" - when my arguments raised do not conform to your way of thinking.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Am I merely repeating or are you not repeating the fact that your "Theory" is related to "the whole idea" that I have presented ? Is there anything wrong with this fact being repeated ? Was it not about this paragraph itself that you got it wrong from the start claiming it to be a "theory" - and attributing this "theory" to be my creation ?</span></p>
              <p>I can see why u just keep saying the same thing over and over again. Tis is because u have nothing else to talk about. I already said tat the "theory", is your idea which is pasted in blue. U agree in here tat I am mentioning your "theory", if u prefer, "idea" as mentioning tis paragraph.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Has it not always been your wish to insist that I have nothing else to talk but to accept the stupidity that you have propounded so vigorously in your insisted position, and to simply be dismissive of my arguments concerning this point about whose "Theory" it has always been ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The pent-up social pressures may lead to a <strong>Krakatoa volcanic outburst</strong>, when social, economic and political stresses takes a bigger toll out of daily lives of Singaporeans that leads to sudden political swings that are unpredictable.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now the only problem is, u do not like the word "theory" to be used for tis idea but instead prefer the word "idea". I got to ask, why the word "theory" cannot be used to describe the blue worded paragraph ?</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it about the word "Theory" alone, or the entire statement in your claim made from reading my paragraph ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Attempting to dodge the issue by micro-arguments and prolonging the issue has been your style across these last 8 pages - now that we have gone into Pg 9.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you so brilliantly conclude in your own "<em>theory tat singapore gonna implode</em>" from the paragraph that you have so diligently quoted from me and shown in Italics without mistake - when compared to what you have written further down your reply that I will address accordingly ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For the moment, it is your own "<em>theory tat singapore gonna implode</em>" - and it is ridiculous, formed from your "wild guesses" after reading my paragraph - and this is the crux of the argument that continue to fester as you dodge this issue by creating more issues, as seen in the text of the next paragraph in your reply...</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have already stated many times tat u have concluded tat singapore is not political stable in future and it results in CEO making significant risk in singapore so much so tat it is worse the china in terms of risk. Tis is looking into the future which u cannot do. Then wat is wrong with the use of the word "theory". The despicable thing u do it simply to ignore tis point repeatedly.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What point have I not been able to answer and ignored - or has my answer been too inconvenient for your purpose in perpetuating the lie that you prefer to make out of what I have presented in my replies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can no one look into the future - even in the form or format that you have insisted  ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only you will not wish to make any predictions of any future - even concerning how smart you can be, given your satisfaction in your status quo. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that sane persons will not look at their present situation, form some judgment of the present circumstances, and make a decision to "estimate" the likely outcome in the future ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not expecting CEO to make similar effort to "look into the future" based on the known and existing risks level and estimate the outcome for their various investments in any country ? {Perhaps it is a wrong question given to you, as you have no CEO talent or skills to give such a reply.??? }</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The point with the word "Theory" is that you have attributed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conclusion in the manner that you prefer</span> to be mine, when the ACTUAL interpretation is your own, in your unique belief that the "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">theory tat singapore gonna implode</span></em>" - from your own preferred conclusion formed by reading with your own preferred color visions from my paragraph formed by words that are clearly and simply printed.</span></p>

              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">On the other hand, you claimed similar severity in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">China's high level of corruption</span> - based on Hu Jin Tao's statements - and conclude that China's position is worst then Singapore position for investments, as China level of corruption leads to copyright infringement. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why did you not extend Hu Jin Tao's concern that if China's corruption is left unchecked, it will lead to the collapse of China ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not simply due to the fact that it was inconvenient for your purpose to project Singapore's stability to attract investment ? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I showed you that despite all your claims of China's instability due to high level of corruption and your preferred side-effects in copyright infringements - China is still able to attract a larger FDI, as Hu Jin Tao and his Government has taken strong actions to reverse the corruption situation in China.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">You claimed in your own "<em>theory of Singapore's collapse by implosion</em>", but will not extend the same weightage from reading Hu's statement concerning corruption.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">An end point that you claim is irrelevant for you to conclude - as stated in your reply on Pg 7 18 Jul'08-5.45PM. but will instead digress to another conclusion claiming China's inability to respect contracts, will back-track and renegade on deals made that leads to copyright infringements.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff;">That has been my statement since Pg 3 - is there any use for your insistence in repeatedly re-defining your postion ?</span></span> </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At least, you have used the word - important" with the word "stability" - so many times, that it has allowed me to clearly form the conclusion that it is an <strong>important factor</strong> for your position.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Tat is right it is important. But tis is different from "most important". Since u claim "implosion" is a mistake, and u said the below</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No you did not use the exact words "most important" - and neither did I use the exat word - "imploded".</span></p>

               There r some problems with sgforums and the reply u set is not the reply it gives out<p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The para is below</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I pointed out to u repeatedly tat china is a powerful country and had more leverage compared with an ordinary company such as providing arms, UN veto, south african influence and many others. U did not mention on the contrast of powers and dwell instead on whether will china attack or not.</span></strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>And I have shown these companies r having problems now due to the EU sanction. The problems of investing in political instable country is even more obvious now.</strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Lost ? U just refuse to comment on the main point which I am bringing out.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">As I had stated before - you say alot without saying anything, and will need to redefine everything that you did not say the first time, even when you have said it so clearly.</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Other than talking rubbish and insults in the reply, do u have anything to say about the analogy now and at peace with the metaphor I had given now ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The conclusion remains the same - you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do not</strong></span> need to say exactly that "political stability" is "THE Most Important" factor - but reading enough of the points made about "poitical stability" and the various shades of importance that you insist on this point alone - it does not take any genius "Stupid-is-Smart" thinker to know how much stupidity you prefer to argue over this point that 'Political Stability" is a critical point in your scheme of things.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r repeating a point which I had also repeatedly rebuked. Your conclusion obviously is wrong. I have stated political stability is important, but it is not the most important factor. U have never shown any examples of me stating it is the most important. The reason why u claim I said it is the most important simply because I repeat, when the reason why I repeat is simply because u repeatedly refuse to listen</p>
              <p>Is saying the same thing many times = it is the most important ?</p>
              <p>Is a geography teacher saying geography is important = she must means geography is the most important subject for mankind ?</p>
              <p>Is a person saying eating vegetable is good for health repeatedly = she must eat nothing but vegetable for her whole life ?</p>
              <p>I have stated the example of the geography teacher many times which u again refuse to comment or listen. Tis is again nothing but a black and white thinking of yours. Saying repeatedly doesn't mean it must be the primary factor. It just shows u repeatedly refuse to listen</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you finally awaken from your stupor to recognise what has been said in the preceding pages in different forms ?</span></p>

              <p>Tat is the first u mention tis. It is u who finally realise wat is the more important thing to talk about</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again, you repeat that "political stability" is an "important factor"  - and this had been repeated at each and every opportunity given to you, and yet you can be hypocritical to claim that you have never claimed <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Political Stability"</span></strong> to be the 'MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR".</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r really just wasting my time. I have never claim china is gonna collapse or singapore is gonna collapse of political stability is the most important consideration. All tis is u trying to force me in concluding. Now the only thing u do is simply try to force your words on me then attack on these false conclusions which I never stated. Isn't tat despicable, dishonest and frankly, disgusting way of debating.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="color: #0000ff;">

              </span></blockquote>
              <p>U r the one making all the false claims here and proving tat will be a lot of false claim around any society. I have already stated tons of examples on fase claims circulating a lot of countries which again u refuse to see. In fact from all your replies, filled to the brim with verbal abuses, it clearly shows why politician have the right to sue on slander or libel. They do it to control such a despicable low class person from abusing the system and give insults for nothing. Isn't tat already evidences of my conclusion ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were you too embarrassed for the idiocy that had been exposed in this reply that you refused to quote in full that had referred to your last response being addressed ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat is inside the reply u stated ? Nothing but verbal abuses and u expect me to paste it all out ? Com'on la. I can never achieved your ability in giving verbal abuses over nothing.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even in attempting to explain the difference <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with and without</span></em> the word "almost" -  you have already shown the idiocy in your thought process. Are you drained ?</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Drained ? U mean giving abuses without elaboration is better ? I have already clearly stated the differences with the word "almost" which u clearly remove. Again it is another attempt by u in putting words into other people's mouth which u have shown to do it repeatedly. Wat does tis say about your character</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Com'on la... I thought u support people to protest. Does protest necessary leads to violence ? Another black and white thinking of yours or u r beginning to think like PAP ? A group of people can choose to protest in seoul while the other "right minded" group can choose to protest in another city. Will tis 2 group meet ? Nope. Do they have to have an open confrontation ? Nope. Do they have to hurt each other ? Nope. Can they get their message across ? Yes. So how come nobody stand up against the beef protesters ? Isn't tat again show tat it is 50,000 to zero</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Again u have shown yourself to be incapable of looking at the main point brought but instead nitpicking on stupid details such as the one above. I have stated tis point repeatedly</p>
              <p><em>It is not about whether is george bush, chen shui bian or dick cheny being right minded. It is about even the US president, Taiwan president and a high gov officials considered to be not "right minded".

              <p>And wat is your answer to tis ? NOTHING ! U just keep talking about other issues, hurling insults and say nothing on the main point. And the whole idea is about president. Look at the line in bold. George bush and chen shui bian r just examples tat support my statement.</p>
              <p><em>Almost everybody will lie and make false claims in politics. <strong>Even Presidents can make false claims to support their stand</strong>.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The problem with this ongoing "discussion" is that you refused to accept the situation that you have been proven to be bankrupt in your values and thought processes, but will refuse to accept the clear facts presented by redefining and changing your postion with new clarification and new arguments.</span></p>

              <p>U see the above, u have only come out with 3 lines tat r relevant to the discussion namely the one in blue. The others r simply verbal abuses. Removing the quoted words, the only relevant words to the point is simply 47 words while the irrlevant insults is 194. And u expect me to quote out all your rubbish when it is just verbal abuses ?

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I not mention that even as India was a political democracy, its economy was under the autocratic control of its bureaucracy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it was not until PM Mamohan Singh's decision to liberalise India's economy from autocratic control that saw India blossomed and produced all the millionaires.</span></p>

              <p>U r not answering to the point. Then isn't it obvious tat democracy in politics had nothing to do with "democracting" the economy ? U claimed tis indian PM liberalise india economy. But the fact is he done it too late. China who is not democratic yet had "democrat" their economy. Tat is why their economy is better and they r more influential. So wat is the point of democracy in politics when it is mutually independent to economy ? U refuse to answer the above point and talk about other stuffs. I put it in number form for u</p>
              <p>4.3.1) India is democratic for many years. China is not democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.2) U claim india economy is not "democratic" in the past and surprisingly claim china economy is for many years. Tat is your explanation why china's economy is better than india despite india being democratic</p>
              <p>4.3.3) Then the question is, Wat is the point of democracy in politics, if it does not lead to it to be a "democratic" economic ? Why people choose democracy is simply because they should get a better life. They should not choose it because the westerners sing praise of it.</p>
              <p>And now u talk about something completely different. U r claiming we should not compare with china since it is not a democratic country. Why not ? Why compare</p>
              <p>Singapore Versus India + Hong Kong</p>
              <p>and not</p>
              <p>Singapore + China against Hong Kong + India ?</p>
              <p>U r again out of point</p>
              <p>I also realise u refuse to answer on your civil servant reply. I pasted it again for u to reply</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I got to ask also... wat happened to your civil servant reply ? u claim all civil servants cannot vote and they do not deserve to vote in your ideal model of democracy. So it is no longer one person one vote anymore. So wat is your stand on tis matter now ?</strong></span></p>
