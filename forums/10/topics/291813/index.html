            <div class='col-md body'>A forummer displeasure:<br><br>Sounds to me like you are trying to brush aside ordinary SÂ’poreansÂ’ thinking by terming them as Â“politics of envyÂ”. I think SÂ’poreans are not like a frog in a well; we do know that the rich gets to enjoy a certain life-style. We envy these people, but we donÂ’t begrudge them.<br><br>Of late, it seems that the word Â“globalisationÂ” has been conveniently used as an excuse for any and all negatively conceived policies of the ruling party. Can the party explain what exactly is Â“globalisationÂ” and why it means we have to bear with lower wages and longer working hours?? SÂ’pore is not the only country subject to Â“globalisationÂ”, but we donÂ’t see citizens of other countries sacrificing as much as we do. OhhÂ…and donÂ’t start the Â“SÂ’pore has not natural resourcesÂ” crap again because this is the 21st century, not 1960s. Police-men donÂ’t wear shorts anymore.<br><br>LetÂ’s talk about meritocracy and equal opportunities in SÂ’pore. It doesnÂ’t take an idiot to know that there is no such thing as real meritoracy in SÂ’pore. For starter, tell us why sons of senior govt officials are listed as Â“white horseÂ” while serving NS??? Our dear minister Raymond made a lousy attempt to justify this practice by saying it is to prevent special treatment for these sons!!! Is he taking us as morons? If you donÂ’t point out these special sons, how in the world would army officers know they are Â“white horsesÂ”???<br><br>Second, children of the rich and senior civil servants can easily get admitted to top primary schools. Why is that so?? Third, I always wonder why spouses and relatives of senior govt officials always hold senior private sector positions, earning big bucks. The list goes on and on.<br><br>Now, we have ministers telling us that they need another million dollars a year to Â“motivateÂ” them to stay in office!!! ThatÂ’s a load of crap-shit. Name me a minister (or Perm Sec or any other senior govt official) who has made it big in the private sector.</div>
