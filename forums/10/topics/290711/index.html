Is the runway still safe?<br><br>Mr Liew Mun Leong, who was part of the Public Works Department (PWD) team that built the airport, said it was not in the corporate culture to point fingers when mistakes were made - the priority was to just fix it.<br><br>Said Mr Liew, who is now CAAS chairman: 'Mr Sim's emphasis was always: 'What's the problem? How can we move on from here?'<br><br>'He was a wise chap.'<br><br>Running an airport is a 24-7 affair and when problems crop up, they need to be fixed, and fast.<br><br>This 'just fix it' mentality was what made Changi's predecessor, Paya Lebar Airport, work, too.<br><br>Mr Goh Chin Ee, director of the Singapore Aviation Academy, remembers that at Paya Lebar - which was the country's main civilian airport between 1955 and 1981 - there was just one runway, compared to the two that Changi now has.<br><br>He said: 'So whenever something happened - like if an aircraft broke down on the runway - we had to work fast to clear it so that others could land.'<br><br>This focus on getting the job done - whatever the challenges - is crucial when 'you can have all kinds of problems - fuel crises, Sars, airlines starting, airlines dying, air service quarrels'.<br><br><strong>A WISE CHAP</strong><br><br>'Mr Sim's emphasis was always: 'What's the problem?

In many countries, the airport manager cannot tell Customs what to do, and, in some places, cannot even enter the Customs area.'<br><br>In Changi, cooperation and coordination between the different departments, government agencies and commercial organisations are nurtured and encouraged.<br><br>Everyone moves as one to serve that most important entity - the passenger.<br><br>The CAAS, as conductor of the Changi orchestra, has to take responsibility for the total performance, Mr Wong said.<br><br>This is why, added the man behind the building of Changi Airport, Mr Sim Kee Boon, 'we instilled, right from the start, a mindset among airport management and agencies involved - even the private retailers - that the comfort, convenience and well-being of the passenger must be paramount'.<br><br>'That's who the airport is for - the passenger.'<br><br>It is a basic philosophy that has endured to this day.<br><br>This team approach is also critical to tackling emergencies.<br><br>During the Sars outbreak, for instance, it was a solid team effort from the CAAS and other key players - such as airport police, medical personnel, immigration, Customs and airline partners - which won the battle for Singapore.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

He remembers the airport's first night in 1981 when only three aeroplanes were parked on the tarmac.<br><br>'The airport was so huge and there were only three planes. That night, I wondered how we were ever going to fill up the airport. It seemed impossible. But look at Changi now. Whoever thought it was going to be this busy?' said Mr Lim, now a 60-year-old father of two grown-up children.<br><br>He was among 25 airport staff who were honoured at yesterday's celebrations. These people have worked at Changi Airport for the past 25 years.<br><br>Another recipient, Mr Abdul Hamid Ahmad, 56, remembers the public excitement when the first commercial flight landed on Changi's tarmac on opening day.<br><br>'The viewing gallery was crowded with people, both staff and members of the public. It was a novelty to see the plane touch the runway because there were no viewing galleries at Paya Lebar,' said Mr Abdul Hamid, a duty manager for cargo and flight operations at German airline company Lufthansa.<br><br>Mr Tay Kim Seng, a supervisor with the airport's meteorological station for 42 years, remembers the first few critical hours when the airport took over operations from Paya Lebar.<br><br>'We were under great pressure...Many of us worked late that night to make sure things went smoothly,' said the 59-year-old.<br><br>Old-timers like him have no plans to leave their jobs at the airport, which has become their home and their source of pride. Said Mr Tay: 'We're all very proud to have contributed in one way or other to its progress, no matter how little we've done.'<br><br>ndianah@sph.com.sg<br><br>karam@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2006, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

That's how former employees and friends described Sim Kee Boon, who will retire as senior adviser group at the end of June.<br><br>Mr Sim was appointed the group's senior adviser on Jan 1, 2000, when he stepped down after some 15 years as the conglomerate's executive chairman.<br><br>In a statement yesterday announcing Mr Sim's retirement, Keppel thanked Mr Sim for his 'immense contribution and total dedication to the Keppel group for the past 19 years'.<br><br>Keppel, it said, has grown and benefited from his business acumen, network and experience.<br><br>An avid golfer, the sun-tanned Mr Sim will, however, remain adviser to the Spring City Golf and Lake Resort, 'a task which, we are sure, he will enjoy', said Keppel. Spring City Golf is the Keppel group's resort and golf course complex in Kunming, Yunnan province, where Mr Sim, 73, is frequently seen teeing off.<br><br>Mr Sim continues to be adviser to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore board and the Lum Chang group. He has also been a director of Temasek Holdings since January 2000, and a member of the Singapore Council of Presidential Advisers since 1997.<br><br>Choo Chiau Beng, chairman of Keppel Offshore and Marine, said: 'As a mentor, he accepts you are not perfect but encourages you to do your best. He has expectations that you will perform to your best.'<br><br>Mr Choo has worked with Mr Sim for nearly 20 years, from 1984 when the latter was appointed executive chairman of the Keppel group.<br><br>At that time, Mr Sim had retired as head of the civil service to take charge of the financially troubled Keppel group. Then prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had told him: 'Go and turn the company around.'<br><br>At that time, Keppel was saddled with debts of $845 million, half of which was a result of the over-ambitious takeover of the Straits Steamship group. From a staggering loss of $174 million in 1984, the group staged a turnaround in just two years, earning a $5 million profit in 1986.<br><br>Another interesting point which Mr Choo highlighted was the fact that when Mr Sim joined Keppel, he came alone. 'He did not bring anyone with him from the civil service, not even his secretary. Some people (bring their friends and associates) for comfort level.<br><br>'He formed his judgment that he can use people within Keppel and went along with it.'<br><br>Another person who regarded him as a mentor is Streats' business editor Conrad Raj.<br><br>Mr Raj, who has known Mr Sim since 1989, said: 'I used to fear him because of his reputation but once I got to know him, the fear dissipated. He became a friend and mentor.<br><br>'He is inquisitive, he wants to know about things. Also, he is not one who cares about rank; he looks after everyone from top to the lowest in the company.'<br><br>Copyright, 2003, 2004, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">The inspiring Keppel men</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sunday Times, The (Singapore)<br>Sunday Plus! Page 4<br>September 10, 2000<br>Author: RICKLIM </span><br><br>LIFE'S LESSONS<br><br>With their tales of humble beginnings, hard work, and bold risk-taking, the tough men of Keppel Shipyard inspire equal diligence and dedication<br><br>RECENTLY, I was asked to nominate a colleague to give a talk on journalism to a workshop comprising junior college students.<br><br>Ordinarily, I would nominate someone who could do it without too much fuss, and forget about it.<br><br>But this time round, I nominated myself, since I thought I was of an age when I should be taking on more civic duties such as this one, and not push them to my younger colleagues.<br><br>But when the organisers of the workshop finalised the date and told me that my slot was an 8 am one, I almost wished I hadn't nominated myself.<br><br>It meant my having to get up before 7 am, since the venue was more than half an hour's drive from my home, and goodness, when was the last time I had to get up at even 8 o'clock? It must have been more than 10 years ago, when I had to attend a friend's breakfast wedding ceremony.<br><br>I did it anyway - I hope I acquitted myself well - and only because I reminded myself of the story the widow of Mr Chua Chor Teck recounted to me back in 1993, when I interviewed her for a commissioned book to mark Keppel Corporation's 25th anniversary<br><br>...................<br><br>IF MR CHUA'S story is an inspiration, so are those of Mr Loh, who became the MD in 1986 and retired in June last year, and of Mr Sim Kee Boon, who was chairman of the group from 1984 till the end of last year, when he too retired.<br><br>....................<br><br>When Mr Sim was appointed executive chairman Keppel in 1984, he was 55, and had already put in 30 years of illustrious service in the public sector. Keppel had fallen into a hole then, as he described it, its cash purchase of Straits Steamship in 1983 saddling it with a debt of nearly $845 million. His job was "to get it out of the hole".<br><br>As if that wasn't bad enough, the shipbuilding and ship-repair business during that period was pronounced a sunset industry by the pundits, and in 1985, after its study of the two shipyards, the American management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co proposed that Keppel and Sembawang be merged.<br><br>The study, commissioned by the two yards, was believed to have cost $1 million. But Mr Sim didn't think a merger was necessary. He rejected the "expert" proposal, which led to the Wall Street Journal and The Economist anticipating blood on the floor.<br><br>Yet by the end of 1986, he had turned Keppel around coolly. And he never had to look back - over the next decade, he grew it into a Singapore flagship company. During all that time, he was also the man behind Changi airport, as chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority.<br><br>I took away from my one interview with Mr Sim this invaluable lesson in management: He said: "I give my managers far more direction and power than a lot of other people. I don't see them for days, even weeks. I don't keep them on a leash ...<br><br>"My philosophy is this: This is your job, you do it. If you can't do it, I'll take it back. If you can, I'll give you more. If you have any major problem, let me know."<br><br>I thought about these tough men when I visited the showflats for the new Keppel showcase which is coming up in the place of the old shipyard. An era has passed.<br><br>* Richard Lim's website is at http://LimRichard.tripod.com<br><br>Copyright, 2000, 2004, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Man who made Changi fly and Keppel swim dies of cancer</span><br>Legacy of Singapore stalwart Sim Kee Boon, 77, lives on</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Business Times, The (Singapore)<br>Top Stories<br>November 10, 2007<br>Author: Conrad Raj</span><br><br>HE was the man tasked to build Changi Airport. He was also the one given the job of turning Keppel Shipyard around. And it was about him that Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once said: 'He was the shrewdest of our permanent secretaries.'<br><br>Sim Kee Boon, the former head of civil service, died yesterday at the age of 77 with his legacy still thriving around him. Mr Sim was hospitalised about a month ago following the recurrence of a cancer that had claimed half his stomach some 17 years ago.<br><br>The brilliant bureaucrat was part of that rare breed of civil servants who also enjoyed great success in government-linked businesses. He was someone who believed in excellence and quality, not only in work but also in life - a man who enjoyed good company, good food and good wine.<br><br>His colleagues remember him as a good mentor, a big-picture person who was also interested in and attended to details.<br><br>Mr Lee and the government was so impressed with him that he was often entrusted with turning around some of the government's ailing companies and embarking on its most ambitious projects.<br><br>He was the man tasked to build Changi Airport and did such a splendid job that it has been receiving one accolade after another since its opening in July 1981, including World's Best Airport title for many years running. His connection with his best-known legacy continued and Mr Sim was recently appointed chairman of a new advisory group to help in the global expansion of the airport.<br><br>When he arrived on board Keppel Shipyard in February of 1984, just after he had retired after a five-year stint as the head of the civil service, Mr Sim was told by then PM Lee: 'Go and turn the company around.'<br><br>Keppel was struggling at that point, following its purchase of Straits Steamship for what was then considered a staggering $500 million. Mr Sim had admitted that he had no specialist qualifications for the job, but his instincts served him well.<br><br>From a painful loss of $174 million that year, the group swam out of red ink within just two years to turn a profit of $5 million. Today, the Keppel Group is one of Singapore's largest conglomerates with a market capitalisation of well over $30 billion, if Keppel Land and Keppel Telecommunications &amp; Transportation are included.<br><br>His attitude sat well with his colleagues. Choo Chiau Beng, Keppel's deputy chief executive and chairman of Keppel Offshore and Marine, who had worked with Mr Sim since his arrival at the company, said of him: 'As a mentor, he accepts you are not perfect but encourages you to do your best. He has expectations that you will perform to your best.'<br><br>Mr Sim held himself to the same standards. Educated at the Anglo-Chinese School, he joined the civil service after graduating from the University of Malaya in 1953, and quickly rose to become acting permanent secretary of the National Development Ministry in 1962, and the Finance Ministry in 1963.<br><br>He was also seconded to start up Intraco, which became the government's trading and manufacturing company.<br><br>Intraco's former managing director, S Chandra Das, remembers him as 'my xifu (mentor) who taught me everything I know about business today; he was a caring and forgiving boss'.<br><br>In 1975, Mr Sim moved to the Ministry of Communications as perm sec and, in 1979, he was appointed head of the civil service, a post he held till 1984, when he became chairman of Keppel and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. He received the Distinguished Service Order in 1991.<br><br>An avid golfer, Mr Sim was the founder chairman of Tanah Merah Country Club, and adviser to the Spring City Gold and Lake Resort in Kunming, China.<br><br>He was also chairman of the Singapore-Suzhou Township Development, a member and later chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers, and director of DBS and Temasek Holdings.<br><br>Mr Sim is survived by his wife Jeanette, 76, five sons and five grandchildren. Youngest son, Arthur, is a journalist with BT.</div>

While the aviation sector would enjoy many highs, he was tempted at first to shutter loss-making Keppel.<br><br>Instead, within five years, he diversified into engineering, property, financial services and more. He developed shipyards overseas. So out of troubled waters, he drew out one more Singapore icon.<br><br>In his own words, his management philosophy was marked by 'fast decision-making and implementation after careful weighing of risks'.<br><br>Many remember him for his management-by-walking-about style, too.<br><br>He would arrive early at airports elsewhere to scrutinise the details of shopfront lighting, for instance, said Mr David Lum, managing director of Lum Chang Holdings.<br><br>Mr Sim and his wife Jeannette, 76, were avid golfers.<br><br>Mr Edwin Khoo, committee member at the Tanah Merah Country Club, said although Mr Sim could not play golf due to his health, he would still putt around and join golf buddies for drinks most weekends for two hours.<br><br>Until as recently as last month, he was at the club where he was the founding chairman. This despite having undergone chemotherapy and walking with a tube under his shirt, said Mr Khoo.<br><br>His passion for work was legendary, and once there was a comic twist to it.<br><br>Mr Sim was task-oriented boss to businessman S. Chandra Das, 68, in the 60s and 70s, at the Economic Development Board and at Intraco, the state trading company.<br><br>Mr Das recalled taking a day off for his wedding vows at the Registry of Marriages, only to have Mr Sim call and ask: 'Is Chandra Das there? Tell him to come to work.'<br><br>But Mr Das and others remember Mr Sim as a teacher and mentor with a caring touch, despite being synonymous with Singapore's mega-projects and enjoying first-rate global connections.<br><br>In the sombre days after Lum Chang's MRT construction project at Nicoll Highway collapsed in 2004, Mr Sim advised Mr Lum to make voluntary compensations to workers.<br><br>In more joyful moments, if his staff sent him wedding invitations, he would try his best to be there. He would also personally greet new Tanah Merah Country Club members.<br><br>He loved reading, music and certainly golf, and once said his wife played 'far better than I do'.<br><br>A 1972 profile of her in The Sunday Mail described the dynamics of their marriage, which produced five sons: 'He is sharp, pithy, impatient. She is calm, dependable, tactful - the perfect civil servant's wife.'<br><br>Although Mr Sim was known for his meticulous command of details, she affectionately drew aside the curtain on his occasional lapses. He sometimes forgot their theatre dates, or sprang a surprise dinner invitation when she was dripping wet from golf.<br><br>She understood.

Mr Sim proved that he was not just a competent administrator but also an outstanding businessman.<br><br>The Keppel Group was then burdened by debts amounting to nearly $850 million. It did not help that the economy soon ran into a severe downturn.<br><br>But within two years, he had turned Keppel around and generated a modest profit. Over the next decade, he grew the company from a shipyard into one of Singapore's leading conglomerates.<br><br>After Keppel, Mr Sim continued to contribute actively in diverse roles... He was also a member and later chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers, and served on the boards of various companies and government agencies.<br><br>In Temasek Holdings, he not only offered valuable perspectives and sound advice to the senior management, but was also much sought after by the younger officers, who vied to work with him so as to learn how he tackled problems, and imbibe his wisdom and insights.<br><br>An avid golfer, Mr Sim served as chairman of the Tanah Merah Country Club since its opening in 1984.<br><br>With his keen eye for detail and uncompromising insistence on quality, he made Tanah Merah one of the best golf clubs in Singapore.<br><br>Even a diagnosis of cancer in 1990 sapped little of his passion for golf. I remember meeting him in Singapore General Hospital in 1992. His cancer had recurred, and he was about to go for a second major abdominal operation.<br><br>Yet his main concern was whether he would be able to continue playing golf after the operation. Indeed he did, for many more years.<br><br>I was sorry to learn that he had fallen ill again this year. When I met him, he explained how he was leaving the medical decisions entirely to his doctors, in whom he had full confidence, and taking things one day at a time.<br><br>I know he was hoping to see his first grand-daughter's wedding in January. Unfortunately, it was not to be.<br><br>Mr Sim dedicated himself fully to serving the country, and was always ready to answer the call of duty. He had a deep sense of mission, and in every assignment and task, he demanded high standards and gave his best. His passing is a deep loss to all of us.'<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
