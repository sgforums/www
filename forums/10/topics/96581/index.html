            <div class='col-md body'>Dera SibeiSuayKia,<br><br>Just to clarify some mistaken points.<br><br>Singapore was not some little fishing village as you claimed when PAP came into power! We have the most advanced and sophiscated infrastrucutre comparatively in SEA back then! All thanks to the British Colonist... they didn't call us "Crown Colony" for nothing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And contrary to what you say, Singapore is NOT created "single-handedly" by LKY! LKY only provides the Iron Fist rule, for people like Dr. Goh KS, Mr. Hon SS, Mr. Toh Chin Chye...etc etc to create miracles for Singapore.<br><br>Lastly, you will never know whether opposition parties would have done a better job than PAP because you could not turn back clocks and do experiments on that. Thus, it is unfair to make such statements that opposition could not have done a better job than LKY.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SibeiSuayKia:<br><strong>I personally would feel sad and i think i would personally pay a tribute for him..<br>a man who single-handedly made Singapore what it is..<br>a true founder and creator who outlast,outwit,outsmart<br><br>For oppositions , it may also mean that they got more chances in election etc..<br><br>For Singaporeans as a whole, we would have lost a great leader who could propell us into the next world..<br><br>From a small fishing village and a entrepot trade area..to a modern country..<br>of 4 million pple who are well knowledged..strategic location...even without any natural resources like m'sia or indonesia but less then 700 km square of land..<br><br>Into a full fledged armed forces containing more then 100 sophisticated and latest fighter jets armed heavily with aim-120 , 200+ over A-4 Super Skyhawk bombers ,300,000 over troops available within hours in times of war..<br>over tens of ships armed heavily and alot of submarines for years to come..<br>largest and most powerful armed forces in south east asia..a huge arms enterprise which has over few billion in net revenue per year..<br><br>Almost 80 billion USD of GDP a year..world class financial,medical,travel,<br>and lastly PSA...world's busiest port which generates 12 billion in revenue a year<br><br>With 1/3 of the world's trade passing thru here..and China...a superpower in the future...depending on our ports alone<br><br>world class performing theatre..Esplanade.. , over a few hundred billion dollars of bank reserves kept..<br><br>a whole CBD and Orchard Area.....<br><br>and lastly , a non-corrupted man.<br><br>I hereby pay my tribute towards this great man..<br><br>Even though there are so many flames towards PAP and stuff,<br>i don' think the opposition could have done any better or else<br>PAP would be close to losing their power after their first win..<br><br>There is not many years left for this great leader ler..<br>Kudos to him even though some of his policies like<br>propaganda in sch textbooks , or *Coughs* white horse..<br>or probably his family in the high echelons..<br><br>Basically , in ASEAN , We Singaporeans are the only one with the voice..<br>when we speak, everyone listens..<br>We are 1 hell lotta powerful pee sai..<br><br>IMAGINE BG YEO Speaking to over 1 hundred countries..on<br>UN General Assembly..something which the taiwanese will never ever do..<br>and to have the whole world agreeing with us..<br><br>And Taiwan is facing financial difficulties towards coping for the 30 billion modernisation plan..<br><br>for SG , with billions of dollars available, doesn't seem to have any problems financing it .. ^.O , be glad<br><br>Anyone watched Mighty Mouse before?
