I personally also believe that it should remain more or less the same Â¨C as I mentioned, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arab nations in both West Asia and North Africa should become more wary of US unilateral actions </span>now , this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also applies to non-Arab nations in West Asia e.g. Iran.</span><br><br><strong>SaddamÂ¡Â¯s capture is also no humiliation to himself or Arabs/Muslims</strong>.<br><br>Many ArabÂ¡Â¯s, Muslims or those the dislike US (<strong>not necessarily terrorist or extremist)</strong> felt that Saddam had <strong>shamed himself; other Arab viewed his capture as another Arab humiliation by Western forces</strong>.  Others tried in vain to give explanations why Saddam was captured without even fighting back or committed suicide Â¨C <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving unsubstantiated stories like he was drugged or gassed into submission and captured with fainted</span>.<br><br>I donÂ¡Â¯t agree to such views.<br><br><strong>Putting SaddamÂ¡Â¯s atrocities and moral rights/wrongs aside, </strong>Saddam defied US Â¡Â®valiantlyÂ¡Â¯ before which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may make him an Arab hero but that does not make him super human</span>, <strong>Saddam, like most rational human, are afraid to get hurt and afraid to die.</strong><br><br><strong>The situation was very much against him</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he already accomplished an amazing feat by escaping US forces for eight months, considering US forces are everywhere in Iraq</span>.  He <strong>no longer had large army protecting him, not even bodyguards </strong>(unlike his sons who fought back and was killed together with bodyguards), Saddam was also <strong>trapped in a hole with only 1 entrance/exit Â¨C and that was block by his enemies,</strong> where else he could go?<br><br>Moreover, as reported, <strong>Saddam quickly identified himself just seconds before US forces threw in grenades </strong>to ensure no harm will befall on US forces.  <strong>So Saddam was really forced into capture, no shame or humiliation for that.  </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Who is not afraid to die?  Very few indeed</strong></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does the Arabs really still believe in those Saddam propaganda and bullshit that he is not afraid to die?</span>  <strong>Those are made for TV/media when he is still in power and possibility of death/capture is never in his mind</strong>, it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">very different story when you are the no. 1 wanted man in Iraq escaping from the US forces, no good food, shelter, water or entourage of bodyguards for many many months</span>.<br><br>Showing SaddamÂ¡Â¯s medical check up is also not Â¡Â®humiliationÂ¡Â¯ to Arabs, only showing standard of care giving to POW by Coalition/US forces, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his interrogation was not showed on international TV or was Saddam paraded in a humiliating way</span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some ArabÂ¡Â¯s insistence that Saddam should commit suicide or fight to the death </span><strong>when Saddam is already a very defeated man with no other means of escape is not only irrational, it also incites greater hatred and glorifies suicide bombing against innocent civilians</strong>.<br><br>Arabs and Muslim all over the world sometimes should ask themselves<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> whether are the world portraying them in the wrong light </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>or it is they themselves that prefer to die a pointless and violent death, especially against innocent civilians</strong></span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>
