            <div class='col-md body'>just one word from all of you...... do we need so many minster?<br>Why do we need Mr Goh in the SM position?I really don't understand because Singapore is such a small country and do we really need that position?<br>And worst of all, that position is CREATE by no one other then Mr LEE himself.<br>And worst of the worst is, without any really good reason given and just create that position  anyhow.<br>I did not see Mr Goh contribute anythings to the nation beside shaking hands around the world.And he can get the pension, salary and frame and power with that ' create from the thin air' position.And that person is Mr Lee K.Y. So much money wasted to that Mr Goh position i think so.<br>A point to take note is, that Mr Goh position salary, pension was paid by our tax payers money.Not forgetting our CPF sum in that Temasek holdings... also contribute to all the minister salary!<br><br>Another thing to point out is, why do we pay so much money to the president with him getting the pension , salary, power and in the end, he is just another puppet for the PAP?How many money paid to him for just like SM Goh travelling around the world shaking hands, sitting in the president office watching news but when PAP introduce something bad to our nation, he just keep his mouth shut without doing anything?<br>A point to take note is, he hold the key to the reserves of Singapore but instead he take orders from Mr Lee.And worst of all is, we pay so much money to him but he is nothing but another PAP puppet! Cant even help the locals to voice out our angers to the parliament.<br>What a waste of our tax payers money!!!<br><br>And not forgetting, why why do we need SMM position?And that position created by he himself???No law and order in Singapore but law and order from he himself?So does that mean he suka suka can create whateever position he like in order to stay in power?Or maybe because he create that SM position for Mr Goh because he knows some dirty things inside the parliament and that's why to shut his mouth up, Mr Lee create that position inorder to please him?Any idea why did we need that SM position to waste so much tax payers money?<br><br>Lastly, the point taken from the above can be summarise as , we are under one party system where they are above law and order within their own interest.With a one man emperor ruling one small nation, it can be seen as another dynasty been born in Asia.Without any party to watch over that emperor, without any good form of Anti corruption department like the ICAC of Hong Kong to watch over that thunder logo party(please forget about our own Anti corruption deparment as they are under the party, and what a laugh to say our anti corruption police will do whatever the Lee's ask them to do.I think the police wont even dare to do anything to the Lee's including their relatives, friends, without the feer of the Lee's power), our nation will be nothing but the Lee's business empire to do their own business with their own interest!!!<br><br>I hope Singaporeans will wake up from their sleep and really do something for our nation!!! Thanks for reading!!!<br><br>The below link is a must read for all Singaporeans who concern about where our money went to!!!<br><br><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2007/08/25/a-contrast-of-two-schemes-the-annuity-scheme-and-the-pension-scheme/#more-452" rel="nofollow">http://theonlinecitizen.com/2007/08/25/a-contrast-of-two-schemes-the-annuity-scheme-and-the-pension-scheme/#more-452</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, I don't think we have too many Ministers.<br><br>Maybe we have absolutely no need for a Minister Mentor. Just what does he do? Teach the younger Ministers how to "Minister" according to his ways. I may be ignorant, but if its that, then it certainly defeats the purpose of having "Fresh Blood" with "Fresh Ideas".<br><br>I for one think we could do with a lot more ministers, or maybe a lot more employees under the Minister's Office. And these people should take a month of to work as a cabby or someone in a marginalised vocation without any fanfare.<br><br>Cabby is my first choice. Just let them bring out the topic on politics with their peers and their passengers who would hardly recognize them in the taxi and for once they'll have a clearer view on the real Singapore "view" on Politics. It seems now that they have managed to delude themselves, thanks to the "sucking up" employed very much by upper-management and civil service sectors.<br><br>As a contract teacher, I once saw how the entire school changed its face/teaching methods/materials just for one day for the visit of the Education Minister. Yea. Announce it like that and you'll go back with a "painted" image of what the ground really is.<br><br>We indeed need more employees in the ministerial departments to do some real ground work.</div>

Should adopt a hire and fire style of management to these people.</div>

So much money wasted to that Mr Goh position i think so.<br>A point to take note is, that Mr Goh position salary, pension was paid by our tax payers money.Not forgetting our CPF sum in that Temasek holdings... also contribute to all the minister salary!<br><br>Another thing to point out is, why do we pay so much money to the president with him getting the pension , salary, power and in the end, he is just another puppet for the PAP?How many money paid to him for just like SM Goh travelling around the world shaking hands, sitting in the president office watching news but when PAP introduce something bad to our nation, he just keep his mouth shut without doing anything?<br>A point to take note is, he hold the key to the reserves of Singapore but instead he take orders from Mr Lee.And worst of all is, we pay so much money to him but he is nothing but another PAP puppet! Cant even help the locals to voice out our angers to the parliament.<br>What a waste of our tax payers money!!!<br><br>And not forgetting, why why do we need SMM position?And that position created by he himself???No law and order in Singapore but law and order from he himself?So does that mean he suka suka can create whateever position he like in order to stay in power?Or maybe because he create that SM position for Mr Goh because he knows some dirty things inside the parliament and that's why to shut his mouth up, Mr Lee create that position inorder to please him?Any idea why did we need that SM position to waste so much tax payers money?<br><br>Lastly, the point taken from the above can be summarise as , we are under one party system where they are above law and order within their own interest.With a one man emperor ruling one small nation, it can be seen as another dynasty been born in Asia.Without any party to watch over that emperor, without any good form of Anti corruption department like the ICAC of Hong Kong to watch over that thunder logo party(please forget about our own Anti corruption deparment as they are under the party, and what a laugh to say our anti corruption police will do whatever the Lee's ask them to do.I think the police wont even dare to do anything to the Lee's including their relatives, friends, without the feer of the Lee's power), our nation will be nothing but the Lee's business empire to do their own business with their own interest!!!<br><br>I hope Singaporeans will wake up from their sleep and really do something for our nation!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>What can Singaporeans do? Ask opposition to come forward and propose the abolishment of unnecessary positions and strip thier positions right away? Wait till old men age away? Or wait for a day when PAP is being voted out?<br><br>Another questions. Who have the power to strip this unnecessary positions, are they in a position to do that, do they have the ability to do that? Those who have power to do that, are they seeing it unnecessary or are they in line with the old men?</div>
