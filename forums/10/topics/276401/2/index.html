So much money wasted to that Mr Goh position i think so.<br>A point to take note is, that Mr Goh position salary, pension was paid by our tax payers money.Not forgetting our CPF sum in that Temasek holdings... also contribute to all the minister salary!<br><br>Another thing to point out is, why do we pay so much money to the president with him getting the pension , salary, power and in the end, he is just another puppet for the PAP?How many money paid to him for just like SM Goh travelling around the world shaking hands, sitting in the president office watching news but when PAP introduce something bad to our nation, he just keep his mouth shut without doing anything?<br>A point to take note is, he hold the key to the reserves of Singapore but instead he take orders from Mr Lee.And worst of all is, we pay so much money to him but he is nothing but another PAP puppet! Cant even help the locals to voice out our angers to the parliament.<br>What a waste of our tax payers money!!!<br><br>And not forgetting, why why do we need SMM position?And that position created by he himself???No law and order in Singapore but law and order from he himself?So does that mean he suka suka can create whateever position he like in order to stay in power?Or maybe because he create that SM position for Mr Goh because he knows some dirty things inside the parliament and that's why to shut his mouth up, Mr Lee create that position inorder to please him?Any idea why did we need that SM position to waste so much tax payers money?<br><br>Lastly, the point taken from the above can be summarise as , we are under one party system where they are above law and order within their own interest.With a one man emperor ruling one small nation, it can be seen as another dynasty been born in Asia.Without any party to watch over that emperor, without any good form of Anti corruption department like the ICAC of Hong Kong to watch over that thunder logo party(please forget about our own Anti corruption deparment as they are under the party, and what a laugh to say our anti corruption police will do whatever the Lee's ask them to do.I think the police wont even dare to do anything to the Lee's including their relatives, friends, without the feer of the Lee's power), our nation will be nothing but the Lee's business empire to do their own business with their own interest!!!<br><br>I hope Singaporeans will wake up from their sleep and really do something for our nation!!!
