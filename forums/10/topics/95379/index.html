            <div class='col-md body'>Someone in this forum asked me about what views I have with regards to the barbed wires and nails put up in Pasir Ris GRC to deter youngsters from playing balls.<br><br>I think this is the most typical example of PAP ruling style. To deter people from doing certain things, social engineering process is used. You could either prevent them from making certain acts by putting up prohibiting conditions (fines, harsh sentencing and now, barbed wires!) or that you entice them to act accordingly with goodies (HDB upgrading if you vote PAP!)<br><br>I think only people with sick and anti-social minds would think of such "brilliant" ideas of putting up nails and barbed wires to deter youngsters to have some simple fun!<br><br>We should encourage youngsters to be more sociable and active in the community. Having a game of the ball is just a small step ahead. But when someone actually goes to the extend of detering youngsters from such "undesirable acts" is really amusing.<br><br>Most parents now think that keeping their children in their house is the safest way of keeping them out of trouble. They would stuff these kids with computer games and internet access, just to keep them indoor. This will ultimately have adverse effects on the children as well as the society's development in the long run.<br><br>What harm could there be to have youngsters playing balls in the void decks? I think it is a good utilization of empty spaces in Singapore, to transform the void deck into some activity grounds for these youngsters.<br><br>To fill the void decks with nails and barbed wires to discourage youngsters from playing is the most stupid and sick thing to do! IT has turned the void deck into "HELL"! It makes the place so ugly! Unbelievably, the Town Councils actually go on with such stupid and sick idea!<br><br>The Town Council should instead think of ways to provide more street fun for these youngsters. Build street soccer facilities for the residents or even convert the void deck to provide a safe place for them to play ball! What we need to do is to use NET to round up the void deck, put on protective, colourful guards on the pillars and we could have a nice makeshift street soccer facility!<br><br>Ok, they will start to give you craps about void decks are not meant for all these and such, but hey, there are already resident corners for residents to have TV and cushions to laze around, enjoy themselves, why not possible to make something out for the youngsters to enjoy themselves as well?<br><br>Town councils could even recover some maintenance cost by putting up drinks vending machine nearby! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now don't you believe PAP is really dry of ideas? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br></div>

To deter people from doing certain things, social engineering process is used. You could either prevent them from making certain acts by putting up prohibiting conditions (fines, harsh sentencing and now, barbed wires!) or that you entice them to act accordingly with goodies (HDB upgrading if you vote PAP!)<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br></div></blockquote></div>

No playing of soccer" (or smth like that) on alot of empty grass fields... i take d train home everyday n see alot of these fields with a sign there that says its stateland and therefore ppl cant play soccer on it...  i think that shud be the focus of complaints more than the barbed wire in voiddecks...</div>
