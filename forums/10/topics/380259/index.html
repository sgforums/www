              <p><strong>MM calls on US to retain key role in East Asia </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WASHINGTON - The United States must be an important part of any new
                                  East Asian framework, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said yesterday,
                                  cautioning against defining the region in closed or racial terms.</p>
              <p>At a gala dinner where he was conferred a lifetime achievement award
                                  for fostering US-Asean ties, he said that the US would remain the sole
                                  superpower for two or three more decades despite the fallout from last
                                  year's global crisis.</p>
              <p>While China may be rapidly gaining economic and geopolitical clout,
                                  Beijing is neither willing nor ready to take on equal responsibility
                                  for managing the international system. Therefore, the US should not be
                                  shut out of any new East Asian architecture, Mr Lee said.</p>
              <hr>
              <h4>Kissinger, Shultz and others recall encounters with MM</h4>
              <p>It was a stormy night, but inside the Mandarin Oriental hotel
                                  ballroom, the mood was warm and celebratory, as past and present United
                                  States officials and top businessmen took turns to thank and pay
                                  tribute to the man they credit with forging closer political and
                                  economic ties between the US and South-east Asia over the past four
                                  decades. But it was some of the speakers' anecdotes of their personal
                                  interactions with Mr Lee that enthralled the audience, their stories
                                  offering a rare glimpse into the world of high-powered friendships
                                  between leaders who played a role in shaping their countries' bilateral
                                  ties and strategic views about global challenges.</p>
              <p>Former secretary of state George Shultz, 89, highly-respected for
                                  two decades of public service, received a standing ovation as he walked
                                  up to the podium to make a speech, which he began by saying he had
                                  learned a great deal from Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons he visited Singapore in 1973 - when he was
                                  Treasury Secretary in the Nixon administration - was to meet Mr Lee,
                                  who was then Prime Minister.</p>
              <hr>
              <h4>US-China competition yes, but conflict? No</h4>
              <p>COMPETITION between the United States and a rising China is
                                  inevitable, but conflict between the two powers is not, Minister Mentor
                                  Lee Kuan Yew said yesterday.</p>
              <p>'Unlike US-Soviet relations during the Cold War, there is no bitter,
                                  irreconcilable ideological conflict between the US and a China that has
                                  enthusiastically embraced the market,' he noted in his keynote address
                                  at the US-Asean Business Council's 25th anniversary gala dinner.</p>
              <p>'(The Chinese leaders) have concluded that their best strategy is to
                                  build a strong and prosperous future and use their huge and
                                  increasingly highly skilled and educated workers to out-sell and
                                  out-build all others.'</p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>MM Lee on the beginning of his deep personal ties with the US</strong></p>
              <p>'Singapore's role will be that of a catalyst. We're a city state so
                                  we can leap forward quickly. The others have been somewhat slower
                                  because of their internal diversity, so we can act as a kind of
                                  catalyst to show them this is the way, (and) you can do it faster.</p>
              <p>'China has found us a useful model economically. They decided not to
                                  follow the path of South Korea and Japan, of closing their domestic
                                  markets and building their own champions whether it was cars or
                                  computers...</p>
              <p>'They took the Singapore path, invited all the multinationals to
                                  come in. And their engineers, designers are working for all of them. So
                                  in 10 to 20 years, when you get all these people to come together, you
                                  already have a little (home-made) car called the Cherry. I would be
                                  bold to predict that in 20 to 30 years, they could build a Mercedes or
                                  a Lexus. The sheer number of talent and people they have is quite
                                  scary.'</p>

              <p>If you read his remark in the Straits Times, <em>"cautioning against defining the region in closed or racial terms". </em>Just who is he cautioning about this racial thing - the US or China?<br><br>It has never been a question of defining E Asia in racial term. All along, the whole E Asia region is monoracial. Not politcally or xenophobic motivated, it is a given fact.<br><br>If it is the US he is targetting, than his remark seems, all the more strange. Who is the US to define this region in closed or racial terms. The US is, but just, one of many players to have that ability to shape this region's racial composition or that big enough clout to shape policies towards E Asia with a racial twist - not without backlash, that is.</p>
              <p>His remark seems to aim at China and Japan wtih the recent the Japanese PM's visit to China and the proposed an E Asia integration. <br><br>Is his remark, a masked warning to E Asia counties against integration? I tend to believe this is the real intention. It is the only logical derivation. He went to the US to say of those nasty things he wants to say to Japan and China. <br><br>He went to China shook their hands, told them their time has arrived than he went to the US to warn the American to watch out for the E Asian bastards.   <br><br>Cunning old fox.</p>

              materials available in Japanese-language for the occupiers," he added. </strong></span></span><br> <br> Lim was a graduate of Singapore's prestigious Raffles College and a medical doctor trained in University of <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Malaya’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Malaya">Malaya</a>, which was then located in Singapore. <br> <br> "I was also a founder of University of Malaya's Socialist Club which
              became the cradle for many politicians and intellectuals in both
              Malaysia and Singapore who fought for independence," he recalled with a sense of pride. <br> <br> "In those days, anti-colonialism was a very powerful and popular sentiment even in Singapore … I helped found the People's Action Party (PAP) to fight for the freedom of Singapore
              from British rule and to reunite it with Peninsula to form an united,
              non-communal and progressive Malaya <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but when Lee turned right wing and
              started serving British interests, the party split and I left to join

              also opposed to the 1963 merger because we thought it was an
              opportunistic adventure on the part of Lee who wanted to exploit Tunku
              Abdul Rahman's anti-communism to suppress the Left in Singapore … we wanted merger but not in the 1963 version which proved to be an utter failure just two years later in 1965. <br> <br> "I was completely English-educated," stressed Lim, which was obviously
              a sarcastic and subtle rebuttal to the now stereotyped and widespread
              notion that the Left in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s was a "Chinese-educated" phenomenon. <br> <br> <strong>Political conviction </strong><br> <br> As for his detention, Lim said he did not suffer any physical torture.<br> <br> "But, detention without charge or trial for an uncertain period of time
              is itself a form of torture, albeit a psychological one," Lim said.<br> <br> "When I was first arrested in February 1963, my son was only
              five-months-old but when I was released in 1982, he was already

              fortitude and solidarity for the entire period of my 20-year detention
              and also for bringing up our boy," he added. <br> <br> Quizzed on what helped him preserve his sanity during his detention,
              Lim replied: "Political conviction, intellectual integrity and moral
              conscience". <br> <br> "I certainly have no regret for my involvement and participation in
              politics although I had to pay a heavy price for it. I am still a

               What westernize the old man is trying to curb civil liberties and democracy. What western country??? The police force, judiciary system even down to education institution and hospitals are controlled by by the tyrant he and his family. Westernize? Where do you got that impression? You think beautiful bay and tall buildings and clean streets make a country first world and western? Singapore is not westernized? Where is the free press?
              Singapore is like today's PRC only the PRC leadership is better because it is not run by any family dynasty. Go to most developed China's cities and I can bet it's not less remarkable than Singapore! Westernized? it's a fascist country.

              <p>The communist China is having a capitalist economy, it clearly shown that with a communism politics, it can still absorb a capitalist economy. no problem, the Politburo of China will alway be the same, but the economy if changing and so does it peoples, given more freedom and wealth. Unlike their predecessor Mao, who absorb communism and also provide one the world most saddened and laughable economy that strife on internal market only. Be it the cultural revolution or the great leap, millions died under his rule and leadership. All these happen in the 50s to late 70s, that was the time when communism was feared most by the West  and singapore is no different under the Brit influences.</p>
              <p>In fact, if you look at today Singapore geopoltiical economy, it is quite the same as china, no change in the politic arenas, the only differences is that we are having the right to votes whereas the Chinese have never know what is voting.</p>
              <p>As to why china is trying to learn from singapore, it is because our politics arena, tho a so call democratic one, seem to be so similar to them. For them is the Communist party and our, the PAP party.</p>

              <p>The communist China is having a capitalist economy, it clearly shown that with a communism politics, it can still absorb a capitalist economy. no problem, the Politburo of China will alway be the same, but the economy if changing and so does it peoples, given more freedom and wealth. Unlike their predecessor Mao, who absorb communism and also provide one the world most saddened and laughable economy that strife on internal market only. Be it the cultural revolution or the great leap, millions died under his rule and leadership. All these happen in the 50s to late 70s, that was the time when communism was feared most by the West  and singapore is no different under the Brit influences.</p>
              <p>In fact, if you look at today Singapore geopoltiical economy, it is quite the same as china, no change in the politic arenas, the only differences is that we are having the right to votes whereas the Chinese have never know what is voting.</p>
              <p>As to why china is trying to learn from singapore, it is because our politics arena, tho a so call democratic one, seem to be so similar to them. For them is the Communist party and our, the PAP party.</p>

              <p><br>It seems that you have still not learn from the past drubbing that was dished out to you for your flippant attempts at teaching others from your shallow knowledge of what you intend to tackle.</p>
              <p>What do you understand by the term "geopolitical economy" - in your effort to impress with such a profound term that seems out-of-sync with what you have written ?</p>
              <p>How did you manage to compare the time "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">when Communism was feared by the West</span></em>" and "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore is no different under the Brit influences</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Are there any connect between the two statements that you made with so much hot gas inflating your position that leads one to no where ?</p>
              <p>Have you thought about the reasons for Communist China to embrace Capitalism and yet will not abandon Communist ideology in their politics ?</p>
              <p>While the authoritarian government maybe the same in China and in Singapore - even as Singapore has a "pseudo-democratic" system, China also has their version of election at the village and provincial level, and at their National Congress level.</p>
              <p>Safe candidates are selected by their Central Committee and offered for balloting by the general assembly, and this is no different from the PAP methods of selection of candidates to be nominated for the assembly of trusted Party Cadres to vote.</p>
              <p>Both the citizens of China and Singapore have similar aspirations, can be seen in the events in 1989 - when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Chinas_Government_Running_To_Stay_In_One_Place/1746978.html">‘a sense among the students and all the people who cheered them on in 100 cities that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>there must be a better way to govern the</strong> <strong>country than</strong></span> the use of police and the use of armed force and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the lack of a space in which intelligent people could operate and perhaps give their suggestions to the government</span></strong>.. (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Singaporeans today are as frustrated - as China's citizens were in 1989 - with the continuous humdrum of the Singapore Government dictating and controlling every aspects of our lives, intruding even into our personal spheres, but will abandon us to our own wits when the economic downturn occurs.</p>
              <p>If you must offer something to anyone, the least you can do is not to contribute any from the ignorance of you shallow intellect.</p>
