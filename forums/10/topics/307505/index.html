              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am talking about LARGE WORLD CLASS MNCs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why they only offer contract positions and keep saying headcount freeze?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My cousin got a job offer today but he wanted permanent position and even willing to lower salary for that kind of position. The pay for contract is good but somehow, large MNCs are not offering permanent ones. At least very rare.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I could not explain the why.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>need some insights from you, the esteemed forummers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it that some idoits have spoilt the market or encouraged or enabled the large MNCs to protect their turnover rate by not offering permanent whereby contracting offers large mnc's to hire-and-sack at will without worry to answer for it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks!</p>

              <p>Your first para is absolutely right. MNC always want to replace employees with cheaper cost workers .</p>
              <p>But, salaries of permanent staff under employment are fixed costs, not operating costs! MNCs wants to keep wage costs low, salaried staff need increment everyear, plus bonus. contract wages are fixed for the period of the contract unless otherwise stated; salaried staff when retrenched, retrenchment payment has to be paid while contract staff can be terminated and all payments are stated in the contract.</p>
              <p>If MNC cannot find cheaper salaried staff, they will move!! to indonesia, vietnam, china, india...you can't force MNC to stay.</p>
              <p>you can blame the government, the FT, but ultimately it is the MNCs who decide if they want to pay a slightly higher costs for singaporeans, or keep the costs low on local staff and save the money to pay for the expat's housing, children, country club, home leave..... blame the MNCs, no, cannot, because they are angmoh!</p>
              <p>Rentals are operating costs. Have retailers been paying rental hikes annually, or only recently?</p>
              <p>Your last paragraph is contradicting, cheap foreign labours are working on contracts, actually contributing to low operating costs. How can cheap labour increase operating costs?</p>

              <p><br>... well, it's simple; since operating costs are directly &amp; indirectly influenced by government, and since these opreating costs can never go down, the government ensures there is ample supply of cheap labour available to offset running costs - constant down trimming labour costs to accomodate other rising operating costs...</p>

              <p>Redress, MNCs pay you what you're worth and put you on contract so that you don't get complacent and keep working so that your contract gets renewed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bang Hong is also right. That's why you ask for more pay as insurance against those times.</p>

              <p>This is not an excuse. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you or do you not understand the simple meaning of generalisation?</span> Do you mean to say that if you see a motorcyclist driving dangerously, you can claim that ALL motorcyclists drive dangerously? Obviously, you do not know what is meant by justifying your statements. If you cannot answer questions on your friend background, I see no point in us discussing. As pointed out in another thread, age does play a role, and so do experience and education. You are making it sound like even fresh university graduates cannot get a perm job, but instead, only a contract job, something which I can safely claim that it is not true.</p>

              <p>You can come to the job fair in NUS MPSH on 21~22 Feburary to question the big companies. I can wait for you at Clementi Station to bring you there if you do not know how to go.</p>
              <p>But I guess you rather sit at home in front of your computer and bark like a little dog without knowing what is going on at all.</p>

              <p>it all has to do with how budget is done.</p>
              <p>headcount freeze - common thing, it is to please the accounting folks, the top bosses and the shareholders. a company has to be seen doing the right thing during tough times. however work still has to be done. by offering temp positions, the money that is to paid may not come from the budget for full time staff.</p>
              <p>temp/contract staff - this is a quick fix for tough times. allow the company to keep going but not to be seen as expanding headcount. also many projects are time sensitive, by offering contract, once the job is done, the company is under no obligation to employ the individual</p>
              <p>however, it must be noted that in many cases, good temp staff get to be offered full time job.</p>
