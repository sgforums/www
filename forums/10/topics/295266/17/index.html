            <div class='col-md body'>I shall post a repeat of my answer for you to challenge. It was <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=295266&amp;page=11" rel="nofollow">5 pages</a> ago, and you only decide to bring it up again now. Well done, Gazelle.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Do you want to give it a shot?<br><br>a) How many people do you think the army can take?<br>b) How many people do you think will join the army because they cant compete with FT?<br>c) Are soldiers in the army and clerk at Mindef civil servants?<br><br></div></blockquote>Before anyone answer questions a and b, please bear in mind that it is Gazelle who said this<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">If you think you dont have what it takes to compete with FT, join the army!!<br></div></blockquote>As seen from the statement above, Gazelle is directing the above statement to everyone! Thus, the answers to questions a and b do not matter because Gazelle is asking everyone who doesn't have what it takes to compete with FT to join the army, irregardless of the number that the army can take in! Questions a and b are therefore totally unrelated to us questioning his claim in the first post. Furthermore, if Gazelle had wanted to support his claim in the first post, it is his own obligation to furnish us with these details, and not direct such questions to the audience who he is addressing to.<br><br>And because Gazelle could not support his claim well, he has to resort to such unrelated questioning techniques to put the spotlight away from his glaringly rubbishy statement.<br><br>With regards to question c, since the topic is already about the army, we would not need to discuss about civil servants as a whole. Army personnel are civil servants, but civil servants are not all army personnel. Again, Gazelle is here trying to deflect the spotlight away. He puts a statement, cannot support it, and poses unrelated questions to shift the focus away from his invalid statement. While we direct our attention to his claim of joining the army, he attempts to change the destination to civil servants, a group that is much larger than the army itself. The question would be more valid if he had said "join the civil service" instead of "join the army".<br><br>In conclusions, all three questions are totally invalid.</div>
