Some might even disagree with that, as there are those who feel that the playing field should be tilted in the favour of the citizen. e.g. giving incentives for hiring locals instead of FTs. Hire FTs only if you cannot find locals to take the job.<br><br>To borrow the some word of a PAP MP, FTs should be a supplement, not an easy first choice for employers. As far as I know, there is no levy for FT who earn more than 2.5k a month. Coupled with no reservists(for males), no CPF to pay. Hell, its a bloody attractive hire for any employer<br><br>edit: And you say like the civil service is like a dumping ground for Pte sector rejects. How does a Poly grad at 30yrs join the army? Or even a 'O' level holder for that matter? Do remember that degree holders are far from being the majority among the resident workforce.</div>
