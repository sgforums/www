However this is very risky route to take and it might just back fire and tarnish fymk and Geraldine's reputation in this forum further.<br><br>(Not easy situation, but you have to decide which way to go.)<br><br>3) Maybe you might want to consider giving up both fymk and Ellezag and start with something new again.<br><br></div></blockquote>I am keeping FYMK , thanks .
