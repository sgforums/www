Protectionism will not work...it is survival pressure that brings out the fittest in a community. Decades of protecting   bumiputra interests in our neighbour only serve to create a Malay community that has fallen further behind and ill-equipped to face the challenges posed by the new economic powers of China and India.<br><br>If you won't work harder for less when there is a FT willing and able to fill your job, you deserve to lose it!</div></blockquote>Acquiring skills is not going to solve the problem. Raising a skill level from A to B, the same situation will arise. Another FT at skill lvl B will be competition. Whats wrong for seeking a level playing field with regards to job hunting? Whats wrong with preventing foreigners from becoming the preferred choice in your own home?<br><br>Have we all been so pre-occupied with achieving economic growth as a nation, that we forget what are we pursuing the economic growth for? Isn't the pursuit of economic growth and prosperity (as a nation) a means to provide for the people in the first place? To give them a better living, and/or raise their standards of living.<br><br>What is the point of economic growth when the people/citizens/residents that the economy is supposed to serve/benefit, are being marginalized?<br><br>No one deserves to lose his/her job in his/her own home just because an FT can come in to "spoil market". No everyone has the same capability bandwith, so those with less, get left behind? "Sorry, we are heading for economic growth, keep up or get left behind" Is this the kind of society that we want Singapore to become? What happened to LHL's vision of an inclusive society?<br>What ever happened to "One people One nation"? Have we become a society that pursues material and leaves national values behind?</div>

Walesa and I clashed over a thread before and quite badly. Yet with both forumners as well as the others I debated with, we can respect each other. For you, I can't say respect is mutual or anything.<br><br>As far as I know your first paragraph contradicts your behaviour. Even your thread is aimed at degrading Singaporeans who may not be as fortunate as you to <span style="font-style: italic;">own a second hand audi </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">some percentage of a property overseas</span>.<br><br>Just because some Singaporeans cannot compete in a market that devalues their skills doesn't mean they can't compete AT ALL .  <strong>They just have no opportunity to do so. Not when the market favors cheaper labour. Some cannot even afford to take on a lower wage when there are bills to be paid , mortgage to fulfil and family has to be fed. </strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">We are not talking about people who can afford to transmit some money to their country and 10 bucks can feed a whole family per week. </span><br><br>Some of us , including myself, we are lucky because there is nothing in Singapore to tie us down from venturing overseas and seeking our fortunes there.<br><br>What you have done with starting this thread is basically nothing short of insulting others who are less fortunate to not have the opportunities you have, <span style="font-style: italic;">presumably if you still even have YOUR job</span> .</div>
