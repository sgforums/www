What if that guy who named us "little red dot" was the one who run singapore for the past 30 years? maybe SG will be so poor and has no money to pay him $2.7mil a month.....2.7mil rupiah maybe.<br>think, think, think.<br><br><strong><span class="large">DON'T harp on this crap again -- "...bring it to what it is today".<br>Whatever good he has had done, I believe we have thanked him and repaid him ENOUGH.  He is like GOD here for the last FIFTY YEARS or more.<br>What else does he want? Maye he wants to be like Shih Huang Di....get some medicine to live forever and thus enjoy forever.<br><br>And about the little red dot story........do you think he can survive ONE MONTH in the kind of political situation in THAT country?  Man create circumstances, circumstances create man.........nobody owes anybody anything. Fade away. Let others move on, for better or for worse. </span> </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, let me state that I'm neither anti-LKY nor anti-government by starting this discussion thread. I'm just a citizen expressing a very valid concern about how our tax money is being utilised.<br><br>Secondly, I feel that it is not morally wrong to ask questions about how millions of tax dollars are being spent by public officers....in a truly democratic country (which our consitution seems to suggest.....), one citizen need not join any political party in order to reflect his concerns to fellow citizens. During election time, my MP said something about him being attentive to citizens' concern......shouldn't this hold true too, after the elections?<br><br>Thirdly, haven't the government always been advocating that we should have a more "participative community". Well...I'm doing just that by putting the salary of our political appointees on discussion.....<br><br></div>

These are the ones who do most work but get paid the least.....<br><br>And then there are the "top civil servants" such as the perm secs, Administrative Officers and directors, etc....who are paid much more than the abovementioned.<br><br>And lastly, there are the political appointees, who are now suggesting that  their million dollar plus annual salary raised by another million.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>I personally have nothing against raising the salary of the 1st category of civil servants because what they do in their daily work is open to public scrutiny. But for the last 2 categories, the citizens of this country deserve to know why it is justifiable for their pay to go up as multiple millions of dollars  will be expended....at the very least, greater details about their job scopes and responsibilities should be made public knowledge.</div>
