            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All<br><br>An education is to prepare us the demanding tasks that we may face in the future. I do not agree that the no. of years in school is too long. In fact, I feel that schooling should be a life long process so that we can always keep our mind alert/active and mindful of what is going on in society. Having said this, you must think that I am some propaganda machine for the education system. This I am not.<br><br>Though I feel the above, I am not 100% satisfied with HOW  education is being dished out in Singapore. From my days, it is really a spoon feeding process. The system always propagate the herd mentality; do this, study that, in this fashion and you will definitely pass with flying colours! I wonder how much has this mentality change over the past 7 years. Not wonder we do not grow up with much creativity. Recently, Effort has been put into diversifying the subject content such that a person who major in science stream will also get a feel of Art or Business subjects. Applaude to this initaite.<br>Having done this, the next step will be to change our mindset. Studying to pass is a thing of the past. We still have people who just study study and study. This is very sad. When these same people who start working, they will be totally lost. I have seen scholars who cannot articulate his thoughts, who do not have an opinion etc. cos he is too "hardworking" to acquire IQ during school and totally ignore the importance of EQ..........any comment so far....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel that the paper chase mentality is kind of over hibed. We are constrained by our needs to justify ourselves by having paper qualifications. Even to be a good sports man in the future, you will may need to have a certificate from the Sports School certifying that you are one.<br><br>However, bearing in mind that Singapore wishes to be the educational hub in this region, it is essential for her people to have a tangible proof to show to others mainly foreigners what we have to offer and the result of our offering. This would be shown by our education system and our qualifications etc.<br><br>It is really sad...personally I feel that education should not be restricted to what papers you need to gain and a field favoured by political direction but rather what you want to learn.<br><br>This is perhaps one reason why we never rise about of superiority to others in secondary school to be the leaders in education and research in the world.</div>
