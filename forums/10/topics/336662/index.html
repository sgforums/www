              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> Eugenics in Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew recently said at the Human Capital Summit held last
                  month: "You marry a non-graduate, then you are going to worry if your
                  son or daughter is going to make it to the university."<br><br>Don't
                  gasp. The Minister Mentor was just restating his long-held view that
                  smart people (read university graduates) produce smart people. Such a
                  Hitlerian outlook is repulsive. But in Singapore, no one dares to
                  oppose the man. <br><br>In his book <em>A Nation Cheated</em>, Dr Chee
                  Soon Juan reproduces some of Mr Lee's comments on the subject and
                  discusses <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how they have tragically moulded the Singaporean society:</strong></span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-indent: -0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;">If
                  truth be told, the PAP's neglect of the poor stems directly from Lee
                  Kuan Yew's personal philosophy. In 1967, the Minister Mentor said that
                  every society has approximately 5 percent of the population:</p>
              <p style="text-indent: -0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.31in; margin-right: 0.39in; text-indent: -0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;">who are more than ordinarily endowed physically and mentally and in
                  whom we must extend our limited and slender resources in order that
                  they will provide that yeast, that ferment,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> that catalyst in our
                  society which alone will ensure that Singapore shall maintain its
                  pre-eminent place in the societies that exist in South and Southeast
                  Asia.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.31in; margin-right: 0.39in; text-indent: -0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;">Lee repeated his ideas in 1969, this time even more forcefully:</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.3in; margin-right: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in;">Free education and subsidised housing lead to a situation where the
                  less economically productive people in the community are reproducing
                  themselves at rates higher than the rest. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This will increase the total
                  population of less productive people</strong></span>. Our problem is how to devise a
                  system of disincentives, so that the irresponsible, the social
                  delinquents, do not believe that all they have to do is to produce
                  their children and the government then owes them and their children
                  sufficient food, medicine, housing, education and jobs...<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We must
                  encourage those who earn less than $200 per month and cannot afford to
                  nurture and educate many children never to have more than two.</strong></span> We will
                  regret the time lost if we do not now take the first tentative steps
                  towards correcting a trend which can leave our society with a large
                  number of the physically, intellectually and culturally anaemic.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.3in; margin-right: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;">The Minister Mentor, then Senior Minister, made this point again in 1993:</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.29in; margin-right: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Singaporeans will not become successful and prosperous by talking and
                  concentrating on dividing the pie.</strong></span> Our journalists write about who are
                  the poor. Give them some money. If he can't study because he's too busy
                  helping his father, we must look after his father and him. We are
                  concentrating on our navels!</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.29in; margin-right: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;">One of his faithful ministers, the late S Rajaratnam, echoed his
                  sentiment by sneering, "We want to teach people the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>government is not a
                  rich uncle</strong></span>. You get what you pay for. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We are moving in the direction of
                  making people pay for everything."</strong></span></p>

              <p>"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each in
              the same condition and needing a blood transfusion. The first, a
              Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later.
              The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few
              days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and
              survived. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That is the X factor in development.</strong></span>" - 27 December 1967</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool
              and leave them on the shelf, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you would end up a more stupid
              society...So what happens? There will be less bright people to support
              dumb people in the next generation.</strong></span> That's a problem." -Lee Kuan Yew in

              per cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The
              whites score on average 100. Asians score more ... the Bell curve
              authors put it at least 10 points higher. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These are realities that, if

              <p>"I started off believing all men were equal. I now know that's the
              most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have
              passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this
              earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had
              different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I
              didn't start off with that knowledge.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> But by observation, reading,

              not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very

              <p>He does have a point; except that the point is a skewed, self-deceiving one.</p>
              <p>It's true that many, or even most, of the poorer, less educated folks end up with similar performing children. But what is unsaid is that it happens in such a way because these families lack the financial abilities to pursue the same paths made available to the richer classes.</p>
              <p>Talk about education and environment. A poorer kid will probably end up in schools that has a higher percentage of rowdy, less studious peers. To fit in, he'd talk and think like them.For the richer folks, they are able to enroll in private schools, purchase the material and equipment they require, hire reknowned tutors... Sure, hard work is still required, but the rich kid sure has it easier. Less obstacles to overcome.</p>
              <p>To prove a further point, I too came from a lower-middle income family. My father toiled in odd-jobs over the years to sustain the family, as did my mother.According to MM's theories, I should have ended up as an odd job labourer now as well.</p>
              <p>But right now, I'm in a cushy IT job and can even afford some luxury. But all this would not be possible if I had to be the "law-abiding" citizen that stayed in line with my family's background. My parents worked hard to get me an old computer when I was young, but not being able to afford legitimate software, we had to source for pirated ones. But it is the use of these pirated software that gave me the edge over my peers - for I was able to spend the time experimenting and learning to use those software from the age of 12. Now I pay for all the software I use, but I wouldn't have gotten here if I hadn't had software that cost so much. So financial status did make the difference.</p>
              <p>Not everone is able to achieve success by hard work alone, yet the very idea is often propaganda-ed by our ruling leaders. It takes hard work, chance, inherent and external abilities and perhaps even a little bit of luck to make it in this world.</p>
              <p>Granted, even rich kids can lose it in the world if they just waste their lives away. But you cannot deny the fact that they have an edge - not necessarily so in genetics - but in their living environment and spending power. For if rich kids are in general smarter than their poorer cousins, we wouldn't see so many dumb moves made by some of the richest brats, and neither would it be that many of the world's greatest minds and richest people came from poor backgrounds.</p>
              <p>Let us get rid of our stereotypical views and social apathy, and work towards a better tomorrow.</p>

              <p>My main point is, as I have said in my post, one should not write off as bunkum what DH had stated "the bell curve is a fact of life".  And if you come to the conclusion (as stated in your post) that the "standard deviation is ..............................and may get even larger if something is not done to correct the situation", you are in fact not commenting on the dynamics of the bell curve itself but rather your perceived scenario of the current social, class &amp; economic status of the people.</p>

              <p>'Facts of life' to support your theory is a misrepresentation of science.</p>
              <p><br>As of today, we have yet to fully comprehend each and every specific gene in the human body. To claim to do so would be a lie. Thus eugenics is disputed science and makes a mockery of repected research institutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We do not yet understand genes and their combinations, the building blocks of life, and yet dare claim it as a fact?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your theory on racial differences in IQ can only hold water if you truthfully admit it as 'behavioural science'. But that is not true science, for it cannot be repeated and obtainable with similar results under different circumstances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The difference between a Rwarda 10 year old villager and a 10 year kid from New York is their  environment and opportunities. The village kid would only be taught goatherding and survival in the savannah, while the city boy would have big city broadbased education, of which IQ tests were constructed upon, of which researchers are similarly taught.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have an opened mind, but eugenics is too much of a 'fringe science', similiar with elvis being alive, aliens conspiracy theories, etc, which are only good for sci-fi books or movies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each person is entitled to his personal beliefs, for we are an open society. But so far, in our nation, eugenics had not played any part in our social programmes. There are equal opportunities for all, even for a woman if she thinks she can be an equal to man in crane operations, of which there exists in PSA, employed as such.</p>

              <p>Yes, your post is true about many issues. But which human would not want to have a country with a good economy to live and thrive in?  Culture? Perhaps later. It's all about experimentation to get the social economic political landscape right for all, if not all, at least the majority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And we are still trying to get it right. No elected govt is perfect. At least we are way ahead of others since independence, freedom from all kinds of discrimination to build an equal opportunity society for all our fellow citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't be too sure about yourself caring only about money. In time, like every other human being whom needs love, you will meet someone and would want to spend a lifetime with, and have kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> This is only natural. Same with everyone boy and girl living in this planet. Love is something special, an entitlement for each human. No one craves loneliness or able to accept it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the economy grows, we all grow along with it, and helping others left behind to catch up with us. This is Singapore, your homeland and the land of your birthright.</p>
