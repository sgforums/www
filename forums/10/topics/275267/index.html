            <div class='col-md body'>SYDNEY: An Australian opposition leader battling a scandal over his drunken visit to a US strip club still has a winning margin over Prime Minister John Howard, an opinion poll released Tuesday said.<br><br>The poll published in The Australian newspaper showed Kevin Rudd had extended his lead as preferred prime minister to 46 per cent against 39 per cent for Howard, who was hurt by an interest rate hike this month.<br><br>The telephone survey of 1,152 voters was taken over three days between last Friday and Sunday, when newspapers revealed a boozy visit to a New York strip club that Rudd made four years ago on a taxpayer-funded trip to the United Nations.<br><br>While Rudd this week said he expected his alcohol-fuelled escapade to damage his standing, the early evidence provided by the Australian's survey appeared to show voters were more concerned about the economy.<br><br>The poll showed Rudd's centre-left Labour Party leading the ruling Liberal-National coalition 55 points to 45 on a two-party-preferred basis, which strips out the influence of minor parties.<br><br>A separate poll in the newspaper showed the number of voters who believed the coalition was best equipped to handle the economy had dropped from 53 to 47 per cent in recent weeks, eroding one of Howard's key advantages.<br><br>Howard, who campaigned on the platform "keeping interest rates low" at the last election in October 2004, said the poll backlash was inevitable after the Reserve Bank last month lifted rates 0.25 points to 6.5 per cent.<br><br>But the prime minister said there was plenty of time to turn his fortunes around before a national election expected before year's end.<br><br>"This election has only just begun," Howard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.<br><br>"The history of elections in this country shows time and time again there are enormous changes often between how the public judges people this far out from an election and on actual election day.<br><br>"I have little doubt that as we get closer to the election, the polls will alter."<br><br>Howard said he had no idea who leaked the story of Rudd's strip club sojourn and said politicians' private lives should not become public fodder unless they directly impinged on their ability to carry out their duties.<br><br>He said he would urge his colleagues to concentrate on attacking Rudd's economic credentials.<br><br>"My constant injunction to my colleagues is attack and expose Mr Rudd's lack of an economic plan for Australia's future," he said. "That is what is relevant as far as I'm concerned." - AFP/ac<br><br></div>
