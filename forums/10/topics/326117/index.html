                  That's true.  And in his defense, he blamed Singapore and said that incident scarred him for life.  When he was in Singapore, he said his parents divorce scarred him.  What a loser, always blaming some one else for his own mistakes.

              i really think that caning is excessive and even unnecessary for vandalism. As no one is being threatened or hurt physically, fine and imprisonment should suffice.
              
              i also think that teenagers shouldn't be tried like adults as they aren't adults yet. We all know that adolescence can be a trying time for teenagers. They are unable to handle their emotions and behaviour properly. We should give them more leeway when they make mistakes and help them adjust to adulthood. Harsh punishment could embitter them and cause them to view the world with hostility. They would then become ill-adjusted and could continue to cause harm to themselves as well as others in the future.
              
              It is very likely that Micheal Fay has been scarred by the divorce of his parents as well as the caning here as he has no one to guide him. To me he is a pitiful soul!
