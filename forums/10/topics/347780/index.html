              <p>Thursday, 12 February 2009	
              
              
              <em>John Burton<br>Financial Times<br></em><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/items/balloon_pop.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="150" align="left">When
              an apparently deranged man in Singapore set fire to his parliamentary
              representative at a community event recently, a local website polled
              its readers to ask which of them deserved more sympathy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By a
              four-to-one margin, the readers voted for the assailant.</strong></span><br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The episode appears to reflect an undercurrent of public discontent
              with the People’s Action party (PAP) government</strong></span>, which celebrates its
              50th anniversary in power this year, as Singapore confronts its worst
              postwar recession, with the economy expected to contract by up to 5 per
              cent.<br><br>The
              PAP government has long been one of Asia’s most secure. Singapore’s
              dominant one-party system has set an example for countries such as
              China, Russia and the Gulf states. Their leaders “are picking up points
              here and there” about how Singapore can “keep its ruling party in place
              and run a tight ship, honest and effective”, says Lee Kuan Yew, the
              city state’s founding father.</p>
              <div id="floating-target" dir="ltr">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/graphics/sg-gdp.gif" border="1" alt="" width="180" align="right">But
              the economic crisis is putting Singapore’s political system to its
              severest test since independence in 1965. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Officials appear scared
              about the public reaction. I’ve never seen them so concerned before,”
              said a Singapore-based regional political analyst.</strong></span><br><br>The economic
              downturn threatens to expose some of Singapore’s vulnerabilities,
              including a wide gap between rich and poor and a heavy dependence on
              foreign investment for growth.<br><br>The recession also comes at a
              challenging time, when the city state must find new manufacturing
              industries to replace the declining electronics sector and as it
              embarks on an ambitious plan to become the Monaco of Asia, with private
              banking and gambling as growth sectors.<br><br>The PAP has stayed in
              power because of an implicit social bargain that it would deliver
              prosperity in return for restrictions on political freedoms. It has
              justified its strong rule by saying that liberal democracy could prove
              divisive in a multi-ethnic society such as Singapore, with its ethnic
              Chinese, Malay and Indian populations.<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong, the
              prime minister and son of Lee Kuan Yew, recently praised one-party rule
              for promoting administrative efficiency and good policymaking, compared
              with malfunctioning” Asian democracies such as Taiwan, with a troubled
              economy, polarised politics and widespread corruption.<br><br>“I don’t think you want that kind 	of political system in Singapore,” he told the annual PAP 	congress.<br><br>Terence
              Chong, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, says:
              “Political order and economic stability may go hand in hand, but there
              is increasing awareness, even within the PAP, that that may no longer
              work.”<br><br>He points to a feeling that the PAP is 	“out of touch with the general suffering”.<br><br>In
              November, Singapore said it would cut the 2009 salaries of senior
              government officials by up to 19 per cent in response to the slowing
              economy.<br><br>The government also said recently that it would tighten
              already strict rules on public assemblies to prevent acts of civil
              disobedience. But civil activism is growing, and the government is
              coming under increased scrutiny and criticism on the internet.“<br><br>The
              government hasn’t helped matters by losing billions of dollars by
              investing in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch,” says a foreign businessman,
              referring to the $24bn (€18.6bn, £16.7bn) invested by Singapore’s
              sovereign funds in western financial groups. “The crisis is proving to
              be a reality check for the authorities.”<br><br>Officials are hoping to
              address public concerns with the recent announcement of a S$20.5bn
              ($13.6bn, €10.6bn, £9.5bn) stimulus package.<br><br>Manu Bhaskaran, of
              Centennial Group, an economic consultancy, also argues that support for
              the government remains strong in comparison with neighbouring Malaysia
              and Thailand, “where there is corruption and mismanagement”.<br><br>He
              adds: “The population doesn’t want to rock the boat in an economic
              storm and it will support the government, which has a strong record of
              economic progress and political stability.”<br><br>But an element of
              uncertainty remains about the depth of public support. A third of
              Singaporeans normally vote against the PAP, despite the weakness of
              opposition parties. The government must call an election by November
              2011. It may decide to call a snap election this year if it fears that
              the economy will not recover in the next two years, when public
              discontent might be stronger.<br><br>While the PAP is expected to
              return to power, its nightmare result would be to lose one or more of
              the five or six-member group representation constituencies (GRCs) that
              dominate the parliamentary system. Voters cast a single ballot for a
              party slate of candidates. The opposition, which now has only two seats
              in the 84-member chamber, would gain its biggest representation in more
              than 40 years.<br><br>“The loss of a GRC would be a psychological blow
              to the PAP and might encourage more Singaporeans to join the
              opposition,” says the local political analyst.<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f3e5d78-f87a-11dd-aae8-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1"><em><br><br>http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f3e5d78-f87a-11dd-aae8-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1</em></a></p>
