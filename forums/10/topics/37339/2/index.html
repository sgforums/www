            <div class='col-md body'>I am a recent graduate, i have heard of all recent unemployment rates increasing. But I am not worried, I am willing to go low, real low, albeit temporily. I am willing to take $1400 - $1500 gross a fren company is offering. Such pay will seem obscene to some graduates, some diplomas holders may even reject it. I however am more than willing to take it and they are arranging an interview. Who doesnt want  a job that pays what u deserve but If i never work, how on earth will i ever get the "relevant experience" that so many jobs are demnading now? If I never work, I would be income=0, but i rather have $1400 than 0.  Men whines.

It absorbs money. The Port is a profit centre. It brings in money. So taking money from the SAF and putting it into the port (or biotech or stock market) is justifable.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> its as justifiable as the sun rise from the west... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> PSA is not a ministry in the singapore govt... its a GLC... as such... it is not entitiled to govt spending or a share of govt's income tax revenue... in economic language... such a transfer of fund is call subsidy (or protectionism).. which is banned under FTA and WTO GATT agreedment as well as AFTA... it also contravenes free trade as well as invites reprisal actions from other nations...very bad move... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> lastly... such transfer would encourage inefficiencies and lead to national bankrupt ...

All it takes is for a hostile foreign subs<br>to sink a couple merchant ships in along the busy water ways to<br>blockade Singapore's SLOC. That is NOT what Singapore is<br>prepare to see.<br><br><blockquote>And FYI, the top speed of a submarine is like what? 15 knots? Can it outrun a speed boat packed with explosives heading towards a parked supertanker?</blockquote>Another blunder here: RSN and the Marine coast guard had<br>already step up their patrols and escorts of vulnerable vessels<br>during approaches and departure of Singapore water and ports.<br>In fact, even the PSA container port screening is CIA-certified.<br>So who needs a 15-kt sub chasing a terrorist vessel when<br>RSN has fast surface ships ? I think you've shot the wrong<br>elephant ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong>Let me tell that person that the SAF is a COST centre and taking money from a COST centre and putting money in a PROFIT centre makes good economic sense.</strong></blockquote>SAF makes good investment.<br>Why ? Who wanna put $ at places that its systems of law and<br>order are being made mockery by hostile elements due to lack<br>of proper security infrastructure ?<br>SAF is an insurance that Singapore cannot do without.<br>I think you can agreed with that , don't you ken ?<br><br></div>
