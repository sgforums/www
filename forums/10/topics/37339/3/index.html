            <div class='col-md body'>To Â“GasbandÂ” and Â“CXÂ”<br><br>Thanks for both of your insights, but I cannot blame you for reading more then what was intended in my post.<br><br>Did I project a Â“feelingÂ” that working at a hawker center, or as a kopi tiam assistant or such similar menial work as Second Class?<br><br>Well, to your relatives and others, I must apologise, as that was never my intention.<br><br>I have friends who are young graduates and found lucrative employment as a hawker, using their parentsÂ’ age to obtain a hawker license; but these are the fortunate few who have the small capital to start up and a winning recipe or skill.<br><br>If you had been more discerning, and not so quick in your judgment, you will have read that I had stated that:-<br><br>Â“<strong><span style="color: green;">many families living in Single Room, Two Rooms and even 3-Room HDB Flats that have to take on second jobs to make ends meetÂ…..............working in hawker centers, working as cleaners, sweepers, or as coffee shop assistants. Some even take on part time jobs as Relief Taxi Drivers, Trishaw Riders for down-town tours, or even as Security Guards</span></strong>Â”.<br><br>These people who take on such SECOND JOBS are probably stretched out on a full Eight Hour Day with the First Job (if they still have any), and to take on a Second Job although at shorter hours will be considered STRETCHING their energy level that will put their first job at risks too, and affecting the remaining time for family life<br><br>No wonder there is an increase in social problems such as family break ups, divorces, and petty disputes during these difficult times.<br><br>The Singapore Government has been very clear in their views of NOT providing any direct support for any kind of subsidies for all forms of public services.<br><br>The Citizens are expected to be charitable to support the various Private Charity Organisations that operate homes for the aged, hospices, care for the blind, deaf, the spastics and other institutions that looked after the unfortunate. The excuse given is valid that the Citizens cannot walk away from the responsibility of looking after these unfortunate members from our own community.<br><br>However, the same should be said of the Government too, especially when the healthy working Citizen gets old and infirmed, what is being done by the various Government bodies to look after US ?<br><br>Our Government is the primary champion of the Â“FREE MARKET MECHANISMÂ” -to  let the public (the Citizens) provide and pay for the services based on Â“MARKET PRICEÂ” Â– which is basically fixed (or if you prefer Â“determinedÂ”) by the GovernmentÂ’s views of how a market mechanism should be.<br><br>When such Â“market mechanismÂ” work in the favor of the Public, the Government will intervene by setting new rules to thwart such supposed Â“imperfect playÂ” of market forces Â– (the COE system is a case in point).<br><br>With regards to being Â“CommunisticÂ” in practice, I was referring to the dominance of the Government views, and its non-acceptance of any alternative or dissenting views from the Citizens Â– in Private Life or in Opposition Politics; and the methods that they employ to Â“neutralizeÂ” opposing views (some have been sent to the Mental Institution for observation).<br><br>The Singapore Government (or should I refer to the Ruling Political Party) feel themselves as omni-potent in experience, knowledge and expertise by supposedly having the best brains that they can muster from the supposedly limited Â“Talent PoolÂ” of this small island Nation of 4.5 million.<br><br>Quote from CX<br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Â“ah... could have helped, but did not... why? cos u're abusing hindsight. how would anyone know which investment would fail?Â”</strong></span><br><br>Hindsight?<br><br>Well there were dissenting advice from within the Ruling Party , not to invest in the high risks venture of entering a failing market of Hard Disk Drives, but against all good advice, the GLC spent millions in buying over MICROPOLIS, and ended with a spectacular loss within a year (?). Did you say Â“HindsightÂ” ? There were some who had the foresight but the dissenting advice was ignored.<br><br>Seriously, do you believe in the accounts that have been generated after the FIRST YEAR of a take over?<br><br>Are you naive or innocent to politics ?<br><br>Those telecommunication companies that SingTel had bought over in Australia, Belgium, and Indonesia were all money losing companies for many years prior to being taken over.<br><br>Do you think that SingTel will be allowed to buy over these Â“national assetsÂ” that are suppose to be jewels and pride of the respective countries, if these were not already a burden to the country ?<br><br>Wait for another few more years and we will see the accounting results, then either you or I may have to eat our words.<br><br>DBS was surprised to have been sprung with another load of undeclared bad debts of another US$400+ Millions, almost two years after the take over of Dusat Thani Bank - AFTER the first batch of US$600 Plus Millions (I stand to be corrected??) were written off.<br><br>The current spate of price increases have been quickly executed, and the outbursts were tolerated with the expectation that it will blow over quickly, and over time the usual grudging acceptance will complete the exercise as a Â‘fait accompliÂ”.<br><br>With the full knowledge that events are going to be worst for the employed, and not too prospective for the unemployed, should the many price increases be implemented during the second half of 2002 in such a hurried manner ?<br><br>No one was asking for the dole then, nor subsidies; but everyone was asking for a delay in the increase in GST, hospital levies, utility rates, transport fares, and others.<br><br><strong>"Do not ask what the Country can do for YOU, but what YOU can do for the Country ?"</strong><br><br>Have you served your National Service ? Both of you must have completed your NS, and so have I.<br><br>We have given the best years of our Youth for the Country, and if ever called for the defense of this Country, I will give my life for it.<br><br>Do not ask more from me, not when you think you are SMARTER than me.<br><br>But what has the the GOVERNMENT of this Country done for US, other then to create all kinds of regulations, rules, and legislations, to suck up all the funds - that we have from our salary, CPF, Medisave, and MediShield Â– each time we spend on consumables, housing, transportation, medical, and what have you.<br><br>No one is asking for subsidies, but real market prices WITHOUT artificial interferences.<br><br>In the 1970Â’s the TeacherÂ’s Co-operative had proven that a group of people can come together with funds, to accomplish the building of a Private Housing Estate at a substantially lower costs then buying similar type of homes from a Private Developer.<br><br>With Public Housing, the original goal was to provide affordable housing for the masses, and it started off with reasonable affordable prices; and should have remained so with <span style="color: red;"><strong>a larger co-operative formed by 4.5 million people</strong></span> all accepting and living in HDB homes.<br><br>However, the goals seemed to have shifted to one of PROFITABILITY, and with the HDB Homes subject to Market Pricing comparable to the Private Housing Sectors.<br><br>The newer types of HDB Flats are now TWENTY percent SMALLER, but cost more then THIRTY PERCENT compared to the homes built about 5 to 10 years ago Â– yet inflation is under control and hovering around ONE Percent annually for the last 20 years.<br><br>However, do not despair as there is a future for Singapore, ONLY when the Ruling Party decide NOT to use legislations to monopolise and dominate its privileged position in dealing with the Singapore Citizens on legitimate issues of politics, economics, social and cultural matters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>brudder, u are cynical beyond belief...<br><br>nothing i want to say about your beliefs on the system... but as someone directly affected in more than one ways by the depression, i prefer a more direct approach towards alleviating the current economic woes.<br><br>and i believe that the little people and the heartlanders share this view also... we don't much care for flashy economic principles and g.p lessons. we don't care if the gov't is dirty and monopolistic. we don't much care if glcs win or lose money, <strong>as long as we get bread and circus.</strong><br><br>the situation now suggests that we're only getting the clowns  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>i'm no liberal, neither am i a firm believer of parliamentary democracy. if there's ever a political philosophy i subscribe to, its anarchism. all gov'ts are bastards and scums and filth. the very institution itself is a device of oppression and exploitation.<br><br>but since a utopia where are men are kept in check with their self restraint is even more remote than a clean gov't, i subscribe to a more pragmatic view of my world.<br><br>many people now need direct aid <strong>before</strong> they can help themselves. i see your point, but i differ in opinion on what is more important to the people now.<br><br>cussing them for what they've done is not helpful here. and not everything that they've done has had a negative impact on the little man on the street.<br><br>what the little man cares about, is what they're gonna do to help him. i can pick myself up. i'm young. but what about the older retrenched workers?<br><br>the economy can restructure for all we care, jobs gone will just have to be lamented, but what more can be done to cushion the pain beyond rhetoric and symbolic gestures?<br><br>(and i don't want to hear another chee soon juan-type speech cos i frankly find them unconstructive and overly biased...)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sorry if i ever sound insulting to anyone, but I guess when discussing politics, all a person is interested to brush away every single thing the government does, pin every blame to the government (my gosh i mean people can somehow say government no good=people need 2nd job=no time=family problems), i must say these people have a nice way of reasoning. Therefore I think if you cant give a neutral discussion of politics, you have just  proven yourself dispensible in our country's development.<br><br>Leave if you need to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Â“CXÂ” and Â“gasbandÂ”,<br><br>Many thanks for your views that have been put in a very clear way.<br><br>The question that has been asked is what can we do to fend for ourselves under the present circumstances?<br><br>We are more hardy then the griping reveal, and there are many ways to beat any system that the Government care to put up.<br><br>Sometimes griping do help to stir the spirit, and one can be inspired to be more creative.<br><br>About the Â“chee soon juanÂ” type of politics, I think we should give him more credit for his Â“die-dieÂ” type of perseverance in butting his head against the system.<br><br>if we shut off the propaganda and character assassination, and listen to his principles, and his thoughts on some of the issues, there are reasonable views that even a supposed "NUT Case" can also offer.<br><br>The eminent Jeyaratnam was also vilified by his nemesis in LKY, and likewise the older generation also derided "Jeya" - (as this present generation is also deriding Â“Chee Soon JuanÂ”).<br><br>After more then 20 years in Politics, the soon to be Â“Rising SonÂ” in the DPM has decided to give Jeyaratnam his rightful dues of recognition for his perseverance in his political views for Singapore in his heart.<br><br>Shut out the political propaganda and character assassination, and Chee Soon Juan may yet see his better days, when the next future generation of Political Leaders decide to give him recognition for his present perseverence and efforts, despite the current on-going attempts to neutralize him while he is in his present youthful age.<br><br>Should we then play into the hands of the Ruling Political Party, by following their propaganda to deride Chee Soon Juan in his seemingly suicidal butting with the system ?<br><br>I would like to have an Active Opposition Representing the alternative views (in any form and quality) then NO Opposition to represent the alternative views in Parliament.<br><br>At present, the Ruling Political Party is having it too easy, in passing any legislation without any serious debate or representation of the feelings and views of the citizens.<br><br>With a vibrant political system, that allow for alternative views and open debate of ideas, the present disgraceful display of Political SUPREMACY and ARROGANCE can be avoided.<br><br>Contrary to what the Ruling Party would have us to believe, a serious Opposition Party would at least put in check the arrogant wastage of Public Funds in all the failed ventures locally as well as overseas that remain quietly and embarrassingly suppressed.<br><br>About Â“neutral positionÂ” to be taken in a discussion of politics, I guess one has to be a fence sitter, if I have to follow Â“gasbandÂ’sÂ” idea of political neutrality in such discussion. Unfortunately, this is something that I am not familiar with, being a Â“Fence SitterÂ”.<br><br>Â“Either you are with the Government position, or you are against it.Â”<br><br>You canÂ’t have the cake and eat it; and unfortunately, many Singaporeans are Â“Fence SittersÂ” in Politics.<br><br>They would like to have a strong Opposition, but they prefer also to have the goodies that the present Government is prepared to offer them if the votes are received.<br><br>Â“Selling their soul to the Devil for the material goods that can be immediately enjoyed ?Â”<br><br>With the exception of the wards in Potong Pasir and Yishun that elected Opposition Candidates, and turned down the tempting offers from the Ruling Party; the other wards that had the opportunity to cast their votes, had basically preferred material gains then to restore their political pride of self-assertion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My fellow Singaporean, Â“CXÂ”,<br><br>It truly amazes me that my posts seems to constantly elicit from anyone, a habit of reading more than what has been posted; as reflected in the constant non-failure in such reactions from you, Â“gasbandÂ” and Â“tripwireÂ” as in my earlier response to all your postings.<br><br>Has any one of my posts specifically made any explicit or implied request for an open mind from anyone to my posts ?<br><br>Have I confronted or taken anyoneÂ’s position to task, or fault anyone for their preferred posts directly - as what you have done in your direct "confrontation" to my posts ?<br><br>Could my posting of my alternative views to someone elseÂ’s posts be considered a violation and a discourtesy shown to his position taken ? Have I criticize anyone's posting in the same manner as adopted in your style displayed ?<br><br>The controversial positions that I have preferred to take, and dare to take a stand on, is quite different from yours, and the preferred neutral position taken by "gasband", and the controversial "tripwire" - as you guys seem to prefer to take a safer approach of walking the fine line of non-commitment to any clear defined political position(s).<br><br>Now I am wondering where the Â“bigoted bullÂ” is coming from, and who is taking a hypocritical position in being Â“the kettle calling the pot blackÂ”.<br><br>I believe that this condescending statement from you is a reflection of your position of "hypocrisy and bigotry" more than that from what position I have taken; and in posting your own critique by assuming more then what I had written.<br><br>Certainly, the intent of my post is to talk up a storm, to awake the placid contentment of Singaporeans that continue in dreamland, thinking that the present Political Status Quo is good for the future of Politics in Singapore; and for the future development of Singapore.<br><br>The present economic malaise in Singapore has as much to do with the Political Situation of a Dominant Single Party Politics, that has the arrogance of believing in its omnipotent righteousness and correctness in everything it does, and is intolerant to any alternative advise or opposing views.<br><br>Its sheer arrogance is reflected in its dictate that Citizens, who must make political statements, have to join a Political Party before they can make any statements.<br><br>This in breeding of exclusive talent, that believes that it alone has the monopoly and exclusive right to political governance, at the expense and exclusion of participation by all other Citizens from the other strata of Singapore Society, can only spell more trouble for Singapore.<br><br>I would welcome any reply from any interested party to engage in my Â“bigotryÂ” (if you so prefer to call my posts), and will invite anyone to prove where I have been mistaken in my views.<br><br>Why do you take it on yourself to teach anyone about courtesies, when you have displayed little understanding of this subject; nor have you appreciated the perimeters of your own status as a participant in this forum ?<br><br>Have you shown courtesy or respect to anyone elseÂ’s viewpoints that you disagree with ?<br><br>Not being able to accept someone elseÂ’s view points (or prefer to adopt a differing view) does not entitle you to show disrespect by calling someoneÂ’s viewpoints as being Â“bigotryÂ”.<br><br>This must be some kind of weird lopsided courtesy ?<br><br>What motivate you to view it as Â“bigotryÂ” ?<br><br>If my posts have inflamed your emotions, at least it met my objective of agitating you from slumber, and hopefully caused you to view matters outside the influence of established propaganda and clichÃ©s.<br><br>I would certainly extend to you the courtesy of your own bigoted views to my posting, and welcome any critiques you may have.<br><br>However, I do not think you are in any position to teach anyone the lessons of courtesy when you have shown little understanding of this subject - excuse me, but no apologies will be offered.<br><br></div>
