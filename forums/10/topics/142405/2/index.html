In fact, they thought we weren't ready for independence. By joining Malaysia, we gave the impression that we had some form backing.

Examples of this would be superfluous for me to point out.<br><br>Now, the question is why would I defend this company called Sg Inc? Would you take to arms and picket fences to protest the closing down of your company that you are working for???<br><br>The possibility of invasion is so remote that those not in the army look down on those forced to serve it and those in it abuse the system. Why would I bother taking to arms when this company is threaten?<br><br>Perhaps someone can outline the benefits of defending this Sg Inc?<br><br>War comes, all reservists get called back. Taxes increases to "pay for war". PAP flies to an allied nation with their families to set up goverment in exile so as to "better rule without blackmail".<br><br>Generals fly to the same allied country so as to "better advise the leaders" and "manage the war better".<br><br>If we win the war, ministers will increase their pay to compensate them for the "hardship incurred". Police and military forces will curb and limit peasent freedom to "prevent reoccurance of war and unrest". All land and property will be confiscated by the state to "help bring the economy back".<br><br>All privacy will be removed to "weed out dissendents and enemies of the state".<br><br>So, once again, why should I defend Sg Inc?</div></blockquote>Bravo! Nothing could be furhter from that. Singapore is run like a corporation than a nation.
