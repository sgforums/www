              <p style="margin-top: 8px;"><span><span>
              </span></span></p><p>The UN nuclear assembly voted on Friday to urge <a class="bluelink" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3284752,00.html">Israel </a>to
              
              accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and place all atomic sites
              under UN inspections, in a surprise victory for Arab states.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px;">The resolution, passed narrowly for the first time in nearly
              two decades, expresses concern about "Israeli nuclear capabilities" and
              calls on International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei to
              work on the issue.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px;"><span>The Middle East resolution, sponsored by
              Arab states, was backed by 49 votes to 45 against in a floor vote at
              the IAEA's annual member states conference. The vote split along
              Western and developing nation lines. There were 16 abstentions.
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <a class="bluelink" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3284215,00.html%20">Iranian </a>Ambassador
              
              Ali Asghar Soltanieh told reporters the passage of the resolution was
              "very good news and a triumph for the oppressed nation of Palestine".
              <p> </p>
              Russia and China backed the resolution.
              <p> </p>
              Israel is one of only three countries worldwide along with India and Pakistan outside the <a class="bluelink" href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dda/WMD/treaty/">nuclear NPT </a>and
              	 is widely assumed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, though it has never confirmed or denied it.
              <p> </p>
              "The delegation of Israel deplores this resolution," David
              Danieli, deputy director of Israel's atomic energy commission, told the
              chamber after the vote.
              <p> </p>
              "Israel will not cooperate in any matter with this resolution
              which is only aiming at reinforcing political hostilities and lines of
              division in the Middle East region."
              <p> </p>
              <div style="float: right;"><br></div>
              The measure was last voted on in 1991 when it passed by 39-31 with 13 abstentions when IAEA membership was much smaller.
              <p> </p>
              Since then there has only been presidential summaries of debate
              on this item or motions for adjournment or no action that carried the
              floor.
              <p> </p>
              Diplomats pointed to the increased number of abstentions – from
              countries ranging from India to Argentina and Nigeria as an important
              factor in the resolution's adoption. <br><p></p>

              <p>Out of curiousity, what do you think would be Israel's incentive to settle problems and compromise with its neighbours in a more diplomatic manner when it knows it has the world's biggest military  backing it ?</p>
              <p>Why would i want to compromise with people who don't like me when i have the biggest stick around and i know the neighbourhood policeman is going to back me up when i get in trouble?</p>
              <p>Yes Israel has a valid concern about its safety when its neighbour do not officially accept its existence. But by engaging in pro active strikes and aggressive moves against its neighbours the stituation would never be resolved.</p>
              <p>The populace already have alot of reasons to hate the Israelis and it would be very difficult for any of chauvinistic Muslim leaders to initiate compromise without looking weak and inept to their own people.</p>
              <p>I do not think it can be blamed on the religion itself. Politicians do what they have already done for thousands of years they are more interested in making decisions that would allow them to stay longer in power, not neccessarily for the welfare of the people they are responsible for.</p>
              <p>Instead, it would furthur encourage them to seek nuclear weapons in order to protect themselves. They're not stupid and they've already seen what happened to Iraq, none of them have any doubt it could happen to them especially Iran.</p>
              <p>I don't think using Singapore is a good example. Our existence came about as a natural process in the region while Israel were forced upon the Middle East, a decision made without the consensus of the surrounding region. The majority of Singaporeans then were already living here long before independence and though our existence is disliked we are more tolerated than hated. .</p>

              <p>Was it about whether it was correct for Egypt to launch a surprise attack on Israel, or was the event used to illustrate that the Egyptian surprise conventional attack during the Yom Kippur War can put Israel in peril - what more when the threat is nuclear and the threat could come at any surprise moment ?</p>
              <p>Israel had assumed wrongly that preparation for a conventional attack by any Arab neighbors can be detected with enough time to mobilise.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Egypt had cleverly concealed its mobilization process that led its military preparation to reach a critical mass, and in complete secrecy that caught the Israelis off guard and with devastating results.</p>
              <p>Can Israel afford to do nothing and wait for a nuclear strike by rouge elements so as to bring about another holocaust onto Israel ?</p>

              <p>Was it about whether it was correct for Egypt to launch a
              surprise attack on Israel, or was the event used to illustrate
              that the Egyptian surprise conventional
              attack during the Yom Kippur War can put Israel in
              peril - what more when the threat is nuclear and the threat could
              come at any surprise moment ?</p>
              <p>Israel had assumed wrongly that preparation for
              a conventional attack by any Arab neighbors can be
              detected with enough time to mobilise.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Egypt had cleverly concealed its
              mobilization process that led its military preparation to reach a
              critical mass, and in complete secrecy that caught the Israelis off
              guide. with devastating effects.</p>
              <p>Can Israel afford to do nothing and wait for a nuclear
              strike by rouge elements so as to bring about another holocaust
              onto Israel ?</p>
