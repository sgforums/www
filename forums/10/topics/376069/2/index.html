                                      to arrest the Singapore Cabinet.</p>

              would be healthy to continue to pursue policies based on assumptions

              <p>:</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yitzhak Rabin, chief of staff of the Israeli army </strong></span>at the time, stated:
                      "I do not think Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent to the
                      Sinai would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive war. He
                      knew it and we knew it."[2]</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prime Minister Levi Eshkol </strong></span>stated: "The
                      Egyptian layout in the Sinai and the general military build up there
                      testified to a military defensive Egyptian set-up, south of Israel."[3]</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Modechai Bentov, an Israeli cabinet minister at the time</strong></span>, stated: "All
                      this story about the danger of extermination [of Israel in June 1967]
                      has been a complete invention and has been blown up <em>a posteriori </em>to justify the annexation of Arab territory."[4]<br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Menachem Begin, a cabinet minister in June 1967,</strong></span> stated, while prime
                      minister, addressing Israel's National Defence College, on August 8,
                      1982: "In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian army
                      concentrations in the Sinai did not prove Nasser was really about to
                      attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack
                      him."[5]<br><br> As to "Syrian provocative attacks," let us let <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Moshe Dayan, Israel's
                      Minister of Defence at the time</strong></span>, tell us the facts as reported by Serge
                      Schmemann:<br><br> "He [Moshe Dayan] said he regretted not having stuck to his initial
                      opposition to storming the Golan Heights. There really was no pressing
                      reason to do so, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>many of the firefights with the Syrians were
                      deliberately provoked by Israel</strong></span>, and the kibbutz residents who pressed
                      the Government to take the Golan Heights did so less for security than
                      for the farmland... I know how at least 80 per cent of the clashes were
                      started. We would send a tractor to plow some area, in the
                      demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would start to
                      shoot. If they didn't shoot, we would tell the tractor to advance
                      further, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and shoot and
                      then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and that is
                      how it was."</p>

              <p>The Soviets also played a very dubious role in the period leading up to the war because they fed fake info to Egypt and Syria on Israeli military deployment:</p>

              <p>Soviet disinformation tactics play a crucial role in instigating war. 
                            The Israeli air attacks over Syria put the Soviets in the position of 
                            being able to feed Syria and ultimately Egypt with disinformation about 
                            Israel’s supposed intentions such that they provoked Egypt into taking 
                            military action against Israel. Commencing on May 8, 1966, a TASS cable 
                            from Damascus made the first mention of a suspicious concentration and 
                            movement of Israeli troops sighted lately on the border with Syria.</p>
              <p>By May 21 it was being asserted that about a third of the Israeli army 
                            was being transferred to the Syrian border. (see Isabella Ginor, The 
                            Cold War's Longest Cover Up: How and Why The USSR Instigated The 
                            1967 War, vol. 7, Issue #3,Meria Journal, Sept. 2003) The Russian Foreign 
                            Ministry sent at least eight warning notes to Israel's diplomats, 
                            alleging Israeli troop build-up on the Syrian border, none of which 
                            was true. At one point Israeli Premier Eshkol suggested that Soviet 
                            Ambassador Sergei Chuvakhin go to the northern border and check for 
                            himself. Chuvakhin replied that his job was to communicate Soviet truths

                            the Israelis had agreed to a UN inspection of the Demilitarized Zones,

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prime Minister Levi Eshkol</strong></span> stated: "The Egyptian layout in the Sinai and the general military build up there testified to a military defensive Egyptian set-up, south of Israel."[3]</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Modechai Bentov, an Israeli cabinet minister at the time</strong></span>, stated: "All this story about the danger of extermination [of Israel in June 1967] has been a complete invention and has been blown up <em>a posteriori</em> to justify the annexation of Arab territory."[4]<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Menachem Begin, a cabinet minister in June 1967,</strong></span> stated, while prime minister, addressing Israel's National Defence College, on August 8, 1982: "In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai did not prove Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him."[5]<br><br>As to "Syrian provocative attacks," let us let <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Moshe Dayan, Israel's Minister of Defence at the time</strong></span>, tell us the facts as reported by Serge Schmemann:<br><br>"He [Moshe Dayan] said he regretted not having stuck to his initial opposition to storming the Golan Heights. There really was no pressing reason to do so, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>many of the firefights with the Syrians were deliberately provoked by Israel</strong></span>, and the kibbutz residents who pressed the Government to take the Golan Heights did so less for security than for the farmland... I know how at least 80 per cent of the clashes were started. We would send a tractor to plow some area, in the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would start to shoot. If they didn't shoot, we would tell the tractor to advance further, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and shoot and then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and that is how it was."</p>

              <p>With the benefit of hindsight, one can perhaps make changes to ensure that any mistakes now identified will make it unnecessary to walk the same path again.</p>
              <p>However, if others know that you have changed course, will others not take advantage of that knowlege and attack you ?</p>

              <p>If you have any intention to be objective, you should read up on the events that led up to the 1967 Six-Day Arab-Israeli War, and not from those who have looked at events with the benefit of "hind-sight".</p>
              <p>If you were involved and living each second and minutes of that threatening period that led up to the important decision to launch a Pre-Emptive Strike that became known as the Six-Day War - you would probably draw a different conclusion.</p>

              <p>The Soviets also played a very dubious role in the period leading up to the war because they fed fake info to Egypt and Syria on Israeli military deployment:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soviet disinformation tactics play a crucial role in instigating war. The Israeli air attacks over Syria put the Soviets in the position of being able to feed Syria and ultimately Egypt with disinformation about Israel’s supposed intentions such that they provoked Egypt into taking military action against Israel. Commencing on May 8, 1966, a TASS cable from Damascus made the first mention of a suspicious concentration and movement of Israeli troops sighted lately on the border with Syria.</p>
              <p>By May 21 it was being asserted that about a third of the Israeli army was being transferred to the Syrian border. (see Isabella Ginor, The Cold War's Longest Cover Up: How and Why The USSR Instigated The 1967 War, vol. 7, Issue #3,Meria Journal, Sept. 2003) The Russian Foreign Ministry sent at least eight warning notes to Israel's diplomats, alleging Israeli troop build-up on the Syrian border, none of which was true. At one point Israeli Premier Eshkol suggested that Soviet Ambassador Sergei Chuvakhin go to the northern border and check for himself. Chuvakhin replied that his job was to communicate Soviet truths and not to test them.</p>

              <p><em>“The repetition of these charges, together with increasingly acrimonious Soviet statements and the encouragement of Syria to undertake actions (which indeed provoked a forceful Israeli response climaxing on April 7, 1967) were part of a deliberate escalation designed to prepare the ground for harnessing Egypt to the end is in the military confrontation being prepared and to draw an Israeli strike against Egypt as well.”</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sixdaywar.co.uk/6_day_war_aftermath_prof_adler_context_pt1.htm#9">[9]</a> </p>

              <p>General Odd Bull commented that in April 1967 during the period when Russian was issuing its warnings concerning Israeli troop build up, the Israelis had agreed to a UN inspection of the Demilitarized Zones, a somewhat strange thing to do if the allegations had been true. </p>

              <p><br>Are you not implying that the Soviet Union colluded with Israel ?</p>
              <p>Whose fault is it now ?</p>
              <p>The Israelis for making an unprovoked pre-emptive attack on her Arab neighbors that started the Six-Day War - as suggested in your preceding posts; or did the Arab neighbors actually responded to the false Soviet information and had actually massed their troops to threaten Israel and caused Israel to re-act with a Pre-emptive Strike ?</p>
              <p>You have got to make a stand somewhere, and not be wishy-washy from moment to moment.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should purchase or borrow the following book after reading a synopsis of the contents and broaden your knowledge of those events that led to the Six-Day War and correct your slanted views of the politcs of that region.</p>

              <p> Why did the Soviet Union spark war in 1967 between Israel and the Arab states by falsely informing Syria and Egypt that Israel was massing troops on the Syrian border? Based on newly available archival sources, <em>The Soviet Union and the June 1967 Six Day War </em>answers this controversial question more fully than ever before.</p>
              <p>Directly opposing the thesis of the recently published Foxbats over Dimona by Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez, the contributors to this volume argue that Moscow had absolutely no intention of starting a war.</p>
              <p>The Soviet Union's reason for involvement in the region had more to do with enhancing its own status as a Cold War power than any desire for particular outcomes for Syria and Egypt.<br><br>In addition to assessing Soviet involvement in the June 1967 Arab-Israeli Six Day War, this book covers the USSR's relations with Syria and Egypt, Soviet aims, U.S. and Israeli perceptions of Soviet involvement, Soviet intervention in the Egyptian-Israeli War of Attrition (1969-70), and the impact of the conflicts on Soviet-Jewish attitudes.</p>
              <p>This book as a whole demonstrates how the Soviet Union's actions gave little consideration to the long- or mid-term consequences of their policy, and how firing the first shot compelled them to react to events.</p>
