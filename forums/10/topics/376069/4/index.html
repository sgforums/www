              <p><br>The jewish are able to survive there because the Arabs are not united, surprisely, given their brotherhood muslim status, Arabs states are very individualistic, and such non corporation is make worst by the western intervention. The West has an agenda of not making the Arab states United, if the Arabs get united, gone is the jewish state, and in my opinon, Jews are not good either, their brother are NewYork con- bankers who channelled your money invested into Israel military use. There is alots of dirty conspiracy going on...and the current sufferers are the Palestine peoples. If the Arabs are co-operatives, they should take care of their brothers and sisters there, but instead of doing it, these Arab kings, generals and Fahats are happily enjoying rich life with big asses farting all the way to America.</p>

              <p>I do not know the answer to your first question, and i'm betting neither do you.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In your earlier post, you did make the following statement (in blue italics), which was a feature in my response (shown in green) - should I not know the answer ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">There is a difference between being able to see where their logic is coming from and believing and agreeing with it.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">You seemed to think it must be the same.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #339966;">As observers "without any interest in the Middle-east politics" - you and I can see the obvious difference.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #339966;">Can those with direct interest see the differences ?</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure that those with calm and sound minds, and able to think for the long term will be able to see where the logic is coming from, and depending on which sides of the fence one is standing in the battle lines - the concerned parties may believe and agree with what they see; while others may believe in the causes but not necessarily agree with the methods or course taken. </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I think you're thinking only of Muslim fundamentalists/terrorists when you ask this question. Certainly there's cause to consider that, but i'm willing to consider that the current Israeli government, or at least people who have influence on the government too have a vested interest in keeping things this way. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In politics, there are always vested interests involved, and it depends on the basis of those vested interests - which in the Israeli case, coming from the difficult history that they have as a people across the ages, I would hope and expect that their interest is a morally acceptable one. </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I certainly have no objection to the second part of your statements.</p>
              <p>Some of them no doubt have a desire to establish this caliphate. But how does telling these countries that they cannot have nuclear weapons because they may use it on Israel when Israel could use it on them with no fear of retaliation supposed to make them feel?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> India has develop nuclear capabilities, and so too has Pakistan.</p>
              <p>Are the levels of concern as high with these two countries compared to what has been shown towards the Iranians - and considering that Pakistan is an Islamic State ?</p>
              <p>It is the Iranian track record of irresponsible statements made and which have been bolstered by actual acts of irresponsiblity of the State of Iran that aroused valid alarm amongst the global community.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If Indonesia starts developing nuclear weapons but Malaysia and Singapore are told by the US, China and the UN that we cannot have it wouldn't you feel that it's injustice as well?</p>
              <p>We're not even at odds with Indonesia, but we would still protest at this idea. What about the countries who saw what happened to Iraq and feared everyday that it would happen to them as well?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> If Indonesia is a real threat to Malaysia and Singapore, do you think that both will not covertly begin some illicit program too ?</p>
              <p>Despite all the pressures applied onto India and Pakistan, both had developed their nuclear option.</p>
              <p>In any case, it has always been China's policy not to interfere in national affairs. </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Would Israel have less incentive to bully the Palestinians if the US no longer support it with no questions asked.Would it then have more cause to try to reconcile differences with its neighbours when it doesn't feel so invulnerable?</p>
              <p>I'm not asking for Israel to go totally passive and just tolerate bullying from its neighbours either. But what's happening now is the other extreme, that Israel need not fear any retaliation for its actions no matter how questionable. </p>
              <p>You want the Middle East to acknowledge Israel, but that won't happen if Israel doesn't feel that it needs their acknowledgement.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>With or without US support, the track record has been the Israelis will protect themselves against all agressions from any direction.</p>
              <p>If the US was to cut off economic or financial support to the Israelis, one may see a less intransigent Israel in the negotiations and conduct with the Palestinians. </p>
              <p>The present situation has the Iranians bent on its declared destruction of Israel, and delivering financial and logistic support for the rocket attacks from Hamas in Gaza, and by the Hezbollah from southern Lebanon.</p>
              <p>Israel has never backed down from direct challenges to its existence, and will employ even tougher methods that can be seen as bullying from those outside the theatre.</p>
              <p>Despite serving a propaganda coup to the Iranian agenda, the Israeli has little concern for this loss as long as they are able to achieve security for their people.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that Israel do not need the Middle-East acknowledge to their existence and will prefer to live in a war-like seige environment, with the bulk of their national budget spent on defense ?</p>

              <p>This is a topic about Israel and i prefer not to get drawn in to a discussion about the PAP and LKY with you because i know from the history of this forum how it would end up.</p>
              <p>But i do find it rather disgusting that you would compare us with the current state of the Palestinians. The majority of the population have never experienced constant blackouts and water cuts. Medicine, clean water and stable supply of food are still available to us.</p>
              <p>You view our state as somehow comparable is because you cannot imagine the insecure feeling of not knowing when another country is just going to drive in with tanks and attack helicopters and bomb us with impundity.</p>

              <p><br> The jewish are able to survive there because the Arabs are not
              united, surprisely, given their brotherhood muslim status, Arabs
              states are very individualistic, and such non corporation is make
              worst by the western intervention. The West has an agenda of not
              making the Arab states United, if the Arabs get united, gone is the
              jewish state, and in my opinon, Jews are not good either, their
              brother are NewYork con- bankers who channelled your money invested
              into Israel military use. There is alots of dirty conspiracy going
              on...and the current sufferers are the Palestine peoples. If the
              Arabs are co-operatives, they should take care of their brothers
              and sisters there, but instead of doing it, these Arab kings,
              generals and Fahats are happily enjoying rich life with big

              <p>Well, some said the Americans are best bastard in this world, they can be both policemen and thieves. Remember the watergate issue, and that Lt Col north on Iran...aren't Americans playing triple heads monster here,..too bad the Arabs are mostly lazy bums, dun bother to dig and refine their petrol and also do the marketing, so the American and the west do it for them, in the end, the Arabs have to depend on them, they just go on eat fat muttons and shake legs with juicy bimbos.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, if you follow the book of western laws (bible), the land belong to the jews, but if you follow the real geopolitical situation, the Arabs had occupied the place for so long. God may have blessed Arabs with oil, but he certainly never instill brain and hardworking attitude in them....anyway, oil is stable</p>
