              Israel exists, at least initially as a result of foreign

              <p>The zionist ideology must go.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As long as Israel is an ethnic 
                  state, it will be forced to deepen the occupation and intensify its ethnic 
                  cleansing policies to prevent the emergence of genuine Palestinian political 
                  influence -- for the reasons I cite above and for many others I don’t. In truth, 
                  both a one-state and a genuine two-state arrangement are impossible given 
                  Israel’s determination to remain a Jewish state.</span></span></p>

                  obstacle to a solution, then, is not about dividing the land but about Zionism 
                  itself, the ideology of ethnic supremacism that is the current orthodoxy in 
                  Israel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As long as Israel is a Zionist state, its leaders will allow neither one 
                  state nor two real states.</strong></span></span></span></p>

                  solution, therefore, reduces to the question of how to defeat Zionism. </strong></span>It just 
                  so happens that the best way this can be achieved is by confronting the 
                  illusions of the two-state dreamers and explaining why Israel is in permanent 
                  bad faith about seeking peace.</span></span></p>

              <p>As observers "without any interest in the Middle-east politics"
              - you and I can see the obvious difference.</p>
              <p>Can those with direct interest see the differences ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While religion is not the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict
              over the creation of the State of Israel, it has
              now <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">evolved into
              a Jihad</span></em> for the many Muslims across the
              globe - who were offended by the imposition
              of unequitable, illegal and total lack of justice in the
              treatment of the Palestinian people by the State of
              Israel.</p>
              <p>The Muslim activists have used religion as
              a platform as a unifying call amongst their own faithfuls
              to stand up to the insufferable injustice practised by an
              arrogant Israel - with direct or implicit support from many Western
              Government.</p>
              <p>It does not help when the political fight between the
              Israelis and the Palestinian Arabs have now been hijacked by
              Religious Fanatics with a larger agenda of annihilating the State
              of Israel and to create an Islamic Caliphate that stretched from
              the West Coast of Africa, across the Middle-east and Central Asia,
              and into the eastern most corner of Southeast Asia.</p>

              <p>I do not know the answer to your first question, and i'm betting neither do you.</p>
              <p>I
              think you're thinking only of Muslim fundamentalists/terrorists when
              you ask this question. Certainly there's cause to consider that, but
              i'm willing to consider that the current Israeli government, or at
              least people who have influence on the government too have a vested
              interest in keeping things this way. </p>
              <p>I certainly have no objection to the second part of your statements.</p>
              <p>Some
              of them no doubt have a desire to establish this caliphate. But how
              does telling these countries that they cannot have nuclear weapons
              because they may use it on Israel when Israel could use it on them with
              no fear of retaliation supposed to make them feel?</p>
              <p>If Indonesia
              starts developing nuclear weapons but Malaysia and Singapore are told
              by the US, China and the UN that we cannot have it wouldn't you feel
              that it's injustice as well?</p>
              <p>We're not even at odds with
              Indonesia, but we would still protest at this idea. What about the
              countries who saw what happened to Iraq and feared everyday that it
              would happen to them as well?</p>
              <p>Would Israel have less incentive to
              bully the Palestinians if the US no longer support it with no questions
              asked.Would it then have more cause to try to reconcile differences
              with its neighbours when it doesn't feel so invulnerable?</p>
              <p>I'm not
              asking for Israel to go totally passive and just tolerate bullying from
              its neighbours either. But what's happening now is the other extreme,
              that Israel need not fear any retaliation for its actions no matter how
              questionable. </p>
              <p>You want the Middle East to acknowledge Israel, but that won't happen if Israel doesn't feel that it needs their acknowledgement.</p>

              <p>Do we need fences and concrete walls to hold a population
              captive ?</p>
              <p>The PAP is more sophisticated in their methods then
              you can possibly imagine.</p>
              <p>The minority groups have been politically disenfranchised
              by the standard political detoxification applied on every
              Singaporean, and have been further treated with more stringent and
              cautious policies to ensure that they do not become a force that
              will threaten Singapore and the politics of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Surely, you are aware, or do you need it to be spelled out in
              this public forum ?</p>
              <p> You should not count this option out too early.</p>
              <p>What make you think that such options are not
              already considered in the studies made by the many "Think
              Tanks" under the auspices of the "Inner Circle" ?</p>
              <p>The same had happened in the Middle-east too, where Jews
              familiar with their Arab neighbors were similarly protecting each
              other in areas where one is the majority.</p>
              <p>The same can be said of Malaysians and Singaporeans - we were
              one and the same people of the same ethnic diversities, social
              customs, culture, cuisines, languages and dialects, religions,
              personal ambitions and dreams for the future generations - still
              politics have muddied the calm waters, with others insisting
              on taking the short cut to political power by hijacking the powers
              afforded from the pulpit.</p>
              <p>In this day and age - can any single superpower
              guarantee our existence - other then the collective powers of all
              nations embracing the tenets of the United Nations ?</p>
              <p>Singapore do not depend on one single superpower, but a balance
              of powers for our survival - and even then, we will have to
              consider that any such relationship will also have spill over
              benefits for our neighbors and that we are not singularly the
              sole-beneficiary of such a relationship.</p>
              <p>This explains for the implicit tolerance of the existence of the
              US Military using Singapore facilities while in transit, and
              spreading the benefits of the logistical support to Indonesia
              and Malaysia despite their strong reservations that were expressed
              earlier.</p>
              <p>Your question should be directed to LKY and the PAP - who
              have constantly reminded Singaporeans the need for Singapore to be
              vigilant, and mindful of the vulnerability of the past.</p>
              <p>Although the events that led to the Singapore being kicked out
              of Malaysia - have seldom been addressed directly, this was done
              as a matter of deference to the sensitivities of perception
              and interpretations of those events - that will surely
              lead to acrimony with our neighbours.</p>
              <p>The past have always been the basis of developing our present
              planning for the future threats that are to be expected.</p>
              <p>Is this not the way forward in strategic planning ?</p>
              <p>Is our population size so big ?</p>
              <p>The size and quality of the SAF may provide
              a strategic edge when compared with the military force in the
              neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Even when you dare to weild the big stick, do you think that the
              bigger neighbors will not have their own "Think Tanks" that would
              have studied the use of their large land space to absorb
              your entire SAF, stretching your manpower and resources thin
              as they draw you deeper into their hinterland ?</p>
              <p>Can your small civilian population and economy support a
              NSF military force to sustain a long term strategic
              war designed to deplete your military manpower ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, can the size of our population and the
              country sustain the SAF in any long term
              conflict - without the support of any big brother as the
              one that Israel has ?</p>
              <p>When the opponent know that you are not prepared, or too eager
              to use the stick that they know you have - do you think that it
              will not weaken your political position when you are seen as
              nothing more then a "Paper Tiger" ?</p>

              <p>This is a topic about Israel and i prefer not to get drawn in to a discussion about the PAP and LKY with you because i know from the history of this forum how it would end up.</p>
              <p>But i do find it rather disgusting that you would compare us with the current state of the Palestinians. The majority of the population have never experienced constant blackouts and water cuts. Medicine, clean water and stable supply of food are still available to us.</p>
              <p>You view our state as somehow comparable is because you cannot imagine the insecure feeling of not knowing when another country is just going to drive in with tanks and attack helicopters and bomb us with impundity.</p>
              <p>Do i think our current state of affairs are satisfactory? No.</p>
              <p>But i would never imagine comparing what we have to what the Palestinians are going through.</p>
              <p>I have no interest in responding to the rest of your post because it reflects my point, we can't go about waving our sticks because we can't support such an endeavour. But that doesn't neccessary weaken our position either.</p>
