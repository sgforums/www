            <div class='col-md body'>well, from my experiences in sch, its stil proven to me tat female teachers r more 'creative' in punishing students...they r the ones who inflict punishments which r more psychological rather than physical...when i was in primary sch, i encountered several female teachers who had a wide variety of punishments. they include things like ear-pulling, standing wif book on top of ur head, recitation(repeating a statement again n again until they tell u to stop), doing half-squats while pulling ur ears, slapping ursel, walking up n down the corridor for 1 whole period cos u were caught walking ard the class without permission...i myself was a victim of a few of these...i recall an incident in primary sch...it was during a prize presentation rehearsal...when we went to the hall for rehearsal, we saw 2 boys each standing at 1 corner of the stage on top pulling thier ears...we later found out tat they were being punished by the teacher-in-charge of the rehearsal. to make it worse, the teacher made them stand facing us. we could see how embarrassed they were. n the teacher kept thenm there thru out the entire rehearsal!!! so while we were rehearsing, those 2 boys were being punished. can u imagine how embarraseed they muz have felt?? n how tired they muz have been for standing for such a long period??? again, it was done by a female teacher...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello all, i am back again...<br><br>yup to continue the topic, let me cite another case tat happened wayback when i was in primary 1...tis happened to my classmate...<br>we were having chinese lesson in class n we were sitting in front of the class listening to the teacher...then just as the teacher was explaining sth halfway, my classmate who wanted to say sth interrupted her. the teacher was angry tat he interrupted her like tat without raising his hands 1st. she scolded him n ordered him to stand at the back of the class n do recitation. he was to recite " i must raise my hands if i want to speak" in chinese. while tis may seem an ok punishment, it muz be noted tat he was punished for the rest of the period. i estimate it was abt half an hour. at the end, he was physically tired out from all the recitation. was the punishment too harsh? did he deserve such harsh punishment? 2 pts to note...<br><br>1) he was onli a primary 1 student<br>2) it was the 1st time he was punished for such an offence.<br><br>wad r ur views? air them here...</div>
