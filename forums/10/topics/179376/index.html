            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by despondent:</div><div class="quote_body">all of us i believe have had our fair share of being punished in school. some punishments r more physical while others more psychological...physical ones include caning, CWO, kneeling or standing for long periods etc...psychological ones like pulling of ears, facing the wall, being ask to sing in front of whole class etc...i personally feel tat diff. punishments shld vary wif the severity of offences n the age of the student involved...surely u wun wanna shame a university student by punishing him like a primary schoolboy?<br>below is a true account of a student i noe who was punished by a teacher...he was punished for spewing 1 word of vulgarity...<br><br>student: @#%()&amp;*&amp;^%$%^*<br>teacher: U!!! COME HERE!!! HOW DARE U SAY TAT!!! COME HERE!!!<br>boy approaches n teacher scolded: WAD DID U SAY JUZ NW?! I DARE U TO REPEAT WAD U SAID JUZ NW!!!<br>STUDENT: i didnt say anything...<br>teacher: DUN DENY IT ALRITE!!! I HEARD WAD U SAID!!! I HEARD U!!!(pulls student to 1 corner) SLAP URSLEF!!! SLAP!!! KEEP ON SLAPPING!!<br>(abt 10 min later) teacher: U R NT SLAPPING...U R PATTING!!!(pulls student out of class) dun wanna slap rite...face the whole school n slap...<br>in the end, DM happen to walk pass...teacher complained abt student to him n student was caned in front of whole class<br>wad r ur views abt tis? was the teacher too harsh? was the student deserving of the punishment? air them here...</div></blockquote>i would prefer if a trip to the gas chamber will be for punishment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
