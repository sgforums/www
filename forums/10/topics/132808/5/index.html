            <div class='col-md body'>basically there are many ethnic groups within the chinese community: mainly the Han or mandrins, the dominant group on china. reccent studies have shown that the hokkiens actually belong to a group called the "yue" who have been assimilated into han culture when the han people took over their land. the cantonese also fall under the "yue" peoples.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> thats why they resemle the taiwanese and hong kongers more than the mainland chinese(whom by themselves compromise of millions of different peoples).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> generally chinese from the southern regions tend to be shorter and smaller built with more roundish facial features and their complexion gets darker as they spread southward whereas the northern chinese which includes the han are taller and nigger built, some posessing indo-european features due to the intermingling between them and the indo european tribes that migrated to the north of china.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> notice how some ancient chinese paintings and potraits feature taller and bigger built men with higher nose bridges?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lets not get into genetics: it reminds me of Hitler and his herrenvolk (master race). Genes may be "diluted" (politically incorrect term), and one may be less of a person of Han or Indo-Aryan construct. Yet, in this case, it is more appropriate to talk about Peranakans being an ethnic group and not a race. refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race </a> Ethnicity is not made up by genes alone. it combines customs, traditions, language, and the delicate idea of ethnic consciousness.<br><br>Peranakans customs have evolved through 500 years of interaction, and in some cases intermarriage. Yet, they have not lost the idea that they were essentially different from the Malays around them. Similarly, under pressure to adopt the Singaporean "Chinese" identity (as defined by the govt), they have not lost the awareness that they are indeed different (at least to some extent) from the cantonese and mandarin speaking people around them.<br><br>It is thus understandable that many Peranakans are disaffected with the constant accusations that they are "bastardized" Chinese.

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes, i cant stand Sporean Chinese coz they mix a lot esp if they are many generation here, or have pernakan blood. those who grandparents born in china, still ok, as they retain their chinese look. but if they are say 5-6 generation already in Spore, chances are they are quite mixed and it shows in their face. Many local celebrites are example and it is very easy to tell the difference from their faces. u also notice, a fair lot of sporean chinese on th street dont really have that very Chinese look that are common in China, Taiwan (a lesser extent) and HK (oso lesser extent).<br><br>Southern Chinese, esp from coastal provinces look kinda different. A bit of Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino and China's minority races like Yao and Miao. Even as a Shanghainese, i can tell who is who apart easily.</div>
