If this is true, then it is indeed the "people who piss on streets attempt to look pathetically "elite" over a people whom are streets ahead."<br><br>Most Chinese may have left china a poor man but many succeeded one way or another in south east asia. That is the reason why ethnic chinese minority remain significant players in the economies of most, if not all south east asian countries today. Most chinese would go back to china to get marred then returned here. They din marry the "low caste locals."<br><br>If you don't have the book and you think you are peranakan, so be it, but don say your ancestors are poor chinese married to "low caste locals". You insult your ancestors and all peranakans.<br><br>If you don't know your ancestor, or don't follow the family middle name, ask your parents, only they can tell. don't make sweeping statement here about chinese or peranakan. What you have said so far do not honor your ancestors.<br><br>Are you sure your ancestors are farmers from China, not a japanese soldier taking a chinese name, married a "low caste locals" to avoid trial after WW2?<br></div>

If one were to search for the truth, eg can provide evidence that all 8 of your grand parents came direct from China......otherwise, give truth a chance.<br><br>If we were to accept the fact that we have Malay blood, then we will learn to treat the minorities in our midst with more respect.......afterall, we also are part-malay.....<br><br>All I am asking is that people don't accept but test for the truth.
