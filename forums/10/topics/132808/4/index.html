            <div class='col-md body'>I say, let them deny their identities and heritage all they want. Perhaps after a long time they feel distinct from the mainland Chinese.<br><br>Afrikaners of South Africa were descended from 17th century dutch and speak afrikaans, a version of the dutch language. Yet, they feel distinct from the netherlands and its culture. (they identify as white though)<br><br>So peranakans may not be exactly Chinese, as Drwho pointed out.
