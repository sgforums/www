It's sad that alot of people nowadays, especially the younger generations really, so blinded in their life to make money for themselves, has faded the acknowledgment of the existenance of these less fortunate people. People nowadays tend to be more self centered and less conscious of fellow families that are undergoing hardships. In fact, from what I believe, children/teens from less fortunate familes normally get teased by insensitive schoolmates when they cannot afford new clothes or better looking shoes. Such is life.</div>
