            <div class='col-md body'>Dear PJ Quek,<br><br>There is one thing I acknowledge, and that is, the Workers' Party isn't perfect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Meng Seng knows our opinions do not assimilate 100% with our party's leadership. Otherwise, we'll be worse off than the PAP <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But honestly, you do not sound like you know much about WP, despite living in Hougang <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For example, you said "WP and SDA cannot even maintain their constituencies as good as PAP does".<br><br>I can't speak for SDA.<br><br>For the WP, it won Hougang because the PAP incumbent carried out a botched job. After Mr Low won, residents felt he did better. This was why he won three times. On the contrary, his PAP opponent was into his second election, which he lost.<br><br>The Hougang Town Council has carried out many works and is ranked among the top 10 town councils in Singapore in terms of efficiency. As an Houganger, you cannot have not noticed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I also do not know much about SDP and Dr Chee, but he certainly does not seem to me as "talk politics only during the election time". I see him appear every now and then. It is different from saying his political activities are not in sync with the voting populace.<br><br>You also suggested opposition "come out to organise meet-the-people sessions". As as Houganger, you should know that Mr Low conducts MPS every week <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The Youth Action Committee has also done welfare work. This is an open and transparent feature on our YAC website, with photos to accompany its factuality.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PJ_Quek:</div><div class="quote_body">Regardless of PAP or any other party.
