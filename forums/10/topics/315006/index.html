              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Before I begin,</p>
              <p>I hope all of us 1st understand truely the english meaning of 'ultimately' and  'responsible' and 'national security', these 3 words / terms.</p>
              <p>I am posting this thread to clarify something.</p>
              <p>Based on the news and impression impressed upon me,</p>
              <p>I am wondering, National Security is the responsibility of which person / organisation in the Strictest sense of the words? This question is tough. so tough i do not think many will be able to have the answer. it requires very high level of IQ.</p>
              <p>pang teh ah soh is responsible for things like she sees the tea cup dirty she cleans it.</p>
              <p>she sees a bag left in the mrt train no one take away , she informs mrt staff.</p>
              <p>MRT staff is responsible for checking it out asap and not left till something happens.</p>
              <p>the station manager is responsible for the proper managing of operations.</p>
              <p>who is responsible for implementing the policy of security for the MRT? higher up.</p>
              <p>For the bang case, who is responsible for the national security of the pore?</p>
              <p>is it:</p>
              <p>a. DC security man</p>
              <p>b. DC manager.</p>
              <p>c. higher up.</p>
              <p>in fact national security is not just about abang case.</p>
              <p>It covers all and every aspect of national security. Not just a DC. Not just terrorism.</p>
              <p>it can even mean the survival or death of a nation.</p>
              <p>Who is responsible for this? </p>
              <p>make this easier. Who is Not Responsible in anyway ? 'anyway' means zero responsibility. if its a little responsible, it means, responsible also technically. Its either Responsible or not responsible. Who is it ? if u dare not voice up, tell your heart the answer. tell your subconscious the answer. Tell your wife the answer. Tell your mudder the answer. Tell your dog the answer.</p>
              <p>Can you tell me, Educated ones ?</p>

              <p>The LKY family and croonies are resposibble for National security or is that LKY family interest.</p>
              <p>Girls are a matter of national security also and if they don't succeed in killing you there's always the way to defame the person as being mentally ill/crazy.</p>
              <p>After all who in the world would believe that mind reader(s) exists.</p>
              <p>The dastardly things that they do...shameless people who believe in evil. while the evil they sent fled in terror??! Pretty stupid people I say. wicked but foolish.</p>
