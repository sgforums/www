It is described by C. Wright Mills in 1959 as a enabling Â“its possessor to understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner life and the external career of a variety of individualsÂ”. Mills goes on to describe people as being Â“Seldom aware of the intricate connection between the patterns of their own lives and the course of world history, ordinary people do not usually know what this connection means for the kinds of people they are becoming and for the kinds of history-making in which they might take part. They do not possess the quality of mind essential to grasp the interplay of individuals and society, of biography and history, of self and world.Â”<br><br></div>

I say again, you control your destiny and nobody else. Whoever says otherwise is just offloading responsibility onto others.<br><br>You always have a choice what to think &amp; what to be influenced by. If you choose to think you are being oppressed &amp; thumbed down, well I have good news for you - that my friend will become your reality. Simple as that!<br><br>The rich folks don't bother themselves or waste their time thinking about poverty - so they get caught in an upward spiral i.e. the rich get richer<br><br>The poor on the other hand think of nothing else but their sorry state of affairs &amp; how others are stomping on them - hence they accelerate their death spiral.<br><br>Now do you need a sociology scholar to put it any simply?</div>
