              </span></strong></p><div><strong>The Electronic Police State<br> 2008 National Rankings</strong></div><strong>
              </strong><br> <br> Most of us are aware that our governments monitor nearly every form of
              electronic communication. We are also aware of private companies doing
              the same. This strikes most of us as slightly troubling, but very few
              of us say or do much about it. There are two primary reasons for this:<br> 1. We really don’t see how it is going to hurt us. Mass surveillance is
              certainly a new, odd, and perhaps an ominous thing, but we just don’t
              see a complete picture or a smoking gun.<br> 2. We are constantly surrounded with messages that say, “Only crazy people complain about the government.”<br> <br> However, the biggest obstacle to our understanding is this:<br> The usual image of a “police state” includes secret police dragging
              people out of their homes at night, with scenes out of Nazi Germany or
              Stalin’s USSR. The problem with these images is that they are horribly
              outdated. That’s how things worked during your grandfather’s war – that
              is not how things work now.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">An electronic police state is quiet, even unseen.
              All of its legal actions are supported by abundant evidence. It looks
              pristine.<br> </span></strong><br> An electronic police state is characterized by this:<p></p>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>State use of electronic technologies to record, organize, search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens.</strong></span><br></div>
              <p><br> The two crucial facts about the information gathered under an electronic<br> police state are these:<br> 1. It is criminal evidence, ready for use in a trial.<br> 2. It is gathered universally and silently, and only later organized for<br> use in prosecutions.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In an Electronic Police State, every surveillance
              camera recording, every email you send, every Internet site you surf,
              every post you make, every check you write, every credit card swipe,
              every cell phone ping… are all criminal evidence, and they are held in
              searchable databases, for a long, long time. Whoever holds this
              evidence can make you look very, very bad whenever they care enough to
              do so. You can be prosecuted whenever they feel like it – the evidence
              is already in their database.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Perhaps you trust that your ruler
              will only use his evidence archives to hurt bad people. Will you also
              trust his successor? Do you also trust all of his subordinates, every
              government worker and every policeman?</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>And, if some leader behaves badly,
              will you really stand up to oppose him or her? Would you still do it if
              he had all the emails you sent when you were depressed? Or if she has
              records of every porn site you’ve ever surfed? Or if he knows every
              phone call you’ve ever made? Or if she knows everyone you’ve ever sent
              money to? Such a person would have all of this and more – in the form
              of court-ready evidence – sitting in a database, waiting to be
              organized at the touch of a button.</strong></span><br> <br> This system hasn’t yet reached its full shape, but all of the basics
              are in place and it is not far from complete in some places. It is too
              late to prevent this – it is here. Our purpose in producing this report
              is to let people know that their liberty is in jeopardy and to help
              them understand how it is being undermined.<br> <br> <strong>OUR RANKINGS</strong><br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Firstly, we are not measuring government censorship of Internet traffic or police abuses, as legitimate as these issues may be.</strong></span> And, we are not including evidence gathering by traditional, honest
              police work in any of the categories below. (That is, searches pursuant
              to honestly obtained warrants – issued by an independent judge, and
              only after the careful examination of evidence.)</p>
              <p><strong>THIS YEAR’S RESULTS</strong><br> Our rankings for the year of 2008 show China and North Korea occupying
              the top spots as the most complete Electronic Police States in the
              world, followed by Belarus and Russia. Next, however, we leave
              communist and recently-communist states, with the UK (England/Wales),
              the United States and <strong>Singapore</strong> following closely on their heels.<br> <br> Here are the 52 states and their rankings:<br> 1. China<br> 2. North Korea<br> 3. Belarus<br> 4. Russia<br> 5. United Kingdom: England &amp; Wales<br> 6. United States of America<br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">7. Singapore</span></strong><br> 8. Israel<br> 9.

We welcome input
              from any and all reliable sources. (The information required to prepare
              such a report is not easy to obtain, and we’ll take whatever help we
              can get.)<br> <br> ---------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at Singapore News Alternative:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>The survey is not ground breaking or significant to ponder bout. it suggests technological advancement  rather than police stateness. The coming of technology has posed a number of issues of recordkeeping for safeguarding personal information. Internet banking is not about barter trading or purchasing in ,cash bank transactions, credit card purchases need to have records or else scams, mishaps will be going on all the time. The same applies for criminal records. if u dont hav a record keeping system, the world will go haywire and more crimes will be committed. It is contradicting, isnt it?</p>
              <p>In order for a country to qualify as a police state, there should be clear evidence in practices which violate privacy, freedom, personal space and rights and not about records keeping for  monetary transactions, criminal records ect. These are absolutely needed for society to function.</p>

              <p>The post author suggests that any evidence can be twisted, but it is not possible unless law and justice is being abused by corrupt people out to get u . if u can show that the evidence is not biased towards propagating a theory about someone. IT happens when a innocent person gets implicated in a crime he didnt do and circumstantial evidence is strong enough to do him in.</p>
              <p>But circumstantial evidence need to be proven through medical forensic evidence like DNA or other visual evidence ( if there is a CCTV in the crime scene) . For example if u are accused of a crime u did not commit but because u were there at the crime scene and a CCTV is present, u can easily prove your innocence. if else u can use another CCTV evidence to show that u were not at the crime scene but some place elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Evidence twisting wil not work in many circumstances if u are innocent and have not committed a crime because u did not physically commit the crime  in the first place.</p>

              They can snoop on people's mind and heart to know exactly what each of us is thinking and feeling atm. Back then I was terrified to learn that. Now that I know more it's nothing special actually. The Soviet used it then the American too first the CIA then the FBI. There's a rumor circulating that back during cold war era the Soviet spy managed to read a closed higly classified document which was put on the desk of a senior official inside a government building.

               You know a thin man if given a Malay dress and a head scarf could look like an old lady at night. And a car if set properly could hit a man on the road because it's not giving away a telling engine sound. Traffic light could possibly be arranged too if needed. Cellphone taping that's a sure bet when they want it and has zeroed in on a person. Internet? you bet. Even making your PC to crash from time to time if you manage to get them pissed which is always good. And people would suspect a person less when that person is with a child or children or with his or her family. Of course I have no proof but those are my suspicions from my past experience.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Fishing, when i was young, my Uncle Andrew (at that time very handsome and fine) brought me to Singapore River. He told me last time the river was so flirty that no fish can survive but after clearing up, there is alot of fishes, so he threw his baits consist of sotong shrimp, rice, chicken liver, ikan bilis etc etc into a spot withno rod, no line or hook, just threw it on the same spot for about 4 hrs. Then we went home, i cried because i find it not interesting and no fish. Then the second day, he bring all his rods, same kind of baits and we went to the same spot to fish, we caught so many fish that even the nearby anglers was surprised because they fish overnite and get nothing. So in jealousy, they cast their line over our spot, but that was 4 hrs later, so we go home with our fishes...i was so happy and proud of my Uncle Andrew.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The morale of the real incident above is the same case as Mas, he is the bait set up to lure his accomplices into the picture from both side of the island. He was set to leave ISD within a 4 hours frame, after that, all security will be deployed to hunt him down. He is just a bait.</p>

              nope. it just proved what an idiot you are in posting stuff that are obviously false since the person in question, the gary is still around and did not "magically disappear". and that his blog is still running and not "magically disappear".
              
              It's like, how stupid one must be to think that he is important enough for some other guy to waste effort to monitor you. you think you are what, why waste time on a small fry like you?
