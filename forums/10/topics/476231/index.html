              <p>Hi all, </p>
              <p>I believe someone has posted with regards to our Government's level of preparedness when it comes to crisis situations. </p>
              <p>First, we had to deal with the haze - a yearly occurence that should already have protocols set in case the worst happens, which it did this year. Instead, all we had was a pretty inept handling of the situation, with agencies waiting for direction, instead of being pro-active and having a set of pre-established protocols that could have just been executed. </p>
              <p>Then, we had all the train breakdowns, transport woes, and even a batch of our NSFs getting poisoned in Pulau Tekong alone! </p>
              <p>It seems to me that our highly paid Governemnt, does not have the foresight to plan ahead, although they always claim that they do. I shudder to think what would happen if something major actually struck our country. </p>
              <p>I strongly feel that our Government is not up to scratch on its readiness to deal with crisis, with all departmnets not wiling to stand up and be counted. Instead, they are just content to kick the issue around until it gets blown over. </p>

              Again, if u think u can be a government, why not be a government instead? Rather than just posting here. Well, I kinda agree with ur words.

              are you able to do a better job or do you have anyone in mind whom you think can do a better job?  the scenarios that you mentioned were all unforeseen.  can anyone foresee that the haze could reach 400 PSI?  could anyone foresee that there will be food poisoning at Tekong?  could anyone foresee that the MRT will break down?
              
              the Government is formed by human beings and there is a limit as to what they can do with regard to future contingencies.
              
              at least they put in plans for the continued growth of the economy so that you and I have a job and we have the luxury to write in the forum here...else we will be working in other countries as migrant workers!

              I don;t support any party...I just support results that I can see.  Instead of focussing on the negatives, why we can't also look at the positives?
              
              I don;t gain anything for posting positive comments about any political party anyway....so I don;t get your reasoning that I am plp...
              
              whether I am talking crap is a matter of opinion....I can also say you are talking crap.
