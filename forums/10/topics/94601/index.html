            <div class='col-md body'>At last Indonesia has accepted democracy. Its people will now have hopes of progress even though the road may be long and full of uncertainties.<br><br>Politicians will be brought under control of scrutiny under democratic system. Corruptions and nepotism in the long term will be minimized and checked.<br><br>The best leaders elected under universal one-man one vote system will have to work towards satifying people's needs and aspirations. If they are not good enough, they will be thrown out in the next election.<br><br>Under democratic system, where basic principles and good practices like the 7 points posted in "definition of true democracy" no one will be able tamper with the voting or election processes, and there will be no necessity to justify individualism or social theories or marshaling the armies to control unrest, dissenting views or opinions arising out of inefficiencies or problems. People will at the end decide who are the real leaders they want to lead their countries instead of allowing the leaders to presume themselves on the people based on all kinds of assumptions or justifications   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Many of them are comparing the time of suharto and post suharto era. Past few years of "democracy" had not given them better lives, in fact, lives were worse. Now they just want a strong leader, get rid of the terrorists, give everybody a job, corruption? unless the wealth of the country has already been given to the people, taking money from the country means nothing to the people!! Corruption will gradually disappear with the appearance of democracy? The Indonesians don't believe that, do you?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

USSR suffered from the same fate as those other systems run by a few leaders who are other than popularly or fairly elected.<br><br>All the fears expressed about democratisation are unreal and unproven. China can gradually open up to become democratic eventually to avoid "bright sunshine" hitting the sensitive eyes of people shrouded in darkness as you have described. So, there you are, in the same manner, Iraq will eventually benefit from democracy. The outburst against democracy appears to be unsubstantiated in facts and history.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

USSR suffered from the same fate as those other systems run by a few leaders who are other than popularly or fairly elected.<br><br>All the fears expressed about democratisation are unreal and unproven. China can gradually open up to become democratic eventually to avoid "bright sunshine" hitting the sensitive eyes of people shrouded in darkness as you have described. So, there you are, in the same manner, Iraq will eventually benefit from democracy. The outburst against democracy appears to be unsubstantiated in facts and history.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>It is clear in history that USSR came under the dictatorship of Lenin, stalin, Khrushchev.. and the communists since 1918. There is no question that communism practises centrally planned and controlled economy. But the collapse of USSR was the result of the breaking away of the republics, all declaring independence. Whether or not all are practising the "true democracy" or not I don't know, but the lives in the various republics, including Russia, have not seen any improvement.<br>It is obvious that situation in China is completely different from that in Iraq, they have also taken completely different route to where they are today, I therefore do not see how you conclude that  "in the same manner, Iraq will eventually benefit from democracy."  I certainly hope that peace will eventually come to Iraq, but in the meantime, when this "true american democracy" is being introduced, the innocent Iraqis are dying everyday, along with some US GI. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  :</div>
