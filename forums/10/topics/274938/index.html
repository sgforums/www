Perhaps the solution is in the old fashion but still fashionable way of using carrots without the stick since the latter doesn't work. Pay them well. Greed works most of the time, even for the large majority of people in affluent societies," he said.<br><br>In recent years, even the best-paying firms in Singapore are seeing their young lawyers jumping ship to Hong Kong, where salaries for junior lawyers start at about S$11,650 a month.<br><br>In contrast, the big firms in Singapore pay junior lawyers just over $4,000.<br><br>A second law school has been established at the Singapore Management University.<br><br>Also, the NUS Law Faculty has increased its intake and firms are now allowed to hire foreign lawyers.<br><br>But the shortage has not eased yet.<br></blockquote>Aiyah, why need something so complicated as higher pay to keep new lawyers?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Do the tried and tested method we already use for our DOCTORS!<br><br>Just increase the NUS school fees to $120,000 per year, and BOND THOSE LAWYERS for 5 years la! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br>It works for doctors, don't see why it won't work for lawyers.<br><br>Still not enough lawyers?<br>Nevermind lah!

A property manager with vast professional practical experiences outside is paid only S$3,500-$5,000 pm while a principal estate officer is getting more than $15,000.00 pm for paper work and following instructions from head office.<br><br>Experienced litigation lawyer could hardly earn $100,000.00 pm as those earned by the judicial commissioners who did not even have experiences with litigations.<br><br>A specialist gynae doctor did not get as much as S$20,000.00 pm earned by specialist consultant in the government hospital.<br><br>If a salary survey is to be conducted by an independent agency, based on objective apple-to-apple criteria it will be found that similar jobs in government from teacher to nurse to doctor and lawyer within the government are always paid more - in fact much more than counter-part in the private sector.<br><br>Will the government refund the over-payment of salaries to ministers received over the years due to wrongful or dishonest benchmarking like being done for the ministers recently which were already widely exposed as fraudulent by the people just like NKF.</div>
