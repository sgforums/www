              <p>FUGITIVE terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari probably planned his escape over
              a period of time and seized the opportunity when a 'confluence' of
              factors gave him the break to flee from the Whitley Road detention
              centre on Feb 27, said Home Affairs minister Wong Kan Seng on Monday.<br> <br> He gave Parliament a full account of the escape, based on the findings
              of the Committee of Inquiry (COI), which submitted its report to him on
              April 10.<br> <br> The five-page executive summary of the report was also presented in Parliament.<br> <br> The COI, said Mr Wong, had found 'no evidence of connivance or
              collusion' or any help given to the Jemaah Islamiah leader by anyone
              within the detention centre.<br> <br> It took the Jemaah Islamiah leader under 11 minutes between 3.54 pm and
              4.05 pm to make his escape - from the time he was brought to the toilet
              in the family visitation block and the time when the alert to his
              breakout was raised.<br> <br> RELATED LINKS<br> Ministerial Statement<br> ExecutiveSummary<br> Mr Wong said he agreed with the COI's findings and accepted all its recommendations.<br> <br> He added that he was satisfied that the three-member committee had done a thorough job.<br> <br> Because of the sensitivity of the details, including the identity of
              the Internal Security Department and other security personnel and the
              precise work they do, he said the Cabinet has agreed that it is not
              possible to release the entire report 'without harming national
              interest and endangering the men and women who serve the nation'.<br> <br> 'We had also considered releasing the COI's report with the sensitive
              parts blacked out, but that was not feasible as the details are
              extensive. It would not only make understanding the report difficult,
              but also fuel the distraction of baseless speculation,' said the
              minister.<br> <br> 'However, we are very conscious that Members of this House and the
              public have a keen and valid interest in the findings of the COI.
              Hence, the Government has decided to release the executive summary of
              the COI report to show that the COI had carefully considered all the
              issues.'</p>

              <p>yes, heard it over the radio while driving home a short while ago, and we are no closer to the truth. for a maximum security joint, the laxes they described are amateurish to say the least.</p>

The family visit was to take place in an assigned</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">Family Visit Room, in a Family Visitation Block, at WRDC. As part

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">family visit routine, Mas Selamat was escorted by two Gurkha

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">(“GC”) guards and a WRDC Special Duty Operative (“SDO”) to a

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">clothes. Mas Selamat was then escorted to a toilet located next to
              the Family</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">Visit Room to shave and comb his hair as part of the family visit
              routine. After</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">entering the urinal cubicle inside the toilet, Mas Selamat closed
              the urinal</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">cubicle door. He flipped a pair of greenish-grey pants that he was
              wearing over</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">the concrete ledge above the urinal cubicle door, and turned on
              the water tap</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">inside this cubicle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: blue;">4. </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">The COI believes that while
              inside the urinal cubicle, Mas Selamat climbed</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">onto the ledge located just below the ventilation window, pushed
              open the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">ventilation window and squeezed himself through it. To help his
              descent, he</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">probably held on to a water pipe running vertically down the
              external wall of</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">the toilet. The COI received forensic evidence from </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">CID</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;"> that
              smudges were</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">found on the water pipe, although there were no conclusive
              fingerprints. A</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">packet of 7 rolls of toilet paper was found on the ground adjacent
              to the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">external wall, which he could have used to break his fall when he
              descended.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: blue;">5. </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">Having climbed down the water
              pipe, Mas Selamat was on the ground at the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">rear of the Family Visitation Block. There is no conclusive
              evidence of the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">exact route Mas Selamat took to escape. However, the COI’s view is
              that Mas</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">Selamat was likely to have used a route 20 metres to the right of
              the ventilation</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">window [as one faces the perimeter fences from the ventilation
              window]. This</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">is where the inner and outer perimeter fences converged with the
              enclosed</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">staircase and walkway. Mas Selamat would have scaled the fence,
              climbed</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">onto the roof of the enclosed staircase and walkway, and jumped
              over the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">3</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">converged perimeter fences. In a re-enactment requested by the
              COI, a GC</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">guard took 49 seconds to climb out of the ventilation window in
              the urinal</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">cubicle, scale the fence, climb onto the roof of the enclosed
              staircase and</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">walkway, and jump over the converged perimeter fences.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: blue;">6. </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">The COI did not make any findings
              as to the route Mas Selamat took after</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">jumping over the converged perimeter fences. Pinpointing a
              specific route</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">would have been speculative, given the many possibilities and the
              lack of</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">evidence on this issue. Nonetheless, the COI asked for a
              re-enactment of the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">shortest and most direct route from outside the converged fences
              to the Pan</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">Island Expressway. This attempt was made by a young investigation
              officer</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">and it took him 2 minutes 44 seconds to do so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: blue;">7. </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">The COI believes that the 11
              minutes between </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">3:54pm</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">4:05pm</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;"> would have</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">provided Mas Selamat with ample time to make good his escape from

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">he entered the toilet. This is notwithstanding the fact that Mas
              Selamat is older</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">and less fit than the GC guard and the young investigation officer
              who had</span></p>

              was able to escape because of the confluence</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">of a number of factors. These were:</span></p>

              Selamat did not stop Mas Selamat from</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">providing Mas Selamat more time to make good his escape:</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">believes that Mas Selamat must have been wearing at least two
              layers of</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">clothing when he emerged from the Locker Room; and</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">Block would have provided him with the opportunity to plan his

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">was evidence that Mas Selamat was testing the reaction of the GC
              guards by</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">closing the urinal cubicle door on previous occasions. This would

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">survey the rear of the Family Visitation Block. The COI is also of
              the view that</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">by the time Mas Selamat was brought out of his cell on </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">27 Feb 2008</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">, he had</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">intended to escape that day because he wore his WRDC-issued attire
              under his</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">civilian clothes when he emerged from the Locker Room. However,
              had the</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">confluence of factors not occurred on </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">27 Feb 2008</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">, Mas Selamat would</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">probably have deferred putting his escape plan into action. Hence
              the COI</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">believes that Mas Selamat had pre-planned his escape over a period
              of time and</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">seized the opportunity provided him by the confluence of a number
              of factors</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">at the material time.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">detainees are generally sound. Detainees are secured in individual
              cells to</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">prevent them from communicating with one another. Different blocks
              are</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">linked via enclosed walkways to prevent detainees from
              familiarising</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">themselves with the layout of WRDC. Access within and across
              blocks is</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">tightly controlled to prevent detainees from escaping. When a
              detainee moves</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">within the WRDC compound, he is escorted by at least two GC
              guards, and his</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">movements are logged. The overall guard to detainee ratio in WRDC
              is much</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">higher than that in a Prisons facility to ensure tight security.
              GC guards are also</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times-Roman; color: black;">rotated regularly. This also prevents familiarity with detainees.</span></p>

              <p>"The COI also notes that the CCTV coverage of the area was in the midst of being upgraded to add motion-detectors. This was part of a major CCTV security surveillance system upgrade for the whole complex. At the time of the escape, there were two CCTV cameras mounted at the location where Mas Selamat climbed out of the Family Visitation Block. However, these camera were not commissioned yet as they were part of the CCTV upgrading and the system was still in its testing and validation stage. As such, at the time of the incident, there were no recording or active monitoring of these cameras. This is very unfortunate because if there had been operational cameras in the right places to record the escape, then we could have an idea as to how he got out of the WRC"</p>

              <p>correct. this is mere excuses. no way will such centre will allow a gap or lapse in recording. even if it is being upgraded or something, there will be cover. all the more WKS need to take the rap.</p>
              <p>he accepts the findings, so what's next? still no accountability from the woosie.</p>
