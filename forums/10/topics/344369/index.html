              <p>I'm pretty sure many shares the same sentiments about the tax dollars.</p>
              <p>If it be in my hands.. I will make sure it is an open book. Anyone who is willing to spend the effort time ,will have access to it . </p>
              <p>Doubts shall be clarified and spendings accounted for.</p>
              <p>"If I have nothing to hide.. why hide ?"</p>
              <p>The more one says " You must trust me".. the more that person cannot be trusted.</p>

              <p>The man in the medical industry would feel that the money should be invested in the medical industries, the engineer would feel it's better spent on electrical networks and reservoirs and the social worker would want the money spent on welfare..etc.</p>
              <p>And months could be spent with each side preparing detailed reports and presentations, with months more spent on deliberating which is the best cause of action because all sides wouldn't make a plead if it wasn't really valid.</p>
              <p>Not to say your logic is wrong but it's a huge can of worms when you try to open it up. If you're schooled in a particular field of course you're going to feel it would be better spent in your field. So actual implementation might not equal to increased efficiency or effectiveness.</p>

              <p>this financial crisis from USA is fast becoming a world recession if not a depression. i hope singapore govt can come out with a more heavy hand to deal with this crisis. tax dollars should be better spent on necessary projects and help needy family. we should cut back on defence budget for 2009 and and unnecessary govt spending such as LTA building more ERP gantries and trying more and mroe stupid gagets that fail more than it succeed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think singapore ASAF has mroe than enough ammo to deal with immediate threat even though we cut their budget.</p>

              <p>U see the NDP fireworks or not?? New year day fireworks or not?? there goes part of our extra taxes lor, so those who cheered those fireworks are happy about their taxes gone in the air...Since the country is in recession, why get fireworks again, millions are burnt in air and vapourised, why not use those money to help the poors and the unfortunate instead of presenting it in a form of firework just to please those wearing white trousers and shirts sitting comfortably in the best view circle seats.</p>

              <p>Agree ... Even more so when its hard to validate on potential investments where the ROI is based on projections. For those who do not believe on those projections will want to money to be spend on immediate needs and working on immediate needs is not a long term solution. </p>
