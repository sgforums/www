Bt Panjang ?<br>Airport ?<br>Port ?<br>Court ? Parliament ?<br>Highway ?<br>Shopping centre ?<br>My family ?<br>Our way of life ?<br>Our system of government ?<br>Our dignity ?<br>No alternate route of subsistence ?<br><br>If my parents are no longer here and many of my friends have moved away for work or overseas living, what is there left for me to defend ? My HDB flat ? My car ? I am globally mobile. It just occured to me to ask this question after hearing the speech on Pedra Branca. Yes, sovereignity is important. Yes, space and depth are important. Yes, we should not be intimidated by those who are less effective than us. But whatelse is there to portend for me so vital that my life is worth sacrificing. And will the war planners and the scholar-generals be with me at the front-line ? Are there heroes out there that I can follow their path to keep my nation free. Can I trust them ? Can anyone give me a good reasoning or considered opinion or convincing argument ? I guess Singapore as much as each of us are at a crossroad and at soul-searching.<br><br>ive got tis frm the CNA forum....ive done my reply as Eddie79<br>2 words...SCREW HIM!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I reckon is, most Officers are chosen in BMT due to their ability to communicate with their fellow recruits, and that lots of recruits look up to them. SAF sees that as a key criteria because the moment your men starts giving you nonsense, that is the point failure is inevitable.<br><br>However the thing is, your men may look up to you with the upmost respect, but at the end of the day, if you don't have the skill or tactics, group 40 men will be dead in seconds in times of war.<br><br>Specialist on the other hand, have the most experience. Though lower rank than an Officer, they are Commanders after all.<br><br>I always believe while the Specialist or Warrant Officers are in the mud training with their men, Officers are there drinking wine... watching tv, doing paper work.<br><br>Makes a whole lot difference.</div>
