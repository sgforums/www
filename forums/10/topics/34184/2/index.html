Though lower rank than an Officer, they are Commanders after all.<br><br>I always believe while the Specialist or Warrant Officers are in the mud training with their men, Officers are there drinking wine... watching tv, doing paper work.<br><br>Makes a whole lot difference.</div></blockquote>Candidates are selected not just simply on communicative skills alone.<br><br>Most candidates are already targetted from the large cohorts of "A" Levels and Poly certified Guys, whose academic qualifications, and psychological, mental and physical aptitudes tests during the initial Manpower Base Check-ups are already determined.<br><br>It is during BMT, that those initial observations are put to the tests, and the results collected will confirm if those observations of potential candidates are correct or otherwise.<br><br>Most "A" Levels and "Poly" Grads who make it through at the Manpower Interviews and Check-Ups, and also get through BMT, would probably be selected based on the EXPECTATIONS that they will have some modest or above average portions of INTELLIGENCE, Determination, Character, Discipline, Ingenuity, Resourcefulness, Physical Condition, Positive Mental State, and other Quality Factors.<br><br>An Officer will be someone who will have the ability to handle several assignments at the same time, and the mental aptitude to handle the stress of MULTI-Tasking Work and Responsbilities all at the same time.<br><br>This is a Multi-Dimension world, where events pressed in together all at the same time, to demand the full and immediate attention and energy of an individual.<br><br>Any Commander, be it as OFFICER or a Specialist Commander, must be able to stand up to such an IMPOSED Demand of his character, physical and mental state, and he will need his intelligence, organisational skills, ingenuity, resourcefulness, and determination to get these multi-challenges accomplished.<br><br>The SAF has created opportunities for the Specialist Warrant Officers, who would have attained such a stature serving in the SAF for at least 10 or more years.<br><br>A Lieutenant or even a Captain, would have reached their ranks in a matter of only Two or Five Years respectively.<br><br>There are differing human resources required of each rank, and for the differing tasks at hand.<br><br>In a Business Corporation, if a Storeman can perform the tasks better than a CEO of a Company, and can prove his ability to do so, WHY NOT..?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>still if you want to compare btw the Specs and the officers, there will be a whole lot of difference....<br>have u seen a warrant officer get scolding from an officer so loud that everyone in the whole company can hear... I did!<br><br>Even if the warrant did something wrong, he shouldn't be scold like that! At least, the officer (this officer is a proud, selfish, heartless towards the men) could do is to bring him to a room 'correct' his mistake not to scold him so loud in front of the whole company!<br><br>Officers will always have the final say, specs don't,even if their suggestion is much better than the officers!<br><br>Sometimes, officers even use the specs' ideas and said it was theirs! No use talking to them as u will be 'marked' and suffered for the rest of your days in the SAF!<br><br>I'm not saying that all officers are like that but u can't deny the facts that there are 'black' sheeps in them as I've seen, experience, suffered under them!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
