              <p>My vote goes to WP.</p>
              <p>My friend who is living in Hougang for more than 10 years praised WP MP Low for his good job despite the tight budget.</p>
              <p>He mentioned he will not choose PAP just because of the upgrading.</p>

              <p>Hougang is pretty well developed for an opposition zone fo countrol...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I would rank SDP as the party who mismanage their resources.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say what you want SDP supporters, but a opposition that has 3 seats in the parliment losing all of their seats, damaging their reputation, and the reputation of the oppositon in singapore can only be said to be mismanagement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SDP fails to understand that in certain ways, a political party is like a bussiness...idealism will not work in politics, unless it is extremism in a very harsh environment.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I think you guys actually need to find out more about the weakness and strength of the opposition parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Opp supporters praise the opp like they are perfect, the PAP supporters praise the PAP like they are perfect..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, singaporean's mindset on politics is sooo damn simplistic. We might as well call the democracy here in sinapore <strong>mob</strong>ocracy....</p>

              <p>Resources can also mean public funds.</p>
              <p>There is no competition between a non-fund manager vs a fund manager when it comes to managing resources like public funds.</p>
              <p>Fund managers are the ones who really knows what to invest as they are the experts or specialists in this field. I do not think non-fund managers should make investment decisions.</p>

              <p>Is this thread an exercise in fantasy, and/or furthering self-congratulatory efforts ?</p>
              <p>In the first place, how do you intend to measure the efficiency of managing resources well ?</p>
              <p>What is the standard to determine if the resources are well managed ?</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that all start from an equal basis - with equal amount of cash resources that are allocated according to the head count in each constituency ?</p>
              <p>Or are you referring to the management of the Financial Resources of Party Funds - considering that your comments have referred to the SDP, which has no constituency to manage ?</p>
              <p>In this case, are you being realistic with your efforts at probing the efficiency of political parties managing their resources well ?</p>
              <p>Given the poor political climate in Singapore, where supporters of the Alternative Parties are marked out for "special administrative treatment", can any political parties survive other then the Ruling Political Party ?</p>
              <p>Contributors that give "big financial donations" to any Alternative Political Parties will risk being investigated by IRAS for special tax audits; while the same harrassing treatment is not made towards contributors of any amounts to the Ruling Party.</p>
              <p>With the limited resources that is available to the political parties, would you consider the mileage that each political party can get per dollar spent to achieve the political agenda set forth by the political party ?</p>
              <p>With different political agendas for different political parties - how do you propose to have a common standard of measure ?</p>
              <p>If based on the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">criteria of impact achieved</span></em> in the <strong>publicity of political education</strong> - surely the SDP will clearly have made a bigger impact at educating the ordinary Singaporeans to be aware of the present situation that they are caught in ?</p>
              <p>By the <em>same standard of measure</em>, the PAP also has its <strong>publicity of political education</strong> - have you considered what is its political agenda and the content of its political education ?</p>
              <p>With regards to the other Alternative Political Parties such as the WP</p>
