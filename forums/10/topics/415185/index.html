              <p>I
                   like to thank the NUS Students’ Political Association for this 
                  invitation. Distinguished guests, NUS students and members, a very good 
                  evening.</p>
              <p>I like to share some of my encounters during my walkabouts.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>He was a man aged 45. He said that it was hard to keep pace with the
                   rising cost of living. He was visibly upset when he spoke about the 
                  large number of foreigners in Singapore and felt that they are replacing
                   locally bred Singaporeans. I asked him how many children he has. He 
                  replied “how can I afford?”.</li>
              <li>In another encounter, a man in his 40s whose HDB flat is in arrears 
                  asked me if he could pawn his HDB flat. He is ill and unable to work. He
                   needs the money. But he is unable to sell the flat as he has yet to 
                  meet the minimum number of years of residence required.</li>
              <li>Recently, there was a woman who asked me: “Why are you doing this – 
                  you are doing well and this country is so wonderful and has given you so
                   much, why are you opposing the government?”</li>
              <li>Because it is not enough.  It is not enough that I am doing well 
                  when I can see others not doing quite so well.  Many of you here will 
                  probably obtain your 5Cs or have already done so. Does it mean then that
                   you should just keep quiet if something that is happening in this 
                  country does not seem to be right? We have helped a homeless pregnant 
                  woman living in a tent in Sembawang Park, together with her 2 boys. Till
                   now, I still find it hard to believe this happened in Singapore. It is 
                  exactly because this country has given all of us opportunity, we owe it 
                  to this country to ensure that we do the right thing and give back.</li>
              <li>Some of the issues encountered by the Singaporeans that I mentioned 
                  seem to be a consequence of their own actions. This is not the case. 
                  Policies are the invisible hands that affect the lives of ordinary 
                  Singaporeans. If ill conceived, they have significant impact downstream.
                   I believe the current policy of focusing on GDP growth above all else 
                  is a mistake, one that yields apparent results in the short term but 
                  brings along long term pain.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Adopting the strategy of the importing labour to increase the GDP growth creates a vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>By massive labour import over the last few years, it leads to higher 
                  demand for good, services and housing resulting in higher cost of 
                  living, and greater competition for jobs. Local men would also be 
                  disadvantaged by National Service.</p>
              <p>The unintended consequence of such action leads to diminishing 
                  confidence of their citizens for their future and reduces the value of 
                  citizenship.</p>
              <p>Some PRs whom I spoke to do not want to convert to citizenship, as 
                  they do not feel that the difference between citizens and PRs are sharp 
                  enough. They think that this is a good place to make money, and they are
                   certain of their future when they return home to their motherland. They
                   also feel that this is a good place for their children’s education and 
                  Singapore is a good springboard to other developed countries like 
                  Australia and US.</p>
              <p><a href="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-418" title="NUSPASlide1" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide11.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=616" alt="" width="1024" height="616"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>Vicious Cycle due to Strategy of Labour Import to increase GDP</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <div style="text-align: left;">The outcome of this strategy is a 
                  2-Singapore. One for the haves; the other for the have-nots. Is this the
                   country we want? A divisive society. What happens to the promise of 
                  building an “Inclusive Society”?</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div style="text-align: left;">Statistically, there is a significant 
                  increase in foreign labour input in the last few years specifically from
                   2007-2009 to spur the growth of GDP. This has invariably resulted in 
                  the increase of the cost of living. Let me highlight some examples.<strong> </strong></div>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>From 2006-08: Electricity Tariff increases by 23%<br> </strong><strong>Hospitalisation Cost increases by 13.5%</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“As of Oct 2008, 8% of 420,000 HDB Households with outstanding loans defaulted.”</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“Findings indicate that
                   Singapore’s bottom 10 per cent was the hardest hit. 2009 was a rough 
                  year for all. Each member of the poorest group of households got a 
                  monthly income of S$334, down from S$340 in 2008.<br> In real terms, the average income per household member among employed households fell by 3.5 per cent.” </strong></span></li>
              </ol> 
              <ul>
              <li>Would all the policy makers one day come from one Singapore who may 
                  no longer understand issues face by Singaporeans living in the other 
                  Singapore?</li>
              </ul>
              <p><a href="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-423" title="NUSPAslide2" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide21.jpg?w=640&amp;h=452" alt="" width="640" height="452"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Making of a 2-Singapore</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">We also fail to put in adequate infrastructure development to cope with the significant increase in our population.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">While total number of passengers increases 
                  by 20% from 2006 to 2008, the total Train Kilometre operated by train 
                  companies increases only by 8.8%.</p>
              </li>
              <li>While total number of vehicles grows by 12% and total number of cars
                   grows by 16% from 2006 to 2008, the public road increases by a mere 
                  1.9%.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>How about the middle class? They are sandwiched. Let us take a look at some graphs<br> <a href="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-425" title="NUSPASlide3" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide31.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=696" alt="" width="1024" height="696"></a></p>
              <ol>
              <li>The blue line represents the Resale Price Index, the red line Median
                   Household Income. The base years have been changed in order to clearly 
                  understand the impact of the rising prices of HDB flats, and their 
                  impact on Singaporeans. By altering the different base years, one can 
                  better appreciate the significant increase in the resale price of HDB, 
                  specifically when the base year is 2006. By looking at the graph with 
                  Base Year 2006, the increase in Median Household Income has clearly not 
                  been able to keep pace with the gain in HDB Resale Price.</li>
              <li>What this means is that the middle class would have to work harder 
                  to earn more to pay for their housing, while spending less and saving 
                  less for their retirement.</li>
              <li>With rising housing prices, domestic consumption by the 
                  middle-income group would also be put under pressure. China is focusing 
                  on increasing its domestic consumption to move away from their heavy 
                  reliance on export to drive the economy.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Median Household Income</h3>
              <p>Our liberal labour policy in support of GDP growth has resulted in the following consequences:<a href="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437" title="NUSPASlide4" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide4.jpg?w=640&amp;h=338" alt="" width="640" height="338"></a>The
                   policy of GDP growth by labour input has created this entire list of 
                  immediate problems. Is this policy being short term? Are we feasting 
                  today so that there will be a famine tomorrow?</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Has this solve our ability to increase our Total Fertility Rate 
                  (TFR) in the long run? Our TFR is below 1.3. We need a TFR of 2.1 just 
                  to replace ourselves.</li>
              <li>Singapore is a small island; there is a limit to which how much we can grow our population.</li>
              <li>After our population hits 6.5 million, then what’s next? What if we still have a dismal productivity growth?</li>
              <li>Are we building a nation – a place where we can be proud of, or just
                   a strip of land where people can be here to make money and with the 
                  intention to leave?</li>
              <li>Maybe we can do a survey later to ask you whether do you feel like leaving this country.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We do have an alternative model.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>It starts with leadership. Look at the last financial crisis in USA.
                   They have the best minds and brains in their banks, in Wall Street. But
                   the system is weak; it is non-transparent with little accountability. 
                  So getting the best minds and brains, and then trusting them is not good
                   enough. Pegging the entire reward system of the ministers to a single 
                  KPI: GDP growth is a systemic risk to the nation in the long run. A 
                  summary of the policies are in the next 4 slides.<a href="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429" title="NUSPASlide5" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide5.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=478" alt="" width="1024" height="478"></a><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-430" title="NUSPASlide6" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide6.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=561" alt="" width="1024" height="561"><br> <a href="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-431" title="NUSPASlide7" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide7.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=534" alt="" width="1024" height="534"></a></li>
              </ul>
              <h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-432" title="NUSPASlide8" src="http://votingrp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/nuspaslide8.jpg?w=640&amp;h=312" alt="" width="640" height="312"></h3>
              <p>Finally, in the late 1960s, Singapore’s government saw rapid 
                  population growth as a threat to living standards and political 
                  stability, as large numbers of children and young people threatened to 
                  overwhelm the schools, the medical services, and the ability of the 
                  economy to generate employment for them. The policy of “Boy or Girl – 2 
                  is enough” is implemented as part of the family planning.</p>
              <p>It was hailed as a success as Singapore’s TFR plunges from a high of 4.66 in 1965 to 2.1 in 1975</p>
              <h3>Policy cannot be short term at this stage of Singapore’s 
                  development. The world is undergoing massive changes. We cannot afford 
                  to bank on policies that will bring us short-term benefits, while 
                  leaving future generations to pay for the mistakes they did not make.</h3>

              <p>I
               have been in politics for coming to ~1.5 years. A very short time. I 
              have so much to learn, and from so many different people: reporters, 
              activists, politicians and veterans, friends (do not ever believe that 
              Singaporeans are apolitical; you get them started on policies and you 
              will not get your chance to say anything) and our younger Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I do not know where this road will lead to. I just know 
              what I am doing is giving me meaning to live, and there are many people 
              whom I have met, who are doing this so that tomorrow can be better for 
              many other people. Amongst these people are many members of our younger 
              generation who are standing up and fighting for their beliefs. They do 
              not get a penny for doing this.</p>
              <p>Think about the homeless (“There are no homeless in Singapore, just 
              Happy Campers”; 
              http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=243022663629&amp;ref=ts).</p>
              <p>Think about Vui Kong (“We believe in 2nd Chances”; visit 
              http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/We-Believe-In-Second-Chances/121781017872484?ref=ts).</p>
              <p>Think about YOG critics (one of the most interesting argument I heard
               from a young volunteer is why should volunteers not get better food for
               public service rendered, just like how our leaders demand for million 
              dollar salaries to serve the people).</p>
              <p><strong>I am gravitated to the young people. There is hope. Give more credits
               to our young people than what some of us think. They are quick to point
               out your flaws and see beyond your facade – knowing whether you are 
              “genuine” or worth your salt.</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore is definitely not ready for leapfrogging in terms of 
              political freedom now. Our people and our institutions may not be ready.
               There is much work to be done. It has to start now with the young 
              Singaporeans. As a voter, I am convinced we need change, to realize the 
              vision of an inclusive society, a transparent and an accountable 
              government.</p>
              <p><strong>Deep in my heart, the young people gives me the reason to do this.  
              After more than 1 year, this is the main reason I am doing this. That is
               why I am working towards building a platform for our young people to be
               involved in politics.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>- This platform should allow young people who can step forward to 
              join any political parties, and offer yourself as a candidate not for 
              money or power but for the pure desire of wanting to make contributions 
              to ordinary people.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>- This platform ensures that politics is not just meant for those in power and the incumbents.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>- This platform would require office holders to be questioned, and 
              challenged by anyone, including ordinary citizen, to hold them 
              accountable.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>- This platform would require the office holders to change from an 
              approach of “I say you do” to “let us discuss and let us do together”.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>- This platform would allow our young phoenix to rise from the ashes,
               without fear or prejudice, when the calling comes for them to serve.</strong></p>
              <p>It was the last generation of Singaporeans who have laid the 
              foundation in place for the success of my generation. I believe I should
               contribute and do whatever I can, in my limited capacity, to ensure 
              that a platform is there for the next group of future leaders to stand 
              up, and for Singaporeans to truly have their voices heard, and casting 
              their votes purely based on their agreements or disagreements with 
              policies.</p>
              <p>We need our young leaders to stand up. I know they are amongst us. Do
               not be made to believe that you need the experience and you need to be 
              earning million of dollars before you can take part in politics. The 
              first batch of Singapore leaders comprises of union leaders, teachers 
              and postmen. Few of them have any experience in politics and running the
               country. And they have laid important foundations to grow a successful 
              Singapore. We need another group of trailblazers – willing to listen, 
              constantly working on the ground, and prepared to make a difference to 
              the people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The world has changed. Singapore has changed. Our young people are 
              more educated, well read and discerning. None of the leaders now may be 
              around in leadership position 15-20 years from now. The younger 
              generation is all we have. What must we do to allow their voices and 
              ideas to be heard? Young people need greater political freedom, freedom 
              of developing their potentials and expressing their thinking.</p>
              <p>I hope you would help spread this message of change. To tell young 
              Singaporeans why this is important. It is about you. We depend on you.  
              You and your peers will change and will lead Singapore.  You will chart 
              the destiny of this nation and our people.  Together your voices and our
               voices must start to bring change so that the power will sit with you 
              when the time comes for your generation to lead the country.</p>
              <p><strong>For the young people of Singapore,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Your voices today are for our future.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Your one voice will change our future.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Your one vote will decide our future.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Because you are our future.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
