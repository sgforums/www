It merely means that the person is self-centered.<br><br>As for why it happened, I would guess its a combination of the current trends and the relatively pampered environment they are under these days.<br><br>Then whether is it healthy or not, only time would tell. I wouldn't say its entirely bad, as strong opinions can mean resolve and passion, but on the other hand can also mean stubborness.<br><br><blockquote><br>I'm not saying it isn't good to be mature, but youths these days give me the feeling of being pseudo-mature, that is they think they are mature, but in reality, they are not.

Can you say that your thoughts aren't affected by these mediums of communication?<br><br>Humans invented the words and language to communicate to each other. The experience of others are pooled into data stores so that the rest might benefit. Along the way, it is up to each human to interpret what they saw.<br><br>So, can errornous beliefs be defined?
