I hope that in times of crisis, all Singaporeans will stand up to be counted. In the meantime, we must redouble our efforts to build up resilience in the hearts and minds of our people in this fight against terrorism. This is where the third phase of our national security efforts must focus on.</span><br><br>87% what a surprising figure? What's the sample size? Unfortunatelz it was not mentioned in the speech.<br><br>I no longer feel belonged in this country, I no longer feel our leaders understand the grounds in the heartland. I'm not sure if our leaders can rally the masses when there is a crisis.</div>
