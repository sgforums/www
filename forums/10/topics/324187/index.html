              <h1 class="clr">Dr Ong Chit Chung dies peacefully at home</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Dr Ong Chit Chung, a Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC, passed away on Monday morning. He was 59 years old.</p>
              <p>His family told Channel NewsAsia that Dr Ong was at home when he died peacefully.</p>
              <p>A
              five—term MP, Dr Ong was a lecturer in military history at the National
              University of Singapore when he went into politics in 1988.</p>
              <p>He
              won the single—seat ward of Bukit Batok for two terms before the
              constituency became part of the Bukit Timah GRC in 1996, and then
              Jurong GRC in 2001.</p>
              <p>In 1991, Dr Ong was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Labour.</p>
              <p>He
              later left the world of academia and joined the private sector. At the
              time of his death, he was President of Davos Life Sciences Pte Ltd.</p>
              <p>During
              his twenty years in politics, Dr Ong had also served as the Chairman
              for the Government Parliamentary Committees for Education, Defence and
              Foreign Affairs.</p>
              <p>In a statement to the media, Dr Ong’s family
              said they are saddened by their loss. And in memory of his service to
              the residents in his ward, they have asked that in lieu of wreathes,
              donations can be made by cheques to the PAP Community Foundation, Bukit
              Batok Branch.</p>
              <p>The wake for Dr Ong will begin on Tuesday evening at his family home at 41, Princess of Wales Road.</p>
              <p>The funeral is expected to be held this Friday. — CNA/yb/ms</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has sent his condolences to Dr Ong Chit Chung’s widow.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh said Dr Ong was talent spotted by the PAP because of his
              reputation as a military historian and his helpful nature. Dr Ong
              became a Member of Parliament in 1988 and served five terms.</p>
              <p>SM
              Goh said Dr Ong had put in "many years of sterling service" as
              Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministries of Home Affairs and Labour,
              and as chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committees of
              Education, Defence and Foreign Affairs.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh described Dr Ong as respected and well—liked by grassroots leaders and residents.</p>
              <p>"Having
              served for five terms, I am sure that he will be deeply missed by them.
              He had given the best part of his adult life in the service of
              Singapore", wrote Mr Goh. — CNA/ir</p>
