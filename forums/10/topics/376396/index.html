              <p>The detention regimes, amenities and food must be more suited for Mas Selamat Kastari in Malaysia, and he will surely have less incentive to make a run from it.</p>
              <p>With the current report that MSK claimed that he felt being dizzy most of the time, and suspected that he was drugged, it will be quite damning to know that a sem-drugged prisoner can still succeed to escape from the ISD facility.</p>

              <p>  PETALING JAYA: Jemaah Islamiah militant Mas Selamat Kastari is happier being detained in Malaysia than in Singapore, says a human rights commissioner.</p>
              <div id="story_content">
              <p>Suhakam vice-chairman Tan Sri Simon Sipaun said Mas Selamat did not have any complaint about his detention in Kamunting, Perak, where he has been held since early this year.</p>
              <p>“He said he prefers to be in Malaysia. He has no complaints of the treatment he gets here.</p>
              <p>“His only complaint is on the failure of his family to visit him. From what I understand, there is no problem as far as the Malaysian authorities are concerned.</p>
              <p>“The issue is with the Singaporean authorities,” he said when contacted yesterday.</p>
              <p>Sipaun said both him and Suha-kam commissioner Datuk N. Siva Subramaniam had met Mas Selamat, as well as the other seven detainees during their inspection of the centre on Friday.</p>
              <p>The 48-year-old militant had escaped from a maximum security detention centre in Singapore in February last year, and swam to Johor. He was arrested at his hideout in a tiny Johor village in April this year.</p>
              <p>Sipaun said Mas Selamat had told him during their meeting that he suspected he was drugged while detained in Singapore as he was constantly dizzy after meals.</p>
              <p>He said they spoke to Mas Selamat, who looked healthy, for about 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
              <p>“He was not aggressive, he was very pleasant and very polite.</p>
              <p>“In fact, we didn’t know he was Mas Selamat until we asked him where he was from. Only then did we realise it was him,” he said.</p>
              <p>“My only regret is that I forgot to ask him how he managed to escape from Singapore, as Singapore is so strict and the security there is so tight,” he said.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Siva Subramaniam said the militant should be allowed to have his day in court.</p>
              <p>“Malaysians, of course, do not support terrorists. But he should be tried in court, to see if he is indeed guilty of all the charges brought against him,” he said.</p>
