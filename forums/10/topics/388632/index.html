              <h1 style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-large;">Former SAF and PSC scholars join Reform Party</span></h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span class="time">January 20, 2010</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Two former high-flying civil servants have joined the fledging Reform Party led by economist Kenneth Jeyaretnam, the elder son of the late opposition leader Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">39 year Ms Hazel Poa was a former PSC scholar who worked for four years in the service in the 1990s. Her last-held post was that of an assistant director in the Finance Ministry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Poa graduated from the University of Cambridge with 1st Class Honours in Mathematics and is currently the Managing Director of an education company with operations in Singapore and Indonesia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">She joined the Reform Party last month, eight months after her husband, Mr Tony Tan Lay Thiam. Mr. Tony Tan graduated from the University of Cambridge with 1st Class Honours in Engineering after which he joined the SAF as an Army Officer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He is currently the CEO of a Private Education Organisation and is a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Reform Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Reform Party was founded in 2008 by the highly regarded J.B. Jeyaretnam to spear-head his lifelong dream of reforming Singapore’s archaic and repressive political system. It was taken over by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam after his demise in October 2008 from heart failure.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam graduated with a double first class honors in Economics at the prestigious Queens’ College, Cambridge University.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A victim of the autocratic ruling party himself, JBJ, as he is fondly remembered by Singaporeans, was thrown into jail once and bankrupted several times for by defamation lawsuits launched by the PAP leaders to cripple his political career.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Singapore’s octagenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew reportedly told former President Devan Nair that he would make JBJ “went on his knees and beg for mercy.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In an interview with Straits Times, the couple said they joined the Reform Party because they wanted to help foster a more balanced political landscape here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“I felt they needed more people to help. But of course, anyone joining the opposition would do it because they wanted to see certain changes in the way the Government is running the country,”</em> said Ms Poa.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Both would consider standing in future elections, if the need arose.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“If you really want to make a difference, you must be prepared to stand as a candidate. As voters, we always hope to see more options and more contest of ideas. But we cannot be waiting for somebody else to take the lead,”</em> Mr Tan added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Besides them, Mr Jeyaretnam revealed that there are two former government scholars who are currently volunteering at party events and may consider joining it as members.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Reform Party will be organizing  a seminar on the Education system in Singapore on 23 January 2010 at Berkshire School Pte Ltd. For more information, please visit its website </span><a href="http://www.thereformparty.net/index.php?option=com_jevents&amp;task=icalrepeat.detail&amp;evid=19&amp;Itemid=10&amp;year=2010&amp;month=01&amp;day=23&amp;uid=c762868b28edd6a38412ba6243f51aca&amp;lang=en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is good to see more Singaporeans stepping forward to join other political parties in Singapore which will benefit the country in the long run.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With the ruling party losing support from the people due to its ill-conceived policies, the Reform Party stands a good chance of making its mark in the next general election due by 2011.</span></p>

              Congrats to both of them.   I hope more highly educated people would join the opposition party so that we can have a good debate on important issues during election campaign.
              I also hope there would be a  balanced graduates and non-graduates in opposition party to cater for all sectors of our society.

              <p><span class="time">January 20, 2010</span></p>
              <p><strong>By Selina Lum from Straits Times</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>A 59-YEAR-OLD doctor who appealed against her two-week jail term for drink driving has had the sentence reduced to a $5,000 fine.</p>
              <p>Dr Irene Lim Kay Hian, a senior consultant radiologist at the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, looked relieved after her appeal was allowed. She remains banned from driving for four years.</p>
              <p>Justice Chao Hick Tin said he will give written reasons for his decision at a later date.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim’s lawyer, Senior Counsel Sant Singh, argued that her decision to drive was not deliberate but arose out of her distraught state when she got a phone call in the middle of the night saying that a close aunt was in a bad state in hospital.</p>
              <p>On her way to the National University Hospital, Dr Lim’s car stalled along the Pan Island Expressway near the Clementi Avenue 6 exit.</p>
              <p>A patrol officer with the Expressway Monitoring Advisory System who checked on the car, noticed the woman smelt of alcohol and the Traffic Police was called in. A breathalyser test at the police station showed she had 129 mcg of alcohol per 100 ml of breath, nearly four times the legal limit of 35 mcg. – Straits Times</p>
