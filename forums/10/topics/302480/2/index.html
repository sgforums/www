            <div class='col-md body'>Myth: Malays Receive Free Education<br><br>One of the sore points many Singaporeans on the Internet have regarding our Malays is the notion that we are receiving Â“free educationÂ” from the state even through polytechnic and university.<br><br>Free education for indigenous people is a legacy brought about by the British to protect the original inhabitants of a country. It is still widely practised in other Commonwealth nations such as Australia and New Zealand where the aborigines are fully subsidised in tertiary institutions.<br><br>However the legacy for tertiary fees has been dismounted by the Government since 1991. While students coming from households earning less than $1500 a month will be put through a subsidy programme via Mendaki ( a Malay version of the Chinese CDAC and Indian SINDA), the majority of Malay students in polytechnics and universities today are there on tuition fees fully paid for by their parents. Be rest assured that your Malay countrymen are working and saving just as hard as you are to support their children's tertiary educations.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I don't understand seriously why TS still thinks that malay got priority in this country.<br><br>Everyone is the same here, want something, earn it.</div>
