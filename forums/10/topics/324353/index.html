              <p>i just saw the debate on you tube; though the debate not perfect, and perhaps a tad too short; it (again) demonstrates malaysia's new openness and progress in politics. i have no doubt in the upheaval that malaysia is experiencing now will have short term pains, it will grow more mature politically and the country's survival in the long term is more assured. is anwar out to ruin the country? or BN has got it wrong? the end state is, the people can decide and will be able to make an informed choice on what's good for them and the country. that's a small but significant step in the right direction, imo. </p>

              <p>A true democracy at work will prevent instability of the country. The question now all Singaporeans will have to ask themselves is:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Do I still want to fall for all the past propaganda painted by government controlled media against western democracy just to allow a few selfish power that be to continue to hijack democracy for its own purpose or do I want to practise true democracy which not only will not cause instability but will assure us all to bring about stability through genuine rule of law to reach mature understanding of democratic practices?"</p>

              <p>My view of Lee Kuan Yew is that he is a bastard.</p>
              <p>There are still people hoodwinked by his propaganda and afraid of him.</p>
              <p>That is why he must die.</p>
              <p>He is simply an old bastard.</p>
              <p>I find it ludicrous that this bastard has been in power since 1959.</p>
              <p>Almost 50 years now.</p>
              <p>The amount of damage this has done to Singapore society is too great.</p>

              <p>yup, got my news alert earlier. looks like the BN folks are pulling no punches to kill/stop his political comeback.</p>
              <p>i think anwar made an error by announcing that he will form the government by sept 26 or some time around there. this helped the incumbant to plan how to stop him, any which way possible.</p>

              <p>It is almost impossible for the opposition to take over the state government, because in Malaysia, the law system, the constitution is all inclined towards the ruling party.</p>
              <p>Just few days ago, after so much rumours, the opposition head has finally submitted a motion of non-confidence towards the government. Seems like they have secured all the potential votes.<br>However the parliament speaker who is at the BN side rejected this motion, and said this motion is not right to be approved, and in the law the parliament speaker has right to reject any motion without giving any reason.<br>tsk tsk...Like that even if the opposition has secured 2/3 of the seats they will won't be able to overturn the government. They have to wait another 4 years+ from now.</p>
              <p>I really pity Anwar, being jailed for so many years without any crime.The reason why Mahathir and C4 use sodomy to attack him because Anwar didn't involve in any corruption case. Hence, they couldn't find any excuse and finally resort to dirty trick.</p>

              <p>i think there is more twists in this developing tale. dr m has stoke the fire by suggesting that racist muhyiddin can topple c4 in the coming umno election. dr m could indirectly help anwar. this is a 3 faction war; anwar and pakatan trying to topple the government, dr m and his invisible army trying to force pak lah out and destabilise umno and the brewing in-fighting within umno. </p>
              <p>the other report about the factious pas and that some may cross over to umno could complicate matters. </p>
              <p>so far, the army has been staying on the sideline. the police force are pro-government.</p>
              <p>the political upheaval in malaysia certainly has upped a few notches since the election. i just hope when the dust settle, everything remains intact and common sense prevail. i got loads of relatives up north.</p>

              <p>A true democracy at work will prevent instability of the country. The question now all Singaporeans will have to ask themselves is:</p>
              <p>"Do I still want to fall for all the past propaganda painted by government controlled media against western democracy just to allow a few selfish power that be to continue to hijack democracy for its own purpose or do I want to practise true democracy which not only will not cause instability but will assure us all to bring about stability through genuine rule of law to reach mature understanding of democratic practices?"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Talking about black and white thinking, tis seems to be a just black thinking. Why don't singaporean ask themselves tis</p>
              <p>"Other than the problem of democracy, has tis government perform badly, taking into account our restriction in size and lack of resources ? Do we have a poor quality of life and fare badly compared with other countries ? Will democracy helps, looking at the governance of countries like USA, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, India etc. Can I name one smart policy or governance tat they had made recently ? Is democracy overrated ? Will it make my life better or worse ?"</p>
