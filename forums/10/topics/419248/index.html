              <p><strong>This year, in Singapore politics...</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 31 December 2010 0853 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Election 
              talk, new political parties, changes to the Constitution, and a historic
               deal sealed with neighbour Malaysia. These were some issues which took 
              centrestage on Singapore's political scene in 2010.<br><br>It was also a
               year the nation mourned the deaths and remembered the contributions of 
              two key personalities in Singapore's development.<br><br>Former deputy 
              prime minister Goh Keng Swee and Madam Kwa Geok Choo, wife of Minister 
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, had each, in their own way, played roles in 
              Singapore's success.<br><br>And even as their contributions are 
              remembered, the process of political renewal continues.<br><br>At the 
              People's Action Party (PAP) conference on Nov 28, Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong said the party would have enough talent to form the next 
              generation of leaders if it were re-elected in the next general 
              election.<br><br>He said: "I can tell you that elections are due before 
              the next party conference. So, this is the last one and so, we must gear
               ourselves for the campaign". <br><br>Election talk and speculation 
              about when the polls will be held featured much of the year. New 
              political parties emerged, declaring their intent on giving the PAP a 
              good fight at the polls. <br><br>Key changes to the Constitution, and 
              the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections Acts were passed in April. <br><br>These
               include having smaller Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and 
              more Single Member Constituencies, and guaranteeing more opposition MPs 
              in Parliament.<br><br>The Prime Minister said the changes were made to 
              meet Singaporeans' aspirations for more diverse views in Parliament.<br><br>A
               Cooling Off Day on the eve of polling, when no campaigning is allowed 
              for parties and candidates except for party political broadcasts, will 
              also be introduced.<br><br>Cyberspace is expected to be abuzz, with 
              rules on new media relaxed to allow online election advertising.<br><br>Mr
               Zaqy Mohamad, an MP for Hong Kah GRC, said: "The new media channel will
               somewhat be an alternative where voters may look to for, I suppose, 
              gossip, or certain events or facts. <br><br>"So, I think that's where 
              people will do some cross-referencing against what you see on the 
              traditional media channels".<br><br>The Electoral Boundaries Review 
              Committee, which examines the growth of the voter population and 
              recommends the number of electoral wards as well as their boundaries, 
              was also convened in October.<br><br><br><br>BOOST FOR BILATERAL TIES<br><br>On
               the foreign front, analysts said 2010 marked a high point in 
              Singapore-Malaysia relations, with the resolution of a 20-year 
              outstanding issue.<br><br>After a meeting in May, the Prime Ministers of
               both countries agreed on new terms to settle outstanding issues within 
              the 1990 Points of Agreement (POA).<br><br>A decision was made to move 
              the Malayan Railway (KTM) station in Tanjong Pagar to the Woodlands 
              Train Checkpoint - near the border by July 1 next year.<br><br>Because 
              of its historical significance, the two leaders have decided to conserve
               the Tanjong Pagar station, although no decision has been made on how 
              this prime piece of land will be developed.<br><br>By 2018, there will 
              be a Rapid Transit Rail System between Singapore and Malaysia served by a
               single co-located Customs, Immigration and Quarantine facility.<br><br>National
               Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said a traveller from Singapore to 
              Malaysia will be checked by both authorities from both countries, but in
               one location. After that, he would be free to go over to the other 
              side. <br><br>Mr Mah said it would be more convenient for travellers 
              because they would only have to stop once compared to twice now.<br><br>Some
               analysts attribute the breakthrough to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib 
              Razak.<br><br>Mr Yang Razali Kassim, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam 
              School of International Studies, said: "He is the son of a Prime 
              Minister, Razak Hussein, and he (Mr Najib) sees in himself the inheritor
               of a future. <br><br>"And he sees in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong the
               inheritor of a future as well. So, he sees both of them as being in a 
              special position that can never be replicated".<br><br>Mr Michael 
              Palmer, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Foreign 
              Affairs and Defence, noted that the relations between the two Prime 
              Ministers "are certainly a lot better, more friendly".<br><br>"Najib and
               his government also want to come to some form of agreement because 
              there's certainly an advantage - particularly with the Iskandar project 
              and Singapore's proximity, and wanting (Singapore) to invest in that 
              project," Mr Palmer said. <br><br>"So they want our investment. We want 
              to make that a reality and, therefore, it can only be win-win." <br><br>Then
               came a small hiccup in December: WikiLeaks revelations of US diplomatic
               cables allegedly quoting remarks made by Singapore diplomats over 
              Malaysia's leadership and politics.<br><br>Still, discussions by senior 
              officials on details of the POA continued and are likely to wrap up on 
              Friday.<br><br>Said Mr Palmer: "The diplomatic community is also 
              cautious, but they also realise that many of these comments and 
              statements that are released may be taken out of context.<br><br>"There 
              will always be some factions that will want to see this dent or this 
              rift widen ... Prime Ministers from both sides must ... take the lead in
               making sure these subversive factions don't achieve what they want to 
              achieve."<br><br>In September, leaders from both sides also agreed to 
              swop the land in Tanjong Pagar, Woodlands and Bukit Timah, for four 
              plots in downtown Marina South and two in the Ophir-Rochor arts 
              district.<br><br>The Singapore Government will vest the four land 
              parcels in Marina South and the two in Ophir-Rochor in M-S Pte Ltd, the 
              company formed to look into the implementation details.<br><br>Both 
              sides are also working on a wellness township project in Iskandar 
              Malaysia, in southern Johor. Malaysia's Khazanah Nasional and 
              Singapore's Temasek Holdings will form a 50-50 joint venture company to 
              undertake the development of the wellness township. <br><br>Mr Mah, who 
              co-chairs the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Ministerial Committee for 
              Iskandar Malaysia, said: "It could be wellness, it could be health. It 
              could be retirement, it could be medical care, a combination of both or 
              other things in additional to this.<br><br>"The concept has to be 
              viable, then the location has to be good. Then, of course, all the 
              economics of it has to be right - the pricing has to be right."<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
