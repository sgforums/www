            <div class='col-md body'>20/20 Stupid in America<br><br>20-20 investigation by John Stossel entitled "Stupid in America" highlighting some of the flaws with the education system in the United States.<br><br>The story started out when identical tests were given to high school students in New Jersey and in Belgium. The Belgian kids cleaned the American kids' clocks. The Belgian kids called the American students "stupid", which gave the piece its name.<br><br>Jay Greene, author of "Education Myths," points out that "If money were the solution, the problem would already be solved: We've doubled per pupil spending, adjusting for inflation, over the last 30 years, and yet schools aren't better."<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRUMmTs0ZA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRUMmTs0ZA</a><br><br>In some ways, we have to be thankful for our education, be it flawed at times. Share your views on how our neighbourhood schools compare with American public schools? I would say it's not much of a contest.<br><br>What does everyone think?</div>

Concern.<br><br>These are the basic characteristics of those teachers whom I have the fortune of experiencing their guidance.<br><br>From these basic characteristics it leads the teachers to be more imaginative, inspirational, original, and refreshing in the manner which they deliver the knowledge and information that makes everything so interesting that a student will want to explore more on its own.<br><br>To the credit of the money driven Government, they did not allow the teachers' wages to lag behind the Private Sector, which allowed the best brains also to flow into the Teaching Profession.<br><br>However, money alone may not be the driving force - as much as the Teaching Force will also need to bring back the bacon to their families.<br><br>It is the love of teaching, the imparting of skills, thinking ability, knowledge, and experience that attract the most dedicated to a career in Teaching.<br><br>Unfortunately, the eagerness to perform and to be the best can easily be dampened by bureaucracy, politics, inflexible policies that bind and prevent the teachers from exercising their imagination and initiative.<br><br>Good Leadership at all tiers of the Education Department is essential, with vision that is realistic and achievable goals, and of course the financial backing from the political masters.<br><br>As much as the basics are attended to - it is essential that teachers have strong morals and know where to draw the line in their relationship with the student.<br><br>It is sad that over a period of five years, scandalous relationships between teachers and students have sprouted in the news - something that is unheard of in from the 60s to the 90s.<br><br></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No children are dumb, unless they are handicapped. They are supposed to learn better when thereÂ’s fun in learning, just like the young in the animal world. The young are mischievous, they learn by playing and making mistakes. Children, like young animals, have boundless energy. They seem to be more interested in sports and games than studying.<br>Media or IT technology could be a distraction. The Americans are spoilt for choice.. Or maybe itÂ’s about motivation, passion, ambition. ThereÂ’s no pressure for American kids to excel academically.  The school pressure is only felt in Asian schools. ItÂ’s the Asian attitude.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its well known that the American and British public schools are failing. The classrooms are so noisy and disruptive that the teachers cant teach.<br><br>But i dont think Singapore students score better in achievement tests due to the school system alone. It also depends on the importance the parents places on education. Many other asian countries, like Singapore, send their kids for private tuition, cram schools etc, These asian counterparts have performed just as well. I would say that the students would have scored just as well even if the school system wasnt good, because they would have received extra help after school.<br><br>I guess PRC would be a good example to illustrate my point. Why do so many PRC students say our math and science are easy?<br><br></div>
