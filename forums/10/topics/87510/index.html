Some sounds ridicolous (E.g. last time bus fare increase is followed by announcement of profit from bus company, really !@#$%^&amp;*). But some may be justified. Government budget deficit is ALL SINGAPOREANS' problem, not just government hor. So, if there is justification, no problem. Just not like the above situation I stated.</div>

Let me know if my responses do not make sense to you.<br><br>It is good to propose framework on moving ahead. But when it comes to solving problems, each has to be studied on it's own merit considering impact on various involved party. When things are vague, then there is no item to action upon. And thus, indecision and lack of actual action. Debating things on the philosophical level is interesting and many people likes to do that. But when it comes to actual research of the problem and defining the problem and solution set, very few people do it. My point here is really just that we need to talk about the actual issues, and not just some vague ideas at the philosophical level.<br><br>I hope my points are clear.</div>
