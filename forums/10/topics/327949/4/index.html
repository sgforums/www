              <p>1) not just the collection of direct tax such as work permit levy but also road tax, ARF etc. Also the collection of indirect tax such as GST, ERP, entertainment tax etc. Generally, more FT, more collection of all kind of taxes. <br><br>2) But you should also see another pic. I had with me foreign classmates, all are Master, MBBS, PhD in a class of local dip and basic deg. We will work under them and not they work under us, you know.</p>

              <p>Losser is a name the govt given to label the ex-sg to shame them. The govt realizes that the foreigners who migrate here are also loser to their home country. So they stop using such term now.<br><br>I cam  across an article, not sure if it is the same as yours. These locals are staying abroad because they've accumulated lower wealth and poorer skill sets over the years. Therefore, they dare not come back.<br><br>Imagine this, you use two linear curves one steep, one not. The steeper one would be the income if they stay and the other if they work overeas. <br><br>I know some would dispute with me. But please understands that not all who works overeas are professional. I personally know ppl who have only O levels and were forced to work overseas, esp the recession period. <br><br>Sadly, this is the group that is fearfully of coming back.    </p>

              <p>4sg,</p>
              <p>I disagree with your point that overseas Singapore accumulated poor skill sets and as such will be at a disadvantage when they return to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Since Jan this year, the Singapore Goverment has been organising overseas meetings among Singaporeans who have been working overseas in UK and US and the meetings has been taking place in cities like London, New York and cities in Australia.</p>
              <p>I was fortunate enough to be attending one of these meetups and met many Singaporeans in London who are in very well known companies in UK.  After the gathering we were also invited for lunch and I got a chance to network with the overseas Singaporeans based in UK.  I can assure you that if you are in excellent financial companies like Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs or Citigroup, you are in a much better position than most Singaporeans working in banks. </p>
              <p>You have no idea the degree of competition required in order to obtain a job in such an organisation because you have to compete with the top students from Cambridge and Oxford and the talented foreigners from the Ivy League Unis in the US for a job.  When you inside such an organistion, you have to demonstrate assertiveness, courage to speak out, and express yourself like a gentlemen.  This is not something that can be done without hard work and perseverance and especially cannot be learnt and taught in Singapore schools.</p>
              <p>Therefore I personally feel that Singaporeans who are working overseas represent Singapore in their own way.  I must admit that I was initially disappointed with being labelled losers when I first heard about it.  However I am quite sure the truth will prevail eventually, and the fact is that if you do live and work in Singapore, you will have limitations unless you are in a field thoroughly encouraged by the Goverment. </p>
