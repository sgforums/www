              <p>With the unreasonable constant rising costs in Singapore, those Singaporeans working overseas in the third world countries are enjoying the low cost of living there.   My neighbour's son was very reluctant to go Vietnam when the company sent him there.   Now that he is there for 5 years, he does not want to come back.   With his pay and the low cost of living there, he employs 2 maids and married a Vietnamese lady.  He told his mum that he is enjoying the low costs of living there and Singapore is just too expensive.</p>

              <p><br>They don't have any kids.  The same neighbour, her daughter was on scholarship to study in US.  NOw working under bond, told the mum she is giving up her singapore citizenship.    I have been receiving all this sort of news.    A man said that the son who has migrated is in the midst of arranging for him to join him.   </p>
              <p>The govt can't be bothered so there is no need to blame people for migrating and labelled them as quitters.    The pay and pay are pathetic sore losers.</p>

              <p>Don't worry.. the gahmen to the rescue.</p>
              <p>They will buy back your remaining lease and leave you with maybe 20-30 years lease.. then the money goes into the CPF life plan.</p>
              <p>Then every month you get some payout and you get to stay in your HDB flat.</p>
              <p>But if you live beyond the remaining lease you own.. then you have to ask gahmen for mercy , they only deal case by case.</p>
              <p>After you die.. the HDB flat goes back to gahmen. So before you die.. you tell your children.. you will die a poor man.. so don't expect any inheritance.</p>
              <p>Very well thought out plan from gahmen.. clap clap.</p>

              <p>Yes it is true.. the health care system is cheaper and provides quality care.</p>
              <p>But due to age discrimination and lack of elderly friendly infrastructure... it's hardly  desirable for people who have gotten used to living in elderly friendly countries.</p>

              <p>like to chip in to say that</p>
              <p>i see a trend in singapore.</p>
              <p>the ft policy will develop further and people need to continously feel 'hungry' especially the young ones.</p>
              <p>If i extrapolate this trend, I had an awakening.</p>
              <p>Need to dust off my resume and look for a prospective INC to live and work in - work-life balance mah.</p>
              <p>ultimately the responsibility lies in the hands of the people.</p>
              <p>recent times, the blogs and forums have contributed their own ways to liberalise singapore. i attribute these efforts as contributing factors to the garmen's decision to agree to so-call liberalise, which depends on approval.</p>
              <p>Why not then and only now?</p>
              <p>I think the People responsible are the one who can answer this.</p>
              <p>democracy literacy have room for improvement.</p>
