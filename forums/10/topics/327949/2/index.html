              <p>This intention has been in the minds of pure bred Singaporeans for a long time. More so when announced that we can't enjoy our CPF at retirement. Now its "what retirement?" , "what CPF"... CPF will be depleted once the baby-boomers reach retirement thats why this policy.</p>
              <p>Problem here is not that nobody wants to speak up...its just that nobody wants to be charged for defamation, illegal gathering, demonstrations, etc...</p>
              <p>Very siong living here. Looks like its headed for only the rich &amp; since there are so many, its like indirectly telling the others to get out.</p>

              <p>Survey is reflecting the reality of what the people want.   It is so true about the young twenties group that they want migration.   Majority of the people from late teens to early twenties I speak to talk about - study, work, migrate overseas.  One poly grad was so happy that he got scholarship from an overseas company to study in UK and thereafter work for them and will settle down in UK and never want to come back live here.   he will be making arrangement for his mum to migrate to UK.</p>
              <p>Singapore is no longer a place for the born and bred.   Sad.</p>
              <p>I am hoping to retire overseas.</p>

              <p>Is that strange?</p>
              <p>Because this country has no concept of retirement at all but people really want to at least be able to enjoy that last bit and spend a bit of their hard earned money in CPF, before they die. I don't think that's too much to ask but that's not in-line with what the government wants which is to work people to their coffins</p>

              <p>LKY mentioned that retirement means death.   If possible, if can, he will make it that there is no retirement for anyone in Singapore.  </p>
