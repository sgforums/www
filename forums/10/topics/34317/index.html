            <div class='col-md body'>looking at the current impasse between singapore and malaysia...<br><br>anyone else have a similar sense of frustration??<br><br>i mean.... hell.... we try to reason with them... but they are unreasonable...<br><br>We try to come to a compromise with them... but they want us to simply hand over everything they want....<br><br>We tell them the importance of bilateral treaty and the importance to be responsible for the sake of both nations... but they try to act like monkeys...<br><br>On the one hand.... we try to go by the diplomatic and legal way of resolving the problem... amicably...<br><br>While at the same time... we dont want to resolved our problems through force of arms... but then... they are not giving us much options left...<br><br>They continue to intrude into PB and has become more and more unreasonable by the days...<br><br>I fear... that the problem between the 2 nations might have reach a point where war is fast becoming a reality...<br><br>Singapore is probably still holding onto our sanity as we wait for malaysia's move on water and PB issue...<br><br>BUT... if malaysia should decide on the last minute not to sign the mutual special agreedment to bring PB to the ICJ and/or starts to take unilateral position on the issue of water...<br><br>I fear... war preparations would begin in earnest... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>HOwever... i believe that there is one more avenue that singapore can resolve the current impasse... we should bring our mutual conflict to the UN or the ASEAN meet...<br><br>we could expose the lies of malaysia to the whole region if not throughout the world using mass media, diplomatic channel and force them to abide by the international norms of diplomacy...<br><br>even if malaysia refuse to bring the matter to the regional grouping or the UN... singapore must at least present its side of the story... inform our friends and neighbours what has happened.... then perhaps seek their assistance to force malaysia through diplomatic, economic or even millitary pressure... ( a few hundred thoudsand soldier from TNI and Thai army place around malaysian border would work wonders... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>OR.. in the event that diplomatic pressure failed... we should gathered around us... our friends, allies and neighbours to support us in times of grave conflict...</div>

Korea and the Mid-East.<br><br>SE Asia is peripheral at the moment... yes, war on terrorism, blah blah blah... lets bomb iraq... sigh...<br><br>also, NOBODY believes that the two countries will actually come to blows...<br><br>not THAT easy to just find an opportunity and have it out with the suckers...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frustration - is how the US feel when dealing with North Korea and Iraq.<br><br>North Korea has Kim IL Jung and Iraq has Sadam Hussein, both are experts in the field of political deceit and manouvre.<br><br>Both leaders are stubbornly holding out and wearing down the patience of the US and the UN, in a "cat and mouse" game of hiding their Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br><br>North Korea Kim is an unpredictable and psychotic leader, who ordered the bombing incident in Myanmar that killed seven South Korean Ministers, when they made a State Visit there.<br><br>Iraq's Sadam is similarly unpredictable and shows no qualms even in the execution of both his sons-in-law, by deceiving them to return home from illegal flight, only to have murdered by his elder son.<br><br>Sadam has been documented to have ordered the killing of Iraqi Citizens of Kurdish ethnicity, by using toxic gas that killed over five thousand people in one single town alone.<br><br>He has also been documented to have authorised the use of mustard gas against the Iranian army, to break the impasse during their "ten year war".<br><br>Just like his North Korean counter part, Sadam is also very good at the game of deception.<br><br>Both have continued to spend billions on exotic weapons, as well as on grandiose palaces and monuments, while their citizens suffered through another year of winter.<br><br>The US remain helpless and frustrated, as the UN efforts to locate the Weapons of Mass Destruction continue to prove inconclusive the existence of the Weapons of Mass Destructions.<br><br>Malaysia's behaviour can be compared to that of North Koreas's Kim, as both are as "hare brained" as one from the other..<br><br></div>
