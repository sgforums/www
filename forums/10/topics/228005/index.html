            <div class='col-md body'>Mobsters and hookers unwelcome in Singapore<br><br>December 27, 2006 - 12:19PM<br><br>Loan sharks, prostitutes, money launderers and mobsters - they're traditionally as much a part of casinos as the punters themselves.<br><br>But squeaky-clean Singapore is taking steps to make sure criminals have no place in the city-state's two new gaming centres, which are due to open by 2010.<br><br>Analysts have confidence the strict regulatory system will work, and that Singapore will remain one of Asia's most crime-free countries even after the multi-billion dollar projects change the face of the city.<br><br>"There should be very little concern," said Steven Tan, a Malaysia-based analyst with CIMB-GK Securities.<br><br>Singapore is a majority ethnic Chinese country where legalised betting on football, horse racing and lotteries is widespread.<br><br>But when the government first raised the prospect of casino gambling, a public debate erupted in the city-state where voices of dissent against the government are rarely heard.<br><br>The opposition Workers' Party feared a casino could threaten Singapore's "family values" reputation and put it at risk of becoming a centre for money laundering.<br><br>The government went ahead anyway, hoping the casino "resorts" - which will have entertainment and other facilities alongside the gaming areas - would boost the city's tourism appeal.<br><br>Las Vegas Sands, which has operations in the booming southern Chinese gambling enclave of Macau, won Singapore's first casino licence in May. Its bid underlined an effort to strengthen Singapore's position as a top meeting and conventions destination.<br><br>Early this month Singapore named Genting International and Star Cruises, both part of Malaysia's Genting Group, as winner of a second casino licence on Sentosa island. Their family-oriented proposal features a Universal Studios theme park and the world's largest oceanarium.<br><br>The projects are scheduled to open in 2009 and 2010.<br><br>Stephen Vickers, president and chief executive officer of International Risk in Hong Kong, said earlier this year that organised crime remains a threat to Asia's burgeoning gaming industry.<br><br>He said vigilance and a zero tolerance approach are needed to keep out the triads and organised crime syndicates which have not completely disappeared despite stiff enforcement measures.<br><br>"There is a long history of triad and organised crime and penetration of gambling especially in Macau and South-East Asia," Vickers said.<br><br>"Those people have not all died and gone away."<br><br>But Singapore police say traditional Hong Kong-style triad groups no longer exist in the city-state.<br><br>"How many criminals do you see in Singapore?" said CIMB-GK's Tan. "You don't find much robbery. You don't find gangsters."<br><br>Jonathan Galaviz, a partner with Las Vegas-based consulting and research firm Globalysis, said Singapore has made it clear that "any form of criminal activity will be dealt with swiftly, and that the casino gaming activity is going to be no exception".<br><br>While Las Vegas once had a reputation for mafia infiltration of its casinos, Galaviz said a solid regulatory system has made criminal activity practically non-existent among operators there.<br><br>"Of course there's another side of the equation, which is the consumer side," he said - adding that surveillance technology and other measures are effective against criminal customers.<br><br>Galaviz said Macau's regulatory system is well respected but was still "a work in progress" in a city that liberalised its gaming sector only five years ago.<br><br>Singapore's home affairs ministry - which groups the country's law enforcement agencies - says it will work closely with casino operators to set up a comprehensive regulatory and enforcement framework.<br><br>"The ministry of home affairs is mindful that casinos can bring with it associated law and order problems such as illegal money lending or loan shark syndicates, prostitution, money laundering and criminal gang activities," it said.<br><br>A planned Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) will require casino operators to put in place a robust anti-money laundering program, and will scrutinise the operators' programs and financial records, it said.<br><br>Police have formed a new criminal investigation branch to detect casino crimes, the ministry said.<br><br>Galaviz said Singapore already has a reputation for transparent and ethical regulation of other industries, and gaming will be no exception.<br><br>"So there should be really no concerns as it relates to Singapore's position on the regulatory front," he said.<br><br>Singapore also has strong existing regulations to prevent money laundering in the financial sector, making that type of crime unlikely in casinos, he said.<br><br>Tan agreed, but added: "There's no such thing as 100 per cent."<br><br>AFP<br>--<br><br><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/singapore/mobsters-and-hookers-unwelcome-in-singapore/2006/12/27/1166895340500.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/news/singapore/mobsters-and-hookers-unwelcome-in-singapore/2006/12/27/1166895340500.html</a></div>
