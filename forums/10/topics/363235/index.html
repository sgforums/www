              <p><strong>Asia Sentinel, 8 Jun 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore's Sham Political Reforms </strong></span><br> <br> <img src="http://www.asiasentinel.com/images/stories/smoothgallery/JAN2008/singa-trojanhorse1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Given the Singapore government's oft-repeated mantra that multi-party
              politics is not appropriate for a small city-state, it might have
              surprised outside observers when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
              recently unveiled plan to boost the number of opposition MPs in
              parliament.<br> <br> Only last November at the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) annual conference, <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lee
              insisted that a "two-party model cannot work in Singapore" and that
              "the country is much better off with one dominant party".</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Just seven months later, Lee seems to have changed his tune somewhat. </strong></span>Now,
              he acknowledges that "Singaporeans want national issues to be fully
              debated" and that the government should "improve our political system
              to encourage a wider range of views in Parliament, including opposition
              and non-government views".<br> <br> The government thus plans to change the constitution to ensure that
              there are at least nine opposition MPs in Singapore's supine Parliament
              (currently just three of the 85 voting MPs are not PAP apparatchiks) by
              expanding the existing system whereby the best-performing electoral
              losers are awarded parliamentary seats with watered-down powers.<br> <br> Coming after recent decisions to permit public protests (albeit only in
              one specified location) and allow the release of some political films
              (subject to government vetting), it almost appears as if the prime
              minister and his PAP allies have undergone some sort of damascene
              conversion to liberal democratic principles.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But, in reality, the latest
              reforms are nothing more than Trojan horse politics, designed to head
              off the growing clamor for more alternative voices and to sow discord
              between Singapore's spattering of brave but fractious opposition
              politicians.</strong></span></span> The PAP has maintained an iron grip
              on power since Singapore won independence from Britain in 1959 not by
              locking up its opponents, although it does occasionally resort to such
              tactics, but by dominating public discourse, castrating opposition
              politicians through libel proceedings and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>manipulating the electoral system to its advantage.<br> </strong></span></span> <br> Lee junior's proposed parliamentary reforms are just the latest example of this approach.<br> <br> From its once-impregnable lock on power, the ruling party's share of
              the popular vote has declined steadily, from 75 percent in 2001 to a
              still-formidable 66.6 percent in 2006 and, with Singapore facing the
              worst recession in its history, the PAP is concerned that support could
              fall even further at the next general election, which is due by 2011.<br> <br> While most political parties around the world can only dream of winning such support, <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the
              PAP remains nervous because it knows that the rapid rise of the
              internet has eroded its ability to control public opinion through
              state-owned newspapers and broadcast news outlets.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Although many of the city-state's bloggers and citizen journalists
              dedicate as much time to bashing each other as they do to taking on the
              government,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong> the PAP fears that the next generation of Singaporeans, who are internet-obsessed, will be much less craven than their parents.</strong></span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By guaranteeing a limited
              amount of greater opposition within Parliament, the PAP hopes to defuse
              the growing calls for more debate without giving up any control. For
              the real bulwarks of PAP rule – control of public debate and
              gerrymandering – remain fully intact.</strong></span></span><br> <br> To illustrate the first bulwark, you need look no further than Amnesty
              International's latest annual report, which concluded that "a climate
              of fear and self-censorship discouraged Singaporeans from fully
              participating in public affairs".<br> <br> With regard to the second pillar, the bizarre system of Group
              Representative Constituencies (GRC), in which the party that wins the
              most votes in a single constituency sees their whole slate of
              candidates elected, remains intact despite some minor tweaking.<br> <br> Although officially intended to ensure that ethnic minority (i.e.
              non-Chinese) MPs are elected, the GRC system provides a massive boost
              to the PAP as the embattled opposition parties cannot risk losing five
              or six of their best candidates in a single battle where the odds are
              tilted heavily against them.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>While the reforms do nothing to weaken the PAP's
              electoral position, they will further undermine the public credibility
              of the opposition, which has already been damaged by persistently
              negative government spin and a tendency for internecine warfare.</strong></span><br> <br> The election of "best-losers" – who are known officially as
              non-constituency MPs (NCMPs) – began in 1984 and led to bitter
              divisions among opposition politicians, who differed about whether it
              was better to feed off the PAP's crumbs or take a principled stand and
              turn down the opportunity to gain a rare seat in Parliament.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The proposed expansion of the NCMP scheme will
              only deepen the tensions between Singapore's handful of opposition
              politicians, who are damned if they do and damned if they don't.</strong></span> Accept the NCMP scheme and some activists will criticize them for being
              unprincipled, self-aggrandizing lackeys. Reject it and the government
              can once again paint the opposition as irrelevant, ungrateful and
              uninterested in the real machinery of democracy.<br> <br> Sylvia Lim, an existing NCMP from the Workers' Party, has welcomed the
              latest reforms cautiously while others in her party remain opposed to
              them as do competing opposition groups such as Chee Soon Juan's
              Singapore Democratic Party.<br> <br> Opponents point out that NCMPs are second-class representatives,
              without the right to vote on amendments to the constitution, motions of
              no confidence or issues relating to public funds. Devoid of a physical
              constituency, it is also extremely difficult for NCMPs and their
              parties to build the support bases that they will need if they are to
              be anything more than isolated voices singing in the wind.<br> <br> Those who reject the scheme also insist that the government guarantee
              of nine opposition MPs in Parliament will only add to the PAP conceit
              that there's no point in voting for the opposition.<br> <br> Singapore's voters are habitually threatened by the PAP that upgrading
              projects for their shabby housing estates and other manifestations of
              government largesse are solely dependent on their support for the
              ruling party in general elections. The opposition, by contrast, can
              make no such promises or threats.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>With the presence of nine alternative
              parliamentary voices guaranteed, Singapore's cautious and brow-beaten
              electorate will have even less reason to cast their compulsory vote for
              anyone other than the PAP. </strong></span><br> <br> ----------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>Time out for a reality check.</p>
              <p>How often had opposition politicians been voted into Parliament as MPs?<br>And why not?</p>
              <p>These are questions you must ask, after spewing forth the raw emotions, if one truly cares about the nation and its people.</p>
              <p>If MM Lee had been in the helm as PM, rest assured, there would be no such thing as NMPs or even NCMPs.</p>
              <p>Look at the situation seriously and consider intelligently - are any of our opposition politicians ready to be elected as MPs to serve the people capably? We, as a society, are even questioning the calibre of the ruling party's MPs, how more can we be assured of the calibre of the opposition's?</p>
              <p>Be realistic. The current crop of opposition political wannabes STAND NO CHANCE of being elected, simply because they offer no better alternatives nor any ounce of intelligence in outwitting the ruling party to reach out legally and peacefully,  intelligently playing within rules, to the masses.</p>
              <p>Thus the only hope that they have NOW is the olive branch offered freely by our PM, a chance for the opposition politicians to prove their worth within a democratic republican parliament, a national stage whereby they can voice their opinions or constructive suggestions ( or the lack of it ) to improve our lives.</p>
              <p>Nothing is fair in life, more so in politics. Thank heavens people like me are not in politics, otherwise, nothing of such offers would even be allowed for consideration.</p>
              <p>No one is perfect but Politics are best left to the more wise and those who wish to serve with a sincere heart, a ear for the people and a genuine desire to uplift the lives of our fellow citizens, such as what our PM is doing.</p>
              <p>Bad mouth such efforts more, and it will earn the ire of the masses, who may make representations to scrap such attempts as an ungrateful waste of time - a loss for opposition representation as well as for the People, whom are to be served, to judge them as potential leaders of constituencies and our nation. </p>
              <p>Worse still if we the republican citizens of an independant nation are to let ourselves be told and taught what is deemed 'right' by foriegn nations or its people of differing cultures and historical values. Even worse is to stand on their side and take swipes on one's fellow citizens.</p>

              <p>A good move. It probably stems from the PAP's deepening sense of boredom. But anyway it's a good move for Singapore.<br><br>Would
              you not be bored, if 95% of the time, you were just talking to
              yourself, nodding your head at yourself and agreeing with yourself?
              Yes, you would grow bored. You would run short of ideas, and get lost
              in your own stagnating mindset, and secretly wonder what was the point
              of all this. And eventually you might even long for some genuine
              discussion, engagement and feedback.<br><br>That is what has been
              happening in Parliament for many years. 95% of the time, the PAP is
              just talking to itself, nodding its head to itself and amiably agreeing
              with itself.<br><br>Well, at least the PAP will now have a few extra Opposition MPs to talk to.</p>
