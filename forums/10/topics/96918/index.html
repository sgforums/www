            <div class='col-md body'>I have come across this website on an interesting method of sewage treatment.<br><br>It may just prove more cost effective this way.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>http://technology.ssc.nasa.gov/suc_stennis_water.html<br><br>Success at Stennis<br><br>A New Image for the Water Hyacinth<br>In tropical and subtropical areas where water hyacinths grow, including the southern United States, these aquatic plants are generally considered a colossal nuisance. They are extra-ordinarily prolific, virtually indestructible, and their rapid growth clogs rivers and streams.<br><br>However, in a small but growing number of American communities, the glossy green, violet-flowered water hyacinth is developing a new image as a useful and beneficial plant. Its upgraded status stemmed from the discovery ?in a NASA technology application project ?that water hyacinths thrive on sewage; they absorb and digest wastewater pollutants, converting sewage effluents to relatively clean water. Thus, the plants have exciting promise as a natural water purification system, which can be established at a fraction of the cost of a conventional sewage treatment facility. Water hyacinths are serving that purpose in several locales and a number of other communities are considering adoption of the technique.<br><br>For maximum effectiveness, pollution-gorged water hyacinths must be harvested at intervals, but this apparent drawback offers potential for additional benefit. Harvested plants can be?and are being ? used as fertilizer. They can also be heat-treated to produce consumer energy in the form of methane gas. And if an economical way of drying the plants can be developed, they may find further utility as high-protein animal feed.<br><br>NASA launched its initial water hyacinth experiment in 1975 at the National Space Technology Laboratories (NSTL), Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. With the cooperation of Bay St. Louis officials, NSTL<br><br>Fenced off seven acres of the cityÃ·Ã• 40-acre sewage lagoon and planted water hyacinths. The plants flourished on the sewage and the once-noxious test area became a clean aquatic flower garden.<br><br>On the basis of this and other experiments, NSTL described the method and results in a study report which has been widely used as a basis for further application of water hyacinth technology. One of the earliest users was the town of Rio Hondo, Texas, population 2,000. Seeking alternatives to construction of a costly conventional sewage facility, town Mayor Juanita Brodeky learned of NASAÃ·Ã• work, contacted NSTL and obtained literature and personal guidance. Rio Hondo decided to adopt the NASA system, dug lagoons and imported water hyacinths. For more than four years, the plants have proved an effective, year-round means of treating sewage. The initial cost of the facility came to only one-twentieth the quoted estimate for a conventional system.<br><br>Similarly, the community of Orange Grove, Mississippi, shelved plans for an expensive mechanical system and opted instead for a combination of wastewater treatment methods in which water hyacinths play a leading role. In Florida, the Coral Springs Improvement district used NSTLÃ·Ã• research as the basis for a 150,000 gallon-a-day water hyacinth pilot plant which has been operating since 1978; installation costs were 40-70 percent below those of a conventional system and ongoing costs run 25 percent less. The city of Lucedale, Mississippi plans a program, which will include water hyacinth treatment of sewage together with methane generation from harvested plants.<br><br>Walt Disney World, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, activated a prototype 100,000-gallon-a-day sewage treatment plant using NSTLÃ·Ã• water hyacinth technology. The plant is part of the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT), being created to provide a site for demonstration of new technological, social and aritistic concepts. Among the sponsoring organizations of this project-along with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, NASA and private companies is the state of Florida, which is studying the possibility of using water hyacinth technology on a statewide scale. Florida has a need for improvement of its rural sewage treatment procedures, and it is estimated that water hyacinth systems could halve the $330 million cost projected for upgrading the stateÃ·Ã• sewage facilities by conventional means.<br><br>The city of Hercules, Georgia, has built a 350,000-gallon-per-day water hyacinth wastewater treatment plant. The unique facility has a greenhouse cover, which permits year-round operation. It can be expanded to treat almost two million gallons of raw sewage wastewater daily.<br><br>The largest application of water hyacinths yet initiated is a million-gallon-a-day pilot plant recently approved for the San Diego (California) Water Utilities Department (SDWUD), which handles sewage treatment for more than two million area residents. SDWUD contemplates a recycling system in which water hyacinths, combined with a mechanical system for separating solid waste, will restore wastewater to a certain level of purity; further treatment by other means would make the water pure enough for drinking and general use. Interested in broader application of water hyacinth technology, the California Water Resources Control Board has established an Aquaculture Studies Section to investigate the matter.<br><br>A number of other state and local governments are looking into water hyacinth sewage treatment and there are also several experiments under way to explore the plantÃ·Ã• byproduct potential as a source of methane gas or animal feed. For example, United Gas Pipe Line Company is one of the sponsors of the Disney World EPCOT program; in addition to its EPCOT study of separating methane from heat-treated water hyacinths, the company has been considering construction of a pilot plant in Louisiana to investigate large-scale production of methane from a combination of water hyacinths. Bermuda grass and municipal sewage.<br><br>Using harvested water hyacinths as animal feed was researched by the Louisiana State University Agricultural Experiment Station. In one test, conducted with NSTL cooperation, researchers fed chopped, solar-dried water hyacinths to a herd of dairy cows for four weeks; it was found that the cows produced as much milk-and of comparable qualify-as did cows fed their customary hay ration. LSU dairy scientists feel that the plants could become an alternative livestock feed when land now used to grow forage may have to be used to produce food for humans.<br><br>Additional research is needed before water hyacinths become practical, economical sources of methane or animal feed, but the plants have already demonstrated their efficacy in sewage treatment and wider application for that purpose seems likely.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it brings about the Wastewater Gardens:<br><br>http://www.idepfoundation.org/default_site/wwg2.htm<br><br>Partnering with PCRF Â– IDEP brings Wastewater GardensÂ® Technology to Bali &amp; Indonesia<br>In 2002 Yayasan IDEP established an MOU with PCRF (The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation), to introduce one of the worldÂ’s most effective technologies for environmentally sound wastewater treatment. PCRF has over a decade of research in the use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment.<br><br>The system was developed as part of the Biosphere 2 closed ecological system in Arizona (1991-4). In the years since, PCRF has created Wastewater GardensÂ® in the US, Europe, Mexico, the Bahamas Belize, Indonesia &amp; Australia, see www.pcrf.org Wastewater GardensÂ® are sealed subsurface flow wetlands that use plants, microbes, sunlight &amp; gravity to transform wastewater into beautiful gardens &amp; reusable water.<br><br>The technology has been reviewed by the U.S. EPA &amp; European Health authorities, and meets their wastewater standards. This system has been proven to be far more effective, affordable &amp; long-lasting than conventional sewage treatment systems, particularly in tropical zones.<br><br>Currently there are eleven Wastewater GardensÂ® in Indonesia, all of which have been designed and installed by members of the IDEP team. This includes systems we have made for residences, hotels/resorts and a local school (Sunrise school). We are currently developing a new system for a community and their new education center in Sulawesi with MAP-Mangrove Action Project (see links page) to protect their critically threatened mangrove and reef habitats.<br><br>Yayasan IDEP is working to increase the awareness of the Indonesian public and local government with regards to the system and its applicability as a sound solution for addressing the increasing need for available fresh water nationwide.<br><br>Why choose Wastewater GardensÂ®?<br>Introduction:<br>Current Problems with Sewage Treatment<br>Pollution of water resources by improperly or inadequately treated domestic wastewater (sewage) contaminates drinking water supplies and so is a leading cause of human disease worldwide.<br><br>Health problems related to sewage are widespread, ranging from children swimming in open sewage treatment ponds, failure of leach fields due to wet season inundation, and sewage effluent pollution of groundwater, rivers and lakes with adverse impact on drinking water quality and recreational use of these resources.<br><br>Small, rural and isolated communities often canÂ’t afford the great expense and difficulty in maintaining highly technical wastewater treatment systems. It is frequently reported that maintenance in such situations soon becomes almost non-existent and inadequate sewage treatment results.<br><br>In addition to issues of human health, the release of nutrients from this wastewater causes eutrophication in the environment, leading to a wide range of environmental problems. These include:<br><br>Mangrove habitat &amp; Coral reef decline<br>Oxygen depletion<br>Marine life/ Fish mortality<br>Ecological degradation of rivers and lakes<br>Giving competitive advantage to weed species over native plants.<br>Constructed Wetlands as an Alternative Method of Wastewater Recycling and Treatment<br>The past several decades has also produced new discoveries to solve this situation, stemming from a fundamental change of perspective based on a total ecosystem approach.<br><br>Â“WastewaterÂ” is in fact a valuable source of nutrients and water, upon which ecologically flourishing wetlands can exist. Wetland scientists have demonstrated that not only natural but also properly designed and constructed man-made wetland ecosystems are extremely efficient at utilizing and cleaning such nutrient-rich waters.<br><br>The new disciplines of Â“ecological engineeringÂ” and ecotechnics seek to utilize predominately natural, ecological mechanisms to integrate the human economy and technology with the biospheric ecology.<br><br>This approach turns what was previously Â“wasteÂ” into green plants and reusable water. Wetland ecosystems can be constructed for less cost, because there is less reliance on complex technology which is capital and maintenance-intensive, and which uses electricity / fuel.<br><br>The use of ecologically constructed wetlands for human sewage treatment relies on the ability of green plants and non-pathogenic microbes rather than expensive machinery.<br><br>In addition, designed wetlands create a Â“bufferÂ” ecosystem between the human economy and the environment to mitigate negative impacts, illegal as well as unpleasant and unhealthy.<br><br>Wastewater GardensÂ® systems are less expensive to build than conventional sewage treatment and running costs are dramatically lower (5-10% of ordinary maintenance and operating costs), since little or no machinery is used ,and gardening skills are the primary need once the system is operating. Many systems can be designed to rely completely on gravity-flow eliminating the need for pumps and electricity.<br>Wastewater GardensÂ® become more effective at wastewater treatment as the plants establish, compared with mechanical systems which become less effective as machinery ages. Subsurface wetland systems are long-term solutions. They have continued to function for decades since their original development in the United States and Europe in the 1970s.<br>How it Works-the techology:<br>Wastewater GardensÂ® is an ECOTECHNICS invention that uses very effective, ecologically sound, design principles.<br><br>Primary treatment of your sewage water, to separate solids, occurs in a conventional, watertight septic tank or settling lagoon. Then, instead of passing directly into a leachfield (with its attendant problems of little further treatment, smell, clogging and large size), the nutrient-rich wastewater effluent passes into a water-tight treatment compartment that is single or multiple-cell depending on system size.<br><br>The treatment compartment is then filled with gravel so that the wastewater is kept just below the gravel surface. Into this gravel, a wide variety of wetland plants, specially selected for the locality are planted.<br><br>As entering effluent overflows from the first stage cell, where the primary treatment occurs, it passes to the second cell, where advanced treatment occurs, and then into a comparatively small subsurface discharge cell.<br><br>The treated water can be recycled for further irrigation of lawns, shrubs, flowers or trees. Wastewater is generally held in the wetland systems for 5-7 days.<br><br>Why it works:<br>Wastewater GardensÂ® use plants, microbes, sunlight &amp; gravity to transform wastewater into beautiful gardens &amp; reusable water. The technology has been reviewed by the U.S. EPA &amp; European Health authorities, and meets their wastewater treatment standards.<br><br>The design uses only one fifth the area of open wetlands &amp; its high bio-diversity raises constructed wetlands to a complete ecological system.<br><br>THE ADVANTAGES:<br>of the ecological subsurface flow wetland approach include:<br>Fecal coli form bacteria are reduced more than 99% in the wetlands, without the use of expensive, environmentally harmful chemicals like chlorine.<br>Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) reduced 85-90% from influent levels, and removal of nitrogen and phosphorus is substantial.<br>The wetlands are low-cost, low-tech and long-lived. Maintenance requirements are simple.<br>There is no malodor as the sewage is kept from contact with the air.<br>There are no mosquito-breeding or other nuisances associated with open wastewater (e.g. sewage lagoons or surface-flow wetlands).<br>The possibility of accidental public contact with the sewage reduced to someone deliberately digging into the wetland gravel.<br>Subsurface flow wetland systems are capable of extremely high rates of wastewater cleaning. In research over the past several decades, this type of wetland, even in its earlier design forms, has a well-documented track record of consistently cleaning water to levels better than municipal standards for wastewater treatment.<br>The intensity of treatment is such that only 1/5 the area is required compared to a surface-flow wetland. Every particle of gravel becomes colonized by the natural variety of microbes that are effective in utilizing and treating wastewater, and the root systems and water/nutrient uptake of the plants increase treatment efficiency.<br>Where higher treatment than normal municipal standards is required for special purposes, an increase in wetland area provides the equivalent of advanced water treatment.<br>Significantly less wastewater (35-70% depending on design) is discharged from these special wetlands, because the plants use large quantities of water in their transpiration.<br>Subsurface wetlands can be exactly sized from small units for a single residence to larger areas for small city/town systems and so no surplus capacity need be paid for than is needed. On the other hand, new demands can easily be met by simple unit expansion<br>The wetland systems add considerably to the landscape beauty in communities where they are used, and can also include plants to be harvested for useful or saleable products. In Mexico and Bali, hotels and house-owners with wetland treatment systems are now competing for the most beautiful gardens!<br>Wastewater Gardens Save You Money:<br>Wastewater GardensÂ® systems are less expensive to build than conventional sewage treatment and running costs are dramatically lower (5-10% of ordinary maintenance and operating costs), because:<br>little or no machinery is used and systems can be designed to rely completely on gravity-flow, which removes the costs of:<br>Pumps<br>Electricity<br>Replacement of parts/ technician labor / yr<br>they are natural systems, which removes the costs of:<br>expensive chemical additives /mth /yr<br>and Wastewater GardensÂ® become more effective at wastewater treatment as the plants establish, unlike mechanical systems which become less effective as machinery ages,<br>In addition, Wastewater GardensÂ®offer the following advantages over conventional treatment:<br>no odour<br>additional landscape beauty<br>higher water quality treatment<br>more reliable performance (20yrs+)<br>insurance against inflation increasing maintenance costs (parts, electricity, chemicals)<br>Wastewater GardensÂ® have proven to be far more effective, affordable &amp; long-lasting than conventional (high tech) sewage treatment, particularly in tropical zones.<br><br>Applicability in Tropical Conditions:<br><br>Since these systems rely on green plants and microbes, they perform even better in warm, sunny conditions than the successful wetland systems in cold climates such as Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and northern United States. In milder and especially tropical conditions with higher temperatures and increased sunlight, system effectiveness is high year-round. Thus, the approach seems ideal for tropical areas, remote communities, rural towns and houses.<br><br>Wastewater GardensÂ® are especially recommended for use in on-site systems for houses in areas with groundwater close to the surface (such as often occurs during the wet season) and for sites with rocky or impermeable clay soils that prevent standard leachfields from operating.<br><br>RESEARCH<br>Background<br>Wastewater GardensÂ® were used in the worldÂ’s first laboratory for global ecology, Biosphere 2, a 3.15 acre materially closed facility near Tucson, Arizona. Dr. Nelson, one of the pioneers of Wastewater GardensÂ® , was a member of the eight person Â“biospherianÂ” crew for the first two year closure experiment, in 1991-1993. During this period, in the enclosed systems Dr. Nelson was in charge of the wetland wastewater treatment system which treated all domestic sewage from the internal crew, plus wastewater from laboratories, workshops, laundry and domestic animals.<br><br>Wastewater GardensÂ® advanced design, raises artificial wetlands to a complete system that has been extensively tested and successfully applied over the past several decades in over three hundred sites worldwide.This basic approach has been extensively tested and successfully applied in the United States and Europe over the past several decades.<br><br>This advanced design, which raises artificial wetlands to a complete system, is now operating in over fifty sites in southern Mexico, Belize, Bali, Indonesia, the United States and Australia.<br><br>In Mexico:<br>Detailed research was conducted for the Wastewater GardensÂ® systems constructed along the coast of the Yucatan, in southeastern Mexico, and the results critically checked by University of Florida scientists:<br><br>These Wastewater GardensÂ® systems prevented pollution damage to off-shore coral reefs, using 3-4 square meters of wetland per full-time resident. This ratio proved capable of reducing BOD (a measure of organic compounds in water by 85-90%, significantly reducing nitrogen and phosphorus, and reducing fecal coliform bacteria by around 99 % without the use of expensive and environmentally-harmful chlorine.<br><br>Two Wastewater GardensÂ® systems totaling 130 square meters, treated the grey and blackwater of 40 residents. The systems supported 65-70 varieties of wetland plants, with biodiversity three times greater than in adjoining natural mangrove wetlands, and only 5% less than inland tropical forest areas.The owners have expressed great satisfaction with the quality of the water effluent, the beauty of the Wastewater GardensÂ®, and the simplicity of maintenance.<br><br>How we work with you to create your Wastewater GardensÂ®<br>1.Initial consultation to determine whether a Wastewater GardensÂ® system is suitable for them. We will review site and building location plans and discuss possibilities for location of the septic tank and Wastewater GardensÂ® system.<br><br>2.Initial site visit with client to review land contours, existing trees, drainage areas and other factors that will affect the placement and functioning of the Wastewater GardensÂ®. Shapes for the gardens will be discussed at this time as well as types and varieties of plants suitable to the project and owner's taste.<br><br>3.Meeting with client and contractor to hand over and discuss the designs and plans for their Wastewater GardensÂ®. If this meeting occurs at the construction site, then the area for the Wastewater GardensÂ® can be staked out at the same time.<br><br>4.Inspection. If the project is large and/or requires steel reinforcement we will inspect the Wastewater GardensÂ® when it is framed and has piping in place, before the cement is poured. For smaller projects we inspect the Wastewater GardensÂ® after piping is in place to make sure the levels, and positions are correct.<br><br>5.After the cement is poured and/or the walls have been plastered we will supervise a water leak test for the systems.<br><br>6.Before gravel is placed in the systems we will visit the site to assure that the gravel is cleaned properly and suitably placed in the Wastewater GardensÂ®.<br><br>7.Planting &amp; final training. Depending upon what option you choose, either we will plant the Wastewater GardensÂ® or conduct a site visit to supervise the planting according to the design and plan. A list of suitable species is available upon request.<br><br>At this time we also hand over the system Maintenance Manual, and teach the staff in charge of maintenance the few simple procedures of how to operate and maintain the Wastewater GardensÂ®. Follow up visits are available upon request...<br><br>Wastewater GardensÂ® for the home:<br>To date, Wastewater GardensÂ® have been installed in over 250 homes &amp; residences worldwide.
