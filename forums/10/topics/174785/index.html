            <div class='col-md body'>By Loh Chee Kong, TODAY<br><br>SINGAPORE: If Singapore's Opposition parties have their way, the upcoming elections could turn out to be one of the most keenly contested since Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) redefined the electoral landscape in 1988.<br><br>Following last Saturday's announcement by the Worker's Party, the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) - made up of the Singapore People's Party (SPP), the National Solidarity Party, Singapore Malay National Organisation and the Singapore Justice Party - revealed yesterday that it is targeting five Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and three GRCs.<br><br>The SDA plans to contest the SMCs of Potong Pasir, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Timah, Ayer Rajah and MacPherson and the Tampines, Jalan Besar and Pasir Ris- Punggol GRCs.<br><br>Mr Sin Kek Tong, SPP's chairman, and an SDA committee member told Today: "We have looked at which areas we can target based on ground support, past voting patterns and various factors. But whether we can field the required number of candidates will very much depend on our ongoing recruitment drive."<br><br>If the SDA does get its necessary recruits, it will be fielding more candidates this time than in the last elections, when it contested in three SMCs and two GRCs, said Mr Sin, 60, who is eyeing the MacPherson seat. SDA founder and incumbent Chiam See Tong will contest in his ward of Potong Pasir, with Nominated MP Steve Chia working again in the Choa Chu Kang constituency. Plans for the other SDA candidates have yet to be finalised.<br><br>In December last year, the major Opposition parties reportedly met up and agreed to avoid three-cornered fights. They also agreed to contest in all nine single wards and at least six GRCs.<br><br>Last Saturday, the WP became the first Opposition party to lay down its cards in declaring that it would defend Mr Low Thia Khiang's Hougang seat as well as gun for the SMCs of Joo Chiat and Nee Soon East and the GRCs of Ang Mo Kio, Sembawang, East Coast and Aljunied.<br><br>This means that the Singapore Democratic Party, led by Dr Chee Soon Juan, is the last major Opposition party to reveal its plans for the upcoming general elections. - TODAY<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess most of us know that PAP will win whether there's voting or not. Elections are never fair anywhere. whichever party is able to get control of the media, will win. Singaporeans are too afraid to vote what they want. Like what I knew about the last elections, heard people talked about how much they wanted the oppositions to win, yet voted for PAP. Such situation will happen again this time round.</div>
