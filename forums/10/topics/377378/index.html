              <p><strong>CXOtoday.com, 30 Sep 2009</strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">TCS Bags Singapore Govt. Contract </span></strong><br> <br> Tata Consultancy Services announced that it has been chosen by
              Singapore's People's Association to provide annual Application
              Management Services (AMS) for two years. <strong><span style="color: red;">The
              deal is reportedly a multi-million dollar one in which the People's
              Association -- a grassroots government organization in Singapore --
              will have its citizen-centric and mission critical applications
              maintained by TCS.<br> </span></strong><br> According to the agreement, TCS will develop and maintain People's
              Associations' business, citizen-centric applications and mission
              critical applications. This involves consolidating its multiple vendor
              environments, allowing for reduced maintenance costs and simplified
              system administration. This process is hoped to improve efficiency and
              staff productivity across the organization, since TCS will lower costs
              that would otherwise have been spent on application maintenance. The
              increased efficiency and productivity will have a positive effect on a
              citizen's experience with the agency.<br> <br> The government/public sector is one of the focus areas for TCS in Asia
              Pacific, where the company already has a proven track record. <strong><span style="color: red;">The
              company has worked locally with Singapore's flag carrier SIA, Temasek
              Holdings, GIC, DBS Bank, etc. Recently, TCS had recently implemented
              TCS BaNCS Corporate Actions business application for the Government of
              Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC).</span></strong><br> <br> Girija Pande, EVP and head, TCS Asia Pacific, said, "We have instilled
              strict quality control procedures and continue to drive more value for
              our Singaporean clients through increased service quality provided by
              our team of highly qualified people with local knowledge of culture and
              processes."</p>

              <p><br>Is this yet another brilliant foolish display from a X-rated kid ?</p>
              <p>The contract to TATA is said to be a "multi-million dollar" deal and the X-rated kiddo can claim that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">(1) Save's taxpayer monies with cheaper outsource provider, leaving more monies for vital community projects</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Are there any "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">monies left for vital community projects</span></em>" <strong>when the "multi-million dollar" is paid to TATA's account in INDIA, and is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer in circulation</span> in Singapore to boost the economy as some form of catalyst</strong> ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did the X-rated kid come to such a stupendous conclusion that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">(2) Freeing and releasing more of our IT talents into more vital and higher paying jobs with MNCs, while India gets their talents to cope with cheap paying jobs</span></em>" - even as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/singapores_central_provident_fund"><strong>Singapore Jobless Rate hits 4.8% - and going to worsen</strong> (1)  </a>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only the bankrupt values of a X-rated mind can think of such unscrupulous and demeaning methods to dare state that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">(3) our next generation will get to learn and see how the programme and software works, how it can be done cheaper than what we this generation can do, then it will be truly 'tata!!' to TATA when we kick em out and do it on our own, hopefully be able to maintain voluntarily by 17 years old kids for the communities..</span></em>" - does this not confirm again the X-rated expertise at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">copying and plagiarizing</span></strong> the works of others ?</p>
              <p>Has Singaporean lost the creative abilities and need to sink to such low levels ?</p>
              <p>How does the award of the "multi-million dollar contract" help Singapore's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/default.aspx">Nanyang Technological University efforts at being a “great global university founded on science and technology – to nurture creative and entrepreneurial leaders through a broad education” (*2) </a>?</p>

              <p><br>How else can the bankrupt mind of an X-rated kid work, except to irresponsibly leave everything to be managed by others without a second thought to the consequences ?</p>
              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">what we socially paid out better comes back with returns of better social infrastructures such as schools, quality teachers to churn out better young adults, heatth care, and MOST importantly - our cpf monies with interests when we retire!!!!</span></em>"</p>
              <p>Can the X-rated kid appreciate the deteriorating state of affairs in Singapore, and believe that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">our CPF monies will be returned with interests when we retire</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>The CPF system was designed as a pyramid that need a continuous supply of new contributing members to form the large base of the pyramid - so as to support the number of retirees withdrawing from the CPF at the top.</p>
              <p>Can this model be sustained when the pyramid is inverted with a low birth rate that continue to shrink the numbers contributing to the CPF, and the large numbers of "baby-boomers" from the '40s and '50s are swelling the number of retirees reaching age 60 at this time and into the future ?</p>
              <p>The reality is stark and the gloomy CPF picture was already known as early as in 1984, when the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howe_Yoon_Chong">Howe Yoon Chong Commission (*1) </a>had reported that the withdrawal age for CPF had to be raised from age 55 to 60 - but without the truth being explicit said about the CPF that will scare the population.</p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans not begin to ask why is the withdrawal age continuously being revised from 55 to 60, from 60 to 65, and now at one stroke to age 85 ?</p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans not ask for the reasons why more schemes are introduced that will see deductions being made from CPF accounts, with dubious claims of providing income for old age - when the deductions are making huge profit for the organisations managing the deducted funds, and giving paltry return to the CPF members ?</p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans not express concern that a X-rated kid is propagating the plagiarized false statement that it is best for Singaporeans to leave others to manage our CPF funds without any interference or oversight from the CPF Members ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>" <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">just as those who contribute their cpf back at the 60s couldnt believe their eyes when they got money back with interest when they grew old, so much so they spluge it on young nuble PRC gals!</span></em> "</p>
              <p>Where did the X-rated kid plagiarize this statement from, and will baldly spout "lies and half-truths" with such hollow outspoken authority ?</p>
              <p>How many of those who withdraw their CPF accounts had actually splurge on the "<em>young nuble PRC gals</em>" that motivate the X-rated mind to tarnish every retiree with a broad and slanderous stroke of careless statement ?</p>
              <p>Is this not another characteristic display of the X-rated kid blindly copying from statement made by others, and will then shamelessly paste it as his own ?</p>
