            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Dear Claude,<br><br>As much as I like to agree with you that Singapore is not treated fairly, I must say that it is brought onto by ourselves- OUR Government and Singaporeans.<br><br>You see, our recent government does not have any back bone. They are always concerned with only economic progress and money making. It is their priority- its probably our survival (though strongly contested)  - though not a bad thing- they have forgotten to raise the profile and dignity of Singapore in the international stage. In their minds- everything is the economy and everything else takes second place- whether free speech, people's livelihood, leisure, workers and Union's rights,  foreign talent, immigration and even towards Malaysia. We have been playing the submissive role, the supporting role and Singaporeans are always not better than foreigners etc. Where has there been a time where we have been the leader in other stuff like the Iraq war, East Timor, war against terrorist (not to mention our generals were raise to ranks of BG, Lt.General or Major generals without even going for war). We are just too easy to play the follower of USA and Australia and foreigners. That puts ourselves in the 2nd or even 3rd position- we lose our own ability to command respect.<br><br>We are just too easy to forgive a wrong and too willing to make concession. Take Michael Fay, by consenting to reduce from 6 canes to 4 its already a breach.<br><br>You see we do not have an active political participation to enforce this. Look at Michael Fay, the US citizens and his fellow districts and even his President raised up to defend him. Where is our social consciousness to enforce the extradiction of Michael McCrea for national dignity? Who can we blame when we have been surpressed of such feelings by our government for the last 40 years?<br><br>As such it also created a culture of reservation and fear of speaking up for fear of being ridiculed or be "Made responsponsible or even being sued for it".<br><br>So this case is not Australia's fault. It is our fault for not raising our national dignity and the PAP government holds the largest responsibilty for it.<br><br>Also I have to include, our laws are well know to be dragcanian, dogmatic and is not seen as fair in our age of modernity, openness and the Intenet.<br><br>So before we blame others, let start looking ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves what have we contributed to this. As Singaporeans, we have allowed the government to extend this vicious cycle for too long- so much so that they now even think that foreigners are better than Singaporeans.<br><br>I think by awareness is already the first step for us to take action to prevent this from happening again. What action to take is probably within us to do in 1 or 2 years time. Its a choice we have to make- servitude or freedom.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure. I can understand.<br><br>A foreigner upon arriving singapore was desperate to get a visa to stay for a year, met this con man who claims he can get this for a fee. upon getting the payment and providing all false inofrmations disappeared. Fortunately, the victim manage to remember the IC number and reported to police.<br><br>The police promptly, traced the culprit and " charge him for cheating " and was jailed 3 months after he pleaded liniency. All this without any written proof but merely some recording taken by the victim while having conversation with the conman.<br><br>Another case, an undischarge bankrupt issued 2 cheques signed by him and when reported to the police, they say they cannot take any action.<br><br>Another case involving a english lawyer whose car went up a curb and killed a korean family and was classified as mis-adventure. If the driver is a singaporean, it would have been different. According to singapore traffic rule, as long as you hit or killed someone, whether you are in the right or wrong, you will be charged for negligence etc.... nothing as mis-adventures but why is it so for this case. Culprit -- english lawyer free as a bird after killing a korean family. I'm very lost. Without prejudice.</div>

With a president as emotional and thick as G.W Bush, I'm sure if Singapore does anything "inhumane"/"uncivilised" to American citizens, there will be an American occupational force here.<br><br>Or perhaps, the above mentioned situations/crimes are part of a larger global conspiracy, one which we have absolutely no knowledge of... we can only watch the skies... ok now that was lame.<br><br>But I believe the economic policy is logical somewhat... but is economic stuff more important than social justice?</div>
