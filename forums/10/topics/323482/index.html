              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called for more Singaporeans to donate according to their means and from their heart. <br><br>Mr Lee was speaking at the opening of the new premises of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre, called The Giving Place. <br><br>Last year, charitable donations to non-profit organisations (Institutions of Public Character) increased by more than 50 per cent to S$280 million. <br><br>Every society has to take care of its people, especially the vulnerable groups, said Mr Lee. <br><br>He added that this has to be done either by the state or through private initiatives by getting the more successful Singaporeans to help the weaker ones. <br><br>"The more they have gained from society, the greater their obligation to give back something to their fellow citizens. They must not allow society to be split between the haves and have-nots, and undermine the whole basis for able people to succeed and create wealth in Singapore," said Mr Lee. <br><br>He noted that Singapore has yet to build a strong philanthropic tradition. <br><br>However, many Singaporeans are donating generously to good causes, and this started with our forefathers who came to Singapore in search of a world of new opportunities. <br><br>So, successful Singaporeans should be encouraged to donate a portion of their wealth to endow charitable foundations. <br><br>For this purpose, the Community Foundation of Singapore has been set up to offer advice to high net worth individuals wishing to support worthy causes. <br><br>To date, nearly S$13 million has been raised. Among its contributors is William Bird, a British citizen who is now a Singapore Permanent Resident. <br><br>Mr Bird said: "The Community Foundation of Singapore - one of the objectives is to help and advise people like myself who haven't quite decided where they should place or donate their charitable funds. <br><br>"I will be spending time talking to other people in the community foundation and making my decision in the next few months which charities I feel deserving." <br><br>The centre has been helping to foster the spirit of giving in Singapore. <br><br>This spirit is evident in the many contractor-related and legal services provided free of charge by companies for the completion of the centre's new premises at Clarke Quay. - CNA/ir </span></p>

              <p>Whatever it is, LEE HSIEN LOONG, LEE KUAN YEW AND PAP PARTY must set good examples before telling the nation to do so.     Suck so much money from the people and as a government who have obligation to help the poor is pushing it to the common people to do so, so that they can feel free be carefree not to worry about the poor and continue to suck more and more of our money.</p>
              <p>LEE HSIEN LOONG Never stops talking cock.    What a shame to have such a PM for Singapore.</p>

              <p>Personally I think the problem does not lies FULLY with the Decision-Makers, but with the lackeys.  Imagine this scenerio:</p>
              <p>Decision-Makers to Lackey: Based on last year donation results, we collected $10million. So this year target is $15million.</p>
              <p>Lackey to poor NSF: This year, each of you have to donate at least $15, if not....</p>
              <p>Lackey to Decision-Makers: Sir, we managed to collect $15million from the donation drive, what a success!</p>
              <p>Having said this, I think the decision-makers should be smart enough to realise that if things are so easily done, we won't be paying them millions to govern us. Anyway, which decision-markers go through the lifes of common citizens to realise that?</p>
              <p>To me, the only solution is to highlight such events to relevant medias so that such issues can be looked into through public awareness. And mind you, when I say medias, I don't mean the medias owned by the Lackeys.</p>

              <p>It is so convenient, so easy job for Lee hsien loong to push job to the people of Singapore.   Why not let us have the share of his salary?   He has not done anything to contribute the 2% GST to helping the poor, so now he is singing a new tune to ask the people, the nation to help the poor instead.    To a leader who can't keep up to his promise, there is really nothing at all people can base on to respect, rely and trust this hopeless PM.     Any problem he does not want to solve he easily pushes it to the people, so easy job as a PM and get paid so many million salary.    He has the most secure job in the world, nobody dare sack him, make him redundant.   Indeed, he has iron rice bowl.  </p>
