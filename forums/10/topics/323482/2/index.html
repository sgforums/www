              <p>The root cause of many of our problems is one and the same as found in
              NKF. Why do we the citizens have to set up charities to look after
              basic health care like NKF or Renci? It is because our citizens being
              sucked dry of monies are no longer able to afford medicare like
              treatment of Kidney disease?<br> <br> It is all the result of relentless sucking of monies by the government from the citizens.<br> <br> It is all because of government taxing, hoarding of taxes and creating
              all the schemes like GLCs to charge citizens fees for services which
              should have been funded by taxes paid.<br> <br> If government does not pay for or subsidize such basic services it
              should not tax and hoard monies so that people can look after their own
              welfare.<br> <br> The citizens are simply taken for a ride with a government taking
              monies all the time to create surpluses and profiteering tin every
              service provided if at all. That is why today citizens can no longer
              afford their basic medicare and retirements and are forced to turn to
              charity or begging to survive.<br> <br> The real solution is not to ask the rich for assistance or charity but
              for PM Lee to stop all the taxing and hoarding of monies and charging
              of all basic services .</p>

              <p>Oh yes.    The only group of people who does not need to worry about bread and butter issue is PAP.  They have more than sufficient money to live by.   They take so much from society, thus they ought to give back to society.   Like what Lee hsien loong said</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The more they have gained from society, the greater their obligation to give back something to their fellow citizens</span>.</p>

              <p>You mean LHL's grandmother is still alive?   The lee family does not need any hell notes from anyone,   I believe they have obtained approval from the Ruler of Hell to bring along their Sing dollars there.   That is why they keep earning so much quick bucks from the nation to prepare to bring it to hell.</p>
