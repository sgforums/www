            <div class='col-md body'>No you didn't.  You said that they didn't provide senior researchers, which they did.  What they didn't provide was brand names that A*STAR could brag about.<br><br>Why is it irrelevant?  If you had a background in research, you would know this, but I'll enlighten you.<br><br>If research is done right, it will meet accepted standards of quality.  These standards are designed to ensure that the conclusions reached are sound enough to act upon.  The methodology must be designed in such a way that no other explanations for the results is more plausible than the one being put forward by the researchers.  The analyses must follow a clear, cogent process that pertain directly to the matter being studied.  The interpretation of the results must not be extended beyond what the results state.<br><br>The above is a summary of the requirements of proper research, and obviously the devil is in the detail.  The research process is examined in detail and critiqued at two key points, namely at the time of application for approval to proceed with the research, and during the editors' review before the research is published.  JH has had plenty of experience over the decades of meeting these standards, and indeed their reputation hinges upon this continuing - they have nothing to gain and everything to lose by cutting corners.<br><br>While the process of ensuring that research is a complex one, competent researchers would know the rules and be mindful of them at every step of the study.  As long as the rules are adhered to, the research is sound and the results and conclusions are solid enough for applied purposes.<br><br>Bottom line: if you're interested in research, keep your eye on the process and standards, not who's conducting the research.  The brand name is therefore irrelevant and A*STAR's insistence on brand names is therefore misguided.<br><br>That is, unless they have ulterior motives.<br><br>What IS your background, by the way?  I would like to know what level I'm supposed to be presenting my points at, so that I can make myself clearly understood here.</div>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe JH and A*STAR were supposed to be in <span style="color: red;"><strong>PARTNERSHIP</strong></span>.<br><br>Just to clarify, partnership doesn't mean master-and-servant or employee-and-boss, despite A*STAR's wishes.  There are no bosses, masters, captains, generals or any other hierarchical labels of power for the weak-minded to hang on to like life rafts in a storm.<br><br>Anybody who's thinking that there's a boss in this scenario who gets the *ahem* pleasure of firing someone else really needs to:<br>a) find out what partnership means and;<br>b) grow up<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lionnoisy:</div><div class="quote_body">3.On brand name<br><br>JH itself already is a good brand name.Why u say they didnot provide?<br>What they did not provide is hard work to deliver under the contract.</div></blockquote>I didn't say it, A*STAR did in their litany of JH's sins.  You acknowledge the brand name value that A*STAR was getting out of riding on JH's coat tails, so you can see how ludicrous their bleating about brand names is.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lionnoisy:</div><div class="quote_body">4.JH was fired by ASTAR.A very disgraceful in academic history.<br>JH so far have not clarified.<br><br>Why?<br><br>They had not delivered according to contract.<br>What JH think is not iimportant.<br>What the boss,ASTAR,think is important.<br>Full stop.</div></blockquote>Again, with regards to this "boss" nonsense, you're just going to have to get a grip, lion.  In fact, A*STAR is going to have to get a grip too.  Within Singapore they may be backed by the holders of all the strings, but out in the real world they're nobody and carrying on like this will only lead to their own embarrassment.  After all, Idi Amin pronounced himself General, Doctor and so on, but did anybody take him seriously?  Same thing whern someone in a partnership has the temerity to call themselves boss.<br><br>Fact of the matter is that the very small pond that A*STAR's a big fish in is looking to get bigger, but this kind of thing just get's in the way of that goal.  Let's face it, who in their right minds wants to work with a bunch of tin-pot dictators?<br><br>Sure, within Singapore what A*STAR thinks is important and what JH think isn't.  Then again, if Singapore wants to become a technology hub, they'd jolly well better start getting a grip on reality and understand that on an internationa stage, a whisper from JH carries a helluva lot more weight than all of A*STAR's yammering and stammering.<br><br>Why hasn't JH said too much about this?  Open your mind and consider other possibilities instead of going "full stop" - that's like a child saying, "it is too!". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Unlike A*STAR, they're polite, intelligent and, most importantly, they know how the political situation works internationally.  It is better for them not to dignify A*STAR's yapping with a response.  Getting into an open debate with them only makes them look defensive to the people whose opinions really matter (i.e. their other current and potential research partners, and funding bodies like the NIH).  JH already knows that nobody outside of Sinagpore is going to take A*STAR's standing over theirs, and getting into an argument only wastes time and drags them down to A*STAR's level - there's simply no mileage in it.<br><br>In contrast, A*STAR's whinging and dirt-throwing just makes them look stupid and childish - they obviously have no idea how polite society conducts itself, and research institutions are going to be wary of dealing with people who have no compunction about acting like louts just because they're favoured children at home, so effectively A*STAR's just shot itself in the foot.<br><br>Go have a read of Altbach's article again, and if you're not entirely dense you'll see that he's subtly saying that A*STAR's behaviour only does themselves harm because the other kids in the sandbox won't want to play with someone who spits the dummy.</div>

This is a common clause in most government contracts. Otherwise, it would seem like Johns Hopkins has just walked away with $82 million plus 12 months' winding-down funds from Singapore.<br><br>What were the tangible benefits to Singapore since the collaboration started in 1998?<br><br>Why were KPIs not in place when the agreement was signed in 1998? How then would the success of the partnership be measured? The KPIs were implemented only in 2003.<br><br>While the alarm was sounded on Johns Hopkins having significant problems in the research and education programmes as early as 1999, why was A*Star funding not halted while it sorted out its problems but instead more funds were poured in?<br>Its problems had effectively attracted an increased budget of $75 million over five years.<br><br>Did Johns Hopkins deliver on its obligation of raising $23 million to date?<br>In our zealousness to attract world-class talents to Singapore to jumpstart the development of a specific industry, I hope that all public agencies will be more vigilant in monitoring the usage of public funds and to be more decisive when agreements are not working out.<br><br>While this incident is now behind us, it is a good lesson (albeit an expensive one) that even world-class brand names can fail at times.<br><br>Phoon Kok Hwa<br><br></div>

Because as you say, brand is not important. But you know, some people buy banded goods not because of the brand, but because it is known for its quality, comfort or other stuff. Surely there ought to be a difference between Assistant prof and a full prof, like experience, knowledge or other qualities. I suppose its hard to show you the difference between assistant prof and full prof when you are already a prof or doing work equivalent to a prof.<br><br>Beside you have yet to present the most important fact that would convince me. What did a star stand to gain by breaking off the relationship??? right now, other university may think twice about collaborating with a star and they knew this would happen if they break the relation.

Because as you say, brand is not important. But you know, some people buy banded goods not because of the brand, but because it is known for its quality, comfort or other stuff. Surely there ought to be a difference between Assistant prof and a full prof, like experience, knowledge or other qualities. I suppose its hard to show you the difference between assistant prof and full prof when you are already a prof or doing work equivalent to a prof.</div></blockquote>By the same measure, a Toyota gets you economically and safely from Point A to Point B, and on Singaporean roads you're limited in speed.  So why do people buy Ferraris in Singapore?  The show-off factor.  Don't go applying a purely rational decision-making model to everything because it doesn't apply to everything.<br><br>And yeah, a wallet is a wallet is a wallet.

I have yet to heard of anyone saying that A star will get back their money or take over their equipments or their work in singapore.</div></blockquote>If A*STAR is anything like the other government department that I mentioned at the beginning of this thread, and there's no reason to say that it isn't, they'll already have gotten enough ideas of JH to complete the rest of the project by themselves without having to cut JH in on any of the action.  Maybe they figure that what they've got is enough to set them up as a technology hub, so it was time to make sure that they kept all the goodies for themselves, just like the other department tried to sell the electronic tagging system.<br><br>It's a dirty but simple tactic.  Deliberately make the whole process unworkable and drive off the partners, and then come back later and finish it off without the partners.  It's entirely pausible because similar things have already happened in Singapore.</div>

Don't forget that it could equally be that not enough students made the mark, and JH wasn't going to take on substandard students just to make up the numbers.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, goody!  Plenty of questions for me to answer! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And your words make me wonder, what are prof and all research students for if research is that easy?<br><strong>Well, by the time the students get to the research stage, they would typically have become the top 10% of the top 5% that get past Honours to postgrad.  By the time they make it there, research principles should be second nature to them (although, admittedly, there is the occasional student who manages through slip through the filter).  Within those circles, they should already understand the rules well enough to make it easy.  It's takes knowledge rather than intelligence to conduct competent research - the intelligence simply comes in the conceptualisation stage of the process, and JH has plenty of that on hand.</strong><br><br>Why did we need good students for research?<br><strong>You don't.  It's more of a fringe benefit.  That said, having a competent student as a dog's body that you won't have to watch all the time gives the researchers respite from the crap work so they can focus on the real issues.</strong><br><br>why did research seems endless??<br><strong>You obviously haven't done research before.  Getting past the research approval stage, especially the ethics commitee, takes a long time because all the angles crucial to the study's success have to be considered.  Depending on the nature of the data to be collected, it may take some time.  Typically, getting participants for the studies is the most time-consuming part of the process.  Once you have your data, it's a piece of cake.</strong><br><br>Why did it even take years to complete one project?<br><strong>See above.</strong><br><br>Why did we even need to inject so much money into research?<br><strong>Not that I'm any purveyor of medical equipment, but you would expect a fairly hefty bill for the gear to conduct biomedical research, wouldn't you?  On top of that, add salaries and research grants into the equation and pretty soon it adds up to real money.</strong><br><br>why did we even need to call a assistant prof a assistant prof when he is as competent as a prof?<br><strong>It's a rank thing.  Why are some COs colonels while others are majors? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Seriously, most systems are based upon a number of criteria that vary from institution to institution.  Unfortunately, one flaw is that one of the criteria is simply the number of publications per year and in total that the academic puts out, not taking into account the quality of the publications.  I've seen so-called professors churning out utter piffle over and over again, and they still get their professorships.  I've seen others get granted the status as a political reward for bringing in research funding.  So you see, as I've been saying all along, it doesn't really mean all that much.</strong><br><br>Why is it that even students that are up to mark did not even think of applying to JH?<br><strong>As I said in my previous post, do we really know if they didn't apply, or did they have to pass through A*STAR first?</strong><br><br>Also for brand name, why is it that the minute i know my friend buys a volvo, i know he views safely as very important?<br><strong>Again, it's the brand name, isn't it?  For years, Saab have actually trounced Volvo in the safety stakes, but Volvo's still the name associated with it.  It illustrates the association between the name and reality.</strong><br><br>Why is it that if he buys evo, i know he is a chongster? shows there are quality associated with brand name.<br><strong>Well, I'd answer this one if I knew specifically what a chongster was. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></strong><br><br>Why don't they buy toyota which is cheap and able to transport them to the right location?<br><strong>Well, it supports my point, doesn't it?  Reality and pragmatism don't always figure into the picture, and it's more of a self-image issue.</strong><br><br>why is it that when things are made in china, most people thought it is an inferior product??<br><strong>Well, what markets does China traditionally operate in?  Until recently, it's been low-tech products that peasants - excuse me - Chinese citizens can produce at a lower price than others, such as shoes, clothes, toys and fabrics.  They're still working their way up in the higher-tech markets because the purchase decisions in those brackets tend to require more careful consideration of the products' capabilities, and they still fall short of the market leaders there (unless the products are produced under license).</strong><br><br>How did companies even able to make some product into a brand?<br>Just set high prices??<br><strong>Of course.  Rolex don't make the best watches in the world, and if you wanted to tell the time, you would buy a Casio at a hundredth the price.  Despite that, they raise their prices by between 7 and 8 percent every 12 to 24 months.  Hans Wilsdorf, the founder of Rolex, is acknowledged to have been one of the best marketers of his time, and he built up the brand name well beyond the actual value of the product.  Despite the fact that prices have fairly much doubled over the past ten years for the same product, sales rates have not dropped.  Why?  Brand name.</strong><br><br>Why did A star had to bother with collaborating with JH?<br><strong>Let's face it, Singapore's spent decades hammering the "yes sir, no sir, three bags full" mentality into the people, and then when the Thais, Indians and other nationalities came about being able to produce the same things at a third the price, Singapore finally got a wake-up call and realsied that they had to get into the R&amp;D game fast, because inflation had gotten way too high to supposrt the old game of producing electronics and other goods for a low price.  It's fairly obvious that they would look to slingshot their way into research by learning whatever they could from established researchers.  Unfortuantely, once they figure they've got the hang of it, they've got the unfortunate habit of killing the goose.</strong><br><br>If they want ideas, why don't they pay big money to entice the researchers over to singapore? They pay even bigger money to JH.<br><strong>Well, well, well.  As I've already mentioned, off the top of my head I can pick out three instances of where Singapore has mistreated the talent they bring in, and the world's not all that big.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if a number of big names have already heard what's going on and said, "No, thanks".</strong><br><br>Why is no of students even in their KPI (if their intention is to steal ideas)?<br><strong>Well, like I said, if you're engineering the situation to result in failure, it makes perfect sense to put in conditions that you can influence and create problems with, doesn't it?</strong><br><br>What is their plan and how are they going to transform singapore into a technology hub? (stealing ideas?)<br><strong>Three words: Suzhou New District.  The Singaporean government, having been burnt in that project, seem to have decided it was time the shoe was on the other foot.</strong><br><br>If stealing ideas is their way forward, why do they need so many students?<br><strong>See above in the response about the number of students.</strong><br><br>So, there we have it.  Thanks for asking those questions about brand name - it's allowed me to expand on what I've been saying all this time.  Any other questions? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

A*Star decided in May to pull the plug on its funding of the division when it failed to deliver on requirements like bringing in top researchers and training students.<br><br>Yesterday, Johns Hopkins said it respected the termination and was ''working with A*Star to wind down the existing DJHS programmes and develop appropriate transition plans''.<br><br>Both sides said they would like to work together again.<br><br>While this phase of the experiment has failed, there was still scope for future partnerships, said the director of A*Star's Biomedical Research Council, Dr Andre Wan.<br><br>''Scientists on both sides have already been floating up common areas of interest and discussions on further collaborations are already taking place.''<br><br>But first on the agenda is the 12-month ''winding down'' of operations at the division which was closed in June.<br><br>This includes finding jobs for staff and sourcing funding for the four postgraduate students.<br><br>The Straits Times understands this will cost A*Star substantially less than the $14 million needed to run the division annually.<br><br>Equipment and the space occupied by the facility in a building at the Biopolis in North Buona Vista will go to A*Star's other research institutes.<br><br>News of the A*Star-Johns Hopkins split, reported in top scientific journals like Nature, has resulted in some local scientists questioning the strategy of courting big foreign names.<br><br>Said Dr Ting Choon Meng, 47, chairman and chief executive of medical devices firm HealthStats International: ''We can't expect to just jump-start a medical hub here by luring the big names and giving them what they ask for. We can't just create franchises.''<br><br>But A*Star's collaborations with at least six other foreign institutes, like Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, may prove otherwise.<br><br>Its president, Professor Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, said defining clearly the expected goals at the outset was critical in such collaborations.</div>
