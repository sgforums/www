            <div class='col-md body'>Fair enough, lion, that's a rational approach to take and that can't be faulted.  However, consider:<br><br>1) If JH was as bad as A*STAR makes them out to be, how did they get to where they are today?  It stands to reason that if they were so bad at delivering, they would have died out as a research centre long ago.<br><br>2) JH is very experienced in dealing with the rigorous compliance issues of bodies such as the NIH.  That A*STAR petulantly insisted on having "brand name" researchers despite standards having been met certainly is a case of A*STAR going out of their way to make the working relationship difficult.  Would one not be inclined to wonder why A*STAR threw that spanner in the works?<br><br>3) A*STAR, in typical Singapore government style, has approached this issue in the manner of a court case.  What they don't seem to realise is that this is not being tried in court, and instead other international research bodies will be examining the matter to fidn out what dealing with Singapore is like.  At the rate A*STAR is going, they're not making Singapore look at all attractive for research partnerships, and that's just shooting Singapore's biomedical resrach ambitions (amongst others) in the foot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><br><br>It seems to be a common characteristic that runs through the government and its agencies to behave in the same manner as A*Star - in dictating terms and conditions to JH, as was also seen with the IR Committee telling the various Casino operators their nit-picking preferences that impinge on the operators' room to operate - resulting in the early pulling out of a few operators resulting in the postponement of the bidding date, and with the package of terms reviewed.<br><br>Based on the present inexperience of the local Civil Servants in operating casinos, they submitted themeselves to the glib experience of Sands Corporation, who was able to force their own views onto the nit-picking minds of the Singapore Civil Servants.<br><br>The entire IR would have been a botched job if the Civil Servants had got their way, and it will be a matter of time before government linked agency - such as the NTUC - will step in to open an IR of its own under the guise of elevating the status of hard pressed Singapore Workers, along the same line as Orchid Golf Club - "the Workers' Golf Club".<br><br>Probably, NTUC will be asked to step into JH shoes with the health concern of a large pool of Singaporean Workers in the finanacial minds of the Elite Leadership.</span></div>

For 7 of these KPIs, DJHS was unable to even meet the 1st year targets by the end of the 2nd year.<br><br>13 The Agreement allows A*STAR to discontinue funding DJHS if it decides after formal review and with due process, that DJHS is not likely to succeed in achieving its KPIs.</blockquote>2.At least ASTAR put up his case with some concrete evidences.<br>The past performance of JH is not related in this issue.<br>Pl just check if JH has fulfilled their obligations according to<br>the agreements.Of course ,each party may has different interpartations.<br><br>Eg,para 10 and 11.<br><blockquote>10. The Agreement also required DJHS to recruit 12<br><strong> senior investigators with international reputation to appointments at DJHS and with full-time residence in Singapore by February 2006......</strong><br><br>11......When A*STAR raised its concerns, JHU responded that at Hopkins they prefer to hire capable and ambitious junior scientists rather than bring in "big names".

A-star definitely wants some success, if not they pay so much for what.<br><br>JH believes in junior staff. But what can junior staff do without learning the ropes in doing research. They need senior investigators to guide them. I believe that with senior investigator, research can be done at a faster pace. And A-star wants students as well. And Singaporean students who can learn and work hard. So that when they learn the stuff, they can return and contribute. And that when we can stop depending on foreign senior investigators.<br><br>And i really wonder why so many people are so quick to condemn A-star. Here I thought i would really condemn A-star if they still continue paying JH so much tax payers money and yet won't help much in building Singapore research environment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see how you can call A star as ignorance. As lion article shows, A star don't only want brand name. They want the substance behind the name. They want good researchers in singapore to build up the technology in singapore and also to train up researchers. Thats why A star pay so much to JH. And it appears that A star got neither good researchers nor students and that why they terminated the contract. And you call A star ignorance???<br><br>And i wonder about what you mean by R&amp;D game? You mean in this game, i pay lots of cash for the brand name of a college and yet in return i should only expect to get some brunt food?

If it meets well-established standards (which is necessary if it's going to be of any use to JH), the product will not be burnt food as you have described it.
