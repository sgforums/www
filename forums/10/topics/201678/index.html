            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--A research collaboration between Johns Hopkins University, and Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research or A*Star is likely to end soon, with the joint facility at Singapore's biomedical center, Biopolis, to close in a year, the Straits Times reported quoting researchers and officials.<br><br>The newspaper said four local students who were awarded doctorate scholarships to study at the university in Baltimore were also told last month the research division won't fund their studies.<br><br>An A*Star spokesman told the newspaper the decision was taken by the leadership of the U.S. university and the state funded agency to replace the current "operating model of collaboration" with a "new model of partnership" that is still being developed<br><br>However John Hopkins University had a different view.<br><br>A spokesman for the university said it had done its part to recruit faculty and graduate students under its agreement with A*Star. The university maintains that its Singapore partner has not kept up its end of the deal in meeting its "financial and educational obligations".<br><br>"Although Johns Hopkins University has attempted to be as collegial as is possible during this very difficult phase, the displacement of outstanding junior faculty recruited from throughout the world, and the intense disruption of graduate student education, cannot be underestimated or dismissed," the spokesman told the newspaper.<br><br>Johns Hopkins came to Singapore in 1998 to carry out research, education and patient care activities. It also set up a medical center here, designated as Johns Hopkins Singapore's clinical arm for patient care and clinical research, which is still expanding, the newspaper said.<br><br>Singapore is trying to attract investment in the biomedical sector in an effort to diversify its manufacturing sector from a bigger reliance on electronics.<br><br><a href="http://framehosting.dowjonesnews.com/sample/samplestory.asp?StoryID=2006072202090011&amp;Take=1" rel="nofollow">http://framehosting.dowjonesnews.com/sample/samplestory.asp?StoryID=2006072202090011&amp;Take=1</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No big surprise there.  I've heard that 3M and IBM got screwed on projects by a certain government body that spent ages rejecting said company's proposals and then going on to complete the projects once said companies pulled out (to the extent that they even had the gall to patent 3M's idea for themselves).<br><br>Also, a while back I had a chance to speak to a neurologist who was rated as one of the world's top three researchers in his field.  He came to Singapore, apparently did not kiss a certain Dr Lee's ass to satisfaction, and ended up being accused by NUS of falsifying his data, all only after he had completed laying down the foundation for the research to be carried out by local doctors.<br><br>It seems the SG government has learnt well from mainland China.  We'll wine you and dine you until we've gotten what we've wanted.  After that, you can get f***ed.</div>

From what I see and hear, that seems to be pretty much the modulus operandi of our government organisations and statutory boards.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

What are your achievements in the field, pray tell?  You must be some serious bigshot if this Dr Lee's daddy can't touch you in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Without revealing too much information and identifying my source, one of the companies I mentioned was contracted by a government department to develop an electronic tagging system.  The development contract was set within a period of 18 months, and everything went fine for the first 6 months.  After that, the government department started dragging its feet on reviewing the work presented by the company and finding problems with the concepts  until the contract ran out.<br><br>The government decided not to extend the contract and the company cut its losses after wasting 18 months.  Lo and behold, within 2 years that particular Singapore government department was trying to sell an electronic tagging system to other countries, based upon the very concepts that they said were unworkable.  Last I heard, the company was fighting to block the sales in the other countries' courts, claiming IP violations.<br><br>You want to know the funny thing?  I didn't get this information from the company.  I got it from someone within that government department.<br><br>Do you really think it's that easy to sue a government?  What's the US government going to do - restrict arms sales?  The Singapore government's already thrown out the Privy Council because they don't like the Council's decisions, so are you really that naive as to believe that the threat of a lawsuit is going to have the government quaking in its boots? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Have you ever filed a patent?  I have, and many people I know personally and professionally deal with IP issues on a regular basis.  Mention government organisations like ST to any such people, and the first thing they'll tell you is to have your IP locked in airtight before breathing a word to them.  If you think I'm kidding, go ask around and find out for yourself what the word on the street is on that count.</div>
