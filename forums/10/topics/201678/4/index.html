Why are some COs colonels while others are majors?<br><br>Seriously, most systems are based upon a number of criteria that vary from institution to institution. Unfortunately, one flaw is that one of the criteria is simply the number of publications per year and in total that the academic puts out, not taking into account the quality of the publications. I've seen so-called professors churning out utter piffle over and over again, and they still get their professorships. I've seen others get granted the status as a political reward for bringing in research funding. So you see, as I've been saying all along, it doesn't really mean all that much. </strong><br><br>Does that mean that assistant prof cannot even generate piffle?
