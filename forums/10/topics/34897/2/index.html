            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, here's a take from an airsoft player.<br><br>If you own airsoft, keep them safe in an armory or locked away.  Always away from kids.  Thats all.<br><br>Which is precisely why the govt banned the weapons.<br>It is considered firearm, which is absurd.  Cos by definition, a firearm launches a projectile via chemical means ie.  gunpowder.<br><br>Another reason is as stated, some of these airsoft replicas look exactly like the real thing.  Except that it has a 6mm barrel.  Thats all.  In the US and Canada, all airsoft weapons MUST have a red tip, or they will be confiscated.<br><br>If you are interested in airsoft, don't bother buying them.  Just visit the few airsoft range in Singapore and rent them for a few hours.  Unless you are striving to shoot for the best results, u will quickly lose interest.  I heard Bishan CC has an airsoft club.  You can check them out.<br><br>Yes. Airsoft pellets can hurt people.  Causes bruises n such.  Hitting the eye is of course very possible.  But in most airsoft skirmishes, the ROE is that u cannot aim at the head, and u cannot fire under 5 meters.  Shots under 5 meters tend to be very painful... believe me.  Hittin the butt is highly reccomended.  =)<br><br>However, I have not heard of airsoft guns killing anybody.  Please, they fire 6mm PLASTIC bbs thats so light that to kill anybody with it, it needs to be propelled at more than 600fps to puncture flesh.  The highest FPS for airsoft I heard is slightly over 250fps.  Unless you fire an aluminium 6mm BB, (which i have no idea where anyone gets that), and if ur airsoft has hop up, and the target is less than 5 meters.  Still I feel a normal airsoft firing a 6mm metallic bb, will drop like a rock.  No, 6mm plastic bbs at 200fps do not kill, but they hurt like a bitch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Airguns uses 6mm lead rounds.  Kinda mini mushrooms with a 6mm diameter.  Yes, those can kill.  When the round impacts against a metallic surface or whatever, it flattens out completely, and can some time ricochet.  (Which is why we were advised not to shoot coke cans, being pepsi fans)<br><br>Airsoft is supposed to be a SAFE airgun sport that utilizes 6mm plastic BBs for safety instead metallic rounds.<br><br>Yes, agree, airsoft guns pose danger to animals and little children. Which is why I say, KEEP KIDS AWAY from your range or armory. They should just make airsoft reacreation shooting ranges to be set up in certain places only.  Allow Kids above 12 to go in, or they might just steal one and go roaming the streets with it.   I'd rather they play with them with close adult supervision, than to ban them completely and having them obtaining an airsoft discreetly and hurtin themselves.<br><br>If people like the idea of skirmishes (playing team games that u shoot one another with airsoft), then they can play at these facilities AT THEIR OWN RISK.  Of course, must insist on protective gear.<br><br>I mean, in HongKong, kids pop each other with airsoft all the time.  Yeah they cry sometimes, but after 2 days, they go back to the same routine.  But in Singapore, after they get a bruise, they cry and mommy will write a petition to ban these "dangerous" toys from hurting their children.  Just cause they can't be bothered to supervise their playing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In fact even in the US, there are thousands of Organisations promoting such sports, and it is both a common practice that they ensure Safety Gear MUST be worn prior playing skirmish or range practices.<br><br>People who worry about adults running around in public shooting civilians have to realise that Singapore does sell swords for "display", and we don't see people running around with swords slashing people they see. What about knifes ? They are more deadly than airsoft and we often recieve news of people getting stabbed. Precisely this is when you get to realise even normal everyday items can become weapons if you desire them to be. Its simply not fair to judge a sport deemed dangerous. There are other sports that are dangerous as well.<br><br>Age limit must be imposed, should airsoft be available for sale as well as documentations such as licence, Letter of Agreement(LOA), Legal Documents, so on.<br><br>Each airsoft should have a serial number and if the airsoft is found in public or with someone below age limit roaming around with it, it can be traced back to the owner etc.<br><br></div>

Just have to have controlled import.  Next thing you need, is just to organize training schools for shooting.

            <div class='col-md body'>That's the problem with Singapore you see, we want to all live in a place that is as clean and as safe as possible, and that sometimes means making extreme compromises. All this is fine and such, but then again, it's mainly up to the people to be responsible for their own actions, not the govt. In Switzerland, a large proportion of the civilian population carry firearms around, yet their crime rate is one of the lowest in the world. Of course, the same can't be said for America (partially because overly-siong gun laws keep guns away from innocent people who need them for self-defence but hardly stop the bad guys from obtaining them illegaly anyway.).<br><br>It's all down to a matter of mentality. As long as we dun want to be responsible for our own actions, that is, we assume somebody must always be looking out for us, things like airsoft will never make it here because these things require a great deal of personal responsibility for them to harmonize with soceity. Sadly, the reason the PAP treats us like little children is the very reason that's our mentailty, we lack the ability to take responsibility for ourselves, we just keep complaining, complaining and complaining.<br><br>Of course, one gripe though. Now the authorities want us to "think out of the box", but then again, they are the ones who put us into that box in the first place! Again a result of us pushing all the heavy duties of life and responsiblities into their hands.</div>
