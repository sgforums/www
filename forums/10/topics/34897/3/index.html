            <div class='col-md body'>you guys should be given a 3 rounds to zero right ?<br><br>try not to touch, bang, blow, twist, just don't do anything to the rear aperture. its damn sensitive, could mean a few cm off target. the screw comes loose every session, so you'll have to tighten it.<br><br>If you don't wanna stay that low, trust me, do your best in each session. Train until you can make 1 hole with 5 rounds. Bring it up to your coach. he/she might promote you provided he/she sees that you have leadership qualities as well as charisma.<br><br>i can give you tips, thats not a problem, but honestly speaking, when i fire using my personel rifle, i would say the rifle is part of my body, when i breathe it moves, when i load, its satisfied, and i decide when and where i want the pellet to go.<br><br>shooting is all about feeling. honestly speaking 90% before i pull the trigger, i already know where its going. its quite hard to explain, your gonna have to shoot for a long period of time until you get that feeling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for zeroing it doesn't matter if you hit the bull's eye. as long as you have all 5 shots all not farther than .5cm, from there its easy to zero.<br><br>usually 1cm is around ... 3 clicks.</div>
