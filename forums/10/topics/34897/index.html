            <div class='col-md body'>practically its like saying we should not cross, the road cause we might get hit down by a car, or swim cause we might drown, or fly cause we might crash, or walk cause we might trip and fall on an iron rod, or sit cause we might develop blood clot and die in 2 weeks, or take our meals cause we might choke, or sleep cause you might die in the midst of your sleep.<br><br>you give a tendecy ratio of 1:100. how about the tendency of 1000:100000000 considering what we do each day is a risk. i fly quite often and i fully understand the posibility of crashing. that people don't live each day in fear that something might happen.<br><br>where disability is an inevitable course of nature, some may be avoidable through treatments, where some just die and break NOK's heart. my sister decided to commit suicide and passed away, which was something i couldn't control of. though i know i was always in control of my life, i soon realised that somethings was out of my boundary to control.<br><br>where everyday accidents may be devastating be it fatal, or mere close call, it brings a new attitude to life. people know they might crash in a plane, which is precisely why aircraft manufacturer constantly research in technology, designs. to reduce flaws.<br><br>when reflect upon the issue, airsoft is classified as a sport or hobby rather than a rich man's toy. paintball guns had been a problem.<br>Though selling freely overseas, govt here are afraid to see colourful spots around the city. not to mention its chemical effect and certain magnitude of pain as those paintball guns have much higher velosity.<br><br>where it may be true that there is a posibility to convert these airsoft to real weapon, which was mentioned, it is by no means at my discretion to provide any solution to that. as always, its still a posibility.</div>
