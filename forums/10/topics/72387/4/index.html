            <div class='col-md body'>It is so enlightening to see such a balanced and educated retort in the ST Forum to Dr. Ong's mindless proposal.  It is also heartening to know that even our derided "quitters" like Mr. Phua here, still retain such concern for their homeland.<br><br><span style="color: red;">MP may have crossed the line with proposal<br>I WRITE to express my shock and disapproval of Dr Ong Seh Hong's comments during the procreation debate ('It's your 'duty' to procreate'; ST, March 10).<br><br>The notion that the duty to procreate is rooted in 'traditional Asian values' is misconceived. Taken in its proper context, the Chinese philosopher Mencius' words on filial piety - 'bu xiao you san, wu hou wei da' - more accurately refer to the duty to have male descen-dants to carry on the family name, and not to an abstract duty to have as many children as possible.<br><br>If Dr Ong is correct, then China must be the most lacking in tradi-tional Asian values because of its one-child policy.<br><br>Dr Ong's contention that childless couples 'would become a liability to the society in the future' is in itself irresponsible as it ignores such couples' contri-butions to society during their most productive decades.<br><br>In its proposed form, the 'Preventive Eldercare Account' discriminates against childless married couples and therefore may be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Singapore Constitution.<br><br>In any case, the Preventive Eldercare Account is unnecessary as the current CPF scheme appears to provide adequate social security to those in their sunset years.<br><br>Lastly, taking the argument to its logical conclusion, why should the 'sticks' apply only to married couples? Surely, being single and child-less must also be just as irresponsible, according to Dr Ong's conception, because singles also do not produce any descendants.<br><br>[color=red]The 'duty' to pro-create has never been recognised as a legal duty in any modern society, and the proposal to pass laws to punish those who have failed to live up to this expectation may have crossed the line.<br><br>EUGENE PHUA WEH KWANG<br>New York, USA </span><br><br></div>
