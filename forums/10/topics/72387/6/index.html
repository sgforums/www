The financial lever required to successfully push our career-motivated and independent-minded citizens into procreating would be far too exorbitant.  Such dollar-denominated policies have unworkable limits.  Even soft-dollar incentives like extended maternity leave have not demonstrated marked successes of any form.  (e.g. Germany's labor laws legislate maternity leave at a whopping 2 years!  And they still have one of the lowest birth rates in the world!)

Let me cite u a simple case.  I hv currently 2 babies...but in my husband's family of three siblings who r married, we r the only ones brave enuff to hv babies.  Sometimes we joke and say that when we r old...my 2 babies will hv to support us and his uncles and aunties.  You may argue that why should they support their uncles and aunties, since they were the ones who chose not to hv children anyway, furthermore I would nvr expect my children to support me, I m already planning for my retirement btw.<br><br>But come to think of it, they would be supporting their uncles and aunties indirectly.  As we grow older, we would require more healthcare and furthermore our earning power would depreciate.  Currently, for those who are working, how many of us can give our parents sufficient money to let them live comfortably?  I m lucky since both my parents as well as my father in law is working at the moment. But my father and my in law are retiring soon, so I worry whether I can contribute more to both sides families.<br><br>But that is not the main issue ....When I think of my two children, I hv to remind myself not to be a burden to them when I grow older so I actively try to save more for retirement and buy health, disabilty insurance to cover myself.  But I also know, there r many working adults esp. those who do not hv children who do not do that.  So when they grow old and start falling ill and do not hv enough for retirement and healthcare who has to take care of them.  Welfare from the govt...many may say, for these people hv did their economic duty to the country in their younger days.  But where is all the money going to come from??.....The state treasury....but where does the state treasury's money come from...people's income tax....and....the income tax....comes from our current children's pockets.  So if the ratio of young : old is now about 3:2, what about 20 years down the road, if less people reproduce....2:6???  Just imagine the amt of tax my children has to pay...to sustain an ageing nation.<br><br>Give the govt a break, it is not easy.  We all know that Singapore must maintain competitiveness amidst competition from M'sia, China and India...else eventually all the MNCs will move out of Singapore and then there will be more problem in the job market...so that is why alot of us r workin ourselves to dead.  So we also find that we do not really hv enuff family time ( I always feel so guilty about not spending enuff time with my children.)....so many choose not to hv children...why bring them to the world when we do hv time n money to take care of them.  But we really need the children...in economic sense for the country to survive....So really the govt is hving a difficult time balancing both.  So how??? If u were the govt, what would u do?  Very easy for us to sit back and criticise.  So if I let u be govt now.....and ask u to balance the equation....would u do it??  I think many would not.  So give them a break...I think many pple in govt already trying their best...we r afterall humans.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lyling, good post on the connundrum facing Singapore, Singaporeans and the Government of Singapore. However, one important equation you've left out, is that of the cost of living in Singapore. We all know the reasons why we need to have kids. But the question still remains, how can we afford it? The article I'll post in my next post is a simple calculation on the econmic viability of having a child in Singapore. Its simplistic, yes I know, but for the sake of this particular issue, it'll have to do for now.<br><br>Bear in mind, median household income is deceptive, it is almost certain that the numbers of those who earn above the median are a lot less than those who earn below the median.</div>

Studies have shown that companies having pro-family policies (as opposed to getting employees to work till they drop) actually do better and save on costs.<br><br>I stand by my opinion that monetary incentives/longer maternity leave to urge Singaporean policies must be backed up by pro-family/pro-employee changes to the Employment Act. These would include guarantees for mothers to get their jobs back, increased leeway for mothers to sue companies for wrongful dismissal etc. No matter how much we give would-be parents, it will come to nought if they fear for their jobs and livelihood because of the skewed labour policies in the name of attracting MNCs/increasing competitiveness.

Speaking at the event, Community Development Minister Yaacob Ibrahim urged firms to heed the example of those polled and be reassured that providing a better work-life balance can enhance their competitive edge.<br><br>'The sooner we dive into this, the faster we will see results.<br><br></div>

Slightly more than your $50 estimate but reasonable considering the factors listed.
