To threaten punishment for not adhering to someone's preconceived notion of what's acceptable or dutiful, is going to far.<br><br></div></blockquote>Precisely.  Technically, we are already punished for not having more children in the form of baby tax rebates which flow through to child-bearing couples.  Furthermore, single-child parents have disadvantages relating to choice of school.<br><br>Is Dr. Ong's suggested policy so very different from that of open discrimination against citizens by race, religion and income?  If a society is willing to kowtow to such brute social engineering, where then shall we stop?<br><br>I accept that Singapore already practices its own subtle forms of racial and religious discrimination.  However, the notion that it is OUR DUTY to bear children is one that should even shock us from our stupor of political and social apathy.</div>

The people or the garmen? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Getting more rubbish these days.<br><br>Garmen wants people to get married and have children. I will say: get married if you love has reach the next peak phrase - children or not doesn't matter because <strong>IN MARRIAGE, IT'S <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY</span> BETWEEN TWO</strong>. Even if the couple is childless due to circumstances (biological, social, financial, etc), bonds in marriage exist only in two. It's true children are reasons for fulfilling marriage, but when circumstances don't allow that - it's like your parents forbiding your relationship to the extend of disliking your partner.<br><br>Will you let that affect your relationship? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Usually what will people do? Fight and make sure their love remains stronger than what others thought it would fail.<br><br>Do they seriously thinking that having children means fulfilling marriages? Rubbish. Fulfilling marriage can happen with or without kids because... marriage is only between two.<br><br>P.S: Garmen should spend more time and money in looking after couples who TRULY desire kids but couldn't have them biologically (at least its part of their desire to enter the next phrase of their love) instead of employing negative reinforcement on the masses to make them breed.<br><br>Cheers</div>
