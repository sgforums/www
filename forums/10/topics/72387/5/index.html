            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times<br>MARCH 13, 2004<br><strong>MP ONG SEH HONG CLEARS THE AIR</strong><br>My speech taken out of context<br><br>I REFER to the report, 'It's your 'duty' to procreate' (ST, March 10), and the letters to the Forum (ST, March 12).<br><br>My Budget speech, which was made in Mandarin, had been taken out of context, resulting in these myths:<br><br>I dismissed the notion that family planning is a personal decision.<br><br>I suggested that procreation is a duty to the state, implying a legal duty.<br><br>I suggested using the stick on couples who do not have children.<br><br>I neither suggested such draconian measures nor called for the stick to be employed. I have not suggested that infertile couples be penalised.<br><br>I referred to procreation as a moral obligation to our parents, families, society and the country. I did not refer to it as a duty to the state.<br><br>The translation of the relevant part of my speech in Mandarin was: 'It is not only the bounden duty of everyone to procreate but it is also the moral obligation (or moral responsibility) of every citizen towards his family, parents, society and the state.'<br><br>However, the report omitted the words 'bounden' and 'moral' and quoted me as saying: 'Procreation is not only the duty of everyone but also the responsibility of every citizen towards his family, parents, society and country.' The omission of the two key words distorted my meaning.<br><br>When I drafted my speech, I took into account the feedback of my residents. Many suggested that where procreation was once a means to carry on the family name, today it served to make the family more complete. Several elderly constituents lamented that they felt life was incomplete because their children had not borne them grandchildren.<br><br>In Mencius' mind, knowing and not fulfilling one's parents' wishes makes one guilty of being unfilial. This was the intention of my allusion to Mencius.<br><br>My mention of moral responsibility to other citizens and to society at large, taken in the context of my speech, also refers to the belief that our actions have repercussions on others. In this sense, not having children today, which I agree is an individual's choice, has repercussions on society. In my speech, I also called for various incentives, like extending maternity leave up to the fifth child. This was not reported.<br><br>I noted that our early policy on family planning heavily penalised mothers who had more than two children. So I specifically called for 'refraining from penalising those who choose not to have children but to make the latter prepare for their old age'.<br><br>Procreation is a delicate matter and I have been balanced in my approach.<br><br>DR ONG SEH HONG<br>MP for Aljunied GRC<br><br></div>

True, all those major rebellions in Chinese history have almost always been preceded by the flooding of the Yangze and / or Huanghe.<br><br>A lot of politicians and bureaucrats ruling over Chinese people these days seem to think that the Chinese are a meek, placid and obedient people, a people they can manipulate and exploit at will for their own personal advantage. They obviously haven't read their history, which has demonstrated that, as alluded to by CX, the Chinese have a strong tradition of rebelling against inept and / or oppressive rulers. Major national revolutions have often been the driving force behind Chinese history, bringing about much needed change and national rejuvenation. Heck, never mind history, Dr Ong and his friends obviously don't know what happened in Hong Kong in July last year.<br><br>Will we have a 'revolution' of sorts at the next elections?</div>
