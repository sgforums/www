            <div class='col-md body'>I can imagine the firestorm that is going to be kicked up from this load of rubbish.  There should be no "duty" involved in living one's life.  A person's freedom of choice in choosing between procreating or not should never ever be allowed to be impinged upon.  The very thought that our MPs are allowed to spout such preposterous notions in public debate horrifies me.<br><br>I have lived a long and productive life in Singapore and I have served my duty for Singapore continuously through National Service and being an active participant in the nation's labour pool.  However, procreation IS AND SHOULD NOT be a duty.<br><br>Dr. Ong, as our society progresses, perhaps you should learn to drop your archaic, dynastic Middle Kingdom throwback behaviour.  Please leave us alone, if we want to be alone in life.<br><br>I fervantly believe that Dr. Ong owes this nation's citizens an apology for his unthinkable remarks.  WE ARE NOT SHEEP FOR YOU TO BREED AND MILK.<br><br><strong><span class="small">[b]It's your 'duty' to procreate </span></strong><br><br><strong>Carrots alone won't work; it's time for the stick, say several MPs, who want pressure put on married couples who don't want babies </strong><br>By Tee Hun Ching<br><br>HAVING babies is a duty. Make that a duty to self, society and country.<br><br>Alarmed? You should be, if you are married and have no desire to procreate.<br><br>MPs like Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied GRC) want to pump up the social pressure on such people whom he described as 'irresponsible'.<br><br>Yesterday, even as their counterparts continued pushing for carrots such as a five-day work week and cash incentives, Dr Ong and several MPs suggested it was also time to use the stick.<br><br>Indeed, the MPs argued passionately that procreation was a responsibility that people should fulfil regardless of sweeteners.<br><br>Adopting the most hardline stance among them all, Dr Ong emphasised traditional Asian values as he dismissed the common refrain that family planning is a personal decision.<br><br>Declared the father of three: 'Procreation is not only the duty of everyone, but also the responsibility of every citizen towards his family, parents, society and country.'<br><br>Those 'irresponsible' people who shun the stork, he said, should realise they would become a liability to the society in future.<br><br>To prevent this, he suggested making this group bear the costs of their old age by having them contribute to an account he called the 'Preventive Eldercare Account'.<br><br>The money in this account would then provide for their needs when they are old.<br><br>He said he believed that Chinese philosopher Mencius' words on filial piety - 'bu xiao you san, wu hou wei da' - still has relevance today. Translated, it means that 'of the three instances of unfilial behaviour, not having descendants is the worst'.<br><br>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC) also held out a Chinese phrase for those naysayers against children to ponder over - ai qing the jie jing. It means a baby is the product of love.<br><br>Marriage and having children came naturally to people of his generation without too much cost-benefit analysis, noted the 45-year-old father of two.<br><br>'Sure, there were problems and difficulties, but they add colour and richness to life. If you ask parents today, few of them would regret having babies despite all the difficulties,' he said.<br><br>He suggested an annual Love Campaign to add spark to the lives of young couples and help them appreciate the joy and fulfilment of having a family.<br><br>'It is like driving a car. We have the best engine, the lubricant is new and the tank is full. But when we turn the key, the engine does not come on because there is no spark in the chamber,' he said.<br><br>Dr Ong went a step further and proposed an all-out media blitz to promote family values.<br><br>Such messages, he said, could be transmitted through TV dramas 'highlighting the sorry plight of a childless old couple and the great problems faced by an ageing society'.<br><br>Joining in the chorus of MPs who lamented the erosion of values that led to having children being viewed less as a duty than a personal choice was Ms Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol), who is single.<br><br>She said while children were a status symbol of sorts in the past, the reverse is true today.<br><br>The MP, who admitted she faced pressures to get married especially during Chinese New Year from well-meaning relatives, said: 'In the not-so-distant past, we had less to eat and wear, but we had more children to show. Today, we analyse and analyse the cost until we become paralysed by it.'[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree! it's indeed a big load of rubbish!<br><br>i was really shocked and angry when i 1st read the article printed in straits times. this load of dirt and rubbish was said by an aljunied mp. wad the heck is the govt thinking and doing?? having babies ornot is our own rights. nothing to do with them. they even want to have love campaigns. kaoz. campaign here campaign there. everything uso campaign. why not campaign for a less interventionist govt who can just scram out of our private lives. to love and to make babies is our choice. nothing to do with them. they have no right to interfere.  they are even suggesting some scheme to lock our money when the childless couples grow old. wad the heck. isn't the cpf enough? and do they really think we dun have brains and initiative to save money on our own?<br><br>maybe very soon they are going to ban abortion if all else fails.<br><br>and that mp's harsh words will have dire consequences. now in a globalised world, people can have immigration more easier than before. worst comes to worst, a certain percentage of people will rather give up their singaporean citizenship to live in other countries where they have more freedom and individual rights. and what happens then? BRAIN DRAIN. and what happens next? some big hoo-ha govt figure will say the STAYER/QUITTER thingy.<br><br>but the govt FAILS to understand 1 thing: IT'S THE OPPRESSIVE GOVT WHO DENIES <strong>INDV RIGHTS,FREEDOM OF CHOICE and EXISTENCE OF A PRIVATE SPHERE and A PROPER CIVIL SOCIETY</strong>, THAT ARE DRIVING THE BRAINS OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. they only know how to pinpoint others for fault and when will they ever learn to reflect on themselves 1st?<br><br>and as if all these not enough, the govt actually wants the educated to give birth to more babies whilst the less educated less. what is this? ELITIST EUGENICS. and who does this remind you of? ADOLF HITLER. get the link.<br><br>sometimes the govt really make things very suffocating for the people. that;s one of the consequences that result from a dominant, authoritarian one-party govt where no voices of the sound opposition can be heard. how i wish the opposition parties can be more capable and efficient when they are running for elections and even before elections.<br><br>and how i wish there'll be more opposition voted in as full-time MPs rather than NCMP or such where effectively they have no power and control at all.</div>
