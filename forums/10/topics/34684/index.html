            <div class='col-md body'>Thursday - 6 February 2003 Straits Times reprinted a Malaysian New Report that:-<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Malaysia is testing a plan that relies on the use of recycled water from households to boost supplies, as it prepares for a possible water shortage in 20 years' time.<br><br>The Malay-language daily, Beritat Harian Malaysia, reported thata a team of engineers from Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang and the Drainage and Irrigation Department was working on a pilot project to process used water from homes.<br><br>At the project's launch on Tuesday, spokesman Nor Azazi Zakaria said the recycled water could "be used for many domestic needs except for drinking".<br><br>He said the team would monitor the results of the Bio-Ecological Drainage System over a 10-year period.<br><br>There is a possibility that if successful, the model would be implemented nationwide.<br><br>Dr Nor Azazi said recycling water was a cheap way to obtain clean water.<br><br>"This can help save up to 90 percent of our piped water from going to waste, as we only use about 10 percent for drinking."<br><br>He added that the development of the system was significant because of a need to find alternative water sources ahead of a looming worldwide water shortage in 2025.<br><br>Last year alone, Malaysia approved more than 62 water projects costing RM 51.9 Billion (S$23.7 billion) under a master plan to meet rapidly growing deman for water.<br><br>The projects were aimed at meeting the expected increase in the daily demand for water at a rate of 6 percent every year until 2010.<br><br>In 1997, seven of Malaysia's 13 states were hit by a water shortage brought on by a severe drought.<br><br>Singapore has also put in place a system of tapping new sources, including reclaimed water and plans for a seawater desalination facility.</span></strong><br><br>It will be quite an irony that they will also have to depend on their own version of NeWater by 2010, although the present intent is to recover household waste water for domestic use only, and NOT for drinking.<br><br>We may have the last and loudest laugh, when they were earlier laughing at SGP for drinking our own "piss".<br><br>At least the SGP piss had come from drinking cleaner water than what has been delivered to most Malaysian consumers throughout Malaysia, except for Johor Bahru and its suburbs -.which largely depend on the SGP treated water sold to Johor.<br><br></div>
