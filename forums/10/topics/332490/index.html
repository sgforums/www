              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE : One of the three victims from the Yishun triple murder was cremated at the Mandai Crematorium on Thursday. <br><br>36-year-old Yang Jie, a Chinese national, was found dead after falling from a sixth storey public housing flat about two weeks ago. <br><br>The other two victims were found dead in the Yishun flat. <br><br>Yang Jie's 15-year-old daughter, who survived the brutal attack, was at the funeral. <br><br>The teenager was barely able to walk, but she managed to leave the Tan Tock Seng Hospital to attend her mother's funeral on a wheelchair. <br><br>The victim's family members, including her mother, 62-year-old Chang Wei, were also present at the funeral. <br><br>Madam Chang had flown in to Singapore from Shenyang a few days ago. She has been allowed to stay in Singapore until her family's matters have been settled. <br><br>42-year-old Chinese national Wang Zhi Jian has been charged with the murder of one of the three women, Zhang Meng. <br></span></span></p>

              <p>Bentsb, Bentsb, why are so so extreme? Nobody mention kicking out all foreigners. It is very clear that we need to check the credentials of these foreign workers, what are they here for, are they sponsored by a company? is the sponsored company legitimate?</p>
              <p>We have to do these checks to safe guard our own citizens and also the reputation of other foreigners who are making an honest living in Singapore. The present situation is due to the lack of care by the government in regulating the influx of these foreigners. <br>When you let people into your house for party, I am sure u will check for an invitation before u let them in. You just do not let any Tom Dick or Harry into your house.</p>
              <p>And yes, many of the jobs you have mentioned can be easily filled in by a local.</p>

              <p>do you need someone to pick up your tray after your food all the time? it is time, the govt start putting pressure on coffeeshoip owners by reducing th influx or reliance on FW and start to increase salary to attract local ah ma, auntie, uncle into these profession. the main reason they shunt these jobs is not because they are degraded jobs along but low salary that aint enough to survive.</p>
