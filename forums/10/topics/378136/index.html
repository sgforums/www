              <p>There is a war going on in the world. An economic war.

              <p>Would you prefer foreign talents to work for or against us in this economic war and struggle for survival, and grow our own talents thru better education with funds earned? Talents aplenty, those who are uppity,gets the boot.</p>

              <p>Has the X-rat now become accustomed to posting the "Wall of Text" and adopting it as its own plagiarized signature format ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the bankrupt mind of a X-rat will troll the internet and hope to get some ideas for it to plagiarize as its own.</p>
              <p>Without any creativity of its own, can the X-rat find the answer in itself ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the insecurity of the X-rat prevent it from being honest to form its own opinion to this topic that is designed in the boredom of being alone by itself.</p>
              <p>Surely, it cannot be so pathetically hopeless to be trapped in a X-rated mind ?</p>
