            <div class='col-md body'>personally, u can say i am jealous or loser..watever you feel like it..but i think, our govt is spending too much money on scholars with good academic results, w/o even determing their character or attitude.. true that having excellent straights As, mainintaining a near perfect score is a proof of how well you do in school, but so what? jus because they buried themselves in books everyday, anytime,..and then the govt spend money on them to further their studies, come back and secure better jobs with higher pay...<br><br>pp like me, ordinary grad, jus have to sit back n "serve" theses scholars, some of which are worse than me...they only know how to follow the book, but inflexible in alot of ways..worse, some of their attitude are " look you down" attitude...<br><br>When you are in NSF, also the same..scholars one side, non-scholars another batch...they become generals if they sign on, while local grad just have to suck thumb, become LTC and retire at 42...<br><br>coporate ladder also the same...govt sector is the hell worse system for this biased system...sigh....<br>indeed there are true scholars, good in almost every way, but i think more are on the bad side...study freak but useless in actual hands on.. jus because they have a cert from some ang mo universities...tmd</div>
