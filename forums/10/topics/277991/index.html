So what's the reason to bar him from getting a passport. Without passport, can't even go Malaysia.<br><br>And what if within the next 5-10 years, he need to go oversea or maybe just to Malaysia for work which is very common, then how?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I agree with TS on this. If the Gahmen think they can propose something and then take a back seat letting the private sector take over, they are sadly mistaken...... It doesn't work this way......<br><br>Just like the Gahmen's drive to have older workers employed, if the Gahmen don't take the lead to practise what they preach, then I don't think getting older workers to become employed will work at all. No private company wil want to hire older workers if there are younger ones available..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

It just make people doubt the gahmen's campaign...<br><br>I do not know how bad my friend was before he was admitted and seriously, I do not care as long as he does not carry on his old ways. But to deny him a passport and go for a hard earned holiday outside of the country that some would see his past errs as a eye sore is simply unacceptable.<br><br>He had paid for the errs he had made in the past. I do not feel that he should be continued to be imprisoned in a much larger prison(as in the country itself).
