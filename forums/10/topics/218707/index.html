At this juncture, the audience burst into laughter and applauded.<br><br>In his address, the Sultan, who was clad in a T-shirt, said he would not Â“give faceÂ” (bagi muka) to the foreigners (Mat Sallehs) and urged the people not to hold them in high regard,  He also told the locals to be wary of the foreigners as they were vultures.<br><br>With the SJER, the Sultan hoped Johor would be transformed into a global economic centre.<br><br>Â“I hope the SJER will bring benefits to the people of Johor,Â” he said, adding that he was confident it would be a success.<br><br></div>
