Unfortunately, during the dying moments of the previous Sultan, the younger Prince was not present, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Will</span> of the previous Sultan was altered.<br><br>This matter was brought to the Royal Council of Rulers for arbitration, but it declined to interfere and considered the fracas as an internal disputes of the Johor Royal Family.<br><br>The Johor hockey coach was slapped as he did not allow the present Johor Sultan's younger son from playing, and left the young prince sitting on the bench as a reserve. The Sultan thought that with his son playing, the Johor State Team would not have lost.<br><br>After this slapping incident, the hockey coach took a civil suit against the Sultan, but it was thrown out by the civil court, as it had no judicial power to summon a Royalty to court.<br><br>Mahathir, who was then the PM, decided that the Malaysian Royalty that abused their position should not be allowed to continue with their wayward ways - as there were continuous reports of abuses by the large number of youthful members of the many royal families of all Peninsular Malaysian States.<br><br>For the first time, and with the consent of the Royal Council of Rulers, the Malaysian Constitution was changed to allow any member of the Royal Family to be prosecuted, and the Sultan will be dealt with by the Royal Council.<br><br>Following this slapping incident, the Private Military Batalion of the Royal Johor Sultan was disbanded, and all members were absorbed into the Malaysian Army without any loss of rank.<br><br>For all those who are golfing at the Royal Johor Golf Club, be warned not to hang around when this Sultan visit the Club, as you will be roped in to be a golfing partner; and will be expected to lose the game to his Royal Highness.<br><br>You are also then to <span style="font-style: italic;">'give up'</span> your golf set for <span style="font-style: italic;">"losing the match"</span>; and you are subsequently expected to write a letter of apology to his Royal Highness for being a poor player, and also to plead for his generosity to return the golf set.<br></span></div>
