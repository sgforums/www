            <div class='col-md body'>Well...lets look at your own record. You post views and opinions, we happily make counterpoints to your arguments. Check the threads which you've left you insightful comments if you don't believe me. You respond to our rebuttals with other accusations with no relevance whatsoever to the point currently being dicussed, or worse, call us names. And then now you start an entirely new thread for that sole purpose. Whos the retard here?<br><br>People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.<br><br>BTW don't overstrain you meager brain cell resources trying to figure out what that means.<br><br>We've said it before and we'll say it again. The majority of people here are here for a healthy debate on issues. We appreciate anyone joining us here for that purpose, Malaysians included. I suggest you look a couple of pages back for a thread called "IDF in Jenin". Sudaimiki, a Malaysian had initially joined the forum with similiar intentions to you, cause problems, initiate flame wars using another nick. We made it clear we had no time for his rubbish and told him that if he wanted to debase his country and people on this forum(like you're doing now), hes free to do so but he'll be ignored. He henceforth  changed his nick and we had a lively spritied but respectful debate on the topic. Maybe you should take a lesson or two from him, starting with actually sticking to the topic being debated.</div>
