            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, some of u shd have know that each time i typed, i always scold or criticise the malays, esp those in malaysia and indonesia. As i want to apologies to those good one ( those who really follow the religion), i would like to share with u, why i bear so much hatred in them.<br><br>First i am a chinese ( born in msia), and i also have alot of indonesian chinese as my frens too in singapore.  Ok, the first reason why i hate them ( again, not those good malays that follow closely to religion), is becoz these malays are inhuman and always torture the chinese.<br><br>Evidence 1:<br>Malaysia May 13, malays went around with thier knife and killed chinese, burn thier houses....can go internet to check for more.<br><br>Evidence 2:<br>Mass rape in indonesia. For those who dunno how serious this is, let me show u, and ask urself, would u hate them if one of these gals is ur wife/ galfren/ daughter.<br><br>warning!<br>( these website contains gruesome pictures of raping, the intention is for educational ( telling the truth) purposes, and not for any discriminating. so moderator, if it is really too terrible, u can bring it down.<br><br>http://www.huaren.org/atro/<br>http://www.huaren.org/atro/rapvic.html<br>http://www.huaren.org/atro/buddhist.html<br><br>i do not wish to show more, the more i view, the more sad i am to these victims. if u wan to view more is on the right hand side of the page of http://www.huaren.org/atro/ . Just click on them.<br><br>Now, tell me, am i wrong to hate these people? Becoz i really hate these ppl, that's why, i would support bush to just wack afgan, iraq, israel wack palestine. To me, these ppl just deserve it. Why shd i show mercy to them.<br><br>To those who always talk about RTM 1, now tell me, do they ever mention that these mass raping is wrong? Do they show u the pic of innocent gals get rape and kill like this?  They only show what they wan to show...now agree??<br><br>I would rather these gals get killed right away, rather than being rape and torture by them b4 killing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pal, hating those bastards who murdered those girls is one thing. Hating an enire race is another . I know malays who are really nice people and we all believe in living together peacefully. But to say you want to hate another race because of one bunch of assholes, it is entirely wrong.</div>

Let it be used to compare and contrast government policies and how it affects social life in Malaysia, Singapore &amp; Australia.<br><br>Kuala Lumpur is like an acidic solution. It is poorly regulated and corruption is rife. Crime rates are high as a result. There is occasional disorder like street protests against unpopular leaders. It is not surprising to find secret dealings between the underworld elements and the town councils.<br><br>Singapore is at the other end of the pH scale. It is rigidly controlled and all dissent is ruthlessly supressed. The tiny size gives it an advantage in policing the population. Corrupt officials are shamed publicly and their ill-gotten wealth seized. But many of the state functions are cloaked in secrecy. We don't even know how our taxes are managed. Street protesters can kiss goodbye to their freedom under the ISA, even if they had a valid reason for their actions.<br><br>The Australian cities are like a neutral solution because the inhabitants have the best of both worlds. They have a clean efficient system and a free press. The actions of public officials are closely scrutinised by the media (more so in UK, by the way). The government agencies are therefore accountable to their constituents. If any public official has failed in his dities, he must be prepared to face the wrath of street protesters. You can hold anti-Iraq war protests outside John Howard's office and you won't face detention under the ISA or even the wrath of armoured vehicles.</div>
