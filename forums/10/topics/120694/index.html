            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about now, but some years back, I had a lady friend enrolled in SDU.  Physically, she's a very nice lady in chracter, but on the heavy side.  I believe BBW is the term for it.<br><br>Here's what she told me:<br><br>(1) They're all given regularly updated magazines with profiles of members.  From there, you can choose who you wish to meet.  It seems that many have very astonishing expectations, like guys stating that they want slim, rich, high-ranking executive type, beautiful women, etc.  Perhaps some just join for fun, I don't know.<br><br>(2) When you do see someone you like, you can contact the SDU, which will in turn contact the other party for a meeting.  The first meeting, I believe, takes place at SDU's facilities.<br><br>(3) If both parties agree to meet, then the first meeting is very mechanical.  After meeting at SDU's facility, they are brought into a room and given some time where they are expected to chit chat and get to know each other.  My friend told me that the atmosphere in the room was rather formal, the reasons for which I've forgotten.  Perhaps it was office-like or something, so it felt more like an job interview.<br><br>(4) There was another reason why she said it was too formal, but once again I forgot exactly what.  I think it had something to do with a maximum time limit for room usage, so both parties had to quickly blush through it and ask direct questions and get to know as much of each other real fast.<br><br>(5) If the meeting was successful and they like each other, they are transferred to a dim room next door, which is run by the family planning clinic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.  NAY NAY....this paragraph is just a joke.<br><br>I could have unintentionally gotten some points incorrect, but I believe the general picture given above is right.....<span style="text-decoration: underline;">except paragraph (5)</span> which was an intentional joke (sorry, I just couldn't help it - I've had my 2+2 portions of fibre today and thus not feeling so uptight......er.....what about you?).<br><br>I don't know if SDU has served its purpose, but its existence through the years may be proof that it does.  Ultimately, state-run or not, its just an introduction organisation...the kind I'd like to work for (meet lots of singles, no worries about profit reporting, monthly sales targets, etc).  I still think SDU is a good idea though....because in contrast to similar commercial matchmaking companies, it provides an economical means for a targetted group to meet other similar like-minded people.<br><br>My lady friend is still single now, just past her mid-30's....and still looking (oh yes, interested parties may leave their details here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).<br><br></div>
