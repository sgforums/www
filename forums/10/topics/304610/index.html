            <div class='col-md body'>Well too bad.<br><br>Singaporeans learnt from their government. We put our self interest as top priority.<br><br>If a MNC comes and offer lucrative and prospective job offer, why not? Since bond holders usually work as civil servants when they return to Singapore.<br>They learnt from PAP government.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Please dun ask why do they take up the bond when they are not 100% committed to fulfil it. Well, as a student, some people have no financial mean to study in top oversea universities. When they graduated and MNC come and employ them with high wages, isnt it easier for them to break the bond?<br><br>Career prospect vs Fulfillment of Bond. The choice is clear and easy-to-decide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, looks like it's up to me to present a philantropist point of view.<br><br>Most of these were people worked hard and were given opportunities by others and when they became wealthy they wanted to give something back. They did this through endowments, scholarships, etc.<br><br>1. They did not give it because they wanted something back. When the philantropist received help, he knew that the people helping him may never live long enough to see the result of their generousity. Also by the time he was able to repay them, they may be long dead. It was this mindset of paying back a debt to society because he could not pay it to that particular person.<br><br>2. They wanted to provide opportunities where there were none. If there were too few schools, they gave money to build schools. They would never consider giving money to conduct reseach into accurate testing of students to ensure only the ones able to pass get accepted into the schools that existed.<br><br>3. They did not require proof of deservedness. They knew that having someone believe in you and give you money to develop yourself even though commonplace thinking may determine the money goes elsewhere would be a powerful motivator. Having someone in position have faith in you basically that was what it amounted to. Giving this money for education and saying "I believe in you and that you will put this to good use" was sometimes worth more then the money.<br><br>4. The did not question opportunity cost because they did not find it relevant. If the person you gave the money to died in a motor bike accident, would you ask for the money back?<br><br>Now it's collected though taxes which we complain about paying and then students have to display they deserve it with grades and then they have to pay a bond and then they have to pay a penalty for breaking the bond, the bond also includes having to work for the government to pay off their debt. Guarantor are needed and Citizens sit around discussing more ways to ensure we don't get cheated.<br><br>Despite your logic being flawless, I think a philantropist would find it totally alien.<br><br>Just reminding you that there can be more then one point of view.</div>
