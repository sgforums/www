              <p><span>SINGAPORE : More electronic road pricing (or ERP) gantries will
              be put up and some ERP rates will be raised as part of the government's
              wide ranging move to ease traffic congestion.
              <br> <br> In addition, the rate of annual vehicle growth will be moderated but road taxes will be cut.
              <br> <br>In the last of three major announcements on changes to the land
              transport system, Transport Minister Raymond Lim says even as public
              transport is being improved, firm steps must be taken to curb excessive
              car travel demand.
              <br> <br> So the incremental ERP charge will be raised from 50 cents to S$1 progressively from July.
              <br> <br>At the same time, the ERP base charge, which is the starting charge
              for a new ERP gantry point, will be increased from S$1 to S$2.
              <br> <br> The number of vehicles on the road is also set to go down.
              <br> <br> From May 2009, the rate of annual vehicle growth will be halved - from 3 percent to 1.5 percent.
              <br> <br>But road taxes will be reduced by 15 percent from July this year as
              part of the general move towards taxing based on usage, rather than
              ownership.
              <br> <br>To lower the upfront cost of car ownership, the Additional
              Registration Fee (or ARF) will be lowered from 110 percent of the Open
              Market Value (or OMV) to 100 percent from March.
              <br> <br> On the new gantries, 16 will come up in phases during the year.
              <br> <br>On April 7, the gantries at Upper Bukit Timah Road, Toa Payoh
              Lorong 6, Upper Boon Keng Road, Geylang Bahru Road and Kallang Bahru
              Road will be switched on.
              <br> <br>On July 7, five new gantries will run along the Singapore River
              line - from Clemenceau Avenue to Fullerton Road - at Eu Tong Sen
              Street, New Bridge Road, South Bridge Road and Fullerton Road.
              <br> <br>Then on November 3, six new gantries will come up - at Commonwealth
              Avenue, Jalan Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road, AYE (westbound) and PIE
              (westbound) near Eunos and Serangoon Road.
              <br> <br>Mr Lim explained that the ERP system has largely remained unchanged
              since it was introduced 10 years ago so it has to be enhanced to
              address current and future traffic conditions.
              <br> <br> He made the announcements during a visit to the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway on Wednesday morning. - CNA/ch</span></p>

              <p>I will just like to make a simple point.</p>
              <p>I might get flamed - but please this is something which all of you might want to consider in your hearts.</p>
              <p>During the 2006, who did you vote for? <br><br>If it's the opposition you had supported, fine - complain all you want.</p>
              <p>If it's the ruling government which you had voted for - please do not complain and make a hu-ha about prices being upped and everything.</p>
              <p>Remember the carrot and stick rule, or the dog and man rule.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, you would want to think - whether do you want your money to be put to productive use or not.</p>
              <p>Sinking investments, and what not - it's your call.</p>
              <p>If you do want to make a difference, vote in the 2011 elections. Smartly and Wisely,</p>
              <p>Choose wisely, and face the consequences squarely.</p>
              <p>Ultimately at the end of the day, it is your choice.</p>
