Saving face is more for the Malaysian government which continues to sell us raw water at 2 cents. Unless the government has turned around and decided on some expensive massive programs (more and more huge desalination plants) other than newater (which will probably supply only 25-30% of Singapore's needs), then only self-sufficiency is possible. In fact, the government talks about 4 taps - 1) water catchments (transforming 90% of Singapore land into catchment area), 2) newater,  3) imported water, and 4) desalinated water. So, it's unlikely they want to stop the third tap.</div>

Singapore's water need is expected to grow by a third in 10 years.  Of course, decreasing the amount of imported water is a good thing, but the government is realistic and does not rule out imported water.<br><br>(Just as we can never never hope to achieve any semblance of self-sufficiency in energy needs.  We import all the oil and gas from overseas. Renewable energy like solar and others constitute only a minute amount. China and India go all over the world cultivating relationship to ensure oil security, as they can never achieve self-sufficiency in oil either.)<br></div>
