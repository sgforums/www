But this new technology will make the filter double up as a reactor which will be able to destroy unwanted material."<br><br>The nano-material destroys unwanted matter like dissolved salts and chemical compounds in water by using ultraviolet light and visible light.<br><br>The material then clears its surface to allow more unwanted material to collect.<br><br>The final goal, which will take a few years, is to make a cleaning filter or membrane out of the nano-material.<br><br>The focus now is on testing the material and possibly removing one stage of the pre-treatment of waste and sea water.<br><br>Researchers said another objective of the new filter is to prolong the lifespan of the membrane and reduce costs.<br><br>For now, the results of tests conducted are promising.<br><br>To date, the filter can remove at least 20 percent more organic carbon which is one of the parameters to assess cleaner water.<br><br>The PUB estimates that a pilot plant could be built to test the nano-material at Chua Chu Kang Waterworks in about two years and the research project may apply to a scheme called Fast-Tech to fast-track water projects.<br><br>Also announced at the conference is the S$300,000 Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, which recognises organisations or individuals who come up with solutions to water problems.<br><br>Nominations will open from the end of June.<br><br>The winner will be announced next March and presented in June at the first Singapore International Water Week.<br><br>- CNA/so</blockquote>05.June .2007</div>
