If subsection 4(2) wasn't breached; why was subsection 4(3) invoked?<br><br>"Regulating his movement" implies controlling his movement in the area, which does not necessary mean denying his movement in the area. The police officers orders were clear from the video, from the questions that was asked "where are you going madam?", Ms. Chee replied she was going to Shangrila to have her meals, the officer then stated that this was a protected area and she was not allowed to go there.<br><br>So...., did Ms. Chee stepped foot into Shangrila Hotel and committed a breach of that order? If Ms. Chee had clearly violated the order in the first place, why was she allowed to walk 400m in the protected area before being abducted? Shouldn't she have been arrested while breaching the 500m boundary? The intrusion into the protected area of 400m (80%) into the area, does this not imply that movement around the area was not totally disallowed. Compare this with an intrusion into an army base in Singapore, which is also considered a protected area and protected place. Do you think Ms. Chee can walk 400m into the army base without proper authorisation?<br><br>(2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any person who is in any protected area shall comply with such directions for regulating his movement and conduct as may be given by an authorised officer, and an authorised officer may search any person entering, or seeking to enter, or being in, a protected area, and may detain any such person for the purpose of searching him. </span><br><br>(3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If any person while in a protected area fails to comply with any direction given under subsection (2), </span>then, without prejudice to any proceedings which may be taken against him, he may be removed from the area by an authorised officer.<br><br>My question is; are you using a press release by Singapore Police Force as law, or, are you using Protected Areas and Protected Places Act (Chap. 256) to enforce the removal from the protected area?<br><br>If it's the former, is a press release by the Singapore Police Force considered as law now?</span><br><br></div>

All the police officer asked was, "Where are you going madam?"<br><br>Which means that if you have a purpose to be there official or otherwise, you could be there in Shangrila Hotel.

Does it mean he is still a potential murderer? If so, then he should be killed or locked up permanently. And the government should just trash the yellow ribbon project, which is just plainly controversial.<br><br>I cannot deny that Ms. Chee might have some political objectives, but she definitely does not pose a security threat. The only threat that I can forsee is her being an embarassment to our P4P government.<br><br>Looking blankly at the law and citing it is of no use, if you didn't apply it to the context of the case.<br><br>It's a disjunction between text based law and physical reality.<br><br>When you look at the law, also look at the issue in the case in context.<br><br></div>
