To maintain and enhance peace, security and stability and further strengthen peace-oriented values in the region;<br><br>4. To ensure that the peoples and Member States of ASEAN live in peace with the the world at large in a <span style="font-style: italic;">just, democratic and harmonius environment</span>;<br><br>7.  To <span style="font-style: italic;">strengthen democracy, enhance good governance and the rule of law</span>, and to <span style="font-style: italic;">promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms</span>, with due regard to the rights and responsibilities of the Member States of ASEAN;<br><br>11.

(so admitted by you)<br><br>Discredit the government, believe me the government has no need for any discrediting abroad. You can see the negative responses when MM Lee goes over to Australia to collect his conferred degree.<br><br>I think the Filippinos value democracy more than us Singaporeans.

Aren't you also a victim of manipulation by the regime?<br><br>So what you are saying is, if Singaporeans are numb, materialistic and selfish lot, they should not be given any basic human rights, let them suffer the consequences of their selfishness. Your thoughts and actions are kind of vindictive to the Singapore citizens.<br><br>Even Pakistani citizens crave for Democracy, strange that an advanced country like Singapore prefers to waddle in the status as a Hybrid Regime.<br><br>What foreign cause might SDP be promoting? Care to elaborate? Can you read Dr. Chee's mind? Do you have proof to substantiate your claims, or is the information you have provided by our government controlled media?<br><br></div>

Police officers deployed along the stretch of road first engaged the pair at the junction of Orange Grove Road and Orchard Rd and advised them that they were about to enter the protected area and that they should not do so.<br><br>However, they ignored the advice of the officers and continued to proceed along Orange Grove Road towards the Shangri-La Hotel. Police engaged them again along Orange Grove Road near Anderson Road . They were warned repeatedly that they had entered the protected area, and should they refuse to leave, they would be removed. When they ignored the repeated warnings, and still refused to leave and continued to move forward, police officers led them into a police vehicle to bring them out of the protected area.<br><br>The police officers offered to drive Chee and Tan to the SDP office but Chee requested to be alighted at Orchard Hotel as she claimed that her car was parked there. Both Chee and Tan were alighted at the hotel.<br><br>The area around Shangri-La Hotel and three other venues have been gazetted as Protected Areas. Any person engaging in activities, which may compromise the security of the ASEAN Summit, including protesting within the Protected Areas, may be removed to ensure the safety and security of the Summit .<br><br>Police had earlier today facilitated the request of four Singaporeans who had wanted to pass a greeting card to the ASEAN Summit leaders. They handed the card to an ASEAN Summit official outside the Protected Area and left. These four persons were not subjected to any police action.<br><br>Separately, Police were also informed at about 7pm today that some people wearing red t-shirts had assembled outside Orchard Parade Hotel near the Starbucks outlet. When Police officers approached the location, there was a group of about 35 persons standing in line holding hands.<br><br>A banner was also displayed. Police advised them to disperse as they had committed an offence of unlawful assembly. The group heeded the advice and dispersed peacefully from the area.<br><br>Police will be investigating into the possible offences committed by Chee and Tan, as well as the outdoor protest outside Orchard Parade Hotel.<br><br>Police reiterate our advice to the public not to participate in an unlawful assembly or procession. The public are also advised to stay away from the vicinity of such illegal protest activities. Members of the public who choose to give expression to their political views or who wish to organise political activities are urged to do so through available avenues and lawful means.<br><br>Indoor political forums by Singaporeans are exempt from the need to apply for any licence.
