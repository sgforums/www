The police officers accompanied Ms. Chee for 400m, during the tag along, they "advised" her that it was a protected area and that she is to leave (but they have no right to ask her to leave).<br><br>Under subsection 4(2) as it is clearly stated <span style="font-style: italic;">(2) Any person who is in any protected area shall comply with such directions for regulating his movement and conduct as may be given by an authorised officer, and an authorised officer may search any person entering, or seeking to enter, or being in, a protected area, and may detain any such person for the purpose of searching him. </span><br><br>Regulating does not imply removal, if I ask you to regulate the temperature of the oven. Does it mean that I asked you to turn off the oven? Regulate is to monitor and adjust accordingly. If I say regulate the oven to 90 degrees centigrade, you would have to monitor the temperature of the oven and adjust accordingly.<br><br>At time 6:15 of this video, Superintendant Michael Tan asked Ms. Chee what was her intention of going to Shangrila Hotel area. Later on Ms. Chee went on to explain that she was going there for a meal.<br><br>The police asked for their cooperation to leave the protected area. The police advised them to leave the protected area. If the police has a right in this respect of the law, they would have "ORDERED" them to leave the protected area and not asked them to cooperate or advise them to leave.<br><br>Have you seen the police apprehending thieves, robbers or murderers? They have the right, they would normally handcuff these criminals. Fancy the police officer telling a thief, robber or murderer suspect "you are advised to follow me back to the police station for questioning", "please cooperate with us to go back to the police station for questioning", "please cooperate with us while we lock you up in a jail cell".<br><br>Isn't this a joke?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Did Ms. Chee or Mr. John Tan violated subsection 4(2)?<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfnyayx_7u8&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">Ms. Chee outside Shangrila Hotel Part 1</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdXH5llsQ5c&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">Ms. Chee outside Shangrila Hotel Part 2</a><br><br><strong>I also draw your attention to the Act used by you, under section 8 of the Protected Areas And Protected Places Act:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Offences seizable and non-bailable.</span></strong><br><strong>8.

A product of our excellent controls and procedures which our government are renowned for, they are always right and never ever wrong.

Did the police give <strong>warnings or advised</strong> Ms. Chee and Mr. John Tan to leave the area?<br><br>You tell me after looking through the whole video.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In a recent case with similar circumstances (I can't remember what it was), the police did not arrest this person but asked that he go back station. Later on, it was discovered that this person need not follow the police officer's advise or cooperate with them if he chooses not to. Can anyone refresh me on this case? Many thanks.<br><br>Advice, asking for cooperation are very different from warnings. An advice and a request for cooperation can be rejected, whereas warnings are more authoritative and cannot be rejected.<br><br>5) Your definition of regulate is with purpose, it was not specifically stated in subsection 4(2), so don't specifically veer towards that direction.<br><br>6) There was no police warning given, only advice and request of cooperation, so how could the pair have refused the police warning.<br><br>Your use of the word "gang" indicates that you are subjective towards them and you told me to remain objective. I have been objective from the beginning, I am not a fan of the Chee's and don't particularly approve of them or their actions at times.<br><br>7) I agree they have a right to escort the pair out of the area ONLY AND ONLY if they had violated subsection 4(2), which they have NOT. Subsection 4(3) states:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If any person while in a protected area fails to comply with any direction given under <strong>subsection (2)</strong></span>, then, without prejudice to any proceedings which may be taken against him, he may be removed from the area by an authorised officer. </span><br><br></div>
