You chase them out and they said u have no democracy. How convenient.<br><br>Every thing they want to do they will put the responsibilities on human right and democracy without even coming out with any solutions. How convenient.<br></div></blockquote>What is democracy? this definition I found.<br><br>1. Government by the people, exercised either directly or through elected representatives.<br>2. A political or social unit that has such a government.<br>3. The common people, considered as the primary source of political power.<br>4. Majority rule.<br>5. The principles of social equality and respect for the individual within a community.<br><br>Overthrowing a government in the name of democracy, maybe not in Singapore context IMO. In a nation like Burma perhaps, perhaps not. The vibes I get from most people who oppose the ruling party here in SGP are mainly asking for reforms.<br><br>As for the death sentence, I personally feel that one man should not decide whether another lives or dies. But thats just my personal take and not the point of the thread, meant for another if it does start.<br><br>It is not a human right to wreck havoc. Its is a human right, however, to assemble peacefully without arms and non-violently. With the episode regarding Ms Chee and John Tan, clearly point number 5 above, didn't apply.<br><br>On the contrary, advocating human rights is advocating more responsibilities to the individual. As the PAP leaders once said (think it was LKY) "More rights/freedom equals more responsibility " or somewhere along those lines. Then again, who are they  (the PAP) to decide whether we are ready for the responsibilities or not. The compulsory annuity is a perfect example.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Mitell:<br><strong>And if things go wrong this is not their fault because they are doing it for human right and democracy. How convenient. </strong><br></blockquote>You've seen it happen? People putting the blame or using human rights as an excuse? Take Dr Chee for example, I don't really agree with all his antics, but I do not condemn what he does either. Some positive does come out of it. He then goes to jail in the name of individual rights, not run away from it.<br><br>Here in Singapore, there are those who call for more accountability with clear facts, not obscure speeches. Like in the case of selling arms to burma. No figures were released. E.g the manifest of what was sold in detail. Just a friggin speech by George Yeo that just throws alot of smoke.<br><br>GIC, Temasek etc.. should be liable to public scrutiny. We vote for the MPs to represent us, but we don't get to vote for his boss? Maybe PM selection should be done like presidential elections or increase the presidents veto power.</div>

At the 2000 census, of those who identified themselves as belonging to a single race, 75.1% were whites; 12.3% were blacks; 3.7% were Asians, Native Hawaiians, or other Pacific Islanders; and 0.9% were American Indians or Alaska Natives. The remaining 8 percent were either of other races or identified themselves as multiracial. Among the more than 10.2 million Asians in the U.S., Chinese, Filipinos, and Asian Indians were the leading groups, together accounting for nearly three-fifths of the total. Hispanics (who may be of any race) comprised 12.5% of the total population. Among the nation's 35.3 million Latinos, 58.5% were Mexicans, 9.6% were Puerto Ricans, and 3.5% were Cubans.<br><br>According to the 2000 census, the largest white ethnic group, comprising about 46.5 million Americans, was partly or solely of German ancestry. Other reported ancestry groups included those who were either wholly or partly the following: Irish, 33 million; English, 28.3 million; Italian, 15.9 million; French or French Canadian, 12 million; Scottish or Scotch-Irish, 10.6 million; and Polish, 9.1 million. About 45 million Americans aged 5 or over in 2000 grew up in households in which a language other than English was spoken; in about three-fifths of these cases, the other language was Spanish.<br><br>During much of its history, the U.S. had an official policy of admitting more European immigrants than Asian, African, and Latin American immigrants. Changes were made in immigration policy during the 1970s that resulted in large numbers of non-European immigrants entering the country. As of 2000, according to census estimates, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the U.S. foreign-born population numbered 30.5 million</span>; of these, at least half were born in Latin America, and more than one-fourth were born in Asia. An unknown number of undocumented immigrants reside in the U.S., many of whom were not included in the 2000 census figures. Estimates by the Pew Hispanic Center indicate that more than 11 million unauthorized migrants were living in the U.S. in 2005 and that their numbers were increasing by more than 500,000 annually. More than half of the illegal immigrants were Mexicans, and nearly one-fourth came from other Latin American countries.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Am I out of my mind to compare Singapore with USA ?<br><br>Or is your mind too small that you cannot imagine this little red dot of four ethnic groups cannot practise democracy, when the gorrilla sized USA has been able to practise open and transparent democratic processes - even when the USA has more then a dozen over ethnic groups that make themselves less homogeneous, and with a population size that is 20 times larger then Singapore, and a bigger land mass to compare with ?<br><br></span><br></div>
