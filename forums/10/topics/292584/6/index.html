Such a security zone would allow police to conduct checks on persons found within the zone, and order persons found therein to leave the security zone if they pose a security threat to the ASEAN Summit.<br>The security zone will be in place on the following dates and times:<br>Venue	Date/ Time<br>Shangri-la Hotel	17 Nov 2300 hrs - 22 Nov 2359 hrs<br>RCCC	20 Nov 0500 hrs Â– 2359 hrs<br>Istana	21 Nov 1500 hrs Â– 2359 hrs<br>ACM	21 Nov 1400 hrs Â– 2100 hrs<br>Singapore River	21 Nov 1800 hrs Â– 2030hrs<br>Members of public are advised to keep away from the security zones unless they have a legitimate reason to be there. Members of the public can expect to be stopped and checked by security forces if they are entering the security zone. Persons found engaging in activities which may compromise security within the security zones will be arrested and removed.<br>Police are aware of web postings stating that it is not against the law to gather in groups of four or less and encouraging people to do so during the ASEAN Summit period. Police would like to advise members of the public not to participate in such illegal activities.<br>Members of the public who choose to give expression to their political views or who wish to organize political activities are urged to do so through available avenues and lawful means. Indoor political forums by Singaporeans are exempt from the need to apply for any licence. Foreigners who wish to do so can apply for a licence from any Police station or on-line at www.spf.gov.sg/licence/index.html. Â‘Â’</blockquote><span style="color: red;">Here very clearly it stated that the area of incident is a protected area.</span><br><br><blockquote>PROTECTED AREAS AND PROTECTED PLACES ACT<br>(CHAPTER 256)<br><br>2) Any person who is in any protected area <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall comply with such directions for regulating his movement and conduct as may be given by an authorised officer</span>, and an authorised officer <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span>search any person entering, or seeking to enter, or being in, a protected area, and may detain any such person for the purpose of searching him. </blockquote><span style="color: red;">It is also very clear under the act that any person in the area shall comply with the direction of the authorised officer. The above act doesnt make it illegal for the police to be selective in their regulation.<br><br>And yes we can ask why of so many passerby, the police took so much interest in chee?<br><br>I believe it is because Chee has previous record of illegal activities in which the police finds that this person with such a record might be a threat to public peace in the vicinity.<br><br>The police has the responsibility to pre-empt crimes, so why is it illegal or wrong for the police to regulate the movement of people in a protected area with criminal records especially one with a colourful portfolio of demostration?</span></div>
