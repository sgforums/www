            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON (Reuters) - The number of first time house buyers has fallen to the lowest level since 1980, with average homes now unaffordable in most towns, mortgage lender Halifax said on Saturday.<br>(Advertisement)<br><br>HBOS's Halifax said 300,000 first time buyers had entered the housing market in 2007, 44 percent less than in 2002.<br><br>Meanwhile the average house price paid by new property seekers increased by 15 percent to 175,093 pounds. During the last five years the average price has also rocketed by 82 percent from just under 96,000 pounds.<br><br>That meant an average house was unaffordable -- where prices were at least four times greater than household income -- for first timers in 466 out of 483 towns.<br><br>"Rising property values have priced many potential first time buyers out of the housing market," said Martin Ellis, Halifax's chief economist.<br><br>"When they do enter the market first time buyers are now more likely to be in their 30s rather than their 20s and buy a flat rather than a terraced house."<br><br>The survey said Henley-on-Thames, a leafy town in Oxfordshire, was the least affordable town in Britain, with property prices more than 13 times the average income of a first-time household.<br><br>Bootle in northwest England was said to be the most affordable place.<br><br>Britain's housing market has cooled in recent months due to higher interest rates and worries about financial market turmoil.<br><br>Earlier this month, Halifax said annual house inflation would stagnate in 2008 and Ellis said this could help first-time buyer get a foot on the property ladder.<br><br>(Reporting by Michael Holden, editing by Mike Peacock)</div>

Deteriorating mortgage-related investments and corporate loans caused the biggest loss in Merrill's 93-year history during the third quarter, as it suffered $8.4 billion of writedowns.<br><br>Temasek, a government-sponsored investment fund, pledged up to $5 billion and New York-based Davis Advisors will buy $1.2 billion of Merrill stock. The deal is the latest in which an ailing U.S. investment bank has turned overseas for additional capital.<br><br>John Thain, who took over as Merrill's chief executive on Dec. 1, pledged to solidify the company's financial position when he came on board. As part of that program, he also announced Monday the sale of Merrill's commercial finance business to General Electric Co.'s finance arm for an undisclosed price.<br><br>"One of my first priorities at Merrill Lynch was to strengthen the firm's balance sheet, and we have made great progress toward that by bolstering our capital position through these investments and our announced sale of Merrill Lynch Capital," he said in a statement.<br><br>Temasek will acquire $4.4 billion in Merrill Lynch common stock, and has the option to purchase an additional $600 million by March 28. The investment is for no more than 10 percent of the common stock, and Temasek will not have a seat on Merrill's board.<br><br>Temasek has a track record of making large investments in financial institutions, and has major holdings in Britain's Standard Chartered PLC and South Korea's Hana Financial Group. The fund was set up in 1974 to manage Singapore's assets, and now controls a portfolio of over $100 billion worth of investments.<br><br>Davis Advisors is a closely held company that was founded by former Bank of New York executive Shelby M.C. Davis. The investment was described by Merrill Lynch as being "long term."<br><br>The investment could not come at a better time for Merrill Lynch, which some analysts believe might have another $10 billion of writedowns coming in the fourth quarter from its battered mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Global banks have written down an estimated $105 billion this year alone from exposure to subprime loans and other debt commitments.<br><br>That has caused a number of financial companies to secure deals involving infusions from state-owned sovereign funds -- mostly from Asia and the Middle East -- in recent months. Government-sponsored investment vehicles have invested about $25 billion in Wall Street since the mortgage crisis began this summer.<br><br>Morgan Stanley last Wednesday announced a $5 billion investment from China's government-controlled investment vehicle to help replenish its capital.<br><br>In October, Bear Stearns Cos. agreed to a $1 billion investment from China's government-controlled Citic Securities Co. Citigroup Inc. received a $7.5 billion capital infusion from the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government last month.<br><br>UBS AG last week announced that the Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the city-state's other state investment fund, is investing $9.75 billion for a 9 percent stake in the Swiss banking company.<br><br>Shares of Merrill Lynch fell 33 cents to $55.21 in morning trading.<br><br>AP Business Writer Stephen Bernard in New York contributed to this report.</div>

Craig Venter Institute, in the study published in Science.<br><br>The research has been carried out at the laboratories of the controversial celebrity US scientist Craig Venter, who has hailed artificial life forms as a potential remedy to illness and global warming.<br><br>However, the prospect of engineering artificial life forms is highly controversial and is likely to arouse heated debate over the ethics and potential ramifications of such an advance.<br><br>It is one of the Holy Grails of science, but also one that stirs deep fears as forseen in Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel "Brave New World" in which natural human reproduction is eschewed in favor of babies grown artificially in laboratories.<br><br>Venter said in a statement: "This extraordinary accomplishment is a technological marvel that was only made possible because of the unique and accomplished ... team."<br><br>His researchers had "dedicated the last several years to designing and perfecting new methods and techniques that we believe will become widely used to advance the field of synthetic genomics," he added.<br><br>Lead author Dan Gibson said the team had completed the second step in a three-step process to create a synthetic organism.<br><br>In the final stage of their research which they are already working on, the Maryland-based team will attempt to create a bacteria based purely on the synthetic genome sequence of the Mycoplasma genitalium bacteria.<br><br>The bacteria, which causes certain sexually transmitted diseases, has one of the least complex DNA structures of any life form, composed of just 580 genes.<br><br>In contrast, the human genome has some 30,000.<br><br>The chromosome which Venter and his team has created is known as Mycoplasma laboratorium and, in the final step of the process, will be transplanted into a living cell where it should "take control," effectively becoming a new life form.<br><br>The new bacteria will therefore be largely artificial, though not entirely, because it is composed of building blocks from already existing organisms.<br><br>"When we started this work several years ago, we knew it was going to be difficult because we were treading into unknown territory," said Smith.<br><br>But other scientists remain cautious, saying Venter and his team are still a long way from being able to create artificial life. They point to a tell-tale footnote in the study which details a problem in slotting in one of the cloned genes.<br><br>Eckard Wimmer, professor of molecular biology at New York University, said it was clear from Venter's study that the team had not yet created artificial life.<br><br>He said he was left with "the unpleasant feeling whether or not the synthetic DNA was indeed proper and able for biological function."<br><br>His fears were echoed by Helen Wallace, a biologist and spokesperson for GeneWatch UK, who said that while Venter's team has managed a technical feat, it is some way from being artificial life.<br><br>"Venter is not God ... He's a long way from creating life," she told AFP.<br><br>"It's a type of genetic engineering which would allow people to make much bigger genetic changes, which means that in the future you could create organisms with new gene sequences."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong> Pity the British babies. </strong><br><br>By Tim Castle Reuters - Friday, January 25 12:04 am<br><br>LONDON (Reuters) - The largest ever survey of maternity care in England has found widespread failings, with services in London criticised as the worst, the government's health watchdog said on Friday.<br>(Advertisement)<br><br>The Healthcare Commission said many women were receiving inferior screening of their unborn babies. It said there were too few midwives to provide one-to-one care during labour.<br><br>Four out of ten pregnant women failed to get all 11 recommended checks on their babies during ultrasound scans, which include tests on the baby's heart, face and lips.<br><br>Only 11 percent of hospital trusts said they had met higher quality requirements set for Down's syndrome screening in April last year.<br><br>Staffing was found to be below levels recommended by professional medical authorities, who advise that 36 midwives are needed per 1,000 deliveries to meet the government's target of one-to-one care for all women in labour.<br><br>The average level of midwife staffing in maternity units was found to be 31 per 1,000 deliveries. Nine trusts had just 26 or fewer midwives per 1,000.<br><br>The watchdog surveyed all 148 hospital trusts providing full maternity services in England, responsible for around 600,000 births a year.<br><br>The best performing maternity units were in the north of England, with Stockport NHS Foundation Trust the best of all.<br><br>Maternity services in London and central England were the lowest rated, with West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust receiving the worst score.<br><br>Health Commission Chief Executive Anna Walker said she was concerned about London's poor performance.<br><br>"There are a number of factors that may have influenced these results, such as lower staffing levels and the mobility and mix of the population. But London trusts need to rise to these challenges."<br><br>She said low ratings did not mean a maternity service was unsafe.<br><br>The Liberal Democrats called for an immediate review of maternity staffing capacity.<br><br>"With the birth rate rising, many midwives set to retire and not enough jobs for those newly qualified, the situation will only get worse", said the party's Health Spokesman Norman Lamb.<br><br>Births have risen by 72,000 since 2001, while there was a fall in the numbers of midwives last year.<br><br>The NHS Confederation, representing 95 percent of National Health Service organisations, said it recognised that the survey had revealed "deep concerns" about maternity services.</div>
