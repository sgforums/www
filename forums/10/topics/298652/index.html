            <div class='col-md body'>Many people feel that Singapore has being run like personal family business by the Lees. If this place is not country but a hotel or some people personal family business, there is no longer so called <strong>national</strong> service to talk about, it should call Lees' business service. The government should change National service to Lees' business service so to not confuse the people that this place is still running like nation because there's no nation to talk about.<br><br>How will young men feel when they have to being force to accept low wages and serve 2 years of Lees' business service? And how will those who had already served 2 or 2 1/2 years of Lees' business service who thought is national service and realised it's Lees' business service? Will anyone out there accept those kind of wages for 2 years to serve a family business?<br><br>Strongly think that lees family business service should not hide behind the good name of national service. How do you guys think?</div>

For Lee Inc, actually it is not a bad thing to run a country like a business, at least our economy is strong but sometime i feel singapore is abit soulless, as in we are over materialistic and need to be more liberal in certain areas.<br><br>I wish our culture can be fined tuned to make us more adventurous and creative thinking. I think our system is too rigid at times.<br><br>Bottomline..not bad lah, economy generally good, and security good. But still can improve some stuff.

What does low tax mean for Singaporeans? Most Singaporeans don't even pay taxes now, except for GST of 7% (most Singaporeans don't pay taxes before GST was implemented).<br><br>Other countries like NZ, Australia, US UK understands Economics, Business Cycles and Structural Unemployment. Do you even understand these concepts? Welfare maintains a basic standard of living for the unemployed. In Singapore, if your are unemployed, only avenue is beg, borrow, steal, pick up cardboard &amp; aluminium cans or MRT tracks.<br><br>Your friends in the US pay 50% taxes must be more educated than you to realise the disparities. Despite having to pay 50% taxes, they are still willing to leave Singapore to enjoy a better quality of lifestyle. Most of my foreign educated friends all chose another western democracy to lead their lifestyle. Only ones whom I know that complain about other western democracies are those that are perpetually stucked in Singapore. More like sour grapes.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If you are interested in living in a country with low tax rates.
