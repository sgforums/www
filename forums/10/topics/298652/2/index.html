My US and Aussie friends are shocked at the amount we're paying. GIC and Temasek gains have been reported.

But not to countries such as Australia or New Zealand.<br><br>P4P lackeys here complain that some of these countries like Australia, New Zealand, etc have high tax structure.

If the economic prospect of crimes (probability of getting caught is little and gains far exceed the expected outcome), then crime is worthwhile.<br><br>e.g.<br>If the chances of a man getting caught for theft of $10,000 is 5% and the fine is only $5,000. Then it's worthwhile to commit theft. The expected outcome of $9,500 far exceeds the fine of $5,000.<br><br>Expected Outcome: $10,000 x 95% = $9,500<br><br>To reduce corruption, you need to increase the penalties, have stronger controls and enforcement.<br><br>Your logic of increasing pay to stop corruption is equivalent to, instead of a robber robbing an old lady for $1,000, you ask the police to pay the robber $10,000 so that he will stop robbing the old lady of her $1,000. Either way, the robber ends up a happier person.<br><br>Legislation and Enforcement is the key to controlling corruption.<br><br>What next?<br><br>Are we going to be paying traffic policemen more by the amount of bribes they can potentially receive every day while giving out summons?<br><br>Are we going to be paying soldiers more by the amount of top secret information that they can potentially sell to our enemies?<br><br>Are we going to be paying judges the amount of bribes they can potentially receive when handling corporate disputes?<br><br></div>
