Isn't this not running family business?<br><br>Please think about it.</blockquote>A "family business" does not have to account to external stakeholders, that's true... And a family business exists to perpetuate itself, to grow, to prosper, to benefit its owners, shareholders and stakeholders.<br><br>If a family business prospers, its good for everyone involved in it, from grandpa who is MD, 2nd uncle who is manager, 5th cousin who is accountant, 3rd auntie who is secretary, 1st uncle who is supplier and 6th grand-uncle who may be a customer.<br><br>If u extend your example and consider that all Singaporeans are shareholders and stakeholders in this "family business", then do you not think that we are all beneficiaries if the country does well? Through job creation, security, safe streets, good roads, public housing and public transport?<br><br>And no country accounts fully to its citizens on the use of its national reserves. Are u not calling Singapore government to a higher standard of accountability than is consistent with international norms?<br><br>I don't like the idea of the old man sitting there like a grand old sage as well... As far as I'm concerned, he has out-stayed his welcome and he should have retired gracefully long ago.<br><br>But I do actually agree with paying ministers and public officers competitive salaries. In my view, humans are not altruistic creatures and some are not even very moral.<br><br>A cabinet minister is no exception. Its better to pay them properly and make it clear that "alternative income" is not acceptable than to expect them to make a pittance and not get tempted.<br><br>Some may think my views simplistic, but human beings at the basest level are indeed very simple: Not many can easily say no to temptations.<br><br>And at that level, the damage can be very, very serious... public buildings that leaks and collapses, hospitals that have no proper equipment and medication, public services that do not operate unless an additional "coffee money" is paid, public money lost through crony deals and fat percentages skimmed off into swiss bank accounts. In the end? Budget deficit (cos of the thieving), public debt (to cover the deficit) and things STILL don't work.<br><br>Alternatively, they can be paid properly and not even consider supplementing their income. At worse, they will consider that a bribe had better be DAMN attractive or its not worth risking their million dollar salary.<br><br>The political system and process in Singapore is not perfect. But at least we are well known internationally for being clean and graft-free.<br><br>And I never once felt that the country is run like a family business. A business, yes. A rather efficient and money minded one indeed... But its not so simple to say that only a small "family" benefits.<br><br>As in any free market economy, some will benefit more than others. But it is never solely due to "family connections" here.</div>

It's not impossible to have all three.</div></blockquote>I agree... In case you may have misunderstood my point, let me elaborate: I feel that it is easier to get profitable FIRST, followed by moving on to transparency, accountability and liberty and other more abstract concepts.<br><br>To put it simply, a small business needs to do what it can to survive. U can't afford to pick and choose your customers and if needs be, they may cut corners and take certain risks and shortcuts to survive.<br><br>However, once the business grows, it will realise the growing importance of reputation, certification and other value adds.<br><br>If SG were to be likened to a "business", then I venture to say that when the country was young, post 1965, it was absolutely necessary to push ahead fast and kick some butts. We may not agree with the methods used today, but many of us were also not there to experience first hand so once again, lets not abuse hindsight.<br><br>However, now that we're supposed to be "first world", it is definitely necessary to adopt such "best practices" to rise to the next level: that of a developed and dynamic country with an active citizenry and clean, transparent and accountable government.</div>
