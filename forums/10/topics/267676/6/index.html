            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<strong><br><br>While i may have suffered similar disappointments with some of the decisions made by senior officers during my time, i am reconciled by the fact that not all officers make <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span> decisions, and not all good decisions may be '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span>' decisions. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">What constitute a <span style="font-style: italic;">'RIGHT' decision</span> from being a <span style="font-style: italic;">'GOOD' decision</span> or vice-versa ?<br><br>As Dr Goh Keng Swee once said that in the new Army that Singapore was building and continue to build, SAF Officers are required to make their best conscienable effort to make decision to address issues. Any decision is better than no decision. Mistakes made is better than none made, so that lessons and experience can be learnt.<br><br>Is anyone perfect in this World, let alone in the SAF ?<br><br>As a recruit, I was appalled at the leadership quality in the SAF unit that I was posted, and I strived to be in a Command position that will enable me to be in control of any decision making situation that affect my Life.<br><br>It later dawned on me that at each command level, there will always be another higher level that will exist to affect the present. The next best option is to adapt and control one's circumstance, make the best of the present, so as to safely achieve the objectives decided by other lesser beings with the opportunity to affect oneself. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Rest assured that while your opinion of Li's view is that of a localised problem, the truth is that such 'oversight' is endemic throughout the SAF. Having gone through numerous postings myself, i have observed many junior officers who abused their powers, skived their way through appointments and have displayed negligence in their own duties. And many basically got away with it. Such allegations by Li are not wild; they can be verified by other officers who have experienced them firsthand. However, the fact that these are obviously not documented will prevent the actual number from being realised. Those serious enough are elevated to summary trial; the rest are either settled by lower charges or dismissed. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, my skepticism to your statement require me to ask that - unless you had signed on into Contracted Regular Service Personnel , how many of the <span style="font-style: italic;">''numerous''</span> SAF units could you possibly be posted to in the otherwise normal 2 to 3 year NSF service - (which brought you to your views that the subject problem is endemic in the SAF) ?<br><br>Your very negative views towards SAF officers is something in itself, and seem to have seriously colored your usual characteristic sense of objectivity in this Speaker's Corner, and which I have read with interest. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Handling complaints is an art, not simply a process. It is clear that some benign complaints should be dismissed outright, but cases that exhibit a lack of integrity should be further examined. Does a complaint where an officer went AWOL, lied to a superior officer and tried to implicate a fellow officer not reek of concern? Is it not serious enough to warrent further investigation? If the senior officers simply disregard the complaint, what message are they sending down - that an officer can break the rules and get away with it? I find this train of thought worrying.<br><br>What you say is true - the punishment metted out may not be satisfactory in the eyes of some, but the 'slap on the wrist' for LTA 'X' was surely disproportionate to his actions. Li compared it to managing a corporal against an officer. If a corporal went AWOL, it would surely be a charge and a quick drive to DB. If such disproportionate punishments are allowed to continue, how will the chain of command hold up to such lopsided favourism? Such actions may encourage the men to become more insurbordinate, and lacking in respect. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I share your views on the gravity of the various scenarios that you have given. However, decisions are made given the unique set of circumstances and hardly could be an art in itself.<br><br>Given the same set of circumstances, different persons - (civilian and military, managers or officers compared to supervisors or NCOs) - may not necessarily converge into any common set of decision outcome based on their different individual and personal values, experience, exposures, maturity, objectives.<br><br>While some decisions may not be made to one's liking, the decision maker may have a set of objectives in mind; and in this instance, the senior commander to 2Lt Li could have a variety of reason that range from unit cohesiveness, to that of taking the sting out of the political rivalry amongst the leadership corp (between LTA X and 2Lt Li).<br><br>Right or wrong, the decision made by the Senior Commander to LTA X and 2Lt Li can only be respected as his prerogative based on the set of circumstance that the Senior Commander had weighed to arrive at the outcome that is now criticised. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>You say the "<span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The consequences of (2LT Li's) allegations bring up many questions that concerns the quality of the SAF Leadership - and in turn the quality of the SAF "</span></span>, and i say the quality of leadership is <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">already of grave concern </span></span>at the lower levels, nevermind the upper echelons.</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">It will be interesting to understand the circumstances that have brought you to this conclusion.<br><br>Somehow, I cannot help but to detect in your tone - a sense of resentment from an <span style="font-style: italic;">'Old Soldier'</span> who have suffered some wrong, and is carrying the weight on your shoulder against the SAF leadership - especially those Scholars who got an easy ride to the Stars, as well as the present lot of NCOs who are in fact no better then 20 year old kids.<br><br>You should let the water pass under the bridge, and give everyone the opportunity to learn from their mistake - as said by Dr Goh Keng Swee - as you and I have been given our opportunity to make our decisions.<br><br>Let it pass, and give the present youngsters some objective encouragement, some room to make and learn from their mistakes as you and I have made ours. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Let's not allow the fact that it was the PM's son who made the complaint, distract us from the seriousness of the complaint itself. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">As I had mentioned in my previous post, this matter must be broken down into three different parts - <span style="font-style: italic;">'his personal problems with LTA X and the Senior Officers above him; secondly, his wild allegations on the entire SAF Officer Corp based on his 'LIMITED' and 'LOCALISED' experience at his Unit level; third - the indiscretion made to gain wide attention to his very localised problems encountered'</span>.<br><br>Can we have any sensible conclusion when you prefer to delve into a complaint made by 2Lt Li without even the superficial details related to LTA X and his Superior Commander that are both implicated in the letter ?<br><br>Similarly, can we have any possible conclusion when you have assumed that your localised experience with <span style="font-style: italic;">''X-number''</span> of SAF units in the past, and the localised unit encounter from 2Lt Li's - are now alleged by both of you to be endemic in the SAF ?<br><br>The only common ground left in engaging ourselves in debating this issue must center on 2Lt Li - his actions, his allegations, and his connections - as hinted by the Thread itself.<br><br>To do otherwise, will merely hijack the thread from the TS.<br><br>As a consolation, it might interest you to note that in the Straits Times Forum Page (dd 17 July 2007) - someone wrote to suggest that LTA X could be a <span style="font-style: italic;">'Princeling'</span> due to his audacity in repeating the same act despite being exposed.<br><br>Is it the SAF or the system that created the <span style="font-style: italic;">'Super White Studs'</span> in their <span style="font-style: italic;">'Elitist Acts of Cynicism'</span> towards the idea of National Service ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:<strong><br>IÂ’m afraid I will have to disagree with Atobe this time round on the general quality of leadership in the SAF.<br><br>First and foremost IÂ’ve served my NS in the capacity of an infantry Non Commissioned Commander and through a series of rather bizarre circumstances (mostly due to the term cut causing a lack of specialists) found myself going through the several units such as Guards and NDP (sia kang party) before ending up as a BMTC instructor, and while there are good commanders that get the job done fairly and justly, the general atmosphere of commanders in the units I have been through well and truly give rise to the kind of faults that 2Lt Li spoke out against.<br><br>I canÂ’t say this for the rest of the SAF, but by experience and also what the grunts from other places say (just pop by military nuts), the general impression on the ground is that in terms of having the men, equipment and will to fight the SAF isnÂ’t such a slouch, but the weakest link would be that of the leadership.<br><br>And unfortunately, the SAF, with itÂ’s reliance on elite scholar generals sometimes with more book smarts then battlefield smarts has led to a kind of structure that any person serving in HQ will realize as unnecessarily bureaucratic and cumbersome in terms of developing the vision of the Â‘thinking soldierÂ’ and the 3G army.<br><br>All this 3G stuff is impressive, but the grunt is probably far more worried about losing his stuff or being a walking 1206 waiting to happen then to use his equipment to the fullest of its ability. And lets not talk about the red tape for other kinds of things.<br><br>Not that all this red tape is bad, but an overtly by-the-book approach and a lack of emphasis on personal honour, soldiering pride and skills towards NS has fostered a kind of Â“get-away-with-itÂ” attitude in many who take a more selfish approach towards their time in the military.<br><br>Case in point, if you read Generation Kill, you will realize the American Marines have a far greater respect for the personal judgement of the lower ranks, to the point which NCOs and enlisted dare to stand up to their incompetent officers or even demand a hearing when they feel that the leadership in question is questionable. You will never find this condition in the SAF currently.<br><br>Had this happened in the US Military, 2LT Li would certainly still be punished in some way or another, but I doubt his actions would be as scrutinized as being stupid or suchÂ… in fact there would probably be much soul-searching.<br><br>And if you ask me, soul-searching is needed. I for one, from my personal experiences and accounts from my friends who have been at the hand of both competent and incompetent leadership realize that the parts of the SAF we have seen (at the very least), require a serious shake up to restore justice and ethics among the troops.<br><br>Being self-critical may hurt for a while, but I do not think it will cause us the psychological edge. But going into battle deluded with unquestioning faith in your leadership that has done nothing to prove itself will be disastrous.<br><br>This is why the grunt trusts his Sergeant first before his PC, and the PC before the OC, and the OC before the CO. because the Sergeant is less prone to the wishful thinking and glory-snatching that comes up pushing little blocks that represent them around in the sandbox model.<br><br>I am not saying that we are screwed, but I think in terms of leadership the SAF requires some serious shaking up to separate the wheat from the chaff. If you do not believe it, just drop by the military nuts forums and there will be plenty of grunts willing to give you their own perspectives on leadership in the SAF.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Your subject is about <span style="font-style: italic;">'Leadership'</span> and all I can say is that those who are selected into OCS are just like you and I, except that the criteria seems to shift with each passing decade, and giving more emphasis on academic qualification in the selection process.<br><br>The character of the SAF Leadership had evolved from the early days <span style="font-style: italic;">'mature tough guy with martial art skills'</span>, to the present day <span style="font-style: italic;">'young, nerdy, and spectacled'</span> types.<br><br>Is it the fault of MINDEF or the SAF Command, or is it the fault of the Political Leadership in their short-sighted manner of managing the Military Policies that affect all Singaporeans ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok, let me contribute some of my personal opinions and thinkings towards this saga.<br>Firstly, yes, it is true that SAF needs to deal with all those slack, unmotivated, refuse to work regulars that push their jobs to the NSF while they hide some where to sleep. I also laud 2nd LT Li for highlighting this issue to the public........BUT I seriously query the prudence and wisdom in CC it all over the SAF intranet all the way to the defense minister and the CDF. I believe this problem he face is a localised issue and that it can be settled within the four walls of the camp. If not, his next approach should be his CO or BDE CO things on that line. By CCing it all over the place, I really beg to question the real intentions of such an action. Bcos from what I see, this is no diferent from spamming or ah longs writing ur number all over the HDB void decks.  By addressing the issue directly to the CDF or minister, I feel that he is abusing his position as a NSF whom has a father that is of high social, political influence, to coercive the SAF to bend to his desire. One must know that SAF is an instrument of war that is activated when the need arises, and it is politically neutral and fights for the freedom of it's ppls. The 2nd LT should not use the SAF as his own political arena to throw his weight around. For yrs, 'white horses' have been in the lime-light and a hot topic of debate, thus what he did, basically makes most SGreans feel disgusted and disdain towards the so called 'elite' of the society.<br>Besides, he should also as an officer know the importance of chain of command. In time of crisis, eg. a division goes to war, a proper chain of command is essential towards accurate, efficient flow of information from the sections all the way to the DIV. Just imagine the ground troops do not practise proper voice procedures, or they dun do the sitrep properly, the network will be all jammed up. So I think the 2nd LT should seriously learn how to respect the establishment, rather than make the establishment respect his wishes............. </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Congratulations for your balanced, insightful and original thoughts. </span><br></div>

The military is a reflection of the mentality of the government that puts it into effect.<br><br>In any case it is clear that as a corps the SAF lacks maturity, which is not surprising given it is actually quite a young thing compared to other organizations like the British Army or the US Marines.<br><br>As to what 2LT Li did, it is certainly childish and silly- but plenty of good shall probably come of it. I'm not exactly sure what we want to see out of this: that he be charged and DBed or the like? White Unicon status aside, the average grunt would support what he did and he deserves some slack for it.<br><br>Ultimately a great military goes beyond its own laws, its members act for the greater good of it when they realize that the current laws and systems in place are working against it. I doubt 2LT Li has such selfless motives when he sent his E-Mail but how we handle this matter will probably determine if we get such a culture or one that is determined rigidly up by the book of law and not the heroism of men wanting to do the right thing.<br></div>

But as you yourself have realised, each command layer has a distinct set of rules and guidelines to follow. What is practiced at the ground level may not be practical for higher up, simply because a 'helicopter' view of issues will ultimately determine the outcome of any decision, and this decision WILL differ between different officers with different perspectives.<br><br>But this is not my contention. Officers in my opinion are overrated soldiers to a certain extent: they are empowered with certain requirements and standards but they themselves do not adhere to it. The fundamental statue that puts all privileged members of the officer's corps is the knowledge that each must maintain certain principles unique to their position.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok, let me contribute some of my personal opinions and thinkings towards this saga.<br>Firstly, yes, it is true that SAF needs to deal with all those slack, unmotivated, refuse to work regulars that push their jobs to the NSF while they hide some where to sleep. I also laud 2nd LT Li for highlighting this issue to the public........BUT I seriously query the prudence and wisdom in CC it all over the SAF intranet all the way to the defense minister and the CDF. I believe this problem he face is a localised issue and that it can be settled within the four walls of the camp. If not, his next approach should be his CO or BDE CO things on that line. By CCing it all over the place, I really beg to question the real intentions of such an action. Bcos from what I see, this is no diferent from spamming or ah longs writing ur number all over the HDB void decks.  By addressing the issue directly to the CDF or minister, I feel that he is abusing his position as a NSF whom has a father that is of high social, political influence, to coercive the SAF to bend to his desire. One must know that SAF is an instrument of war that is activated when the need arises, and it is politically neutral and fights for the freedom of it's ppls. The 2nd LT should not use the SAF as his own political arena to throw his weight around. For yrs, 'white horses' have been in the lime-light and a hot topic of debate, thus what he did, basically makes most SGreans feel disgusted and disdain towards the so called 'elite' of the society.<br>Besides, he should also as an officer know the importance of chain of command. In time of crisis, eg. a division goes to war, a proper chain of command is essential towards accurate, efficient flow of information from the sections all the way to the DIV. Just imagine the ground troops do not practise proper voice procedures, or they dun do the sitrep properly, the network will be all jammed up. So I think the 2nd LT should seriously learn how to respect the establishment, rather than make the establishment respect his wishes............. </div></blockquote>I agree with you that CCing his complaint in the SAF intranet is amounting to the spamming and yes, more appropriately, like ah long, 2nd Li Â‘s behavior is childish and rash, a little arrogant. But I do not doubt his desire or motive, he simply wanted actions, or just voiced his unhappiness because he was involved. CanÂ’t see anything political in that.<br><br>It does not appear that with a father of high social, political influence, his position was any different from other NSF. Did he have any direct channel to the higher echelon in the SAF to get what he desired? Apparently not.<br><br>How did he throw his weight around, using his political arena (if that is of any consequence)? We donÂ’t see any weight in his letter. If he had warned the officers involved to act or elseÂ…..then he would be guilty of Â“throwing weightÂ”. If he had CC his letter to the PM office it would be sufficient to charge him for Â“coercing the SAFÂ”.  But we donÂ’t see anything of that sort. He broke the chain of command, like any other stupid young soldiers.<br><br>What is key here is the issue, is the complaint valid? By hiding behind the Â“Esprit de CorpsÂ” of other senior officers to go AWOL, the regular officer abused the trust and spirit of Â“esprit de corpsÂ”.  If he were to come from a family of high social or political influence, then he would be guilty of Â“throwing his weight around, he had influence due to his positionÂ”, and I would be quick to join you in taking these Â‘white horseÂ’, Â‘eliteÂ’ to task. We should not look at the persons involved to decide what was right or wrong.<br><br>Observing proper voice procedures is hardly comparable to respecting establishment. Dun do or wrong sitrep is like telling a lie to the higher command, and this is what the regular officer did, went AWOL but made everybody believed he was in. Imagine during crisis, your CO was told battalion at full strength and gives move order, but actually your OC is still away in Orchard Road. If this happened would you not alert other officers? Or just let your company move on?<br><br>The issue is not who did what, but what was done. It is sad for the SAF to have regular officer who took AWOL lightly, it is very sad to have senior officers who condoned such mistake, it would be very very very SAF if nobody dare to speak up for such mistakes.<br><br></div>

Officers in my opinion are overrated soldiers to a certain extent: they are empowered with certain requirements and standards but they themselves do not adhere to it. The fundamental statue that puts all privileged members of the officer's corps is the knowledge that each must maintain certain principles unique to their position.

He is at liberty to exercise his discretion to weigh the circumstances and make his judgement based on the situation at that point in time - i.e. whether in war or peace, how the event will affect discipline and morale.<br><br>Surely, you will not want our Officers to be robots subject to the tight rules and regulations imposed from top to the bottom, and with no possibility nor expectation to exercise initiative, creativity or imagination, all of which will not be tolerated from rank and file ?<br><br>The difference between the Israeli military culture and that of the Arab military - which followed the rigid Soviet military doctrines - should be quite evident, considering the outcome in all the wars that were fought.<br></span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Put all 3 together and what classifies as appropriate punishment?<br><br>If we accept your view that all concerned should respect the decision given by the senior officer, <span style="font-style: italic;">[b]right or wrong</span></strong>, since by your definition everyone is going through a learning curve, what kind of exposure are we opening ourselves to?<br><br>Should we accept obviously 'wrong' decisions and allow officers to take the 'trial and error' approach?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>By Adobe:<br><strong>I am uncertain how to put it except that I feel your approach is unfortunately flawed in that you are mixing two separate issues into one.<br><br>The 3 events that you have described - in the preceding paragraph quoted - concerns the Senior Commander's method in handling LTA X seeming criminal act.<br><br>You have rolled that event into a general situation for the Officers to make 'Right or Wrong' combat decisions in times of War, or some general situation in Peace Time.<br><br>''Right or Wrong'' will depend on the circumstances of what transpired from the investigations by the Senior Commander on the charges laid by 2Lt Li against LTA X, which resulted in the decision that was made - as part of the Administrative Duties during Peace time.<br><br>Are you now suggesting that there are errors made by the Senior Commander in the manner that the 3 events are handled, when we have already agreed that there is insufficient details for us even to have a simple discussion ?<br><br>Even during times of War - even with all the training and honed skills - can any decision by any Commander (whether an Officer or a NCO) guarantee the victorious outcome in a war that is continuously fluid, and being an untested SAF - are we all not on a learning curve ?<br><br>Are you suggesting that every decision by Commanders that you see to be flawed will need to be debated, questioned, and mutiny take place before a wrong decision is acted on ?<br><br>It has always been my contention that any orders - 'Right or Wrong, Good or Bad'' must be acted upon to the best of each of our individual ability, with the information available, and with the manpower and equipment within the unit size that we are posted (i.e. a section, a platoon, a Company, a Batalion, a Brigade).<br><br>There are always alternative ways to do anything - even if we decide to positively follow the order, we could get it done as dictated or done in the best possible ways; or do something else more than the orders demand and completely different to achieve the same goals; or simply do nothing.<br><br>During the Yom Kippur war, Gen Sharon found the orders given to him to be bad, and he did more than his orders demanded and helped to turn the tide of the Egyptian surprise attack. His court martial absolved him of his acts of insubordination - how will you wish to look at this ? I surely will hope that you do not look at it as an 'esprit de corp' connivance in the Officer Corp.</strong> </blockquote>I'm not sure how we should disassociate wartime and peacetime when it comes to disciplinary action - are not both treated with equal seriousness? It's difficult to say a punishment should be more severe if shells are flying over your head, as opposed to normal peace time conditions.<br><br>Certainly, it comes to a head when we discuss cases of AWOL - imagine a platoon of men mobilized for war and only half report for duty, the other half going AWOL. The implications can be enormous. But the gist of the matter is <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>going AWOL </strong></span>itself, regardless of the situation.<br><br>As for the case of poor decision-making (note: i was not refering to a lack of good leadership), i can only stress that a trial and error approach should not be the way to handle it. Your style of absorbing the decision made: <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;">'Right or Wrong, Good or Bad' must be acted upon to the best of each of our individual ability, with the information available...</span></span> is probably the best and only way to circumvent poor decisions - by interpreting them correctly despite themselves.<br><br>If officers make consistently bad decisions, then it is for OCS to decide whether they should be dropped from the course - why inflate the number of officers simply to fill an SAF need? I came across several officers during my tenure, who during field training couldn't perform simple navigation, couldn't make decisive decisions during field combat and was absolutely horrendous in managing platoon discipline.<br><br>In times of war, will the men mutiny? Maybe...to escape being led by an incompetent officer into battle.<br><br>Your statement: <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are always alternative ways to do anything - even if we decide to positively follow the order, we could get it done as dictated or done in the best possible ways; or do something else  </span></span> is idealistic because when one is boxed into a corner, having exhausted all avenues, there may be no other options. WWII has seen many cases of officer fratricide, because their men would sooner kill their PC than be led to senseless slaughter.<br><br>Should those men be courtmartialled? Certainly, but is there any doubt that they probably saved more lives by their actions, despite being heinous?<br><br>At the end of the day, people make choices, and in the case of Li Hongyi, not everyone will agree his actions stemmed from a righteous act, but simply because he was in a significant position to do so. But like i mentioned earlier, it is the gist of his argument, not the manner it came across.</div>
