A senior cadet, one batch before me, wrote a letter directly to Mindef to complain about the behavior of some instructors in OCS, also got reprimanded, but still passed out as an officer.

He was also not afforded any special treatment and in fact often had to do MORE things that some recruits could have avoided (like weekend guard) during his BMT for the simple reason all bases had to be covered to avoid allegations of special treatment.<br><br>In fact, our encik made it clear that he did not want to see any special treatment. We solded the chap when he screwed up, and knocked him down when it was required. If there was anything special then it must have been the extra attention the whole BMTC paid towards safety (and it already is anal about safety compared to your usual unit) while he was there.<br><br>So was he a capable soldier? He probably had to live up to his reputation as the PM's son and hence did not slack in NS. He was a pretty average grunt who could lead when it came to it, and certainly within the capabilities for command school.<br><br>In my <span style="font-style: italic;">personal</span> opinion however, I felt he was better in SISPEC then OCS, but then again HQ had other ideas.
