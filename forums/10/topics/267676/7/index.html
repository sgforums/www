Any attempt at grandiose exaggeration without backing of facts will smear his own integrity and therefore, by innuendo, that of the PM.

Any late comers that arrive after the count will subject the entire platoon for more treatment.<br><br>By the time when LHL joined SAFTI OCS Wing at Coy B, it was a smooth ride for all the three OCS Wings of Coy A, B, and C - with no brutal tormenting of midnight change parade or drills at noon.<br><br>The brutal Platoon Commander behaved like a church-mouse, his voice no longer heard, and his abusive methods unseen for the duration of LHL's stay at SAFTI.<br><br>Are there no preferential treatment ?<br><br>When anyone of us lesser being go for a Live Firing exercises at those infamous hills of Pasir Labar, the most senior officer present will probably be a Company Commander or his Deputy.<br><br>However, when any of the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Super White Studs''</span> were involved in the Live Fire exercises, the Battalion Commander will be present as the supervising officer.<br><br>If there are no continuing preferential treatment, then all files should be stamped WH - then again, someone will use different color codes : White and Red Stripes for the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Super Studs''</span> ? </span><br><br></div></blockquote>The rest of the Coy mates must have been sent back for more realistic training after all of them were commissioned as officers.<br><br>Nothing is more dangerous in war than to rely upon peace training such as midnight change parade or drills at noon. This kind of training is already out of date.<br></div>
