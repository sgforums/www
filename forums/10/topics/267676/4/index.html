Is he? Essentially what he did was to write a complain letter that addresses an ill-culture within the military of leniency towards regulars and broadcast the letter. Was such a move based on personal interest?<br><br>Note that until the penning of the letter, no injustice whatsoever was done upon 2LTA Li. His superior, although irresponsible, did not in any way harm 2LTA Li personally. He could have just kept quiet and went on to MIT, nobody will need to know about this and there won't be any trouble at all. But he choosed to pen the letter, for what? Will he gain anything out of this? Hell No! He did not complain based on a personal grudge, but for the greater good of the organisation and the country.<br><br>If we would recall a few years back, the commando units were suffering from certain ill-culture within the military too and there was a large cover up and general acceptance to such cultures. It took a 3rd Sergent armourer to blow the whistle via similar methods, alerting the public and everyone! I personally knew this 3rd Sergent and he was never punished for blowing the whistle and hell I bet everyone here would be very angry if he was ever punished.<br><br>This is not a case of the so-called first family abusing their powers as you would like us all to believe. It is the case of a hot blooded 2LTA attempting to change things at a cost of his own and end up being blamed by the very people he hoped to help.<br><br>People. asked yourself, if 2LTA  Li had been the LTA in the complain letter and a normal "peasant" as we like to call ourself, is the person who broadcast the letter, would your respones be the same? Would we not be complaining the SAF for punishing the whistle blower and "restricting the freedom of speech" and not having and "Official Information Act" and such?<br><br>And mind you a "reprimand" in military terms is not as light as some of us might thought. It is not just a scolding, it will be recorded and has an impact on future careers, it is a defined punishment and is above extra duties in the hierarchy of punishments.<br><br>People, let's not be bias and see him for who he is and not just who his father and grandfather is, and for goodness sake give him the credit of the whistle blower that he deserves!</div>

During my time, a cadet, one batch before me also wrote directly to mindef to complain about the instructors, investigations were carried out. Not sure of the outcome but the young cadet proceeded on to pass out as an officer. His father has no special lineage of any kind, that I know for sure.<br><br>Often when I drinks with seniors to talk about army training, and all officers would talk about cadet/officers training. It become clear to me that it is not uncommon for young junior officers, or cadet trainees to make all kinds of complaints against their superiors, their units and the SAF, in many instances, the chain of command was broken. Today many of these officers remain very proud of what they did, exposing the flaws of the system, revealing abuses and bringing the guilty to justice, blah blah.....<br><br>is this the guts of the young and brave, or is this the arrogant and the naive? Definitely SAF's growth to what it is today does not come from such complaints.<br><br>I agree with the way SAF reacted, which is based on the validity of the complaint. All complaints got investigated, at least in my unit. If the complaint were right, after investigation, the complainant would only be reprimanded for breaking the chain of command. It would be a different story if the complaint were found to be completely groundless.....<br><br>SAF remains a place where men come in and out every year, not all of them happy and willing, and there are bound to have people going out of line, but comradeship was also cultivated after few months together. In this present case, the officer who went AWOL must have thought that he were covered by the senior officers with whom he had Esprit de Corp, but obviously there was no Comradeship between him and the young stub. Espirit de Corp should never be used to cover up wrongdoings, and comradeship should be cultivated with all men, not just among the seniors.<br><br>Do parents have anymore say in what our young people do today? If they do, even in the army, in work place, in our society, then the young men's behavior either glorify or put their parents to shame. If this is a family of high public profile, they get everything double.<br><br>Ultimately, is the complaint valid, is the behavior a fitting conduct of a soldier and an officer? I was glad the young cadet before me was not thrown out of course.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who's served national service, the culture of 'covering each others arse' by the regulars is not unfamiliar.<br><br>And yet, quite a number of people have expressed their sentiments that such acts are normal, and we should adopt a mature attitude towards it by just accepting it for what it is.<br><br>Sadly, i believe this is the general attitude of the population when it come to local politics as a whole. You sit down at the coffeeshop, bitch about all the injustice that has been brought upon you, about how things should be done, and yet do nothing about it, siting 'maturity' as a reason. and with this 'maturity', the same things happen over and over again.<br><br>It is exactly the same attitude within the army camp canteen, while the soldiers with which the majority are non-regulars discusses the differential treatment that regulars and non-regulars have when it comes to reward and punishment. and no matter how injustified one feels, nothing is done, simply because he is more 'mature'. "just suck it in... it'll be over in a bit" or "what can we do?"<br><br>It is indeed refreshing, that such a case of whistle blowing has been brought to light. and yet even more so when it is done by someone with connections. firstly, because such cases are rare, siting the above 'mature' attitude of the people as a reason. Secondly, for the majority of 'mature' whiners who do not realise it, the people who have the guts to make a difference, are somewhat already the same people in power.<br><br>This issue is particularly ironic and funny because the 2 contenders and what they stand for are hated just as equally. Some simply cannot figure out who they hate more! It is a suggested the viewing of 2LT LI as a common citizen. To champion what he has done, for those of us who otherwise chose to remain silent. On the other hand, there have been people who site the importance and sacredness of our military instituion, and how such a simple thing as the chain of command cannot be broken. That such a situation would not have arisen in the first place, were he not the PM's son.<br><br>But most of all, this is just gonna be a mindless, senseless debate, because at the end of the day, we are indifferent. We have no sense of what we really seek and want out of our environment. We don't really care and as long as our lives don't get any worse off than what it is, we go about our daily routine, being 'mature', taking in what life has to offer rather than actively seeking a life that we want.<br><br>---<br><br>"It is often easier to fight for what you believe in, than to live up to it."<br><br></div>

If you don't, then perhaps it is you who is arrogant for thinking you know better.<br><br>Of course one could argue that perhaps he was more ready to lodge a complaint upstairs because of who his parents were, but it still took moral courage to do what he did. It is far better for someone to speak up when things are obviously not right.

I believe he will learn from this incident and be wiser for it.

It is far better for someone to speak up when things are obviously not right.

Sigh, can tell from your message that how people react and respond really affect you!  Sigh!  Don't be harsh!  Cool down, it is no good for your health to get so worked up!  Take it easy, look at it positively, there are people who said kind words about the lee hsien loong's son.  It is not possible to expect all to say the same.  take it easy, don't blame the people.</div>
