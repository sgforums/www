              <p>It appears that the floodgates will be opened wider to Indian professionals to work in Singapore if India were to have its way.</p>
              <p>An Indian Financial Daily reported two days ago that India is seeking greater access for its professionals to work in Singapore in the coming review of the of the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement or CECA signed between the two countries in 2005.</p>
              <p>The report claimed that “Singapore has already got a lot of concessions as part of India’s free trade agreement with the ten member Asean countries.”</p>
              <p>In return, Singapore has recognized some Indian medical colleges such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Christian Medical College in Vellore as part of CECA.</p>
              <p>Medical doctors from these colleges can now practice in Singapore as doctors without additional local qualifications.</p>
              <p>There are increasing number of Indian doctors working in Singapore in recent years, most of whom are deployed in unpopular specialities within public hospitals and polyclinics.</p>
              <p>An official from the Indian Commerce Ministry was quoted as saying that India wants a “proper mutual recognition agreement in place to provide for both countries recognizing each others’ degrees in given areas.” and to seek greater access for services.</p>
              <p>India’s request is likely to be accepted by the pro-foreigner PAP government which will result in a greater inflow of Indian expatriates into Singapore.</p>
              <p>PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew recently urged Singapore to accept more qualified immigrants and used the example of an Indian student succeeding in Singapore to illustrate his point.</p>
              <p>The news was not published in the state media which is busy of late trying to promote “integration” between Singaporeans and the immigrants.</p>

              <p>Frankly, i feel very worry for the future of singapore, for me, it is ok, i can just go back to Taiwan. But i am worrying for the young singaporeans of today, they will or would face a stiff competition in future, and also, the quality of Singapore will do down for sure. The mentality and the workrate of foreign talent is not same with Singaporeans, i think the govt forget to look into it seriously, right now, not only salary are being pressed down, quality is also down, same goes to productivity and people morale.</p>
              <p>It does not mean that china and indian economy is good, therefore the people there are good and talented, they are just merely waking economy giant with a good domestic market, look at the corruption in india, the leakage of union carbide, the milk scandal, CAO and many others in china, there is simply no ethical and proper management in place in their country, and they will bring that into Singapore, those bad habits and poor attitudes will contribute far worst downturn of the economy then what LKY can comprehend, but to him,  who cares, he may not live long to see it, grab first and let future decide by itself. </p>
              <p>We built this economy not base on foreigners except malaysian in the early 70s, we moved tremedously fast from then on till 1997, all by the effort of singaporeans, do we need FTs  today to surge the singapore economy for an upturn in its threshold?? and do you think that these Talents are real talents that country like india or China will let go and give it to you?? In term of social economy, i see 3 things will happen..if this FT intake is to carry on...</p>
              <p>1. Migration of local talents out of SIngapore</p>
              <p>2. Poorer services and products churn out in Singapore</p>
              <p>3. More corruption in organisation and more crime will surface both in social and economy leading to social not in harmony and peace</p>

              <p>The issue begin with low birthrate, so we pour foreign in, and they said, it will be moderate, those guys who have childrens oversea with Foreign wivies were ask to bring their wives and childrens to become singapore citizens. So, the citizens had alway thot that govt is doing good for the country to decendents that can carry on our legend. But it seem that the agenda hide some motive that is surfacing today, we are talking about bring in FT for the economy, for the healthcare, for the society and for the teaching and for maintaining a good relationship with the FT parent countries.</p>
              <p>Is there a limitation to it. If you open the door, you need to close it, and when will it be, it seem like the govt have removed the door completely so that no one can close it.</p>
              <p>By the way, births can be done in several way, not just by Foreign intake, we can have vitro fertlisation, we can have so call national babies care by govt with fund provided by all singapore citizens to rejuvenate our population, not just pluck from the third world countries and said, welcome, be our citizens, come, I give u free education, nice house, free courses in english, and so on while heckcaring those local citizens here.</p>
              <p>In the begining, God created earth, then Adam, he dun buy or bring adam from another world, he make him from the begining, because he knows that if he bring adam from another world, adam will bring along all those bad things and habit with him.</p>

My heart at times really to those Singaporeans, especially those who still dunno what they will be facing in near future. I used to talk politics and social problem with my young frens, and thanks to sg forums, i also gathered more knowledge and understanding, but most of my young singapore frens said that I am Siao......omg, to me, Singapore govt had truly managed to sway poliltics and social problems out of our youngs mind by instilling high level of education that gives them no time to look at what is happening around them, till they come out and work...then suddenly they noticed...oh?? how come my superior is an Indian from India...and my paid is so low, because my superior pay is low.</p></div>

              <p>How come the India government did not make any prior planning on the numbers of medical graduates matched to their hospital vacancy? Can their lacked of proper planning be the case to pressure Singapore to open its door for their graduates when we have ours to take care of.</p>
              <p>I shall say, because Singapore is a first world country whilst India is a rising nation with the educational level not on par with Singapore trained doctors. It is highly recommended that India should at least let Singapore runs a check on their university right down to research, academic strength and technology before granting a few places for their graduates because the hospital vacancies in Singapore are limited due to efficient and effective management. </p>
