              <p><br> If you do not care how the previous Jury system worked in

              <p>So you want to compare to the previous jury system, than bring it up and compare it loh. how many juries was selected? In  US, every trial needs 12 people. and these twelve people cannot work for the time of the trial. and there is also the selection of the jury, which needs to go through a system. no matter how you look at it, it is an economical cost.</p>
              <p>you seem to question the appointment of the judges. so how are the judges in other countries selected? they run for election?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now that you have clarified your statement that a "<em>big country can affect the economy by getting a 700 billion bailout</em>" - you have at least been encouraged to give a clearer explanation to what was stuck in your mind, which you seem to be unable to express in simple ways, and resulted in your thoughts being skewed by your inconclusive statement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Not so clever to blame others for skewing an incomprehensible simple statement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously think that the 700 billion bailout will turn the US economy around - by this amount alone ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Big countries are like small countries - economic fundamentals need to be managed at the right time and with the right dose of direct or indirect governmental supervision.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Many reviews have already stated that the present situation in the USA is due to the complete removal of regulations that allowed the Financial System to run amok by creating all kinds of financial programs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The present US Government was at fault for the false assumption that pump priming home ownership program alone will help to boost the US economy, without any consideration that proper long term job permanence is required to support the repaymemnt to the freely available loans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Towards this end, the US Government had removed regulations and allowed banks to offer loans to all and sundry - which the banks eagerly accepted to meet bottom line performance demands without considering the recoverable status of the loans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As matters stand, the 700 billion bailout was not sufficient, as the recent concluded studies made by the US Congress stated that another 500 billion is required; while Obama and his new team has stated that structural changes will need to be made to the way the USA is being "managed".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Big country alone may not necessarily be "financially" powerful - if by big country you will mean population size or even in terms of territorial square kilometers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For the USA, her territorial or population size has nothing to do with her wealth, as her wealth is due largely to her political system and the acceptane of a political ideology by both major political parties that support the liberties of the individual.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In terms of population size, the USA is smaller than China; and in terms of territorial size, the USA is smaller than Russia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet it has more then trillions of dollar in private wealth within the USA - even as the country and the government is deep in debt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can Singapore be realistically compared to any country given the politial ideology that shackle Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">How was your statement taken out of context ?</span></p>
              <p>As I have mentioned in my response on 29 Nov '08, 10.11AM - spending the 700 billion alone does not necessarily turn the economy around - as seen in the present situation when the US Congress had demanded that a further 500 billion is needed.</p>
              <p>This amount does not include the additional demands made by the Automobile Industry which made a joint appeal for financial credit support; and also the appeal by Citibank for a bailout.</p>
              <p>How can you say that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">big country can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affect the economy</span> by getting a 700 billion bailout</span></em>" ? </p>
              <p>Am I supposed to swallow this based on your say so when current events do not support your position ?</p>

              the US Congress stated that another 500 billion is
              required; while Obama and his new team has stated that
              structural changes will need to be made to the way the USA is being
              "managed".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Big country alone may not
              necessarily be "financially" powerful - if by big country you will
              mean population size or even in terms of territorial square
              kilometers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For the USA, her territorial
              or population size has nothing to do with her wealth,
              as her wealth is due largely to her political system and
              the acceptane of a political ideology by both major
              political parties that support the liberties of the
              individual.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In terms of population size, the
              USA is smaller than China; and in terms of territorial size, the
              USA is smaller than Russia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet it has more then trillions of
              dollar in private wealth within the USA - even as the country and
              the government is deep in debt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can Singapore be realistically
              compared to any country given the politial ideology that shackle
              Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">How was your statement taken out
              of context ?</span></p>
              <p>As I have mentioned in my response on 29 Nov '08, 10.11AM -
              spending the 700 billion alone does not necessarily turn the
              economy around - as seen in the present situation when the US
              Congress had demanded that a further 500 billion is needed.</p>
              <p>This amount does not include the additional demands made by the
              Automobile Industry which made a joint appeal for financial credit
              support; and also the appeal by Citibank for a bailout.</p>
              <p>How can you say that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">big country can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affect the economy</span> by getting
              a 700 billion bailout</span></em>" ? </p>
              <p>Am I supposed to swallow this based on your say so when current
              events do not support your position ?</p>

              <p>good, you quote the whole thing, so now it downgrades from "reverse the flow of gravitry" or "turn the economy around" to "affect the economy".</p>
              <p>the 700 billion bailouts has not been expanded yet. did they spend all of it? no. a large part of the 700 billion bailout has been set aside for Obama's administration to plan.</p>
              <p>did the US economy improve after the bailout? you tell me no, than this debate is over, i lose, the 700 billion bailout was ineffective and useless, US cannot affect it's economy with the bailout, and save it from impending doom of crash and burn to a controlled descend.</p>
              <p>go on, just tell me that,</p>

              dude, money generates more money in the economy. you bailout the bank, the bank lends money, the money changes hands lots of time, and it will slowly generate the money.
              
              solving debt with more debt is something only a powerful country can do. i don't propose the solution, but that is what they are doing. and in the long term, they are fucked.

              <p>What about below logic:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...We will explore some of these terms, starting with the
                              most obvious feature of financial systems, their role in supplying
                              credit.</p>
              <p>Credit involves
                              lending money to people on the understanding that they will pay the
                              money back later along with a bonus or 'royalty', usually in the form of
                              a rate of interest.</p>
              <p>There is nothing necessarily capitalist about
                              credit and large parts of national credit systems are not related to
                              production at all. Workers can put their savings into a credit
                              co-operative and draw loans from it in hard times in the hope of paying
                              the money back in better times.</p>
              <p>They pay a royalty for the service but
                              this can be small because the co-operative is non-profit-making. Such
                              co-operatives  serve consumption needs, not production and they are
                              not capitalist. Building societies confined to the housing market play a
                              similar role in supplying credit for people to purchase housing.</p>
              <p>A
                              common feature of these kinds of organisations is that the credit-money
                              that they issue is directly derived from savings deposited within them.
                              In other words, their resources come from the past production of value
                              in the economy: employees' savings come from wages that they have
                              already earned in production.</p>
              <p>&gt;<strong>Banks are
                              different because they are able to create new money in their credit
                              operations.</strong> We can see this when we realise that at any one time, the
                              banks as a whole could be giving overdrafts to everybody in the entire
                              economy. Thus, far more money is circulating in the economy than the
                              money derived from savings generated by past value creation. Part of the
                              money is actually what  we can call fictitious money -- money
                              derived not from the past but from expectations that it will be
                              validated by future productive activity.</p>
              <p>Within capitalism, banks also
                              do not have to be operated as private capitalist companies. At the
                              beginning of the 1990s, for example, more than half of the 100 biggest
                              banks in Europe were publicly owned and their financial criteria for
                              operating were, in principle, matters of public choice.</p>
              <p>And even if they
                              are private, the banks play such an essential and powerful role in the
                              public economy because of their capacity to issue credit money that any
                              sensible capitalist class will ensure that the state is constantly
                              interfering in their operations  (even though, for ideological
                              reasons, one wants to keep these state functions 'low profile'). 
                              As Kapstein puts it: "Banks are told how much capital they must
                              hold, where they can operate, what products they can sell, and how much
                              they can lend to any one firm."10</p>
              <p>The existence
                              of this fictitious credit money is very beneficial for the whole economy
                              because of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>role in facilitating the circulation of commodities. </strong></span>Without it, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">economic development would be far slower.</span> </strong>It is especially
                              important to employers, enabling them to raise large amounts of money
                              for equipment which will yield up its full value in production only over
                              many future years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If employers could invest only real savings -- the
                              money derived from past value-creation -- investing in fixed capital
                              would be far more costly --too costly for a lot of investment.</strong></span></p>
              <p>&gt;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And
                              credit has also become a very important means of expanding the sales of
                              goods to consumers.</strong></span> This is another way of saying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>modern economies
                              run on large amounts of debt.</strong></span> So the banks do play an important role in
                              both channelling savings and creating new funds (fictitious money) for
                              productive investment. An entire capitalist economy could be run with a
                              financial system consisting entirely of such banks...</p>

              <p>I cant say that the president is corrupt because I dont know.
              But SR Nathan was a top official at SPH before he ventured into
              politics(PAP). And I'm sure you would agree that SPH is a
              government (PAP) mouthpiece. The PAP has a history, and a
              continuing one at that, of suing (foreign) media publications for
              being critical. So given Nathan's connection to the PAP, wouldnt he
              be part of the PAP apparatus?</p>
              <p>Let me define a conspiracy in my own words, "two or more people
