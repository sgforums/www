              my example is quite simple, but was somehow skewed by you.
              big country can affect the economy by getting a 700 billion bailout. good enough example for you? it cannot defy gravity, which is your words, not mine. my words was affect the economy.
              Singapore obviously cannot match the 700 billion bailouts..

              <p>Which country do you wish Singapore to be compared with in
                      terms of power ?</p>
              <p>Is it realistic to do so - given the size and resource that
                      Singapore has to work in ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looks like you may have got yourself confused between the words
                      "Jury" and "Judiciary" Systems.</p>
              <p>Try googling and understand the difference between the two
                      words.</p>
              <p>Singapore had a Jury System until it was thrown out of the
                      window when LKY felt that the Law is too unpredictable when subject
                      to the vagaries of the Citizens' views of what justice is
                      about, and how it should be dispense.</p>
              <p>With a Jury System, LKY cannnot control the outcome of any legal
                      proceedings.</p>
              <p>As much as he had feared that a Jury Panel can be subjected to
                      pressures by a powerful or influential accused person, by
                      disposing the Jury System he has been able to exert
                      his influence and control who will be appointed
                      to the Judiciary Bench.</p>

              <p><br> ah, since you specifically want to discuss jury, not judiciary system, i will discuss with you. to pass judgement, the US need the jury to be seperated from home and housed in a hotel to discuss the decision, and the trial may last for weeks. ==&gt; economically</p>
              <p>unfriendly
                  
                      and the jury are not professional judges and their judgement will obviously not be as sound as that of a judge. they can cock up more easily, sending innocent people to jail or letting guilty people free. ==&gt; quality of judgement</p>
              <p>they are also easier to bribe, and more difficult to choose... if you choose a fucked up jury to give fucked up judgement, they are just doing their job to their best understanding, and cannot blame them for being fucked up ==&gt; accountability</p>
              <p>before you come up with some bullshit of how LKY manipulate the courts, go wiki and find out how the judiciary system in singapore works. if you suspect some judge to be corrupt, go read their judgement, and court transcript, like the one about CSJ, and imagine how you would judge.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Now that you have clarified your statement that a "<em>big country can affect the economy by getting a 700 billion bailout</em>" - you have at least been encouraged to give a clearer explanation to what was stuck in your mind, which you seem to be unable to express in simple ways, and resulted in your thoughts being skewed by your inconclusive statement.</p>
              <p>Not so clever to blame others for skewing an incomprehensible simple statement.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously think that the 700 billion bailout will turn the US economy around - by this amount alone ?</p>
              <p>Big countries are like small countries - economic fundamentals need to be managed at the right time and with the right dose of direct or indirect governmental supervision.</p>
              <p>Many reviews have already stated that the present situation in the USA is due to the complete removal of regulations that allowed the Financial System to run amok by creating all kinds of financial programs.</p>
              <p>The present US Government was at fault for the false assumption that pump priming home ownership program alone will help to boost the US economy, without any consideration that proper long term job permanence is required to support the repaymemnt to the freely available loans.</p>
              <p>Towards this end, the US Government had removed regulations and allowed banks to offer loans to all and sundry - which the banks eagerly accepted to meet bottom line performance demands without considering the recoverable status of the loans.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the 700 billion bailout was not sufficient, as the recent concluded studies made by the US Congress stated that another 500 billion is required; while Obama and his new team has stated that structural changes will need to be made to the way the USA is being "managed".</p>
              <p>Big country alone may not necessarily be "financially" powerful - if by big country you will mean population size or even in terms of territorial square kilometers.</p>
              <p>For the USA, her territorial or population size has nothing to do with her wealth, as her wealth is due largely to her political system and the acceptane of a political ideology by both major political parties that support the liberties of the individual.</p>
              <p>In terms of population size, the USA is smaller than China; and in terms of territorial size, the USA is smaller than Russia.</p>
              <p>Yet it has more then trillions of dollar in private wealth within the USA - even as the country and the government is deep in debt.</p>
              <p>Can Singapore be realistically compared to any country given the politial ideology that shackle Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>Before the Jury retire to consider their decision of a verdict, the Judge is in the Court to guide the Jury in the deliberations of the evidences presented by both sides in a trial.</p>
              <p>The Judge is trained to determine if a mistrial has occurred, or if a verdict is flawed due to some reasons. Ultimately, the Prosecution can appeal to a Higher Court for retrial. Instances of retrial has occurred.</p>

              <p>At least in the USA and in UK - which our Judiciary System was supposed to have been modelled but had taken on a "frankenstein" evolution - both of these countries have a Judiciary System that is independent and accountable to the Citizens.</p>
              <p>The tenure of the judges are permanent, and not subjected to contractural renewal to be determined either by the Prime Mnister's Office, or by the Secretary-General of the Ruling Political Party, or even by Parliament.</p>
              <p>In the USA, the judges can be impeached by Congress and removed from Office, as the President is also subject to impeachment process by Congress.</p>
              <p>A Jury System is a system where a citizen's criminal offense is judged by his own peers forming the Jury; and although the members of the Jury are not legalistically trained - every right minded human do have common sense of justice, of what is right and wrong; quirks are removed during jury selection.</p>
              <p>In any case, the Judge is present to guide the Jury in the perimeters of their deliberation of evidences presented by both the Prosecution and the Defense; and if a verdict is arrived at against all acceptable reasons - it is the duty of the judge to investigate and call for a retrial.</p>
              <p>Quick dispensation is no justice, neither is delayed justice.</p>
              <p>Worst is when a system is subject to the control of a Strong Man - and everyone is held to ransom by the threat of trial in a system controlled by ONE Man.</p>

              <p><strong>Well, according to Bloomberg recently, the $7.2 trillion has already been spent. More recent estimates range at around $8.5 trillion to the corporate-financial sector. </strong><strong>Try to understand this, you cant fix a problem that is the result of debt induced by monopolised money creation with more money creation.</strong> <em>Thats like trying to fix corruption with more corruption. The Fed is a private corporation that has a monopoly of money creation over the US. </em><strong>When it loans money (which it created out of air) to banks, who in turn loans it to consumers (I mean human beings), the debt includes the principle (money created out of nothing) and the interest (money which doesnt exist). In the long run, it is clear that the system is only sustained by more money being created, which is why inflation is a constant. </strong><strong>And when one component of this system goes bankrupt (an event built into this system of fiat money), the rest is history.</strong> <em><strong>The system has to keep pumping out money to cover up the existing debt and in the process, creates more debt.</strong></em> <strong>Crazy? Well, thats called our beautiful fractional reserve banking system which serves to consolidate power and wealth in the hands of a small elite.</strong></p>

              <p>No matter how well the judge guide the jury, they are still not proffessional and not as accountable as the judge. the defendent can appeal, and this of course shows lack of trust of the citizens in the jury system, because they think that if they try again, things will turn out differently this time.

              <p>US use jury system does not mean it is perfect. try reading books that highlight the deficiencies of the jury system.</p>
              <p>No matter how well the judge guide the jury, they are still not proffessional and not as accountable as the judge. the defendent can appeal, and this of course shows lack of trust of the citizens in the jury system, because they think that if they try again, things will turn out differently this time. But the appeal system is not easy, you can research that if you want ===&gt;accountability</p>
              <p>if using the jury system is on par, or not more efficient than the judge system, than why should the economy suffer more??? why why why??  ==&gt; economics</p>

              <p><br>If you do not care how the previous Jury system worked in Singapore - is there any point in discussing this further ?</p>
              <p>No one said that the jury are legal professionals, and who said that they are not as accountable for the verdicts ?</p>
              <p>The fact that the defendant has been given a right of appeal does not mean that the Jury System is flawed, if that is the case are you suggesting that Trial by a Single Judge is similarly flawed as the defendant is also given similar rights to Appeal ?</p>
              <p>How many persons form the jury in any trial ?</p>
              <p>Can these few persons in a population of 4.5 million residents affect the economy ?</p>
              <p>If the tenure of the judges are not contracturally renewable and whose appointment is not subjected to the whims and manipulation of ONE Man or a Single Political Party, it can be conceded to be considerably more efficient in a country run on the industrial or commercial productivity standards.</p>
