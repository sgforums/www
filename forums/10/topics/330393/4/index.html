              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>What about below logic:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...We will explore some of these terms, starting with the most obvious feature of financial systems, their role in supplying credit.</p>
              <p>Credit involves lending money to people on the understanding that they will pay the money back later along with a bonus or 'royalty', usually in the form of a rate of interest.</p>
              <p>There is nothing necessarily capitalist about credit and large parts of national credit systems are not related to production at all. Workers can put their savings into a credit co-operative and draw loans from it in hard times in the hope of paying the money back in better times.</p>
              <p>They pay a royalty for the service but this can be small because the co-operative is non-profit-making. Such co-operatives  serve consumption needs, not production and they are not capitalist. Building societies confined to the housing market play a similar role in supplying credit for people to purchase housing.</p>
              <p>A common feature of these kinds of organisations is that the credit-money that they issue is directly derived from savings deposited within them. In other words, their resources come from the past production of value in the economy: employees' savings come from wages that they have already earned in production.</p>
              <p>&gt;<strong>Banks are different because they are able to create new money in their credit operations.</strong> We can see this when we realise that at any one time, the banks as a whole could be giving overdrafts to everybody in the entire economy. Thus, far more money is circulating in the economy than the money derived from savings generated by past value creation. Part of the money is actually what  we can call fictitious money -- money derived not from the past but from expectations that it will be validated by future productive activity.</p>
              <p>Within capitalism, banks also do not have to be operated as private capitalist companies. At the beginning of the 1990s, for example, more than half of the 100 biggest banks in Europe were publicly owned and their financial criteria for operating were, in principle, matters of public choice.</p>
              <p>And even if they are private, the banks play such an essential and powerful role in the public economy because of their capacity to issue credit money that any sensible capitalist class will ensure that the state is constantly interfering in their operations  (even though, for ideological reasons, one wants to keep these state functions 'low profile').  As Kapstein puts it: "Banks are told how much capital they must hold, where they can operate, what products they can sell, and how much they can lend to any one firm."10</p>
              <p>The existence of this fictitious credit money is very beneficial for the whole economy because of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>role in facilitating the circulation of commodities.</strong></span> Without it, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">economic development would be far slower.</span></strong> It is especially important to employers, enabling them to raise large amounts of money for equipment which will yield up its full value in production only over many future years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If employers could invest only real savings -- the money derived from past value-creation -- investing in fixed capital would be far more costly --too costly for a lot of investment.</strong></span></p>
              <p>&gt;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And credit has also become a very important means of expanding the sales of goods to consumers.</strong></span> This is another way of saying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>modern economies run on large amounts of debt.</strong></span> So the banks do play an important role in both channelling savings and creating new funds (fictitious money) for productive investment. An entire capitalist economy could be run with a financial system consisting entirely of such banks...</p>

              <p><br>Essentially, I agree. But this piece doesnt really come to a conclusion about the way society is run. It leaves out how <strong><em>privately-owned banks lend money to the government at interest, <strong>which guarantees a country in debt, subjected to the control of the corporate banking elite</strong></em></strong>. Furthermore, I also agree that today money is debt. So we are being subjugated ECONOMICALLY; ergo economic slavery.</p>
              <p>Even under a fractional reserve system, but controlled by the government, with no infiltration by corporate elites, things would be better for the common man.</p>

              <p>Propaganda is defined as an organised effort to promote a particular belief or doctrine. It is a technical word. But today, it has taken on a negative connotation due to media conditioning (though the education system could be blamed as well).</p>

              <p>Absolutely. Thats why in some earlier post, I advocated the abolishing of the monetary system to get rid of corporate greed that is messing up our world.</p>
              <p>I admit that getting rid of money wouldnt solve human greed. But with money gone, society can achieve a more equitable distribution of goods than money prevents. Our present fractional reserve banking system just concentrates money and wealth into the hands of a corporate elite. Otherwise, the money that creates societal distortion will vanish and one problem will be solved.</p>

              <p>You dont seem to understand what I've tried to explain. Everything one says, reflecting a particular belief, is "propaganda work". I am doing propaganda work. You are doing propaganda work. Everyone on a forum, and who thinks and shares his opinion, does propaganda work. The difference is whether your propaganda serves to exploit and to misinform people.</p>

              <p>Absolutely. Thats why in some earlier post, I advocated the
                                      abolishing of the monetary system to get rid of corporate greed
                                      that is messing up our world.</p>
              <p>I admit that getting rid of money wouldnt solve human greed. But
                                      with money gone, society can achieve a more equitable distribution
                                      of goods than money prevents. Our present fractional reserve
                                      banking system just concentrates money and wealth into the hands of
                                      a corporate elite. Otherwise, the money that creates societal
                                      distortion will vanish and one problem will be solved.</p>

              <p>What you propose cannot be achieved without a massive amount of blood and a complete overhaul of the current global order. It's not media propaganda, it's just simple human history.</p>
              <p>Even then, it changes nothing. There will always be a new mode of exchange. There will always be a group of people who are more equal than the rest. That, is how human society functions.</p>

              <p>How many jobs can anyone work on with the Labor Laws that even determine the amount of time ?</p>
              <p>Unless you are a factory production worker that sits as a machine operator and becomes part of the machine, your productivity is measured by the number of items produced.</p>
              <p>With the more talented foreigners doing this kind of repetitive works, what is there left for intelligent sparks like you to perform ?</p>
              <p>In any case, can you even abscond from NSF Reservist Training for reasons of your work being too much ?</p>
              <p>The same goes with Jury Duties as a responsible Citizen, which obviously you know nothing about as you have not even experienced nor understand its usefulness and functions.</p>

              <p>about the jobless stuff, my bad, my english is bad, and since you have clarified it once, i won't mention it again and again and again and again.</p>
              <p>yah, there are books and reports on the cons of not having a jury system. why am i not surprise? maybe because every system is not perfect? why not read a book on the cons of the jury system while you are at it?</p>

              <p> Are there any cons in any system that cannot be fine-tuned and ironed out ?</p>
              <p>Have you read any book on the cons of a jury system that is impossible to be fixed ?</p>
