              in which we cited disputes of fact and law. In other words, there were
              triable issues. The summary judgment meant that we were found guilty

              plaintiffs.</blockquote>

'If it is not sheer stupidity to continue enforcing bans on these films when they can be viewed at a click of a mouse, I don't know what is,' he wrote on his blog.<br><br>How did he come to be such a fighter against Section 33 of the Films Act, which bans party political films?<br><br>Political awakening<br><br>ATTRIBUTE it to a second political awakening that came in the wake of the 2001 <a title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with &amp;lsquo;general election&amp;rsquo;" rel="nofollow" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/general%20election">general election</a>.<br><br>He had had a first awakening back in the mid-1990s, when a photocopy of a banned book came his way.<br><br>The book was To Catch A Tartar, written by former solicitor-general <a title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with &amp;lsquo;Francis Seow&amp;rsquo;" rel="nofollow" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Francis%20Seow">Francis Seow</a>, describing his detention under the Internal Security Act in the late 1980s.<br><br>'My eyes were opened to the darker side of the PAP's history,' he says.</p>

              <p><br>'I read it from cover to cover. I felt...frightened, depressed and angry at the same time.'<br><br>His hitherto placid political outlook changed then, but it was only later - after the November 2001 election - that he was really roused into action.<br><br>What caught his attention was Dr Chee Soon Juan heckling then prime minister Goh Chok Tong about an alleged loan to former Indonesian president Suharto.<br><br>'Chee Soon Juan got hammered very badly. I wondered, is this guy as bad as the media made him out to be? So I decided to check him out myself,' he says.<br><br>A few months later, in 2002, he asked to meet Dr Chee.<br><br>For the next two years, he 'interviewed' the SDP leader regularly, visited him at his home and his office, and observed him when he staged public protests - filming all the while.<br><br>He had reams of footage but no film, until Mr Lee Hsien Loong was sworn in as Prime Minister in 2004.<br><br>Mr Lee's inauguration speech, promising the opening up of civil society, inspired him to compile his shots into a 28-minute film which he titled Singapore Rebel.<br><br>He submitted it for screening at a film festival. But the film never made it past the censors.<br><br>It was deemed 'party political', and banned under Section 33 of the Films Act.<br><br>He was questioned four times over 15 months by the police and even had his video camera seized.<br><br>'They dropped the investigation a couple of months after the 2006 general election. I guess they wanted to watch if I would participate in the election,' he says.<br><br>He never did. But he continued to produce politically incorrect films.<br><br>Singapore Rebel<br><br>MR SEE titled his directorial debut Singapore Rebel. Although about Dr Chee, it sums up Mr See himself - someone bent on capturing alternative politics on celluloid.<br><br>He began his film-making career nearly 20 years ago, right after national service, learning the ropes of video editing in production houses. Along the way, he became a freelance video editor, working for renowned local directors such as Mr Eric Khoo and Mr Jack Neo.<br><br>He spends 90 per cent of his time doing such work to 'pay the bills', but the remaining 10 per cent is now consumed by his passion - making films on local political issues.<br><br>While being questioned by the police over Singapore Rebel, he produced another film, on former political detainee Said Zahari. This was also banned.<br><br>His latest, on Dr Chee and the protests he staged during the IMF-World Bank meetings in 2006, however made the cut. Speakers' Cornered was given an NC-16 rating and screened at the Substation on July 26 this year.<br><br>Despite the overwhelmingly pro-opposition - especially pro-SDP - angles in his films, he insists he is not an opposition supporter or sympathiser.<br><br>He says: 'I fill a vacuum created by the media when they don't cover opposition politicians or political dissidents. I consider myself a citizen journalist, not a Michael Moore type of film-maker.'<br><br>Asked why he bothers to submit his films for classification when he can upload them on YouTube, he deadpans that the law requires it.<br><br>The more compelling reason is that he wants to push the envelope in the area of political expression.<br><br>'Who better to do that than me,' he says, 'since I'm already over the OB markers. I want more film-makers who want to document the political scenes to emerge.'<br><br>In this, he has found a following of sorts.<br><br>Mr Ho Choon Hiong, 33, first heard about Mr See when Singapore Rebel was banned three years ago.<br><br>He was among a group of 12 film-makers who wrote to the Government then, asking for greater clarity as to what constituted a party political film.<br><br>The incident led to him meeting Mr See.<br><br>Their subsequent exchanges emboldened him to capture on celluloid assorted scenes of political activism in Singapore.<br><br>Unlike Mr See, he was introduced to politics early by his father, who used to be a student activist at Chinese High School in the 1960s.<br><br>Like Mr See, however, his political interest was stoked by the 2001 polls and Dr Chee.<br><br>After meeting Mr See, he produced a plethora of very short films, on topics ranging from the 2006 election to protests by Myanmar nationals in Singapore. He sent six to the film censors for classification in May.<br><br>'I have to take a few steps and hope to be undeterred more and more,' says the film studies graduate from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br><br>'I want to put my own perception of truth out.'<br><br>So far, his 'films' have been ignored by the authorities.<br><br>A prolific activist<br><br>NOT so for Mr Seelan Palay, 24, another amateur film-maker.<br><br>He had his film, One Nation Under Lee, seized by officials from the Board of Film Censors as it was being screened in a hotel recently.<br><br>The reason: It had not been passed by the censors.<br><br>His first effort - detractors panned it as a slide show rather than a film - it portrayed Singapore as lacking in press and political freedom, and tightly controlled by Mr Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Point out that One Nation Under Lee is decidedly one-sided - it takes potshots at the Government while hailing Dr Chee as a hero - and he insists he has no political agenda.<br><br>He isn't politicised by anyone either, he insists.<br><br>'I learnt everything from reading, out of personal interest,' says the activist.<br><br>CITIZEN JOURNALIST<br><br>'I fill a vacuum created by the media when they don't cover opposition politicians or political dissidents. I consider myself a citizen journalist, not a Michael Moore type of film-maker.'<br>-- Film-maker Martyn See<br><br>He has been involved at various times with the Vegetarian Society, the Animal Concerns Research &amp; Education Society, and the now defunct SG Human Rights Group.<br><br>Earlier this year he attended rallies by Hindu protesters in Kuala Lumpur, and upon his return to Singapore, decided to mount a one-man protest fast outside the Malaysian High Commission.<br><br>He also takes part in protest actions organised by the SDP occasionally.<br><br>He is not a troublemaker, he insists. He is just doing what he believes in.<br><br>Nothing to fear<br><br>WHAT keeps the trio going?<br><br>'Our conscience pricks us,' says Mr Ho. He sees it as his duty to document what he believes gets sidelined by the mainstream media.<br><br>The trio use the same counter when you point out that their version of 'truth' sometimes takes an extreme slant. Others have noted that it was the publicity over the banning of some of their films, rather than the quality of the films themselves, that made the public more keen to view them.<br><br>But they are not perturbed.<br><br>For Mr See, his mission is simple.<br><br>'I live by the Singapore Pledge. I live by the Constitution that guarantees freedom of expression, association and assembly,' he says.<br><br>And he aims to guard these freedoms by showing that there is nothing to fear.<br><br>The other two, less articulate about their aims, appear to go with the flow as acolytes of Mr See, enjoying the thrill of defiance every once in a while.<br><br>They are all drawn to Dr Chee, whom they see as championing freedom of expression and provoking the Government with his illegal public protests.<br><br>Still, they say, they have no intention of joining the SDP or any political party. Ironically, they fear being hemmed in by party discipline.<br><br>Mr Palay, for instance, will tell you that he supports the SDP's cause but has no wish to sign on as a member.<br><br>Have they made an impact on the political scene? They believe so, pointing to more local film-makers who remain anonymous but, like them, upload political-type films on YouTube.<br><br>They also claim some credit for the Government's decision to consider lifting the ban on political films.<br><br>It was, they say, the banning of Mr See's Singapore Rebel that sparked a debate on the relevance of the Films Act.<br><br>Future films<br><br>FOR now, the three men have film ideas that they hope will see the light of day.<br><br>Mr Palay wants to do a film on the unspoken rule limiting use of dialects in films.<br><br>Mr Ho is aiming to do documentaries on two women: Dr Chee's wife, and his own long-lost Malaysian nanny whom he is still trying to locate.<br><br>As for Mr See, he has two targets too. One is the reclusive former political detainee Chia Thye Poh. The other is Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>In the latter film, he wants to trace the People's Action Party's formation and rise to the pinnacle of power in Singapore.<br><br>Why do a film on the PAP when its story has been told so many times before? 'It is a compelling story,' he says.<br><br>So are they really rebels with a cause?<br><br>Says Mr See: 'There's definitely a purpose to what we're doing. I see it as lessening the climate of fear here.<br><br>'I want more film-makers like me to emerge, wanting to document the political scenes in Singapore.'</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Internet"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked.

              <p>A.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Did he want to imply that Summary Judgement is granted without trial?</span></p>

              <p>In this case,Lees applied for Summary Judgement,after reading Chees defence.</p>
              <p>The Judge hold the hearing in Chamber.But Chees and his learned lawyer</p>

              <p>any things did happen to them on the day of hearing.</p>
              <p>So,i assume they CHOSE NOT to attend the hearing.</p>
              <p>If they did not attend on their own and free will,Chees and lawyer gave up</p>

              <p>By Paul Jacob and Aaron Low</p>
              <p>The High Court ruled yesterday that the Chee siblings defamed
                                      Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in
                                      articles in their political party's newsletter.</p>
              <p>The Lees were awarded damages -- to be decided at a later
                                      hearing -- along with an injunction preventing any repetition of
                                      their allegation and costs.</p>
              <p>The ruling by Justice Belinda Ang was made at a closed-door
                                      hearing which Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon

              <p>Dr Chee again tried to have the proceedings adjourned, saying Mr
                                      Ravi was too ill to be present -- but did not produce a medical
                                      certificate attesting to his condition.</p>
              <p>He said if the hearing continued, he would discharge Mr Ravi and
                                      find a new lawyer. But he left just after 11am before the

              <p>If the truth can be told, why were Singaporeans cheated of hearing more from the 5 day cross-examination that was agreed with CSJ and his sister at a pretrial hearing for LKY and LHL to take the witness box - when after the first day hearing, the entire session was shortened by almost three days, and the hours in court also shortened ?</p>
              <p>Was the shortened number of days due to the embarrassing details that must be raised in a Public Hearing that will include the reputation of LKY and LHL being examined to determine their public standing in the eyes of Singaporeans - so as to determine the quantum of damages payable ?</p>

              <div class="byline">
              <p>The most dogged critic of Singapore’s former prime minister, <a title="More articles about Lee Kuan Yew." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/lee_kuan_yew/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></span></a>, was finally able to confront his accuser this week in open court, as the prime minister sat in the witness box.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lee, 84, has often used the battlefield of the courtroom and the weapon of the libel suit to keep opponents quiet. But this week, for the first time, he was forced to face one of his critics in court — and his antagonist, Chee Soon Juan, an opposition politician, made the most of his moment.</p>
              <p>“I couldn’t make this up, even if I wanted to, how much justice has been gagged, bound up, kicked, raped, quartered and then, at the very last moment, the dagger plunged right through,” Mr. Chee said in the open court hearings, according to local media reports.</p>
              <p>It was an extraordinary confrontation between the country’s most dominant figure and a powerless but insistent adversary.</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee, 45, and his sister, Chee Siok Chin, had already been convicted of libel for an article implying corruption in Singapore’s government that was published in a newsletter in 2006.</p>
              <p>The three days of hearings, which ended Wednesday, were held to determine how much in damages they now owe to Mr. Lee and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Justice Belinda Ang said she would consider the arguments and issue her ruling later.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lee has made it a point to pursue his critics in the courts, determined to put them in their place and, he says, to clear any cloud around his name and legacy.</p>
              <p>“They know me by now,” Mr. Lee said of the people of Singapore, “that if anybody impugns the integrity of the government, of which I was the prime minister, I must sue.”</p>
              <p>He added: “There are various parts of this government which do not comply with Western practices, including the law of libel. But it is a system that has worked.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Lee and other Singaporean leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from lawsuits against their critics and have been accused by human rights groups of using the lawsuits to silence opposition.</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee is already bankrupt after failing to pay 500,000 Singapore dollars in libel damages to Mr. Lee and former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for remarks he made during the 2001 elections.</p>
              <p>None of the critics contest Mr. Lee’s success in building Singapore into one of the region’s most prosperous and stable countries since it became independent in 1965. Even opponents like Mr. Chee credit him with bringing the good life to this tiny, resource-poor city-state.</p>
              <p>But there seemed to be more than policy involved in the two men’s courtroom confrontation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lee expressed what seemed an extraordinary sense of vulnerability, even to the words of a lone critic, while his antagonist described a compulsion — even a mission — to challenge power at any cost.</p>
              <p>“If I did not take him seriously, and he keeps on repeating this, and others repeat this, at the end of the day, I and the party that I used to lead will be totally destroyed,” Mr. Lee told the court.</p>
              <p>For Mr. Chee the issue seemed to run just as deep.</p>
              <p>“I may remain a bankrupt for the rest of my life as a result of my obstinacy,” he said. “It is not a position one aspires to, but it is a cause I find worthy of battle and a call, though sometimes I may resist, I will ultimately trust and obey.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee added: “I cannot deny that I get angry and even bitter with Mr. Lee Kuan Yew over the things that he has said and done to me and others. But through the years, I have seen the bigger picture and developed a sense of calm and equanimity that comes with knowing my role in society.”</p>
              <p>Clearly, after years of political clashes, the two men do not care for each other, and they did not mince words.</p>
              <p>“He’s a liar, a cheat, and altogether an unscrupulous man,” Mr. Lee said of Mr. Chee. “I could also add that I’ve had several of my own doctors who are familiar with such conduct,” he continued, “tell me that he is near-psychopath.”</p>
              <p>As for what Mr. Chee thinks of Mr. Lee: “I don’t hate you,” he told the man facing him on the stand. “I feel sorry for you. I think you cut a pitiable figure.”</p>
              <p>In the end, the point of contention was the price in political and civic freedoms that Singapore has had to pay for its prosperity.</p>
              <p>“The final test is what Singapore was when I became prime minister in 1959 and what Singapore is now,” Mr. Lee said. “We had less than $100 million in the kitty.” Today, he said, “global financial services assess Singapore to have <a title="More articles about sovereign wealth funds." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/sovereign_wealth_funds/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">sovereign wealth funds</span></span></a> of over $300 billion.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee responded with a list of the grievances of the opposition, which he described as the silencing of political opponents, the closing down of independent media “and all your shenanigans, including making sure that I’m not allowed to speak during an election rally.”</p>
              <p>Is all that justified, he asked, because “now we have $300 billion in our kitty?”</p>
              <p>Mr. Chee’s legal troubles continue. Because of his vigorous behavior during the hearings this week, he has been charged with contempt of court. He is scheduled for a hearing on that charge on Friday and could face a term in jail.</p>

This time he is accused of the “crime” of holding a meeting with more than five persons without a permit. The Singapore constitution guarantees freedom of opinion, expression and assembly. <br><br>“Every time we applied for a permit we have been turned down and the minister said that he would never grant a permit,” said Dr. Chee. <br>His ordeal began after he joined the opposition party and criticized the cronyism and secrecy of the Singaporean government. Since then, lawsuits have bankrupted him personally, are about to bankrupt his political party, have sent him to jail because he is unable to pay fines anymore, have cost him his university position as a lecturer and denied him basic legal rights such as legal representation or the right to cross-examine or present a defense.<br><br>And every time he criticizes such unjust treatment he is sued for defamation, then fined huge amounts or sent to jail.<br><br>Singapore also muzzles the press.

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee Kuan Yew vs The Singapore Democratic Party, Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Chee Siok Chin, et al.<br></strong><br>Dr. Chee to the Court on a preliminary objection:<br></span><br><em>Your Honor, I appear in these proceedings under protest.<br><br>I understand these proceedings are concerned with the issue of the assessment of damages.<br><br>However these proceedings now are dependant on whether the judgment obtained against me in the earlier summary proceedings are in fact valid and sound.<br><br>I again raise the defense which I had raised in the earlier summary judgment proceedings, which is, that firstly the court had no lawful jurisdiction to find against me in summary judgment proceedings in a defamation case.<br><br>As your Honor is aware, since these proceedings were brought before Your Honor respecting the summary judgment, I had at all times, strenuously disputed all the allegations raised against me by the Plaintiff in his Statement of Claim.<br><br>This being so, there was clearly a triable issue and therefore summary proceedings, where witnesses are not available for cross examination was a patent misuse of the law.<br><br>In every Common Law jurisdiction, the rules governing summary proceedings are very clear.<br><br>Summary Judgment can only be issued in cases where there is no triable issue, thus making any trial a waste of judicial time.<br><br>This as you are aware was not the case.<br><br>I had strenuously disputed each and every allegation made against me by the Plaintiffs and my defense which I filed made it clear that I was denying all liability.<br><br>My defense had ample factual grounds to join issue with the Plaintiffs allegations and therefore clearly a triable issue was raised.<br><br>Section 5 of the Singapore Civil law Act makes it clear that the Law of England and Wales will be the basis of the civil law in Singapore; in other words Common Law prevails.<br><br>Since there was clearly a triable issue, it was wrong in law for Your Honor to have proceeded in summary proceedings, thereby denying me a right to cross examine my accusers and therefore making the judgment against me a sham and void in law.<br><br>Secondly, Your Honor is aware that the hearing for that summary judgment proceedings was itself conducted in violation of the rules of natural justice, in that, firstly it was conducted in the absence of my counsel who was taken ill and secondly, even I was not present during the proceedings in chambers.<br><br>This court was totally unreasonable and determined not to give my lawyer, M Ravi a chance to represent me.<br><br>Therefore Your Honor proceeding with the summary judgment in these circumstances was an egregious denial of natural justice.<br><br>Please refer to page 29, 30 and 31 of the Affidavit in Chief of the Plaintiff Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>At page 29, para 70, it is admitted that my then counsel was seriously ill and physically unable to attend court.<br><br>Whereas any normal reasonable judge who would have given a reasonable time for the lawyer to produce a medical certificate, Your Honor was exceptionally and unusually opposed to offer any reasonable courtesy to a lawyer in these circumstances, by requiring him to produce a medical certificate that very afternoon!<br><br>Your determination not to provide any reasonable time for my lawyer who was clearly unwell shows bias and malice against me and a desire to favor the Plaintiffs.<br><br>Furthermore it is normal common courtesy at the Bar to take the word of a fellow member of the Bar if he claims to be ill.<br><br>This courtesy is offered in all civilized countries let alone common law jurisdictions which Your Honor was determined to deny.<br><br>In spite of the totally unreasonable position of Your Honor, I did manage with great difficulty to comply with Your Honor's unreasonable request by producing the required medical report that same afternoon.<br><br>Secondly, Your Honor not being a medical or dental practitioner was wrong in making a determination that very day that my lawyer was faking his illness and therefore must appear the very next day for trial.<br><br>I refer to Para 72 in page 30. Your Honor says " CSJ produced a note and a one day medical certificate (both from a dentist) for Mr. Ravi. Justice Ang found several discrepancies..........pericoronitis caused by poor oral hygiene in the area around the lower right wisdom tooth.............unfit for duty on Monday 11 September 2006.................pericoronitis which was a new development.......Davinder Singh counsel for LHL and LKY pointed out additional discrepancies.................the note was not in compliance of pt 2 Para 13...............the dentists note was in black ink whereas the date was in blue ink....................."<br><br>In Para 73 of page 30 of LKY's Affidavit it reads that Your Honor had fixed the hearing for 10 am the next day since the medical certificate was only for one day.<br><br>Even if M Ravi’s certificate was only for a day, it is customary for judges everywhere to give a reasonable amount of time, perhaps 2 weeks to fix another date for the continued hearing.<br><br>Therefore fixing the continued hearing the very next day showed a bias against me, almost a determination to make it as difficult as possible for me. Your Honor’s bias seemed very clear from your actions.<br><br>Firstly I submit that as Your Honor is not a qualified medical practitioner and neither a dental practitioner, you had no basis in law to make a judgment that my lawyer was not seriously ill and therefore under normal circumstances should have been given a reasonable amount of time to recuperate before required to attend court.<br><br>A reading of the record clearly gives the impression that Your Honor was determined not to give the common courtesy or the benefit of the doubt to my lawyer since he could in fact be seriously ill.<br><br>Your Honor's ruling to require my lawyer to come the very next day in the morning to court, less than even 24 hours, shows malice, ill will and a bias against me and favoritism for the Plaintiff.<br><br>In pages 31, 32 and 33 of Lee's said Affidavit, Your Honor goes on to justify why Your Honor proceeded in my absence but Your Honor’s attempt to do it is clearly without any merit and seen only as a judge who is in a great hurry to decide the case in favor of the Plaintiff.<br><br>In Paras 74, 75 and 76, the facts clearly show your Honor's bias and non compliance of legal principles.<br><br>Firstly, just because my lawyer’s medical certificate was for only one day, Your Honor is determined to assume that he is fit and well the very next day, which Your Honor knows to be not the normal case.<br><br>Humans just like any other living thing, need time to recover, especially since Your Honor is not a doctor and could not have known of the extent of my lawyer’s illness.<br><br>Furthermore, Your Honor makes an issue of my failure to attend the summary proceedings.<br><br>Your Honor should be aware that since Your Honor had already decided to proceed with the case without my lawyer present on that day, it is highly prejudicial to my case to defend my self being a lay person while the Plaintiff is being represented by Senior Counsel.<br><br>In these circumstances, it is patently unjust on Your Honor’s part to insist that I defend myself against a trained and experienced senior counsel without a lawyer.<br><br>Your Honor's pre-determined bias, malice and ill will against me is also shown by the fact that the Plaintiffs would have not been prejudiced in any way by Your Honor acceding to my request for a reasonable adjournment of not more than 2 weeks to enable either my lawyer to recover or for me to obtain alternative counsel.<br><br>Even if the case had been delayed for some time earlier, still, the Plaintiffs would have suffered no prejudice and judicial time would not have been wasted by allowing the short adjournment.<br></em><br><br><em>Had I not done anything in the mealtime, Your Honor would have been well within your rights to find against me.<br><br>However in Your Honor's determination to find in favor of the Minister Mentor and the Prime Minister of Singapore, Your Honor failed to provide that very short and reasonable time for either my lawyer to get better or for me to find another counsel in his stead, by reason of which I was seriously prejudiced.<br><br>Therefore your honor would see, by any yardstick that my refusal to take part in those proceedings was not only the right thing to do; it was also the legally correct position to take.<br><br>I was preserving my right to challenge the courts judgment by my refusing to attend since, had I attended without counsel, my attendance in these proceedings may be construed as a waiver of my right to counsel during the proceedings, thereby preventing me from raising it in any appeal against Your Honor’s decision.<br><br>Moreover it is clear from the minutes of the Summary Proceedings that Your Honor while in Chambers with Davinder Singh counsel for the Plaintiffs insulted my honesty and integrity called me dishonest and other such epithets.<br><br>I am in possession of those offending minutes which leaves no doubt in anyone’s mind that Your Honor has already decided even before the proceedings ever started that you were going to decide in favor of the Plaintiffs.<br><br>I therefore make the following preliminary objections at this stage.<br><br>Even though these proceedings are meant only to decide on the quantum of damages, Your Honor still has the power at this stage of the case to take judicial notice of the blatant abuse of the law before Your Honor at the summary judgment proceedings and therefore Sua Sponte, under Your Honor's inherent jurisdiction, you have the power to set aside the earlier summary judgment and give me leave to defend this libel action against me.<br><br>I therefore make this formal request that the Summary Judgment be set aside and that I be given leave to defend.<br><br>If Your Honor is not prepared to set aside the Summary Judgment; since Your Honor was the one that heard the summary judgment against me which I have publicly protested to be unjust and unfair and accused Your Honor of bias and misuse of the law; the correct thing for Your Honor to do is to recuse yourself and let another judge hear these proceedings.<br><br>As the legal aphorism correctly states: Justice must not only be done but must be patently seen to be done. In this case justice was not at all done and was not seen to be done.</em></p>

Dr. Chee has to show that Lee is without any respect in the community, that people consider him no better than a rascal and someone who will shamelessly use crooked means to amass wealth.<br><br>In the first instance, Dr. Chee’s attack on Lee’s character should be based on the pleadings. For instance if he says he was the Prime Minister of Singapore, to show that he got the position by dishonest means.<br><br>In this case, since Lee’s position is that the people would believe that just as the NKF, Lee is corrupt, prove that Lee in fact had control over NKF and since he did nothing to stop the corruption there, he was clearly complicit in it. Moreover his government is no different from NKF since there is no accountability and the newspapers are state controlled and a mouthpiece for propaganda.<br><br>Other than specifically trying to disprove Lee’s claim of respectability, defamation law permits a defendant to raise even extraneous evidence of lack of reputation.<br><br>Therefore Lee’s rigging elections to remain ion power, his misuse of the law to eliminate opposition politicians, his purchasing Jade condominium at a discounted price, his paying himself $3.7 million, his refusal to permit transparency for Tumasek and GIC are all matters that you can validly go into.<br><br>In other words, once a person sues another for defamation, his entire life including everything private and public is fair game to be attacked.

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in
              speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people
              the impression that there are others out there that would agree
              with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a
              false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of
              support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being
              hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in
              which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned.
              Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen
              responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never
              posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread
              called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify
              gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and
              phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by
              this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually
              indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we
              can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting
              of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their
              context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos
              and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY
              make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal;"><span>Hence
              lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20
              minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace.
              Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal;"><span>But
              after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to
              makepeace</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he
              pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote
              himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really
              hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying
              back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny,
              frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from
              the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked.
              Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what
              really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was
              caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another paethetic, and desperate reply from him when he was
              cornered:</p>
              <p>Those who want to see what happened can go here:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/315326">http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/315326</a></p>
              <p>And some screencaps, so the evidence is preserved:</p>

A good number of them who will not give way to you on the highway.  Whether we like it or not, PAP scholars and ministers are a better choice. </p>

              <p>Should we find your views to be contradictory when you state that Singaporeans remain a proud people - with 70% votes given to LHL - but at the same time, you will believe that a good number of Singaporeans will be take advantage of any liberty given to PROUD Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Why will the PROUD Singaporeans who voted for LHL behave utterly in self-interest, and "sell" their country without conscience ?</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised that your PROUD Singaporeans are too proud to give way to you on the highway ?</p>
              <p>For those with myopic vision and uninspired mind, the PAP scholars and ministers are obviously better choice in Government despite their consumate abilities to make immature, reckless and irrational remarks that include:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Unlike the USA where funds can be released to boost consumer spending to jump start the economy from a recession, Singapore is too small and the economy too open and such a policy will result in the outflow of money to other countries" </em>- spoken by PAP Scholar LHL.</p>
              <p>He must have forgotten that the USA is the biggest market for the World, and the US consumers are the world biggest user of all consumer products and services from China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and all the other emerging economies.</p>
              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p><em>"With the evening ERP in place, less traffic jams will result in higher turnover of business in Chinatown"</em> - Communications Minister RL.</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that the ERP had to be modified as business was so badly affected that some had to close ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Removing petrol tax is a subsidy to Singaporeans"</em> - Minister MBT.</p>
              <p>Singapore is the only place in the planet that tax removal becomes a subsidy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"You marry a non-graduate, then you are going to worry if your son or daughter is going to make it to the university."</em> - MM LKY</p>
              <p>Is he embarrassed of his own roots - a salesman for a father, and a housewife for a mother ? Perhaps his creation was from a laboratory dish ? Have we not heard and read enough of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1437-eugenics-in-singapore">LKY’s eugenics in Singapore </a>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Spend more money or Singapore will go into a recession"</em> - SM GCT</p>
              <p>Without Singaporean spending more, will there be enough GST collections to buy him the quality peanuts that he and his wife need ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<em>Singaporeans are being complacent when they believe that the Government will take care of all security matters"</em> - MM LKY on MSK escape, 5 April 2005, ST</p>
              <p>Despite collecting the million dollar annual wage package PLUS his pension - all paid for by Singaporean Tax Payers, are Singaporeans not entitled to such a belief ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"First, the CPI measures average changes in prices across all households. Whether there is an increase in the Cost of Living for a particular household depends on that household's spending patterns. Switching to cheaper products can reduce the Cost of Living despite a rise in CPI"</em> - LHK, 14 Nov 2007, ST</p>
              <p>Can cheaper products exist when the CPI indicate increase across the board ?</p>
              <p>With products costs dependent on the primary factors of business such as rent, utilities, fuel, transportation, taxes - do cheap products exist in a situation where the CPI indicate increases ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The market is controlled by the forces of the economy. this is not true if you only consider a few country, government intervention can skew the market quite badly. but if you consider it glocbally, with roughly two hundred countries, you will need a damn powerful country, or be delusional to think that the market does not reflect reality.</p>
