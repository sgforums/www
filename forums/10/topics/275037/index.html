            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Suicide rate climbs despite good times</span><br>(Insight Down South)</strong><br><br><strong>20 August 2007 by SEAH CHIANG NEE </strong><br><br>Not only are there higher rates of divorces, bankruptcies and crime against senior citizens, but in a land awash with jobs and better pay, the number of people killing themselves has surged.<br><br>A SURGING economy and promise of a brighter future have done little to prevent a decline of the city's social ills, including a worsening suicide rate.<br>Not only are there higher rates of divorces, bankruptcies and crime against senior citizens, but in a land awash with jobs and better pay, the number of people killing themselves has surged.<br><br>The government reported 419 cases last year, or at least one suicide every day, compared to 346 in 2003.<br><br>This was a jump of 21 per cent and is one of the highest in its post-independence history. It is the fourth straight rise in as many years. More people die from suicide than in accidents.<br><br>Surprisingly, too, is the profile of the suicidal.<br><br>The Singaporeans who strived to end it all ranged from teenagers to grandfathers.<br><br>But the largest group was men who were in the 40s, mostly made up of the 1965 independence generation. This rising trend is worrying the authorities.<br><br>The other large group was women aged 50 and older. For every death there were seven attempted suicides.<br><br>The gloomy statistics came shortly after Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had said that Singapore was in a "golden period", referring to its prosperity during the past two years.<br><br>For rich countries to register higher suicide rates than poorer ones is not a surprise by itself.<br><br>Singapore isn't doing too badly when compared to Japan and several advanced Western nations whose rates, despite better welfare help, are faring worse.<br><br>Singapore's leaders, however, have placed a higher emphasis on economic expansion over almost everything else on the basis that once you have achieved wealth, other problems can be resolved.<br><br>For many years, it had worked well in a simpler world, but less so in today's harsher competitive environment that frowns on welfarism.<br><br>More jobs are eradicated; more businesses get restructured and life becomes more uncertain.<br><br>Between 2000 and 2004, 1,723 people committed suicide or about 345 cases a year.<br><br>The Samaritans, which operates a 24-hour distress hotline, handles some 135 calls a day from desperate people unable to resolve their problems.<br><br>The number of calls has risen from 43,255 in 2005 to 49,025 in the past year with one in seven considered to be suicide risks.<br><br>In perspective, Singapore hasn't done badly against the developed world.<br><br>In 2003, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Singapore had a suicide rate of 18 per 100,000 people (12 male and 6 female) and ranked 52nd of 100 countries surveyed.<br><br>It was, however, ahead of more advanced nations like Japan (51 per 100,000), Belgium (40), Switzerland (37), France (35), Denmark (29) and Australia (26).<br><br>Sadly, it is not just about statistics. Each abandoned life has its own tortured tale of sufferings that are not always about money - although financial stress remains a top cause.<br><br>Overwhelming debts, neglect, family break-ups and poor health are some of the factors that push people to end their lives.<br><br>For the younger set, it is mainly over broken love or inability to cope with their studies or broken homes.<br><br>Singapore's rapid success is achieved with a price. Life is a rat race for people who are at the bottom of the ladder.<br><br>For a family man in his 40s who has been retrenched as a result of restructuring, it could be a fearful experience. Unlike other advanced countries, there is no unemployment help.<br><br>"In Malaysia or Indonesia, when a person loses his job, he could go to the countryside and live off the land," said a social worker. "Here there is no countryside to live off."<br><br>One of the saddest cases happened last year when an odd jobs labourer in his 40s killed himself by jumping in front of a speeding MRT train at Jurong.<br><br>He had been unemployed for four months, relying on his wife's S$500 monthly income to feed his family of four (with two teenage sons).<br><br>As bills mounted to $1,000, the hapless man promised his wife he would look for the money.<br><br>One night he gave $9 to his younger son and told him before leaving for his appointment with death, "Daddy is leaving for work, you have to look after mummy, you all have to take care."<br><br>At a time when Singapore was basking in prosperity, his tale stirred the very soul of the nation and public donations amounting to S$500,000 - poured in for the bereaved family.<br><br>"This speedy response shows that it is the people who are compassionate to its needs of their fellow beings rather than the government," one letter writer said.<br><br>Over the past year, the mass transit has become an avenue for committing suicide.<br><br>Four took place within a period of six weeks last year-end with two of them video taped by witnesses and posted on YouTube.<br><br>Why is the suicide rate higher in Singapore than a country like, say, Thailand when life is reported to be so much more comfortable?<br><br>One explanation lies in the psyche of Singaporeans, who tend to be harder striving, less tolerant of failures and overly materialistic.<br><br>As a result of high-pressured living, the economic growth hasn't spread happiness to all hard-pressed Singaporeans.<br><br>Many citizens do not have enough retirement savings and have been advised to work beyond 65 years to survive in this expensive city.<br><br></div>
