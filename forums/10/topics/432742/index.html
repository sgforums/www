              <p> </p>
              <p>As
                   a Singaporean who had dedicated 2.5 years of his life to serving the 
                  nation, it really pains me to read about what is becoming of this nation
                   in the article “<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/05/19/the-woes-of-a-singaporean-it-consultant/">The woes of a Singaporean IT consultant</a>”
                   – we now have under-qualified “foreign talents” who had merely 
                  fabricated their resumes are now being given priority to local jobs over
                   qualified Singaporean PMET’s (who, like me, had dedicated 2.5 years to 
                  serving the country). These foreign talents do not have to sacrifice a 
                  single second of their lives to protecting Singapore, yet are able to 
                  share in the same benefits as the Singaporeans whose jobs they have 
                  displaced.</p>
              <p>If this is not bad enough, let me add that Singapore is now being 
                  sold piecemeal to rich foreigners (some of which hail from dubious 
                  backgrounds, just like our “foreign talents”), by foreigners who have 
                  now decided to call themselves “Singaporeans” but actually have no 
                  intention to contribute back to Singapore (in any way), what benefits 
                  they have taken as “Singaporeans”. How do they do this? Via the <strong>Global Investor Program</strong> (a.k.a GIP scheme) [<a href="http://www.contactsingapore.org.sg/investors/move/global_investor_programme/">Link</a>] sanctioned by Contact Singapore. Let me explain how this works…</p>
              <p>The GIP scheme was actually endorsed by the government to attract 
                  skilled and rich individuals to invest in Singapore. One way is for the 
                  foreign individual to invest at least S$ 2.5 million in one of 
                  GIP-approved private equity funds [<a href="http://www.contactsingapore.org.sg/Library/1/Pages/1191/List%20of%20GIP-Approved%20Funds%20@%2019%20May%202011.pdf">Link</a>];
                   of course, the migrant in question must satisfy certain criteria to 
                  ensure that Singapore is actually accepting talent and not junk. If the 
                  criteria is satisfied and the migrant passes the interviews by the 
                  relevant governing body, he / she is then allowed to “invest” this money
                   in one of the GIP-approved funds and then obtains a Singapore-PR with 
                  no questions asked.</p>
              <p>From the GIP fund’s point of view, they manage the funds and are 
                  required by governing mandate to invest at least 50% of the funds into 
                  Singapore enterprises to encourage the growth of local enterprises. At 
                  the same time, the fund-manager collects 2.5%p.a. of the funds under 
                  management as management fees to cover operating costs. The fundamental 
                  intentions behind this idea are good.</p>
              <p>However, it has come to my attention that there are funds, which have
                   been started by former PRCs who have either become Singapore citizens 
                  or are currently awaiting to become Singapore citizens. Ironically, they
                   too became Singapore PRs (and then subsequently citizens) through this 
                  GIP scheme.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately (according to an insider), none of them have 
                  professional fund-management experience and are focused on raising as 
                  much money as possible (i.e. getting as many migrant-investors / clients
                   to invest in their fund as possible) rather than channeling the money 
                  to helping businesses grow, so that they may benefit from the 2.5% 
                  management fee. It appears that they have a terrible market reputation 
                  and actually advice some of their clients who do not meet the criteria 
                  to qualify for Singaporean PR under this scheme to get their documents 
                  forged.</p>
              <p>To make things worse, they have not invested a single cent of the 
                  funds raised in any Singaporean enterprise (instead investing in Chinese
                   enterprises recommended by their own friends or clients) and are not 
                  intending to invest a single cent in any Singaporean enterprise.</p>
              <p>To top it all off, I was told that this firm (based in Singapore) 
                  employs a lot more PRCs rather than Singaporeans. From what I 
                  understand, the founder of the firm has sent his wife and son to the UK 
                  for the son’s education, and is intending to send his son to the States 
                  thereafter for his university education, with no intention to let his 
                  son serve his rightful share of national service.</p>
              <p>To summarise it in a nutshell, Singapore offered such ingrates a good
                   life in Singapore by offering them Singaporean passports, and 
                  ultimately Singaporean citizenship, and how do they repay us?</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>By opening the floodgates to more foreigners and selling Singapore 
                  to more foreigners (some of who do not meet the criteria of 
                  highly-skilled migrants are encouraged to forge the necessary documents 
                  in order to pass the ICA) so that they may collect more fees and enrich 
                  themselves further;</strong></li>
              <p><strong>.</strong></p>
              <li><strong>the funds that were meant to go towards growing Singaporean 
                  enterprises in exchange for the Singaporean PRs we have so awarded these
                   rich individuals, are now being channeled back into China to fund 
                  Chinese enterprises – one does wonder why we’re awarding a Singaporean 
                  passport to the rich foreigners in the first place if it will not 
                  benefit the country;</strong></li>
              <p><strong>.</strong></p>
              <li><strong>a token number of jobs are created for Singaporeans in this firm – 
                  the firm still prefers to hire PRCs as the bosses do not trust 
                  Singaporeans from what I understand;</strong></li>
              <p><strong>.</strong></p>
              <li><strong>the founders of the firm are not letting their families serve their 
                  rightful due of national service to the country which gave them clean 
                  air to breathe and a safe environment to dream in every night; if they 
                  were back in China, they’d probably be choking on the polluted air and 
                  worrying about whether they would be kidnapped and held ransom by random
                   thugs.</strong></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Really, seeing such things happen in Singapore does make me wonder 
                  what this country is coming to – to have a country being sold out to 
                  foreigners by its own government is a terrible thing. To have a 
                  country’s government let foreigners sell its own country out piecemeal? 
                  That’s unheard of and absolutely ludicrous.</p>
