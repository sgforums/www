            <div class='col-md body'>I think the fundamental principle of equality may be further clarified as all men have equal rights.<br><br>If laws are passed to correct a perceived inequality of rights through giving one party more or greater rights, it is simply compounding the problem and only addressing the symptom. It also paves the way for more laws that promote inequality, well intentioned or otherwise.<br><br>I think that laws have to reflect the developments in society. If they become unenforcable, they should be reviewed and amended.<br><br>However all this must be done without losing sight of the fundamental principles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From wikipedia<br><br>"The Women's Charter was an Act of the Singaporean Parliament passed in 1961. The Act was designed to improve and protect the rights of females in Singapore and to guarantee greater legal equality for women in legally-sanctioned relationships (but not those of Muslims). Definitions of the rights of husbands and wives in marriage, as well as outlining legal potentialities with regard to divorce and separation, and the banning of polygamy are some of the major elements of the Act.<br>An amendment was passed to the Women's Charter in 1996, which focused around rights regarding domestic abuse and matrimonial assets."<br><br>Not mentioned above is that it also includes legislation dealing with the prostitution of women and girls. Doesn't seem to cover the prostitution of men and boys.<br><br>There is a basic assumption that the man is sole bread winner and therefore liable for maintenance but the woman is not.<br><br>I would consider that portion discrimination as house husbands are not protected. That part probably needs to be updated.<br><br>However if men find the laws governing marriages onerous then the entire Act relating to that should be examined and redressed. The purpose of the law was to protect women, not discourage marriage.<br><br>To abolish it would be to abolish many other things as well. It would be necessary to enact new laws to cover those other items.<br></div>
