            <div class='col-md body'>So how exactly screw up Singapore law is? I think the justice system is considered rather complete to MOST, if not almost all country in Asia... The only key to be successful is not going around doing all the stupid things friend... I tell you the key is only thru the hearts of Singaporean... I am very sure Chee had been given enough oppotunities to show himself AS A CREDIBLE MANGER of the country... but rather he choose the deviation to express his view... Maybe it is true that Singapore is not as fair is certain system... but Singaproeans are not stupid either... Look at aljunid gaining a 46% is not a act of foolishness but maturity... So how much did the SDP got? less than 20%? Don't you see what does it show? We are tired of Chee's Clownish immature act and we don't think he fit to be in the office.  We are not seeking another revolution for freedom.... We are seeking for a better life. Which of coz a revolution would destroy our life pretty much.</div>

As I've said, without the rule of the law, a society can never have a functioning liberal democracy. One of the major disappoint for me in the last elections was the lack of such ideals and conviction from both sides on such issues, everyone was simply trying to snipe at each other and orchestrate sound bites and make dramatic, chest thumping speeches, and of course, provide some tabloid fodder with a few circus side shows, the political process should be more than that in my opinion.

The three men were selling the SDP's The New Democrat in the run up to the elections in May.<br><br>The three are required to appear in Court No. 26 at the Subordinate Court on 20 June 2006 to enter their pleas.<br><br>This is another way the PAP prevents the opposition from directly and effectively communicating with the people. In so doing it denies the Singapore Democrats access to the people. This allows the PAP to continue its monopoly on what the public reads and hears, which in turn allows the ruling party to shape politics and the opposition according to its own agenda.<br><br>The SDP is determined to break the PAP's stranglehold on free speech and peaceful assembly in Singapore, and will continue to challenge unjust laws like the PEMA. If Singapore is going to enjoy democracy and if Singaporeans are going to have a meaningful say in how this country is run, unjust and unconstitutional laws like the PEMA must be abolished or amended.<br><br>The Singapore Democrats call on Singaporeans who seek justice and democracy to actively work with the SDP to rid this country of the one-party system and its ban on freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.<br><br>gan ni na bu phua chee bye<br></div></blockquote>Oh my god, this is atrocity and tyranny in action. As I've hate to imagine, we're living under a tyrant government under the guise of democracy. I applaud certain things PAP did to make this country progress, but such anti-competitive behaviors are showing that they cannot, and unable to accept competition from opposition parties. I do not like bullies and will never vote for PAP my lifetime. I've spoken to my friends and funny thing is, most of them (my generation) do not like PAP. I was curious so I asked them why. Because they are well educated and more net savvy and curious to read and find out more about the truths and expose the fallacies of this singapore government. Can't blame the older generation though because they tend to take in information from traditional newspaper/TV which is, if anyone already knows, controlled by the government. I hope to see the day when this country will be finally democratic, instead of just a fallacy.<br><br></div>

If the majority of the people think that the law on murder is wrong, and it's enacted to protect them, then it's a reasonable law because it do more good than harm. But if the government enact a law for mainly self interest, then it's not a reasonable law. If the government enact a law that requires people to pay for pang sai (shitting), then will you go obey the law? No, people will be unhappy. And it is precisely this that makes Singaporeans like me angry as the singapore government has done alot of things that the majority is against, and yet they proceed to do it. The media, because it's partly controlled by the government, tends to build up positive things to side with what the government wants the public to believe. Erm, the casino thing... opps, sorry i mean Integrated Resort, not casino...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Aiyah, I also dunno why I talk so much, if you want to eat pang sai but people say it's smelly and not nice to eat, you will still go and eat it anyway.</div>
