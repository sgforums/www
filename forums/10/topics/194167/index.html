            <div class='col-md body'>SDP activists charged for speaking in public without permit<br>5 Jun 06<br><br>Police have charged Dr Chee Soon Juan, Mr Gandhi Ambalam, and Mr Yap Keng Ho under the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act (PEMA).<br><br>Dr Chee and Mr Yap are charged with eight counts of Â“making an address in a public placeÂ” while Mr Ambalam is charged with one. The three men were selling the SDP's The New Democrat in the run up to the elections in May.<br><br>The three are required to appear in Court No. 26 at the Subordinate Court on 20 June 2006 to enter their pleas.<br><br>This is another way the PAP prevents the opposition from directly and effectively communicating with the people. In so doing it denies the Singapore Democrats access to the people. This allows the PAP to continue its monopoly on what the public reads and hears, which in turn allows the ruling party to shape politics and the opposition according to its own agenda.<br><br>The SDP is determined to break the PAP's stranglehold on free speech and peaceful assembly in Singapore, and will continue to challenge unjust laws like the PEMA. If Singapore is going to enjoy democracy and if Singaporeans are going to have a meaningful say in how this country is run, unjust and unconstitutional laws like the PEMA must be abolished or amended.<br><br>The Singapore Democrats call on Singaporeans who seek justice and democracy to actively work with the SDP to rid this country of the one-party system and its ban on freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.<br><br>gan ni na bu phua chee bye<br></div>

But only 66.6% of all eligible voters actually did. So following your reasoning, 1/3 of eligible voters do not possess ownership of the law - so how can it be a citizens' law when a substantial proportion doesn't accept it?<br><br>Also, PAP created and subsequently passes the law WITHOUT any permission from the citizens.<br><br>If a referendum had been passed and Singapore citizens voted for the passing of the law, I can still accept that it is a citizen's law.<br><br>But that didn't happen. So it's PAP's law, since they were the ones who created and passed it.<br><br>You say that TooFree is missing the point. Looks to me like you're the one missing the point.<br><br>Try looking in the mirror first before sliming others. Hope it doesn't crack.<br><br>I'm out of here.
