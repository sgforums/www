            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/discuss-singapore/message/17302<br><br>&gt; Closing submissions<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Before I had left for the US for my fellowship, I had informed the<br>&gt; courts on 31 January 2004 that I would be away from February until<br>&gt; August 2004 and to postpone all matters regarding the case until my<br>&gt; return.<br><br>Be real. Chee is saying he can just inform others his schedule and<br>expect others to work around it. He should have called a meeting to<br>settle the date for the case or get an agreement to postpone all<br>matters before he left for his fellowship.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Despite knowing this, the plaintiffs wrote to the court on 4 February<br>&gt; and asked for the hearing dates to be fixed. The courts obliged and<br>&gt; set 10 February for all parties to appear before it to take dates<br>&gt; even though it had received my letter indicating that I would be away.<br><br>What does Chee has to show that the plaintiffs had received the<br>information?<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Drew &amp; Napier, the law firm that represents Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr<br>&gt; Goh Chok Tong, claims that it had faxed me their letter of 4<br>&gt; February. I did not see the letter. If I had seen it I would have<br>&gt; been alerted to the session on 10 February. There are three important<br>&gt; things to note regarding this letter that was supposedly faxed to me:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - one, Drew &amp; Napier always send their correspondence to me via more<br>&gt; than one mode: by fax, by post, and by hand. In addition, whenever it<br>&gt; sent a document by hand or by post, the firm would have it delivered<br>&gt; to both my office and home. This one particular letter was only faxed<br>&gt; to my office.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - two, in the bundle of documents that the plaintiffs had compiled<br>&gt; for the hearing, the palintiffs' counsel curiously omitted to include<br>&gt; this letter when it is always very meticulous about presenting each<br>&gt; and every document.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - three, during my cross-examination Mr Davinder Singh showed me a<br>&gt; copy of the letter which had the date of transmission printed over<br>&gt; it. Mr Singh then quickly took back the letter and did not leave a<br>&gt; copy of it for me even though I had requested for one.<br><br>Those are good points. Chee would benefit if he discloses more<br>details about this part of the cross-examiniation.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; There are several questions that the plaintiffs and their counsel, Mr<br>&gt; Singh, should answer:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - one, why did Mr Lee and Mr Goh insist on asking the court to set<br>&gt; the dates for the hearing despite knowing that I was going to be away<br>&gt; and not be able to attend the session?<br><br>How will Chee prove that Goh and Lee knew of his schedule or that they<br>were sure Chee could not change his schedule?<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; - two, why was the 4-February letter only faxed to me (if it was in<br>&gt; fact faxed) when other letters were always also sent by post and/or<br>&gt; by hand to my office and home?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - three, how did he obtain the transmission information printed over<br>&gt; the letter? Would he be willing to allow me to verify the<br>&gt; authenticity of the transmission information?<br><br>It means the copy shown is a fax confirmation page with the letter as<br>content.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; I had applied to cross-examine the plaintiffs so that I could settle<br>&gt; these issues because it runs into the question of whether they had<br>&gt; deliberately schemed to get me to miss the session of 10 February<br>&gt; when the dates for the hearing were fixed. It was also an issue that<br>&gt; the plaintiffs had canvassed during the hearing. But the judge<br>&gt; refused to allow me to call Mr Lee, Mr Goh and Mr Singh to the stand.<br><br>Chee should have cross-examine the staff who handle the fax and<br>arrange for the Feb 4th meeting. Those are the key persons to start with.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; The plaintiffs' counsel also made an issue of the fact that I had not<br>&gt; mentioned my visiting Taiwan on my way to the US and my trip to Hong<br>&gt; Kong in August 2004 in my affidavit. The truth of the matter is that<br>&gt; my stopover in Taiwan on my way to the US was to give my children a<br>&gt; break in the long journey and for them and my wife to see my in-laws.<br><br>This is more a trip to meet the in-laws.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; My trip to Hong Kong was an ARDA mission to assess the political<br>&gt; situation in the Chinese city. In other words, I was on official<br>&gt; business for the organization. Because of this ARDA would pay, as it<br>&gt; does for all of its volunteers, expenses for the trip. But having to<br>&gt; come back to Singapore from the US to attend a hearing and then to<br>&gt; return would have meant that I would have to pay the expenses myself<br>&gt; which I cannot afford.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Besides, what do my stopover in Taiwan in February and my visit to<br>&gt; Hong Kong on 2-3 August have anything to do with 6 September Â– the<br>&gt; date of the hearing which I have asked to be postponed. Mr Singh was<br>&gt; scraping the bottom of the barrel and coming up with facts that were<br>&gt; wholly unrelated to the issue at hand. This was done purely for the<br>&gt; benefit of the local media which lapped everything up to present<br>&gt; as "facts" to the public.<br><br>It is a matter of whether Chee really did not have time to prepare and<br>attend the court session or he was using other events as excuse.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; After Taiwan I arrived in the US on 19 February, ahead on my<br>&gt; fellowship on 1 March. The reason is that I had to look for housing,<br>&gt; school for my eldest daughter, and so on. Mr Singh said that I had<br>&gt; left early and gave the impression that my fellowship started in<br>&gt; February 2004. Again he was saying this for the reporters present<br>&gt; because he knew full well that when one is going away for several<br>&gt; months and with young children, one would need to leave early to take<br>&gt; care of the logistical arrangements I mentioned.<br><br>Who pay for Chee's family members airfare to US and Taiwan, his<br>daughter's school fee, and his wife medical/delivery expenses if Chee<br>could not afford to fly back to Singapore as he claimed. What is the<br>total amount?<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Following the completion of my fellowship, I stayed on in the US<br>&gt; because I had to complete some of the fellowship-related assignments<br>&gt; I had taken up while there as well as to obtain birth and travel<br>&gt; documents for our newborn which took several weeks to do. Despite<br>&gt; this, Mr Singh continued with his lies that I had deliberately stayed<br>&gt; in the US for a holiday to avoid the hearing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I left the US and arrived in Taiwan on 31 August. I had to attend an<br>&gt; ARDA meeting on 9 September. The meeting was fixed before I came to<br>&gt; learn of the hearing dates fixed for 6-8 September.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It was not possible for me to return to Singapore for the hearing<br>&gt; because it would mean that I would miss the ARDA meeting which<br>&gt; involved members from several other countries coming to Taipei.<br>&gt; Besides, I could not leave my three children with my wife and her<br>&gt; parents as my in-laws were not in the best of health.<br><br>They could have returned to Singapore early or chose not leave Spore<br>in the first place.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Based on the following facts:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - that I had asked the courts to hold off all proceedings until after<br>&gt; my return from my fellowship,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - that the plaintiffs and the courts had arranged for a time to set<br>&gt; the hearing dates in my absence after I had informed them that I was<br>&gt; going to be away,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - that the ARDA meeting on 9 September was fixed before I eventually<br>&gt; came to learn of the hearing dates,<br><br>Why Chee leave out details of when he knew of the Sept hearing dates<br>and when he started fixing the ARDA meeting dates? Why he did not<br>check his mails?<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; is it unreasonable for me to ask the courts to postpone the hearing?<br>&gt; After all I was asking for just a few weeks, not months.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How would the postponement of the hearing by a few weeks prejudice<br>&gt; the plaintiffs' case? If the courts had granted my request, the<br>&gt; hearing could have taken place and be disposed of in early October<br>&gt; 2004 at the very latest.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would then be able to cross-examine the very two people who have<br>&gt; accused me of defaming them and wanting close to one million dollars<br>&gt; in damages. I have already been denied of an open trial in the case<br>&gt; and for there to be some semblance of justice, I should be able to<br>&gt; participate in the hearing for assessment of damages.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Without the benefit of the above closing arguments, however, the<br>&gt; judge went ahead and dismissed Dr Chee's application to have the<br>&gt; hearing reconvened. He said that he did not hear any good<br>&gt; explanations from the SDP secretary-general. How could he when he<br>&gt; denied Dr Chee the right to have time to prepare the material?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now compare how the Straits Times reported the matter. At the end of<br>&gt; the report, Ms Chia wrote: "Dr Chee did not respond when given the<br>&gt; opportunity to do so, after which Justice Kan gave his ruling." This<br>&gt; is a lie. Dr Chee repeatedly stood up and challenged the judge on his<br>&gt; decision to not allow Dr Chee to prepare and present his submissions.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; High Court dismisses Chee's application<br>&gt; Straits Times<br>&gt; Sue-Ann Chia<br>&gt; 6 November 2004<br>&gt;<br>&gt;</div>
