I turned around and I saw a man looking at me.<br><br>'We struggled and this time I was hit on the head with a metal bar. Then I realised there was not one but two men attacking me.'<br><br>He described how the two of them took out a folding knife and started slashing his back and even put the knife to his neck.<br><br>He then realised his life was at risk.<br><br>'They asked me if I wanted to live or die?<br><br>'They said if I wanted to live I'd better hand over all my belongings,' he said while adding that he believes one of them was a foreigner.<br><br>'Although I gave them my money, they were not satisfied. So they snatched my bag, passport and my identity card and fled.'<br><br>In addition, Mr Din also lost two handphones worth $500 and $320 in cash.<br><br>STARTED BLEEDING<br><br>He tried to chase the duo but his injuries were starting to hurt badly.<br><br>There was a lot of blood flowing down his back and his head.<br><br>He tried to seek help from passers-by but they paid no attention to him.<br><br>But one man stopped to help.<br><br>'Luckily there was one person who took me to a nearby police station so that I could make a police report,' he added.<br><br>He was then taken to the Sultanah Aminah hospital for treatment.<br><br>The Malaysian police later informed his wife who rushed over to bring him back home.<br><br></div>

I recall it was drilled into kids' heads back in primary school to avoid pathways that seem too quiet and deserted or too dark, more so for women. It's not often mentioned in Singapore, but the general advice to women abroad is to avoid dark areas and at night, if they need help, call for the police for some kind of escort.<br><br>I suppose in Singapore people have gotten too comfortable and too assuming with everything around them.</div>
