              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p><strong>The near-complete dependency on outsiders for all its necessities like oil, water, foods - and even manpower - weighs heavily on Singapore's national psyche.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AFTER water, Singapore is now turning its attention to energy and food as part of its search for a stable, secured supply of natural resources.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Since independence, this small island, which depends on the world for natural resources, had been embarking on this quest, but the recent population expansion has made it more urgent.</p>
              <p>No one here expects it to be able to become ever really self-sufficient no matter what it does.</p>
              <p>It is, however, trying to do the next best thing, reducing the level of dependence on market uncertainties in supply and prices.</p>
              <p>Recently, the government highlighted some of its efforts, including the following:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&gt; Energy: Singapore has taken the first step towards joining the nuclear energy era.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The government will study whether it should generate nuclear power to lessen dependency on imported oil and coal.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&gt; Water: The fifth and largest water recycling plant was opened on Monday that will help meet 40% (up from 30%) of Singapore's water needs.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By 2061, the country will be fully self-sufficient, thanks to recycled water.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&gt; Food: A special Food Fund has been established to help local entrepreneurs to start high-tech fishing and farming to enhance production of chicken, pork, fish, eggs, leafy vegetables and rice.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Since 1965, its near-complete dependency on outsiders for its necessities like oil, water, food - and even manpower - has weighed heavily on Singapore's national psyche.</p>
              <p>Among some Singaporeans, it has generated a sense of vulnerability.</p>
              <p>“People worry when times are bad, and even when they are good they worry in case things go bad,” a columnist once wrote.</p>
              <p>This is believed to be a major reason for Singaporean families migrating to larger, resource-rich countries like Australia.</p>
              <p>During crises, some Singaporeans talk of re-merger with Malaysia.</p>
              <p>“We worry about the kind of future their children can have on this island without natural resources,” a Singapore doctor, who migrated to Sydney with his family, once told me.</p>
              <p>He was rich and successful and his children hailed from elite schools, but these had failed to retain him.</p>
              <p>“I want a more stable future for my children,” he said.</p>
              <p>That this is a small country with few ground resources was a reason Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew once gave for his government's huge accumulation of savings instead of using it on the poor.</p>
              <p>Foreign reserves were needed by Singapore more than resource-rich neighbours to make up for lack of natural assets that could be a useful cushion during a global crisis.</p>
              <p>In this sense Lee was right.</p>
              <p>Singapore is money rich but asset poor. The former was being pursued relentlessly so that it can pay for the resources that it needs.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And oil and raw materials, as well as food, are getting more expensive by the decade.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Globally ranked the world's 20th wealthiest country in terms of GDP (nominal) per capita, Singapore has the world's ninth largest foreign reserves, reported at S$275bil.</p>
              <p>The trouble is that money is not always a solution in times of global resources crisis.</p>
              <p>In 1974, the price of oil shot up four times as exporting Middle East countries put an embargo on their sales.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More recently, oil prices rose sharply and remained at a high level.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The trouble is that the supplies of oil, water, food and commodities are interrupted by scarcity, price adjustments or political conflicts.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of the measures to reduce Singapore's vulnerability, the most ambitious and controversial is the proposed study on nuclear energy.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once considered impossible for a small, over-crowded city to build a nuclear reactor, the idea is now being studied.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Some analysts believe that given the top-down politics here, it is as good as a done deal.</p>
              <p>In the past, regional sensitivities had posed an insurmountable obstacle.</p>
              <p>Any accident could have a disastrous impact not only for Singaporeans but also for people living nearby.</p>
              <p>This is no longer so because five of the 10 Asean countries - including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand - have decided to build nuclear power plants.</p>
              <p>Such plants are proliferating in Asia.</p>
              <p>Of the world's total reactors under construction, 70% are in Asia. China wants 30 more and India another 31 by 2020.</p>
              <p>A multi-agency study will begin later this year to decide on its long-term feasibility for Singa-pore.</p>
              <p>The republic has not hesitated to invest some of its money to buy into companies that produce or refine raw materials, commodities or agricultural products, but not in any substantial amounts.</p>
              <p>How do Singaporeans feel?</p>
              <p>For hard-headed economists, not going nuclear is not a choice, especially with supply future so uncertain and as Singapore's population expands further.</p>
              <p>“It is very simple.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Oil and gas will run out soon, and supplies may quickly become expensive and inconsistent,” wrote JFD.</span></strong></p>
              <p>“Basically, there is no choice.”</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Another supporter, Winners, said he was all for nuclear power.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“At least we don't have to be held ransom by the Middle East suppliers with their ever-higher oil prices.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>But these are minority voices.</p>
              <p>The government faces the prospect of a tough time if they have to sell the plan to its people, judging by the strong reaction so far.</p>
              <p>One writer commented, “It is good to study all options, but it is another when it comes to implementation. You can lose heavily.”</p>
              <p>To run such a dangerous reaction, Singapore doesn't need efficiency, it needs perfection, one Singaporean said, adding,</p>
              <p>“And don't forget there are many terrorists running around looking for a place to bomb.”</p>
              <p>One critic simply said: “Right in the midst of five million people?</p>
              <p>“No, it is crazy!”</p>

              <p>Oil and gas is not a single country like singapore problem, it is the world problem, and the world alway have problem, so to speak. On the other hand, building nuclear reactor is not a problem, it takes the same nos of year as building IR resorts to complete, but if the world is to go into nuclear reactors to supply its energy, just Singapore as an example...what will happen to it economy. The whole of Jurong island become useless, the oil refinery in bukom become empty and certainly, the way of doing business, stock and market is going to change, because oil will not be going to be the bench mark to influence prices, and certainly, many investors including temasek is going to lost billions again. There will be a whole paradigm shift in the way we work, live and earn our living. Middle East will go back to Aladdin times.</p>
              <p>Just imagine, the building of gas pipe lines from indonesia, the city spring gas business, the forefront of  petrolchemical and oil energy industries including engine markers, powerstation will come to a standstill if Nuclear reactor is to take over, it will be a total diseaster for those who invested heavily on such industries, and our govt will suffer leading to putting the loss on we, the citizens. Therefore, it is not a problem in building nuclear reactors, it can be done, but the impact on the losses in the economy is going to hurt badly. And Uranium producing countries such as russia will become the new Arabs of the world</p>
