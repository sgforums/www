              <p>Paving the way for our current Finance Minister?</p>
              <p>From Channelnewsasia</p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Fresh from the historic win of US President-elect
              Barrack Obama, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said it's
              possible for the country to have a minority race Prime Minister. But,
              in his first public comment on the subject, Mr Lee said he does not
              think it will happen anytime soon.
              <br> <br>Speaking at a dialogue session with grassroots leaders from the
              Malay community on Saturday, Mr Lee also touched on the implications of
              protectionist policies for the local workforce, amidst the current
              downturn.
              <br> <br>It was a historic day when Barrack Obama became the first elected
              African-American US President. But Mr Lee pointed out that Obama's
              victory does not mean race is no longer an issue in the US.
              <br> <br>He noted poll results showed Republican John McCain secured most of
              the white votes while Obama scored with the Latin, Asian and
              African-American electorate.
              <br> <br> And in Singapore, he believes the reality is that race-based voting patterns will remain.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "Can we one day have a non-Chinese, a Malay-Muslim
              Prime Minister? It's possible. Will it happen soon? I don't think so
              because finally you have to win votes and these sentiments. Who votes
              for whom and what makes him identify with that person? These are
              sentiments that do not disappear completely for a long time, even if
              people did not talk about it or even if people wish they did not feel
              it."
              <br> <br>Mr Lee added that although the situation today is very different
              from 20 to 30 years ago, no country in the world is totally race or
              religion-blind.
              <br> <br>PM Lee continued: "The population's attitudes have shifted because
              English is more of a common ground, because the new generation is
              better educated and I think they can see that there are successful
              people of all races. <br> <br> “But to become a position where everybody is totally race-blind and
              religion-blind, I think that's very difficult. You will not find it in
              any country in the world.”
              <br> <br> 34-year-old Member of Parliament Zaqy Mohamad was more optimistic.
              <br> <br>He said: "I agree with PM that a candidate for prime minister has
              to be based on ability and acceptance by the majority of Singaporeans.
              I think today with the younger generation who've gone through
              post-independence Singapore, I think they are a lot more accepting and
              race-blind. <br> <br> “In my lifetime, I'm not sure I will see one, but I think if someone
              comes forth with the right ability and proven track record, it could be
              a reality."
              <br> <br> Foreign workers was another hot topic. 
              <br> <br> Participants were concerned that they are taking up precious jobs from locals amidst the current downturn. 
              <br> <br>However, Mr Lee said that foreign workers took the brunt of job
              lay-offs in the last recession between 2001 and 2003 and if it wasn't
              for them, the unemployment rate among Singaporeans would have been much
              higher.
              <br> <br>He said: "If we just send away the foreign workers now, it will do
              us harm. For example - companies which are already in difficulty and
              they hire half foreign workers and half Singaporeans and you tell them
              that foreign workers must go out. And when you take Singaporeans, his
              cost will go up and the company may close. And if the company closes,
              even the half who have jobs may lose their jobs.
              <br> <br>“So I don't think it's that simple. You send out the foreign
              workers and the Singaporeans will take over the jobs and you get paid
              more. I think our interest is to protect the Singaporeans and look
              after the Singaporeans but we must do it intelligently, we cannot just
              react and do something without thinking."
              <br> <br>Mr Lee also advised workers to hold on to regular jobs which
              contribute to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) for better long term
              financial protection.
              <br> <br>He cautions that even though contract or odd jobs may enable
              workers to take home more pay, it's much riskier given the current
              uncertain job market. - CNA/vm

              <p>I agree with Whiskers. Should the question of one's race even surface? On Friday's New Paper,  Dhanabalan would have been considered for the post of PM if not for his Indian ethnicity. Apparently, at that time, 'Singapore is not yet ready for an Indian PM' [from the article].</p>
              <p>We are supposed to be a society based on meritocracy. Provided the person is capable enough for the job, his ethnicity shouldn't be a factor... should it?</p>
              <p>Why the questions about whether or not it is possible to have someone from an ethnic minority to become PM?</p>
              <p>It begets a lot more questions...</p>

              <p>don't think so, highly unlikely, especially if you're talking about a "democratic" nation, only way a non chinese can become a pm right now is for singapore to be a ditatorship based on meritocracy. especially in our region where there're so many racial problems, how many would actually vote in a minority pm?</p>
              <p>i can't see myself voting for any of them at the moment, really need one of those with a halo before i'm convinced of voting for them</p>

              <p>Did PM LHL check his facts before shooting his reply ?</p>
              <p>According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html">CIA Factbook 2008.  </a>- the July 2008 US Population estimate was 303,824,640; while the ethnic breakdown {as of July 2007 estimate} was <em>White 79.96%, Black 12.85%, Asian 4.43%, Amerindian and Alaskan native 0.97%, native Hawaiian and other Pacific islander 0.18%, two or more miscellaneious races 1.61%</em>.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://redbluerichpoor.com/blog/?p=206">By ethnicity: Barack Obama won 96% of African Americans, 68% of Latinos, 64% of Asians, and 44% of whites. In 2004, Kerry won 89% of African Americans, 55% of Latinos, 56% of Asians, and 41% of whites. So Obama gained the most among ethnic minorities.  </a></p>
              <p>In the US Census, it remains a fact that Latinos can be counted as Whites, or counted separately from the Whites who are then indicated as non-Latino Whites.</p>
              <p>With the African-Americans forming 12.85% of the US Population, even with 96% of the Votes from the African-Americans could not bring Obama into the White House.</p>
              <p>It is purely distracting to claim that the Whites voted mainly with McCain, when the majority of the various ethnic groups had voted for Obama - across the ethnic divide - with even various ethnic groups including Whites from the Republicans giving their votes to Obama.</p>
              <p>In this US General Election on 4 November 2008, race or ethnicity was <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong></em> an issue - as it was Economics was the main cause for the US Electorate giving their votes to elect Obama as the 44th President of the USA. </p>

              <p>PM Lee continued: "The population's attitudes have shifted because English is more of a common ground, because the new generation is better educated and I think they can see that there are successful people of all races.<br><br>“But to become a position where everybody is totally race-blind and religion-blind, I think that's very difficult.

              <p>It is unfortunate that while PM LHL can see that the "population's attitudes have shifted because English is more of a common ground, because the new generation is better educated and I think they can see that there are successful people of all races" - the boorish attitude towards Race and Ethnicity remains a central theme of his Government.</p>
              <p>This can be seen in the HDB policy of restricting the number of minority ethnic group in staying in each block. The minority ethnic group can re-sell their HDB home only to another minority ethic person.</p>
              <p>Such manipulation with various Government guidelines, rules, and regulations had continue to allow the SG Ruling Party some certainty in not allowing any concentrations of minority group from working in concert to apply political pressures.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><br>34-year-old Member of Parliament Zaqy Mohamad was more optimistic.<br><br>He said: "I agree with PM that a candidate for prime minister has to be based on ability and acceptance by the majority of Singaporeans. I think today with the younger generation who've gone through post-independence Singapore, I think they are a lot more accepting and race-blind.<br><br>“In my lifetime, I'm not sure I will see one, but I think if someone comes forth with the right ability and proven track record, it could be a reality."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> MP Zaqy had to be diplomatic with his views even as he contradict the statement made by his PM LHL - and seems to tow the Party line concerning <em>"someone comes forth with the right ability and proven track record".</em></p>
              <p>If the US Citizens had waited for someone with any proven track record, Obama would not even have seen any Nomination Forms.</p>

              <p><br>Foreign workers was another hot topic.<br><br>Participants were concerned that they are taking up precious jobs from locals amidst the current downturn.<br><br>However, Mr Lee said that foreign workers took the brunt of job lay-offs in the last recession between 2001 and 2003 and if it wasn't for them, the unemployment rate among Singaporeans would have been much higher.<br><br>He said: "If we just send away the foreign workers now, it will do us harm. For example - companies which are already in difficulty and they hire half foreign workers and half Singaporeans and you tell them that foreign workers must go out. And when you take Singaporeans, his cost will go up and the company may close. And if the company closes, even the half who have jobs may lose their jobs.<br><br>“So I don't think it's that simple. You send out the foreign workers and the Singaporeans will take over the jobs and you get paid more. I think our interest is to protect the Singaporeans and look after the Singaporeans but we must do it intelligently, we cannot just react and do something without thinking."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is silly logic that circumvent the entire problem.</p>
              <p>With the SG economy still dependent on industries that need cheap labor, it is not surprising that more foreign workers are multiplying their presence in SG; with the controlled wages that even the SG workers will find it insufficient to raise more kids that this SG Government has been encouraging.</p>
              <p>In his usual fashion of blowing smoke - he had to make the last paragraph above, it is clear that LHL will pretend to be intelligent by seemingly show you the way forward, but he will take the first exit out and let you continue towards the edge - as he has no clue even how to waddle his way forward despite all the well propagated talents.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><br>Mr Lee also advised workers to hold on to regular jobs which contribute to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) for better long term financial protection.<br><br>He cautions that even though contract or odd jobs may enable workers to take home more pay, it's much riskier given the current uncertain job market. - CNA/vm</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> Are there any regular jobs to be hold on to when it was PM LHL's administration that promoted and insisted that employers must be helped by all SG Workers accepting his Government sponsored idea that there is no "Iron Rice Bowl"; and it will be most advantageous for all sides that SG Workers are employed on short-term contracts ?</p>

              <p> <br>Since that time, we had seen with our own eyes how right Deng was. We are all but humans, no matter what ethnic group we belong. We can screw up big time, but at the same time, we can uplift lives.</p>

              <p>Our forefathers had freed this ethnic group from having to bow or scrape before 'above the law' tyrants, monarchs, minor petty kings and their offsprings, for our malays and succeeding generations are now equal before anyone one of them.
