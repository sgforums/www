              <p>after playing the race cards for so long, i kinda feel if a minority race was choosen for pm by the pap and assuming the polls aren't rigged, things could turn out badly for them. they've always played it up that certain minority races cannot be trusted with sensitive positions. most of the people i know in my circle are actually quite biased against minority races, sometimes due to stereotyping other times through negative experiences.</p>

              <p>i think singaporeans are generally not socially mature enuf yet. but singapore is a young nation. so, i agree in many ways that she has some ways to go.</p>
              <p>however, think of it, when lhl so-called `retires', who in his chinese clans has what is takes to be pm?</p>
              <p>maybe wong kang seng.</p>

              <p><br>maybe Tan Kin Lian and Chee Soon Juan are only actors for PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The multi racial society gives PAP an upper hand to rule, i do applaud LKY brainchild, very smart. In most country, Diversity of race is the most difficult situation to rule but our LKY took full of advantage of it. He make it in a way that you are one people, one singapore, one nation, but not one group. A fragmentation society create individualism, so he instilled kiasee, kiasu and race protectism to separate people from getting/organise together to uprise against the ruling party. Unlike Japan, taiwan or korea, the population are homogenous, one kind of race, so when they uprise, the ruling govt will be gone for sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his speech, he always said that is not easy to govt a multi cultural and racial society, but in fact, it is to his advantage. If Chinses uprise, he support malays, if Indian uprise, he support chinese and malay, if malays uprise, he support chinese and indian, the is the game he played. Therefore you hardly see we singaporeans get together in a full force.</p>

              <p>I thought so too.  Liberalization of economic policies... but the principle applies too.  </p>
              <p>To refine it a bit, its a matter of meritocracy.  However, Singaporeans do not directly elect the Prime Minister, so I'm not sure what LHL was talking about.</p>
              <p>As long as the party wins, the Party generally decides who will be the PM.  If the party doesn't see the minority race candidate as suitable, they won't nominate.  In Singapore's system, the President can veto the party's nominee for PM or even fire him IIRC, but he cannot directly nominate the PM.</p>
