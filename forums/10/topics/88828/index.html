            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever happened to humanity?<br><br>Whatever happened to sanity?<br><br>Where did all the complexities of life disappear?<br><br>Much has happened lately.<br><br>When did we derive the word "Determination" into our lives? Did we take our lives for granted in metropolis Singapore? Are we in safe and reliable hands of our leaders (the present and the future)? Are we able to adapt to any power reshuffle? 39 years have passed since our shores received independence into her own small hands.<br><br>Here we see the anachronism of her history being reignited upon as National Education (NE)? How important is NE to us, the citizens of Singapore, despite having more than a million of us not knowing how frequently Eid Ul Fitri occurs in a year or how long the 7th Month Festival lasts? Are we doing our job to keep up with the government's stand on religious differences? Will our actions spark flames of racism? We are not human beings on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a human journey.<br><br>Can the shift of power be accepted easily as time goes by? Are we really ready to handle different types of situations posed by the "new" government per se? I swore never to be silent whenever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. That should the directive to be taken under the new leadership. Essentially pragmatic in its blight outlook, the People's Action Party (PAP) is unhampered by ideological dogma. Rooted in reality, it shows itself to be exceptionally versatile in devising unconventional but practical policies to fulfil the changing needs of the country. With rationalism as its guiding principle, the PAP has succeeded in turning Singapore from a Third World country with no natural resources into a competitive leading nation in the global scene with its adoption of technological innovation and biological and chemical diversification. Cohesive within itself and honest in its workings, the PAP has proven its leadership capable, highly efficient, and productive, one able to secure high economic growth and stability for the nation.<br><br>And why the existence, of politically-oppressed opposition parties despite knowing they can never retrieve the mandate enjoyed mostlye by the superior leading party in Parliament. Many may digress but these parties are there to make a difference in people's lives albeit a small difference.<br><br>Contentment, Ladies and Gentlement, i bring you to the shores of Singapore and beyond.

Are we really ready to handle different types of situations posed by the "new" government per se? I swore never to be silent whenever human beings endure suffering and humiliation.

There is a need to change the political process and landscape. Leaders should serve as servants of the people with duties to perform and not as lords. Perhaps, it is a challenge to reconcile divided people - pro-PAP and anti-PAP. New policies and changes should be endeavored to make life worthwhile living for all.  Guidance to all should be the key. That is the job of leaders to correct people if some of them are wrong. But there should be no cause for big concern. After all, we always draw a line. For example the fact that there are some terrorists extremists among the muslims does not mean that the rest are the same. My personal views only. Regards.</div>
