              <p><strong>Forbes.com, 27 Jun 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>ANALYSIS-Singapore seeks to manage political change</strong></span><br> <br> Resourceful, but resource-scarce, Singapore has nimbly changed with the times in its first 50 years of self-governance.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>But the global economic slowdown has thrown
              the trade-dependent city-state into its worst recession and issues from
              unemployment to huge losses at two sovereign wealth funds have set
              fresh challenges for the People's Action Party (PAP), which marked a
              half-century in power this month.</strong></span><br> <br> Analysts say future risks include political change after the current generation of ageing leaders, <span style="color: red;"><strong>possibly even from a split in the ruling party, </strong></span>and external threats such as conflict with neighbours and competition from cheaper manufacturing centres.<br> <br> "<span style="color: red;"><strong>It won't be as stable and as unchangeable as people think,</strong></span>"
              said Roman Scott, who runs a private equity firm in Singapore. He is
              bullish on the country's long-term prospects, but said terror attacks
              or political changes were the biggest risks.<br> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even in Singapore, nothing lasts forever."</span></strong><br> <br> Singapore is favoured as a base for its dependability, efficient
              bureaucracy and clean environment. Few investors expect shocks in a
              region where stability can quickly turn to chaos.<br> <br> "I looked at all the cities in the world and decided to move to
              Singapore," said American investor Jim Rogers, who co-founded the
              Quantum Fund with George Soros in 1970. Rogers is bearish on the U.S.
              dollar and pound but expects the Singapore dollar to stay strong
              because of political and economic competence.<br> <br> <strong>SUCCESSION</strong><br> <br> Singapore's stability rests on the vision of Cambridge-trained Lee Kuan
              Yew, who came to power in June 1959 after leading the PAP to its first
              general election victory. The party has never lost more than four seats
              in any poll since.<br> <br> The government recently offered to nominate more opposition members to
              parliament, a move analysts said could be a release valve for criticism
              but may also stimulate some fresh ideas.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>"It needs to accept a level of accountability and debate that it currently will not do," </strong></span>said Bob Broadfoot of Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy.<br> <br> The government has been looking for younger stars, and cadres have started speaking about Singapore after Lee Kuan Yew.<br> <br> Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's former United Nations envoy, saw a
              two-thirds probability Singapore would make a "smooth and seamless
              transition" after the retirement of octogenarian Lee.<br> <br> This was due to a "deep institutionalisation" of the values of
              Singapore's first generation of leaders, though corruption would have
              to be kept at bay, he told a recent seminar. Singapore is rated the
              least corrupt country in the region.<br> <br> "We don't see any dramatic or unstable political change in Singapore in
              the coming 10 years," said Vincent Ho of Fitch Ratings, which gives
              Singapore its top sovereign rating of AAA.<br> <br> Pierre Cailleteau, managing director for sovereign risk at Moody's (
              MCO - news - people ) Investor Service, said its AAA rating for
              Singapore hinged on strong financial fundamentals, a pro-business
              stance and the ability to adapt to changing economic conditions.<br> <br> "We don't look at the rulers of a country, but the way the country is
              ruled. For Singapore, we don't see reasons to believe there will be any
              change in the degree of predictability if there is a change in
              leadership," he said.<br> <br> Even if future Singapore leaders became more vulnerable to public
              pressure and engaged in populist policies at the expense of economic
              goals, the shift would take place over a period of years rather than
              months, he added.<br> <br> <strong>DIVERSIFICATION</strong><br> <br> As it faces up to the global downturn, the government has just set up
              an "Economic Strategies Committee" comprising ministers and business
              leaders, to fine-tune plans for growth, as it aims to stay a hub for
              multinationals and trading.<br> <br> Singapore has already been looking to wean itself off manufacturing by
              developing service industries such as wealth management and tourism,
              with two casino resorts due by next year.<br> <br> It also hired ex-BHP Billiton ( BBL - news - people ) CEO Chip Goodyear
              to run state investor Temasek, replacing the prime minister's wife Ho
              Ching. Goodyear is expected to look at investments in the resource
              sector, after the fund was burned by high profile investments in
              Western banks in the past year that created discontent among
              Singaporeans worried about the state's savings.<br> <br> Analysts say the country will continue to diversify into high value
              sectors such as nanotechnology, biomedical research, and renewable
              energy. But it is expected to remain dependent on overseas demand given
              its small 4.6 million population.<br> <br> Among Lee Kuan Yew's favourite topics is urging Singaporeans to have
              more babies. But this has not had much success, leaving the state
              looking to foreign labourers from China and other Asian countries, plus
              Western professionals, risking future social tensions as the population
              mix changes.<br> <br> Singapore saw deadly race riots in the 1950s and 1960s.<br> <br> Analysts say Singapore will have to be more politically open and
              culturally tolerant to attract rich migrants and to prevent a brain
              drain of young local talent.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>"If you want to be a world city,
              you have to take on some of the characteristics of New York and London,
              a lot more diversity, a lot more tolerance, and a lot more openness,"</strong></span> Scott said.

              <p>I quote from Atobe "To overcome any possibility of the "freak results" that MM LKY had said of Singaporeans decision to vote in an Alternative Political Party - the PAP had opened the flood gates to new immigrants who will at least vote PAP in the next one or two elections - simply out of gratitude from the change of circumstances in their lives."</p>
              <p>I agree with Atobe on this. Contrary to what many people believe, PAP has long anticipated the day where citizen no longer be swayed by its idealism.</p>
              <p>Kishore Mahbubani, in the article written to The Straits Times ''Can Singapore Fail?" said and I quote him.</p>
              <p>"Ïn 1981, Singapore's long-ruling PAP suffered its first defeat at the polls in many years, even though the contest was in a single constituency. I asked Dr Goh K S, one of Singapore's three great founding fathers and the architect of Singapore's economic miracle, why the PAP lost. He replied, "Kishore, we failed because we did not even conceive of the possibility of failure'. </p>
              <p>.......And as Dr Goh perceived. the only way to prevent failure is to conceive of failure." <br><br>PAP has long anticipated the day where the citizen no long associates PAP with the "wow" factor.<br><br>Contrary to what some people think and with the influx of foreigners who are grateful to PAP for lifting their status, from a third world citizen to a first's, their newly  bestowed voting power will ensure the next election to remain status quo.</p>

              <p>If u read the article carefully, there seemed to have mentioned about the brain drain.

              <p><br>Brain drain is not a factor in this new liberalisation world, at any one point, you can consult or seek advice from a good economist or professor by paying him. Same as to you seeking a treatment with a foreign base hospital that is specialist in it, you dun have to bring the whole hosipital or the doctors here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, our economy or what we are today is also a blessing of foreign expert advises, if you depend on our Ministers, who are good only in gathering votes with dines and wines, i dun think we are what we are today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The very fact of seeking advices from smart people outside of here give you a better picture of out of the box thinking whereby these peoples have no self interest nor selfish thinking or so called inward thinking thereby jeopardise the blue print for the future</p>

              <p>Athens was only a small city state and yet, its civlising influence still continues to weave into every nation that aspires towards greatness. Singapore is no different.</p>
              <p><br>Young singaporeans who had been nurtured here will always seek greener pastures, with absolute disregard to the fact that our society had nutured them, forgetting often that without the collective efforts of other citizens, past and present to provide social spending in all areas, such opportunities to even contemplate abandoning the country may not be present.</p>
              <p><br>The young of Africa, Philipines, Loas, Vietnam, etc are similiar in perceptions, but unfortunately, only the rich are capable of doing so, while the rest whom professed to have Uni degrees, are neither welcomed nor accepted or even recognised for employment in many other countries of the world.</p>
              <p><br>Only countries such as Singapore is an exception, an anomaly, where even children of taxi drivers can aspire and easily move to any other country, accepted for employment and sink their roots. Thanks to our forefathers who had invested and made that committment for better education and opportunities.</p>
              <p><br>And being children, kids and immature youths, it is only natural for them to seek seemingly greener pastures, much influenced by western culture freely in our open society, unlike our neighbours whom use various means to curtail such culture and openess, such as western movies dubbed in local lingo, to outright ban.</p>
              <p><br>Another reason for the brain drain is the peasant mentality that we were born with. Attaining wealth and a good life is rapaciously hungered for, more so by those whom are educated and mobile. Social responsibility and idealism is treated with contempt, as a dirty word and a joke.</p>
              <p><br>But what is sad is when these quitters attempt to justify their abandonment to policies laid by the government, whom were freely elected by the majority of our society, trying to make themselves seemed as noble freedom fighters, and attempt to poke their noses and join in the ignorant disgruntled to stow further discord and hate within our society over issues such as NS, CPF, foreign workers, making use of those who cannot or unable to leave the country due to family or financial reasons.</p>
              <p><br>Sadder still when the disgruntled believes half truths and allow the hatred to grow. Those overseas who sow such hatred are untouchable and can freely continue to live with glee, but those afflicted by their brand of discord will only suffer needlessly, by going against society rather than working with it.</p>
              <p><br>No governance system is perfect. It takes time to evolve. Even Plato's Republic did not successfully materialised, or even existed in its pratical form in Athens. But its ideals were long aspired to till today. And Singapore is only still a young nation, even though envied by older societies for our peace and multi-culturalism.</p>
              <p><br>Please do not presume that I tarnish the entire flock of quitters. No, I only criticise those insidious ones. Those who quit the country peacefully to pursue their aims, I fully understand, and bear them no grudge.</p>
              <p>We are a free society, and no sense in holding anyone back if they prefer a better life elsewhere. Those who remain will have to do the best they can and rebuild, work harder, and assume our birthright that our forefathers had worked hard for us.</p>
              <p><br>Foreigners who wish to become our citizens will be welcomed. But do know this fact:-<br>1. They are educated and would not be easily duped. To assume that they will vote out of gratitude is..(laughable). They left their own society, so much for gratitude.<br>2. Many left their homeland due to their national political idealogies, which they know failed them, and had willingly adopted and accepted our freedoms, by pledging to our flag - our society, whomever rules.<br>3. There will always be some bag eggs amongst them, similiar with our quitters, but it is not the entire flock to be blamed. Some will make use of us and then run away, but not all. This is humanity, as well as those whom I had the priviledge and honour of getting to know them.</p>
              <p><br>To those quitters, I wish them well and may they prosper, just as we will with the new blood of immigrants into our ranks.</p>
              <p><br>I mean no mischief or malice to my ex citizens whom are not sowing discord or insidously justifying their abandonment. I only speak with  freedom of speech as is my right, as a contribution to this thread, as others had freely and are welcomed to do so without curtailing anyone's elses right purely for open discussion. </p>
              <p>Peace.</p>

              <p>As usual, they still make uterior policies to control over youngster like me, starting from PAP childcare centre, dun alway think that the govt want to take your money, all they want is control, once they get the control over you, the rest is history. UNDERSTAND.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>you dun need talent to run a country, u just need good advisors, u go ask the saudi king and most arab rulers, they dun even know what is politics. As for Charismaticism, politicans shouldn't be that charismatic or graceful, otherwise people will just said it is just for show and your subordinates will take advantage of your charismatic character to laze around. As for Energetics, look around the world, most of the rulers are not even fit to walk the aisle and still rule with power and control. Deng Xiao Peng, thai King and many other old rulers or govt. Our politicans are consider quite healthy already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY said if you stop working, you go senile and die faster. It is not that the old man wanted to interfere with politics, but merely to churn his brain cells and stay alive. Secondly, you simply cannot forgo a piece of your effort in building Singapore and then let it rot at the hands of some goondo while you are alive, aint you?</p>

              <p>they can alway lure them back with laksa, chicken rice and roti prata, when i go overseas for months, i use to miss them alot, that is why i come back. But i am not a talent, talent is only in the eyes of the beholden, nobody is talent just by academy, everyone of us is talent by our own trade. As a bartender and pub servicing officer, i am talented to serve a PhD</p>
