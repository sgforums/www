            <div class='col-md body'>Many Malaysians might have flocked to Singapore to hunt for some good bargains in the Great Singapore Sale but the perpertual jam in Singapore side of the causeway might have altered it to a Great Singapore Shame!Whether you go out or coming in, the Singapore side of the Immigration is always the culprit holding up the traffic!<br><br>It seems to many  that they could not cope but they are not willing to deploy more people to open up more available counters to ease the jam! It may be a great shame if they compare to its Johor counterpart which has about 10 counters to cope with the traffic!The narrowing traffic lanes in JB side might have caused some jam in JB side but it is alway the slowing traffic on the causeway to Singapore immigration which caused the massive jam! Any fools will see it with their naked eyes!<br><br>Many Singaporeans with good qualifications are out of job and the immigration can easily employ them as part timers to cope with the present situation so that the retails trade could move on with some foreign stimulants,but it looks like"your security is our main concern" kill off everything on earth, worst still ERP into the city and Orchard area is going up!!!Most retails will die of self attrition!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They should open more counters esp. during sch. holidays.<br>I was there recently &amp; only 3 counters opened at 1 side.<br>The queue on S'pore side was very long compared to M'sia checkpt.<br><br>I guess the govt don't want to make it easier for us cos most of us will shop in M'sia. Food, cigarettes, petrol &amp; shopping definately cheaper than here.<br><br>Also they have new shopping havens like Megamall where they got everything we have like Esprit, Adidas, Roxy, U2, Metro, Carrefour but cheaper!</div>
