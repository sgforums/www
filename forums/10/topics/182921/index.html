PAP MPs with minimal experience can then walk into parliament Â“on the coat tailsÂ” of the minister. Smaller political parties (with a heart) are disadvantaged due to lack of SSCs and the Â‘inflated stakesÂ’ needed to contest a GRC.<br><br>* The difficulties of the people in having an alternative opinion are stark given the following statistic.<br>Â“In the last four general elections, the number of uncontested seats has risen from 11 in 1988 to 41 in 1991, 47 in 1997 and 55 in 2001.Â” (http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=18272<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>* Â“Two-thirds or more than 66 per cent of Singaporeans believe that they have little or no influence at all on national issuesÂ”.- http://www.todayonline.com/articles/105957.asp<br>* ST Fri 17Mar06:  of 413 persons (aged btw 21-34) surveyed: 4/10 donÂ’t know which constituency they live in, half cannot name their MP.<br><br>* The price of everything in SG is already inflatedÂ…LKY: please do not price Â‘political representationÂ’ out of the reach of the common manÂ… I want to know who my MP is, I want my MP to have a heartÂ… not necessarily someone who has political clout/ connections and doesnÂ’t care because heÂ’s sure of walking over the next electionÂ…<br><br>Thus for the good of SingaporeÂ’s future- limit the number seats per GRC to 4 or lessÂ….<br>Every national policy must have sound concepts behind themÂ… and the electorate shall see that the ruling party behaves fairly and squarelyÂ… perverse extensions of an existing policy to disadvantage alternative political representations are tyrannical and shameful displays of a partyÂ’s selfishness and ego.<br></div>
