              <p>I don't think moral education alone helps.   You're talking about being gracious (a topic that has been brought up many times).</p>
              <p>Giving up your seat to someone who needs it more, clearing your table after eating, not leaving a mess when you leave a cinema (or anywhere else), giving way to each other on the roads, using your signals appropriately so as not to inconvenience other road users, using traffic crossings appropriately (by that I mean, realizing that you are crossing a road, not walking in a park.  That people are waiting for you to cross so that they can go about their lives too), not playing with your phones in a dark theater cause it'll be glaring into other peoples faces, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc...</p>
              <p>That is extremely difficult here.  Simple reason - the environment we live in. </p>
              <p>An example, I was in Perth a long time ago running to purchase a ticket and the train to Freemantle was about to leave.  The conductor actually smiled, waved me on board and said, "We won't close down cause we miss out on one fare.".</p>
              <p>Can you imagine that happening here in $ingapore?</p>
              <p>It's things like that that make a person realize that we are all human beings living together and should do what we can to help each other out.  It builds empathy, sympathy and the desire to help spread that joy.</p>
              <p>Here, we are squeezed in every direction.  Over priced public housing, need to pay for parking on every inch of road, you get fined following the letter of the law even if you aren't obstructing any traffic if you don't pay to park, even if you drive a taxi you need to pay ERP (cause some taxi drivers will go to town with their families sometimes. So WHAT???), etc...    Essentially, laws put in place to make sure you can't do a single thing without them making money off it.  That there is no room to rest and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>All of these have geared us into a "what can we get away with?" mindset.   Hence, grabbing all the most expensive dishes at buffets without thought of anyone else, hogging overtaking lanes with the, "If the police isn't pulling me over, why should I give way to you" attitudes - same thing with crossing roads, or signalling. </p>
              <p>To make it worse our Government broadcasts the need to look out for ourselves FIRST!!!  By paying themselves millions of tax payers money, "Or else we will become corrupt and steal it"...  continue to draw HUGE tax payer funded pensions even after they retire, then turn around and tell the rest of us that we must not expect too high pay and fund our own annuities in our old age.   After paying taxes all their lives, we are not going to take care of our old.</p>
              <p>Is there really room for grace in our society?</p>
              <p>This same government is now asking us to be gracious.   Simply amazing!</p>

              <p>Interesting viewpoint.</p>
              <p>But never mind. As the population increase faster than public transport infrastructure can handle, there will be more squeeze. The older folks will be 'supported' by the bodies of many others in an MRT and thus need not fear falling down.</p>

              <p>Yes moral education has failed in singapore as compared to even our neighbouring countries. Yet we are still expecting more tourists to visit singapore when many people in singapore have no morality. Ever thought that will they still visit? I dunno about that. This society is a concrete jungle based on my point of opinion. I have currently two hometown, one in Singapore and another one in malaysia. Whenever i compare both places, my only conclusion is that the people in malaysia are more friendly and gracious.</p>
              <p>People said that religions teach morality. But this surely isnt the case. Look at how many youngsters study religions nowadays, but does that improve the morality of the society of youngsters? And parents dont teach their kids morality, and this leads to further downgrade of society.</p>
              <p>MOE should not be responsible for teaching moral educations. It is always the parents responsibility as parents and children are a family. The school is just a place to gain knowledge.</p>

              <p>I don't think moral education alone helps.   You're
              talking about being gracious (a topic that has been brought up many
              times).</p>
              <p>Giving up your seat to someone who needs it more, clearing your
              table after eating, not leaving a mess when you leave a cinema (or
              anywhere else), giving way to each other on the roads, using your
              signals appropriately so as not to inconvenience other road users,
              using traffic crossings appropriately (by that I mean, realizing
              that you are crossing a road, not walking in a park.  That
              people are waiting for you to cross so that they can go about their
              lives too), not playing with your phones in a dark theater cause
              it'll be glaring into other peoples faces, etc, etc, etc, etc,
              etc...</p>
              <p>That is extremely difficult here.  Simple reason - the
              environment we live in. </p>
              <p>An example, I was in Perth a long time ago running to purchase a
              ticket and the train to Freemantle was about to leave.  The
              conductor actually smiled, waved me on board and said, "We won't
              close down cause we miss out on one fare.".</p>
              <p>Can you imagine that happening here in $ingapore?</p>
              <p>It's things like that that make a person realize that we are all
              human beings living together and should do what we can to help each
              other out.  It builds empathy, sympathy and the desire to help
              spread that joy.</p>
              <p>Here, we are squeezed in every direction.  Over priced
              public housing, need to pay for parking on every inch of road, you
              get fined following the letter of the law even if you aren't
              obstructing any traffic if you don't pay to park, even if you drive
              a taxi you need to pay ERP (cause some taxi drivers will go to town
              with their families sometimes. So WHAT???),
              etc...    Essentially, laws put in place to make
              sure you can't do a single thing without them making money off
              it.  That there is no room to rest and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>All of these have geared us into a "what can we get away with?"
              mindset.   Hence, grabbing all the most expensive dishes
              at buffets without thought of anyone else, hogging overtaking lanes
              with the, "If the police isn't pulling me over, why should I give
              way to you" attitudes - same thing with crossing roads, or
              signalling. </p>
              <p>To make it worse our Government broadcasts the need to look out
              for ourselves FIRST!!!  By paying themselves millions of tax
              payers money, "Or else we will become corrupt and steal
              it"...  continue to draw HUGE tax payer funded pensions even
              after they retire, then turn around and tell the rest of us that we
              must not expect too high pay and fund our own annuities in our old
              age.   After paying taxes all their lives, we are
              not going to take care of our old.</p>
              <p>Is there really room for grace in our society?</p>
              <p>This same government is now asking us to be
              gracious.   Simply amazing!</p>

              <p>i agree. perth is really really really a gracious country.</p>
              <p>polite, gentle..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it works both ways la. if singapore were to have that kind of attitude to allow someone to board without a fare, firstly, the boss upstairs will fuck them, and once singaporean consummers hear of it, they'll take advantage of it.</p>
              <p>it really disgust me somehow.</p>
              <p>but it also helps that its easier to be gracious to others when everyone is gracious to you. you'll find it easier to be gracious to others in perth because everyone is like that. monkey see, monkey do. someone bumps into you, smile and apologises and pat you on the back. you can't help but smile and apologise too.</p>
              <p>can this ever happen in singapore?</p>

              <p>to the child whose parents are tyrannical, whose home life is in ruins the school can be his salvation, his 'second chance' to aquire a better sense of self and a better vision of life than was offered in his home. Not everyone has the 'ideal parents' to teach moral values and to guide a child's life so it is also important that school teachers provide that kind of enlightenment. Unfortunately the education system here has been corrupted to focus PURELY on acedemics so i understand most people's views on not relying on school/government.</p>

              <p>Lol you are so right.. Nothing immoral about those behaviour in my eyes. This is merely a case of people absorbing the government's brainwashing to become a more 'gracious' society. They end up critizing small things and saying 'how ungracious!'. Now imagine that multiplied by thousands more brainwashed, complaining people and we have a reputation for being ungracious people.</p>
              <p>Nevermind that people in other countries sometimes(or perhaps most of the time) dont give up seats or hold doors for women we have already aquired the reputation of being ungracious. The funny thing is i dont think the govt realised that its courtesy campaign has backfired. lol.</p>
