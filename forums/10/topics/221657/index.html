If the Pap were upgrading the HDBs in their constituency based on the their very own fund which they have raised through the donators and supporters in that area, then it would be right, however the pap controlled constituency are upgraded using the national coffers are they not? of which the citizens of potong and hougang has also contributed?  If the PAP uses this excuses, then i would not be surprised to say that if a opposition party wins a majority of the parliament, they are not able to use the national coffer funds because it was the ex ruling party PAP which had managed them in the first place to the current quota..so the opposition ruling party must come up with its own means to raise its own national coffer funds to sustain the nation... does it make sense?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br><strong><br><br>Hi Ti Lik,<br><br>In all fairness, politics is like a game.<br><br>Mah Bow Tan is perfectly in his right to claim that the people in Potong Pasir and Hougang voted out the Ruling Party candidates and therefore their incumbent MPs are in no position to demand funding from the govt.<br><br>It's a simple case of majority rules and if the people in those constituencies have voted as such, then the Ruling Party have to 'respect' their decision. Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong will have to find some other means to obtain their funding. It's no point barking up the wrong tree.<br><br>Overall, their attempts in parliament to raise the awareness that taxpayers' monies have been unethically utilized by the ruling party have been sucessful. The ruling party have so far been <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">[b]UNABLE</span></span></strong> to couter this argument. Their counter position has always been: you didn't vote me, so you get zero goodies.<br><br>On the issue of GST increases, let's be realistic: it can only rise. The fact that it came about now is no surprise, seeing as how the public transport companies have also gone through with their price hike despite vehement protests from the people.<br><br>It has been a regular trend that prices rise after elections. A smart investor could even put some money into stocks and property and watch them pay dividends after elections. Unfortunately, when we raise price hiking as an issue, we are accused of being <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>whiners</strong></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>lack constructive criticism</strong></span>. At the same time, Singaporeans themselves are absent minded, having seen first hand the ruthlessness of the Ruling Party in driving their targets thru, without a thought for those who are left behind.<br><br>Lee Junior mentioned in parliament that Low Thia Khiang had jumped the gun by assuming that the budget package he proposed would only last a year or so. He emphasized that a 'wait and see' policy should be adopted. Yet he chose to announce the GST increase at this time.<br><br>Somehow, it wouldn't be shocking if his budget plan lasted only for a year...<br>[/b]</blockquote>I disagree with you about what you said about Mah Bow Tan. Yes. The opposition party are in no position to demand funds from the government becasue it so happen that they do not belong to the ruling party.<br><br>However, have you stop to think that the country's treasury is suppose to be used for all Singaporeans reagardless of the constituencies they are from? PAP is just the ruling party that forms part of the government, and they are NOT the government. So what gives them the right to deny the people of Potong Pasir and Hougang the funds to upgrade their estates?<br><br>If we are to play along with the ruling party resonings that because their party's candidate have not been voted for, and hence, the funds cannot be allocated to that area, then, can we say that a portion of the tax payer's money from that two areas be scheduled to the fundings for these area's upgrading works?</div>
