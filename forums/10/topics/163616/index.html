Also, our present is much more intricately linked to our post-Raffles history rather than to what came before that.

            <div class='col-md body'>your very existence started the moment your father's sperm swam towards your mother's egg. however, as far as you can remember, you probably found life more significant and vivid when your began school...the same goes for singapore's history, before the raffles 'founded' this harbour, temasek was only some outlying fishing village. anything interesting to document then? probably not....</div>
