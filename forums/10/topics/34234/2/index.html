THAT is the perspective i'm talking about. people don't normally DO this kinda things! and THAT is something many people take for granted when viewing the 3rd Reich!<br><br>the main driving force for the rabid anti-semitism was not nazism. that a gross oversimplification. the point is, hating jews was nothing new to the history of europe. i'm not going to launch into a history lesson here, but this is what i'm suggesting:<br><br>that anti-semitic undercurrents found an ideological manifestation in nazism. that's one of the perspectives. thats why ordinary Germans stood back and did nothing when friends and neighbours got carted off and were never seen again...<br><br>because the ideology awoke something that had been stirring inside them all this while... it's a feeling that had occupied the German psyche since the Enlightenment... arguably inherent in the German identity (essentially ethnic in conception) until 1945...<br><br>another i suggest, is that after it got carried to such maddenning extents, the "internal enemies" (aka. jews) were viewed to be as deadly (if not more so) than the external enemies in Stalingrad, London and Washington...<br><br>thats why they continued killing Jews until the very last days of the war... thats why railway carriages transporting inmates could not be freed to carry troops and supplies to the eastern fronts... thats why resources to the death camps could not be redeployed to alleviate the horrible conditions at the war front.<br><br><blockquote>The 3rd Reich view towards the Jews is almost equal to the "Yellow Peril" views aroused by the racist fears of the average parochial US Caucasians of being overwhelmed by Asians.</blockquote>there are indeed many parallels... one of which is that early Chinese immigrants, like Jews, are able to thrive in the face of great adversities... enough to raise attention to themselves and incur the jealousies of the whites...<br><br>then again, thats just an oversimplification... think political... they were pushed around also because China was too weak to afford its overseas citizens any meaningful protection. in fact, they were bullied overseas cos the chinese gov't was too weak to even protect its citizens at home! many of them were kidnapped and sold, not voluntary immigrants...<br><br>thats why there's an obcession with a Jewish homeland after the war. among other things, it was to afford themselves protection.<br><br><blockquote>The "Yellow Skinned Asians" can empathise with the Jews for the persecution they suffered from the Nazis, although the Jew had endured amongst the worst persecution in human history.</blockquote>nay... all ethnicities face adversities in their histories. i have enough to be proud of without referring to parallels... i would emphathise with ALL persecuted and oppressed people in the world... not necessarily jewish...<br><br><blockquote>The policy of the 3rd Reich is a simple distorted Racist Policy, of eradicating a community of Jews, whom they viewed as being "the cockroaches of the world", scavenging their wealth from the misery and poverty of the German people.<br><br>The Racist Policy of the 3rd Reich is the promotion of their superior Aryan Race of pure blond and healthy blue eyed Caucasions; which they nearly succeeded with mechanized ruthless efficiency in subjugating all other ethnic groups of Europe.</blockquote>thats textbook talk... u got the racial part right, but the Jewish part is a little more complicated as i've mentioned... the Nazis did not invent the enemy... they merely re-awakened it (violently!) in the hearts and minds of the people.<br><br>prior to that, things were quite fine... Jews fought alongside germans in WW 1... but suddenly, there was an awakening that Jews, bourgeoisies and socialists betrayed the victorious German army from within...<br><br>not a valid reason of course... pure fiction... but it was close to what Germans wanted to believe... it was easier to believe than accepting military defeat... and Ludendorff and Hindenburg gladly participated in the charade... cos they were too chicken to accept responsibility!<br><br>i could go on all day... but my point is, in this day and age of global communication, enemies do not just appear out of nowhere... they are usually the results of historical baggage and historical conditioning...<br><br>our northern friend could not have made us out to be a hostile neighbour for no reason... its been going on for some time.<br><br>thats why i think its frightening because it is so much more difficult to identify with something than to identify against something... if national identities are forged to identify against an inherent enemy, i would hate to live to see it happen...<br><br></div>
