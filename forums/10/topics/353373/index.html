              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> <strong>I. THE INTRODUCTION: </strong>The introduction is usually one paragraph, 
                    or perhaps two in a paper of eight pages or more. Its purpose is to: (1) 
                    set out the problem to be discussed; (2) define key terms that will be used 
                    in that discussion; (3) outline the structure of the argument; (4) CLEARLY 
                    STATE THE THESIS. <br> <br> <strong>A. Suggestions for the introduction:<br> <br> Establish the problem:</strong> Quickly established the issue your paper 
                    confronts. Where and when are we? What are we examining? It is especially 
                    important to clearly define the limits of your exploration. If you are discussing 
                    the life of Frederick Douglass, it will not suffice to establish the setting 
                    by referring to the "days of slavery," since slavery has existed in all 
                    times all over the world. Frederick Douglass was a slave in Maryland in 
                    the decades before the Civil War. Do not begin a history paper with absurdly 
                    general phrases like, "since the beginning of time," or "humans have always. 
                    . . ." Get as specific as necessary as early as possible.<br> <br> <strong>Set the tone, voice, and style of your paper.</strong> (See other 
                    guidelines for how this is done.) Make sure you convey that the topic is 
                    of vital concern, and that you are interested in it.<br> <br> <strong>Catch the reader's attention.</strong> You might start with an example, 
                    a quotation, a statistic, or a complaint. Be sure that this opening theme 
                    runs through your paper. Do not abandon this theme. You can use it again 
                    later to help unify your paper.<br> <br> <strong>Provide a subtle blueprint (or "road map") for the paper</strong>. 
                    Let your reader know where you are headed (how you plan to tackle the subject) 
                    without giving away your best ideas. If, for instance, your paper breaks 
                    down into political, social, and cultural components, telegraph this to 
                    your reader so she will know what to expect.<br> <br> <strong>B. The thesis: </strong><br> <br> The last function of the introduction is to present your thesis. This is 
                    so important to your paper that it merits lengthy consideration -- please 
                    see my handout on this topic. The biggest problem with student papers is 
                    that they contain no true thesis. The second biggest problem with student 
                    papers is that the thesis is vague and ill-defined.<br> <br> <strong> How the thesis fits in the introductory paragraph: </strong>The 
                    thesis statement is the one-sentence version of your argument. The thesis 
                    thus presents your reader with new information. But a good thesis will require 
                    you to introduce the concepts in it before presenting the thesis itself. 
                    That is the task of the introductory paragraph. The following introductory 
                    paragraph presents a thesis that relies on concepts which have not been 
                    properly defined and clarified:<br> <br> <span style="font-family: Courier;">Since the beginning of time humans have 
                    owned one another in slavery. This brutal institution was carried to its 
                    fullest extent in the United States in the years between the American Revolution 
                    and the Civil War. Slaveholders treated their slaves as chattel, brutalizing 
                    them with the whip and the lash. The law never recognized the humanity of 
                    the slave, and similarly regarded him as property. Consequently, there was 
                    a big disparity between private and public rights of slaves.</span> <br> <br> This thesis presents two words -- "private" and "public" rights -- that 
                    are not even mentioned earlier in the paragraph. What are these things? 
                    This paragraph does nothing to establish the distinction. Instead, it is 
                    a bland statement of theme which provides little background for the thesis. 
                    Thus, when we do read the thesis, it seems to float -- the premises underlying 
                    it have not been established. Compare the last introductory paragraph with 
                    this one:<br> <br> <span style="font-family: Courier;">To many supporters of slavery, the nature 
                    of slave rights had a dual character. On the one hand, in order to maintain 
                    the total dominance of the white master class, the law denied any rights 
                    to slaves. Publicly, the slave was merely property, and not human at all. 
                    Yet the personal records of many planters suggest that slaves often proved 
                    able to demand customary "rights" from their masters. In the privacy of 
                    the master-slave relationship, the black man did indeed have rights which 
                    the white man was bound to respect, on pain of losing his labor or subjecting 
                    himself to violence. This conflict between slaves' lack of "public" rights 
                    and masters' "private" acknowledgment of slaves' rights undermined planters' 
                    hegemony and permitted slaves to exert a degree of autonomy and freedom 
                    within an oppressive institution.</span><br> <br> Note how quickly this paragraph lays the groundwork for the thesis. It is 
                    clearly structured around two competing concepts -- public and private rights 
                    -- which are then incorporated into the thesis. Nearly every element of 
                    the thesis is established in the preceding paragraph, yet the thesis itself 
                    is not a restatement of the paragraph. This paragraph even tells the reader 
                    what sources will be consulted: planters' personal records. Note finally 
                    that, in contrast to the previous paragraph, the reader now has a strong 
                    sense of what the paper will need to argue to prove its thesis. <br> <br> <br> <strong>II. THE BODY:</strong> This takes up several pages, and constitutes 
                    the bulk of your paper. Here is where you argue your thesis. The content 
                    of this section largely will depend on your thesis, and what it requires 
                    you to argue. Think to yourself, "what do I need to support this argument?" 
                    If you find yourself unable to answer, you may need a more interesting thesis.<br> <br> <strong>A. Structure of the body: </strong>You need an organizing scheme 
                    for your paper, which most often will be suggested by your thesis. Let's 
                    take this thesis: "In the 1950s, American auto workers developed their identities 
                    as laborers in the home as well as the workplace." This thesis suggests 
                    a structure: at the very least, you will have to divide things up into "home" 
                    and "workplace." <br> <br> <strong>B. Logic and flow:</strong> The general movement in the body is 
                    from the general to the specific. Start with general statements, such as 
                    "Federal policy towards native peoples aimed at either assimilating Indians 
                    or exterminating them." Then move on to specific statements which support 
                    your general statement, such as "The origins of the policy of assimilation 
                    can be traced back to Puritan missionaries of the 1650s."<br> <br> <strong>C. Paragraphs: </strong>Your paper is built on paragraphs. Each 
                    paragraph should be minimum of four (sometimes three) sentences. The first 
                    sentence of each paragraph is called the "topic sentence."<br> <br> <strong>D. Topic sentences: </strong>The topic sentence should tell the 
                    reader what the paragraph will be about. In essence, it is a "mini-thesis" 
                    -- a small argument you will support in the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph 
                    will be support for this mini-argument. For example, the topic sentence 
                    for a paragraph may be the general statement: <br> <br> <em>Federal policy towards native peoples aimed at either assimilating Indians 
                    or exterminating them. </em>(Note that you are including no specific facts 
                    in this sentence, you are merely making an argument which must be supported 
                    with facts and evidence.)<br> <br> <strong>E. Support: </strong>Two kinds of support should appear in your 
                    paragraphs:<br> <br> Source evidence and quotations: Taken from primary (sometimes secondary) 
                    sources. Can be quoted material, but not always -- you can always paraphrase 
                    (put in your own words) this material, as long as you acknowledge the source. 
                    This is the "raw data" that supports the mini-thesis of your paragraph. 
                    In the case above (federal policy towards Indians), you could, for instance, 
                    quote portions of this letter from Thomas Jefferson, in which he advocates 
                    to the Mohicans private ownership of land to Indians as a means of assimilating 
                    them:<br> <br> <span style="font-family: Courier;">When once you have property, you will 
                    want laws and magistrates to protect your property and persons, and to punish 
                    those among you who commit crimes. You will find that our laws are good 
                    for this purpose; you will wish to live under them, you will unite yourselves 
                    with us, join in our Great Councils and form one people with us, and we 
                    shall be Americans.</span><a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/writing-guides/three%20parts.htm#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a><br> <br> Analysis: Raw data <strong><em>can never, ever</em></strong>stand alone 
                    to support your mini-thesis. It must <em>always</em> be interpreted and 
                    analyzed. This is especially true of quotes. <em>Never</em> just plop a 
                    quote in and expect it to be clear to the reader how it supports the mini-thesis. 
                    Following each citation of raw data, you <em>must</em> analyze and interpret 
                    it -- tell me how it supports the point. In the case above, <em>you</em> must supply the connection between the primary source evidence (the quotation 
                    above) and your "mini-thesis" (that assimilation was one of the goals of 
                    federal policy):<br> <br> <em>Jefferson had little interest in understanding Native American culture 
                    and society on its own terms. To him, "assimilation" meant encompassing 
                    natives in a web of obligations and institutional arrangements which utterly 
                    departed from the anarchy he alleged characterized their societies, and 
                    rendered them dependent upon the "civilized" society he represented. </em>(Note 
                    that these are my thoughts, my words, and my analysis of the material. I 
                    am not permitting the material to speak for itself, because it cannot.)<br> <br> <strong>F. Transitions:</strong> The body of the paper must flow from one 
                    idea to the next. This linking of ideas is accomplished through transitional 
                    phrases. There are transitions between paragraphs, and transitions within 
                    paragraphs. Often, but not always, the last sentence of a paragraph begins 
                    to guide the reader to the next idea. (For this reason, it is often a good 
                    idea to end paragraphs with a sentence summing-up their findings.) Or the 
                    topic sentence of the next paragraph may accomplish this. In the current 
                    example, this topic sentence for the next paragraph not only introduces 
                    a new mini-thesis, it serves as a transition from the preceding paragraph:<br> <br> <em>If Jefferson embodied a policy of assimilation, President Andrew Jackson 
                    represented the ambivalence of a nation enamored with both assimilation 
                    and extermination of Native Americans. </em>(The key to the transition is 
                    the phrase "If Jefferson embodied a policy of assimilation." This phrase 
                    bridges the last paragraph by summarizing its findings. As you can tell, 
                    the paragraph(s) must deal with the ways Jackson represented the embodiment 
                    of both policies towards Native Americans.)<br> <br> Here is another example of a clear transition:<br> <br> <em>. . . Sailors in the merchant marine faced a troublesome labor picture. 
                    Seasonal fluctuations and the unpredictability of the economy of the shipping 
                    industry contributed to instability in employment relations. These in turn 
                    led to a decline in workers's loyalty and their sense of job stability.<br> Instability and insecurity also characterized the wage and employment conditions 
                    of longshore work. . . . </em>(The transition here is built on the use of 
                    "also" in this topic sentence, which links the "instability and insecurity" 
                    of the longshoremen in this paragraph with the "instability and insecurity" 
                    of the sailors in the previous paragraph.)<br> <br> <strong>G. Arguing in the body:</strong> The body is where you will flex 
                    your rhetorical muscle. Scholarly argument is not necessarily rancorous; 
                    it does not rely upon heated emotions, raised voices, and passionate appeals 
                    to the heart. Rather, scholarly arguments marshall <em>facts</em> -- and 
                    <em>analyze</em> those facts -- in a fashion intended to persuade the reader 
                    through <em>reason</em> rather than emotion. The most important technique 
                    for doing this is to anticipate the counter-arguments your argument is likely 
                    to receive. You must constantly ask yourself, what arguments which counter 
                    my thesis make sense? You may do this one of two ways: <br> <br> (1) you may <em>refute</em> an anticipated counter-argument by proving that 
                    it is untrue (sort of a preemptive strike), as in, <em>"While the federal 
                    census of 1890 seems to suggest an increase in black mortality, that census 
                    was infamous for recording specious data."</em><br> <br> (2) you may <em>concede</em> certain points: accept the truth of statements 
                    which seem to refute your argument, but explain why they actually do not 
                    harm your argument (sort of a strategic retreat), as in <em>"It was indeed 
                    true that Latino youth were incarcerated at a rate three to four times greater 
                    than Anglo youth, yet this may suggest the iniquitous workings of the local 
                    justice system rather than a Latino propensity towards crime."</em><br> <br> In history, these strategies often mean dealing with evidence that seems 
                    to undermine the point you are trying to make. It is crucial that you not 
                    ignore this evidence; after all, the reader will not. Selectively invoking 
                    evidence while ignoring counter-arguments undermines your credibility, and 
                    hence the force of your argument. Consider the following paragraph:<br> <br> <em>White Southerners were concerned only with re-imposing a kind of slavery 
                    on the freedpeople. They voted the straight Democratic ticket, which sought 
                    to overturn "Negro rule," and they supported secret organizations like the 
                    Klan and the Knights of the White Camellia. In short, their regard for the 
                    civil rights of the newly-freed slaves was almost non-existent. </em>(The 
                    fallacy here is one of over-generalization. The author claims that <em>all</em> southern whites supported the move to return freedpeople to a kind of slavery. 
                    But we know that some southern whites <em>did</em> support black rights 
                    in the era, and voted Republican. By refusing to consider countervailing 
                    evidence, the author undermines what is a generally sound point: most southern 
                    whites supported the Democracy, but not all. By anticipating and countering 
                    these criticisms, this author would enhance her credibility and make a good 
                    argument more persuasive.)<br> <br> <br> <strong>III. CONCLUSION: </strong>This is usually one paragraph long, and 
                    briefly recapitulates your thesis, pulling all your arguments together. 
                    The first sentence of the concluding paragraph is a clear, specific re-statement 
                    of thesis. The conclusion should do more than simply re-state the argument. 
                    It also suggests why the argument is important in the bigger scheme of things, 
                    or suggests avenues for further research, or raises a bigger question. </span></p>
