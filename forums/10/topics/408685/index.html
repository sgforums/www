              Newsweek Sucks!
              
              "Singapore come up tops in a Newsweek report on â€œThe Best Countriesâ€� in the world with its Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong receiving special praise for leading the worldâ€™s fastest growing economy.
              
              .... What was not mentioned is the fact that Singapore is able to adopt liberal economic policies by forcing unpopular policies such as its pro-foreigner and ultra-liberal immigration policies down the throats of Singaporeans via ruling partyâ€™s tight-fisted control over the state. Official unemployment figures are also unreliable as they include PRs as well."
              
              Link: http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/08/20/newsweek-praised-singapores-pm-lee-as-a-master-of-risk-management/
              
              I hope Singaporeans will now realize that Newsweek publishes unreliable material and whoever did that report has no journalistic integrity whatsoever!
              
              Boycott Newsweek for writing this rubbish!
              
              I especially take issue with this statement in the Newsweek article:
              
              "Education and infrastructure are first-rate and unemployment is among the lowest in the world"
              
              What the f**k are you talking about? Ok ok, our air-conditioned shopping centers are first rate. But Education too? Hello! Do you, Newsweek Writer, know that even in our university, the lecturers are forced to censor their teaching material and material discussing or supporting liberalism are discouraged from being used as teaching material?
              
              And do you, Newsweek Writer, know that many students in our top JCs still don't know our Constitution supports freedom of speech and assembly? They will also not be able to tell you of their rights as citizens. Something that even students in a small town high school in America would know.
              
              Did the Newsweek Writer do his research? Has Newsweek not heard about the climate of fear that is so pervasive in Singapore's society and even once WONDER if it would affect what and how teachers teach their students? (1)
              
              And what about the political science lecturer in our supposedly "world-class" university who's presenting fiction as fact?(2) That sort of thing is apparently a sign of "first-rate" education according to Newsweek. And here I am thinking that Political SCIENCE is supposed to be about facts, and not make-believe stories...
