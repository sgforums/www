              <h1>US backing for world currency stuns markets</h1>
              <p>US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner shocked
                      global markets by revealing that Washington is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"quite open"</strong></span> to Chinese
                      proposals for the gradual development of a global reserve currency run
                      by the International Monetary Fund. <br> <br> <strong>By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard<br> <br> March 27, 2009 "</strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/5050407/US-backing-for-world-currency-stuns-markets.html"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The Telegraph</strong></span></a><strong>" -- - T</strong>he
                      dollar plunged instantly against the euro, yen, and sterling as the
                      comments flashed across trading screens. David Bloom, currency chief at
                      HSBC, said the apparent policy shift amounts to an earthquake in
                      geo-finance.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> "The mere fact that the US
                      Treasury Secretary is even entertaining thoughts that the dollar may
                      cease being the anchor of the global monetary system has caused
                      consternation," he said. </strong></span><br> <br> Mr Geithner later qualified his remarks, insisting that the dollar
                      would remain the "world's dominant reserve currency ... for a long
                      period of time" but the seeds of doubt have been sown.<br> <br> The markets appear baffled by the confused statements emanating from
                      Washington. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>President Barack Obama told a new conference hours earlier
                      that there was no threat to the reserve status of the dollar.</strong></span><br> <br> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I don't believe that there is a need for a global currency.</strong></span> The reason
                      the dollar is strong right now is because investors consider the United
                      States the strongest economy in the world with the most stable
                      political system in the world," he said.<br> <br> The Chinese proposal, outlined this week by central bank governor Zhou
                      Xiaochuan, calls for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"super-sovereign reserve currency" </strong></span>under IMF
                      management, turning the Fund into a sort of world central bank.<br> <br> The idea is that the IMF should activate its dormant powers to issue
                      Special Drawing Rights. These SDRs would expand their role over time,
                      becoming a "widely-accepted means of payments".<br> <br> Mr Bloom said that any switch towards use of SDRs has direct
                      implications for the currency markets. At the moment, 65pc of the
                      world's $6.8 trillion stash of foreign reserves is held in dollars. But
                      the dollar makes up just 42pc of the basket weighting of SDRs. So any
                      SDR purchase under current rules must favour the euro, yen and sterling.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Beijing has the backing of Russia and a clutch of emerging powers in
                      Asia and Latin America. </strong></span>Economists have toyed with such schemes before
                      but the issue has vaulted to the top of the political agenda as
                      creditor states around the world takes fright at the extreme measures
                      now being adopted by the Federal Reserve, especially the decision to
                      buy US government debt directly with printed money.<br> <br> Mr Bloom said the US is discovering that the sensitivities of creditors
                      cannot be ignored. "China holds almost 30pc of the world's entire
                      reserves. What they say matters," he said.<br> <br> Mr Geithner's friendly comments about the SDR plan seem intended to
                      soothe Chinese feelings after a spat in January over alleged currency
                      manipulation by Beijing, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he will now have to explain his own
                      categorical assurance to Congress on Tuesday that he would not
                      countenance any moves towards a world currency. </strong></span></p>

              <h1>The dollar's days may be numbered</h1>
              <p>By
                                      Associate Editor
                                      <a href="http://www.moneyweek.com/about-us/the-moneyweek-team/david-stevenson.aspx">David Stevenson</a> <span class="date"> Mar 27, 2009 </span></p>
              <p>If you've been on holiday abroad recently, you'll be all too aware
              how expensive everything has become if you're paying in pounds.</p>
              <p>Sadly
              for travellers, and also for importers, our national economic woes mean
              there's little sign of sterling recovering much in the near future. But
              the pound's not the only currency with problems.</p>
              <p>With
              various parts of the eurozone near-bankrupt, the euro is under
              pressure, while Japan's recession means the yen doesn't look too hot
              either. And the Swiss franc â a traditional safe haven â has been
              deliberately crushed by the Swiss central bank, keen to prevent
              deflation.</p>
              <p>Still, there's always the dollar. It might be massively indebted,
              but America is still the place where everyone runs to put their money
              when things start looking shaky. The dollar is still the world's
              reserve currency.</p>
              <p>But perhaps not for much longer...</p>
              <h2>Sterling's in a mess right now - but so is the rest of the world</h2>
              <p>Unless
              you have a secret stash of dollars or euros you can press into service
              when the need arises, travelling outside the UK these days has become
              awfully pricey. The currency swap shops will give you less than $1.40
              per Â£1, while you're lucky if you can beat 1:1 on euros.</p>
              <p>While
              exchange rates may improve again one day, you only have to scan the
              horrendous headlines about our economy to realise this isn't likely to
              be any time soon.</p>
              <p>But sterling's main saving grace is
              that the world is in a mess too, particularly the US. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right now, the
              dollar is the world's "reserve currency", which means that many other
              countries hold large amounts of dollars in their foreign exchange
              reserves â 65% of the total, at the last count. That means the
              Americans are in pole position to set the global economic agenda â
              effectively they run the racetrack. </strong></span></p>
              <p>But the trouble is, as we discuss in MoneyWeek magazine this week (<a href="http://www.moneyweek.com/news-and-charts/economics/can-americas-latest-rescue-package-really-work-42821.aspx">Can America's latest rescue package really work?</a>, if you're not already a subscriber, <a href="http://www.moneyweek.com/shop/moneyweek-free-trial.aspx">get your first three issues free here</a>),
              the US has gone on a spending spree like no other in history. That
              means they're running up debt like no tomorrow - $11 trillion and
              counting, if you include social security obligations. In fact, if you
              want to see something really scary, check out the <a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/">US National Debt Clock</a> and keep hitting the 'refresh' button. The numbers just ratchet up while you watch in horror.</p>
              <p>This
              means humungous levels of US borrowing, and probably lots more new
              money being minted, for years to come. That poses some big question
              marks about the greenback's long-term future.</p>
              <h2>Are the dollar's days numbered?</h2>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So
              anyone who holds US dollars could be forgiven for getting a bit twitchy
              about the value of their holdings.</strong></span> And the Chinese have started the
              ball rolling. Central bank governor <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zhou Xiaochuan has called for a
              "super-sovereign reserve currency" that would be run by the
              International Monetary Fund (IMF). Russia, Brazil and India have backed
              the idea as well. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Now people have been predicting the end
              of the dollar's status as reserve currency for years. But it's easier
              said than done. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Having the global reserve currency is the main reason
              that America has been able to rack up the debts it has. Losing that
              position might be healthier for the global economy in the long run, but
              it wouldn't be a very comfortable adjustment for the US. </strong></span></p>
              <p>And
              then there's the status issue. If you no longer control the world's
              main "go-to" currency, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it rather suggests you've lost your position as
              the world's most important country. Hence the long tradition of
              Presidents and Treasury Secretaries pretending that the US has a
              "strong dollar" policy, regardless of what's actually happening on the
              ground. </strong></span></p>
              <p>So it's no wonder that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>markets were shocked </strong></span>when
              on Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said that America is
              "quite open" to the Chinese proposals, sending the dollar plunging.
              "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This apparent policy shift amounts to an earthquake in geo-finance"</strong></span>,
              says David Bloom at HSBC, according to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/5050407/US-backing-for-world-currency-stuns-markets.html">The Telegraph</a>.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dramatic
              stuff.</strong></span> It didn't take very long for Mr Geithner to "clarify" what he
              meant, i.e. that there was no policy change and that "the dollar would
              remain the world's dominant currency" â though that's not quite the
              same thing â but by then the cat was out of the bag. "If there's a
              lesson from today", says Chris Turner at ING Capital Markets, "it's
              that the dollar's on thin ice and any loose talk will be quickly
              punished."</p>
              <h2>How would a global currency work?</h2>
              <p>So how would a
              global super-currency work? At the moment the IMF runs on Special
              Drawing Rights, which are a basket of the world's major currencies.
              "The IMF would be groomed as the planet's central bank", says <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/5051075/A-world-currency-moves-nearer-after-Tim-Geithners-slip.html">The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard</a>, "and the SDRs would gradually become an accepted means of payment - call it the 'globo'."</p>
              <p>This
              could have some benefits. It would mean a new monetary start for a
              world racked by deflation, and maybe inflation again soon. The managers
              â the IMF - would be independent of national governments. That means
              countries wouldn't be able to 'inflate' their way out of debt by
              de-basing their currencies.</p>
              <p>But as the problems of the
              eurozone show, monetary union is easier said than done. Trying to set
              pan-eurozone interest rates is hard enough. Doing it on a global basis
              would be nigh-on impossible.</p>
              <p>And more to the point, any
              basket of currencies used to back the 'globo' would include a far
              smaller number of dollars than central banks currently hold in their
              reserves. That would mean a big plunge for the dollar and serious
              upheaval for the global financial system.</p>
              <p>So you won't be
              able to swap your pounds for globos any time soon. "This is obviously
              not something that's going to happen for quite a long time", says
              Morris Goldstein at the Peterson Institute. But Geithner's 'slip' means
              the door has been opened to a future without the dollar. As Goldstein
              puts it, "the crisis does raise a lot of fundamental issues, and the
              reserve currency is one of them".</p>
              <p>China holds almost 30%
              of the world's entire dollar reserves, says Mr Bloom, so "what they say
              matters". If the dollar starts dropping in earnest, and the Chinese
              really get fed up with losing so much money, don't bet on some form of
              the world super-currency not happening.</p>
              <p>And in the meantime, we've said it before, but we'll say it again â gold looks like the only currency worth having.</p>
