The way it is managed can affect the impression it gives to the world. This is just my opinion.<br><br>I notice that many share the same sentiment as you.<br><br>Look at the turnout the other time.

This turned out to be only 33%.<br><br>At this stage of singapore development, I am not so concerned about economic development as I am about moral character of our talents and leaders.<br><br>Some boss rather hire a honest and hardworking employee who is not yet the best talent than to hire the best talent who may not be honest, who will work for any employer that pays him the best.<br><br>This story reminds me that a leader is not just how smart he is. Its also how he can lead the People. Honesty and respect for the People are attributes I support. To be honest, you got to also be Transparent.<br><br>I prefer an honest person over a smart alek.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you.<br><br>Somehow the citizens of Singapore have lost the spirit as a nation. Day after day Singaporeans brace themselves for the inevitable.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, we lost our own spirit, and also the nation's spirit.<br><br>However, somehow this NDP, there are still crowds that thonged the stadium, 2-3 new national songs telecast tis year, many participants cheorographed in the national songs dance, praises of sg in ST forum, fireworks in the NDP, and massive road blocks for NDP resherasals, limited bids for people joining the NDP, and limited goodies to many people answering the quiz. And many more....dinners at neighbourhoods, ...I do not like all these, two sides of the same coin, one side plastic, the other side it's real.<br><br>It's just inevitable, 2 sides, one side plastic, one side real. It means, we have to work for it, to get benefits from the governance. If the political and business wind is blowing east, we have to go along with it, inorder to reap the benefits we need. But all these is just a degree of plasticness.<br><br>Anway, it's not good to advocate all the time anti-gov blogs either, becos whenever i read through the lives of the PM and MPs, they went through ups and downs, pains and real moments, esp. about sickness, health, etc. They have real and touching life stories also, and do not deserve oppositions for all the things they do. But however, i just feel their grip on power is abit but too non-ideal to equality, and their squeeze on their people resources a show of their oblivious towards many unseen pains and hardships.<br><br></div>
