He has done far too much for the place I used to live in to be relegated to a 'just',' she had written.<br><br>The article was reproduced in the mitigation plea Mr Lee prepared in court yesterday when highlighting Chng's contributions to society.<br><br>VIDEO<br><br><span style="color: red;">Ex-MP Chng Hee Kok fined, but stays on as NTUC Club chief</span><br>(1:56)<br>Chng - who was fined the maximum $5,000 yesterday for an offence under the Companies Act - told The Straits Times about how he felt when he became the subject of a probe by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) more than a year ago.<br><br>'I was shocked when the investigations started,' he said. But as investigations wore on, it dawned on him that he had committed an offence under the Companies Act.<br><br>Chng, who sits on the board of eight public-listed companies, was a director and shareholder of IT firm Stoval Technologies, a private limited company which has dealings with a subsidiary of NTUC Club, NCI Leisure. As a director of NCI Leisure, Chng was required by law to disclose his shareholding in Stoval formally at NCI Leisure's first available board meeting. But he did not, even though he did tell a director verbally about the appointment in private.<br><br>'I'm very disappointed in myself. It was a mistake which should not have been made,' he said. What made it worse for him was his family worrying about the court case, said the father of two adult children. Even his work at NTUC Club was affected. But what kept his spirits up was his family and his bosses' unwavering support after he told them what happened.<br><br>Now, with the case finally over, he intends to<span style="color: red;"> move on </span>and put the incident behind him.<br><br>'It was a traumatic experience, for me and for my family. My work suffered. Now I intend to make up for lost time,' he said.<br><br>cheekin@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A MISTAKE<br><br>'I'm very disappointed in myself.
