The inside story of how Iraq jumped to the top of Bush's agendaÂ—and why the outcome there may foreshadow a different world order<br><br>By Michael Elliott and James Carney<br><br>Posted Sunday, March 23, 2003; 2:31 p.m. EST<br>"F___ Saddam. We're taking him out." Those were the words of President George W. Bush, who had poked his head into the office of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. It was March 2002, and Rice was meeting with three U.S. Senators, discussing how to deal with Iraq through the United Nations, or perhaps in a coalition with America's Middle East allies. Bush wasn't interested. He waved his hand dismissively, recalls a participant, and neatly summed up his Iraq policy in that short phrase. The Senators laughed uncomfortably; Rice flashed a knowing smile. The President left the room.<br><br>A year later, Bush's outburst has been translated into action, as cruise missiles and smart bombs slam into Baghdad. But the apparent simplicity of his message belies the gravity at hand. Sure, the outcome is certain: America will win the war, and Saddam will be taken out. But what is unfolding in Iraq is far bigger than regime change or even the elimination of dangerous weapons. The U.S. has launched a war unlike any it has fought in the past. This one is being waged not to defend against an enemy that has attacked the U.S. or its interests but to pre-empt the possibility that one day it might do so. The war has turned much of the world against America. Even in countries that have joined the "coalition of the willing," big majorities view it as the impetuous action of a superpower led by a bully. This divide threatens to emasculate a United Nations that failed to channel a diplomatic settlement or brand the war as legitimate. The endgame will see the U.S. front and center, attempting to remake not merely Iraq but the entire region. The hope is that the Middle East, a cockpit of instability for decades, will eventually settle into habits of democracy, prosperity and peace. The risks are that Washington's rupture with some of its closest allies will deepen and that the war will become a cause for which a new generation of terrorists can be recruited.<br><br>How did we get here? In one sense, this war is easy to explain. Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator who hates America and has shown a wicked fondness for acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Since Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. has been acutely aware of what can happen when powerful weapons fall into the hands of those with no compunction about their use and no sympathy for those they kill. Put those facts together, and you can argue that Saddam's days were numbered from the moment the attacks on New York City and Washington happened. But that suggests a fatalistic inevitability to the story and ignores the dramatic shifts in opinion and influence among Washington's key players. In truth, this war is just as much about an ideaÂ—that Iraq is but the first step in an American-led effort to make the world a safer place. For some in the Administration, the principles that have shaped policy on Iraq are generally applicable; they could be used with other nations, like Iran or North Korea, that have or threaten to acquire terrible weapons. The least understood story of the Iraq crisis is how the idea behind it took root and eventually brought America to the edge of Baghdad.<br><br>In this battle march of an idea, there are four central players: President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell andÂ—least known to the general publicÂ—Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. One by one, these men signed on to the imperative of taking on Iraq and its weapons, and sending a message to the world. This story does not start where one might suppose, on the day last year when Bush identified IraqÂ—with Iran and North KoreaÂ—as part of the "axis of evil." Nor does it start with the horrors of Sept. 11. The confrontation with Iraq can be traced to 1991 and the end of what some Administration officials have since last fall called "the first Gulf War"Â—the one waged and won by the President's father.<br><br>SOUNDING THE ALARM<br><br>When senior advisers of the first President BushÂ—including Powell, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Cheney, then Secretary of DefenseÂ—gathered in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, Feb. 27, 1991, they agreed that their military and political objectives in the Persian Gulf had been met. Saddam's forces, which had invaded Kuwait seven months before, had been routed. General Norman Schwarzkopf, commander in chief of Operation Desert Storm, concurred in the judgment. Bush had a clear goal for the war: it was not to topple Saddam, much less to march on Baghdad, but to drive the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. The President had assembled a grand coalition, including armies from many Arab states, behind that aim, and he was not inclined to deviate from it. "Bush was a firm believer in sticking with his word," says a former senior aide. "It was his word and his promises that got that coalition together. There was never any doubt in his mind that the war had to end and we couldn't go to Baghdad."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the rest of the report read from the webby...i shall not say much....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> note: -- Note President Bush uses "F---" word!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

Â“Our soldiers on the border are on full alert... If they observe the slightest violation of Iranian airspace or at the border they will certainly react,Â” said Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi-Lari. Tehran, officially neutral in the US-led war to depose Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, has condemned what it says have been repeated violations of its airspace by coalition planes. An interior ministry spokesman said earlier yesterday that a missile that injured three Iranians when it landed on a petrochemical depot at Abadan, near the border with Iraq, was fired by a US or British warplane. Iranian radar had detected no Iraqi planes in the sky at the time, and southern Iraq has been off-limits to BaghdadÂ’s planes since the 1991 Gulf war, the spokesman, Jahanbakhsh Khamjani, said.<br><br>Witnesses also described the aircraft as belonging to the coalition, he said. But the Interior Minister also said at least one of a series of missiles that have hit Iranian territory since Britain and the United States attacked Iraq last week was Iraqi and not Western. He said the Foreign Ministry had summoned IraqÂ’s Charge dÂ’Affaires to lodge a formal protest. In London, a British Defence Ministry spokeswoman said Iraq was probably responsible for stray missiles which landed in Iranian territory during the weekend. Â“Given the disposition of forces itÂ’s most likely that this incident was the result of Iraqi action, thatÂ’s currently the situation,Â” she said. The United States on Saturday informed Tehran that an investigation was under way into reports that two Tomahawk cruise missiles aimed at Iraq had veered off course and landed in Iran. The State Department said it got a complaint from Iran through the same channel late Friday. Iran, which fought a bloody war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988 but also has a hostile relationship with the United States, has condemned the US-led offensive against Baghdad but insisted it would not take sides. Iran has had no diplomatic relations with Washington since after the 1979 Islamic revolution and looks nervously at the presence of the US military in neighboring Iraq on the west and Afghanistan on the east.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EC25Ak02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EC25Ak02.html</a><br><br><strong>Iran's neutrality on the line</strong><br>By Hooman Peimani<br><br>Iranian government spokesperson Abdullah Ramezanzadeh has condemned the American war on Iraq as "illegitimate" and "unjustifiable" and reiterated Iran's neutrality in the war. He has also demanded that both Iraq and the United States respect Iran's neutrality. However, Iran might find it increasingly difficult to remain idle when regional (Turkey) and non-regional (United States and United Kingdom) states are seeking to achieve long-term objectives in Iraq with potentially dire consequences for the Iranians.<br><br>Ramezanzadeh deplored the American government's initiating the war despite the international community's opposition, which he predicted to have grim consequences for Iraq, the Persian Gulf region, the Middle East and the entire world. In his address on the occasion of the Iranian new year (Nouroz) on Friday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami stressed Ramezanzadeh's points as he stated, "We have opposed this move from the outset and today we again clearly condemn this military attack ... this military attack, apart from the destructive damage which it has for the oppressed Iraqi people, is dangerous for the whole region and the world." Despite its intention, though, Iran could be dragged into the American war on Iraq. Intentional, and more likely, unintentional military attacks on Iranian territory could push Iran into the war. On Saturday, an American cruise missile, presumably aimed at the Iraqi port of Basra, missed its target and hit the nearby Iranian port of Abadan. The Iranian government filed a protest for the incident in which two Iranians were killed. On the same day, the head of the legal affairs bureau of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mohammad Danesh-Yazdi, handed over his government's protest to the British and Swiss embassies in Tehran for the violation of its airspace by American and British aircraft. The Swiss embassy takes care of American interests in the absence of an American embassy in Iran. The continuation of such military incidents may well force Iran to take retaliatory action, a recipe for an unwanted involvement in the war.<br><br>The entry into Iran of Iraqi military personnel to seek shelter or to use that country for their attacks on the American and British forces could also provoke the latter's attack on Iran, which would drag it into the conflict against its will. To prevent that scenario, Ramezanzadeh stated that Iran had decided to seal off its borders to prevent any "illegal infiltration to its soil by Iraqi nationals", that is, Iraqi military personnel. Yet he announced Iran's readiness to help Iraqi refugees fleeing war-affected areas. As mentioned last week in Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's appeal to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan for refugee relief assistance, "a growing number of Iraqi refugees" has been entering Iran.<br><br>Iran could more likely be dragged into the war as a result of an Iranian military intervention in that country in reaction to Turkey's move to achieve its strategic interests that could have an unacceptable impact on the regional balance of power. In particular, Turkey's determination to deploy a large military force in Iraq's Kurdish region now sanctioned by its parliament and/or its efforts to annex or control oil-rich Kirkuk and Mosul to which the Turks have territorial claims since the Ottoman Empire's disintegration could trigger an Iranian reaction. Turkey already has a few thousand military personnel in that region who control a 30 kilometer-wide "security zone" along the Iraqi side of the border, while amassing its troops estimated at 20,000 to 40,000 along its border with Iraq for a future massive deployment.<br><br>This situation also alarms the Iraqi Kurds who are on good terms with Iran. Last month, Massoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), one of the two main Kurdish armed groups governing northern Iraq, said that the Kurds would resist "all further Turkish intrusions" into their territory. Nechirvan Barzani, the KDP's second in command, went beyond that statement to say, "The Turks must be made to understand that their presence [in Iraqi Kurdistan] will be disastrous both for us and for themselves." Moreover, Barham Saleh, prime minister under Jalal Talabani, the leader of the other main Kurdish group, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), clearly hinted at a possible Iranian intervention, apart from a Kurdish reaction, when he held, "[Turkish] military intervention would only complicate matters. If one neighbor gets into Iraq, the others will too, and it will be a mess."<br><br>Iran's intervention could take a direct military form if it fails to dissuade Turkey from pursuing its objectives through diplomacy and/or by its Iraqi Kurdish friends and Shi'ite proteges. Iran's ties with the KDP and the PUK have experienced ups and downs over the past two decades. Nevertheless, the two sides have had friendly ties during the past few years as reflected in their receiving assistance from the Iranian government, which has let them maintain offices in Iran. The Iranians will likely seek to halt any long-term Turkish gain in Iraq through those Kurdish groups, which share Iran's concerns about Turkey.<br><br>Towards that end, the mentioned groups could count on the Badr Brigade's cooperation, which is the military wing of the Iran-based and backed Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). This pro-Iranian Shi'ite military force is reportedly have about 10,000 well-armed and trained militias. Late in 2002, Iran brokered an agreement between the Badr Brigade and the PUK in whose territory along the Iranian western border the brigade has bases. The latter aims to ensure a significant share for the Iraqi Shi'ites accounting for 60 percent of the Iraqi population in any post-Saddam Hussein Iraqi government. The Americans have warned the Badr Brigade to refrain from any move to control Iraqi territories when the Iraqi government losses control over them. Given the SCIRI opposition to an American domination over or occupation of Iraq and its close ties with Iran, its military wing's control of parts of Iraq will increase Iran's influence in a post-Saddam era, a scenario that the Americans want to avoid.<br><br>In the case of the mentioned Iraqi forces' failure to prevent the Turks from pursuing their objectives in Iraq, the Iranians might be forced to intervene directly. As well, the Americans' repeated expression of concern about a sudden boost in the power and status of the Iraqi Shi'ites with a positive attitude towards Tehran and the American government's predictable efforts to prevent them from securing a large share of a future Iraqi government may well force Iran to involve itself directly in Iraq. Undoubtedly, this scenario, if comes true, will further worsen already tense Iranian-American relations and may well contribute to a military confrontation between the two sides.<br><br>Dr Hooman Peimani works as an independent consultant with international organizations in Geneva and does research in international relations.<br><br>(Â©2003 Asia Times Online Co, Ltd.

This interest has been one of the most stable aspects of Iran's technological development policy. However, despite Iran's repeated declarations that it is only interested in peaceful application of nuclear technology, the United States has accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons. It has also tried very hard in recent years to prevent other nations from assisting Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. opposition to Iran's nuclear program is to a large extent due to Iran's hostile relations with the U.S. and Israel. Israel, itself, has expressed a deep suspicion about Iran's nuclear motives and seems committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear capability.<br><br>In light of the military capabilities and the expressed opposition of United States and Israel, Iran's nuclear facilities are at risk. If Iran's nuclear program reaches a stage that can produce weapons grade material, either Israel or the United States might carry out a preemptive strike against its key facilities. Iran should not underestimate the likelihood of such an operation.<br><br>Since Iran's air defense at the present is not capable of intercepting and neutralizing such a strike, billion's of dollars worth of investment that have gone into its nuclear program could be destroyed overnight. Iranian policymakers might think of several options that Iran can adopt to reduce the risk of such an attack but as will be described below, none of them appear to be feasible under current international climate.<br><br>One option is to forge a strong political and military alliance with a powerful nation that can shield Iran's nuclear facilities against an air strike. Possible candidates are Russia, China, and to a lesser extent India and Pakistan. However, both, Russia and China have close commercial ties with the United States and cannot afford to anger the United States by supporting Iran. Russia is offering nuclear technology to Iran despite U.S. protest but it will not go as far as risking a military confrontation with the U.S. over Iran's nuclear program. The possibility of receiving protection from China is even less likely. The third and fourth candidates Pakistan and India are locked in a bloody conflict with each other and neither one can afford to annoy the United States.<br><br>A second option is to demonstrate a credible retaliatory power. This could include an array of unconventional weapons and an effective missile system that can deliver such weapons in large quantities to Israel and possibly the United States. However, both of these countries are closely monitoring Iran's missile technology and they are fast at work developing anti-missile weapons. Furthermore, if Iran resorts to such weapons in retaliation for an attack on its nuclear facilities, it could face a full-scale war with the U.S. and Israel in which it will be at a disadvantage. Hence the threat of retaliation is not a viable deterrence either.<br><br>The third option is to work towards improving Iran's relations with the United States. Improved U.S.-Iran relations will reduce the risk of a U.S. initiated strike but it will not necessarily deter Israel. Keep in mind that Israel destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor despite the latter's close relation with the United States in 1980s. Currently, Israel has a close military cooperation with Turkey. With access to Turkish airbases near Iran, Israel can attack Iran's nuclear facilities independently (or at least without any official coordination with the United States.)<br><br>If Iran goes a step further and adopts a more moderate policy towards Israel (similar to the current position of the Arab League, which calls for recognition of Israel in exchange for withdrawal from occupied territories), then the threat will be further reduced. However, A powerful faction of Iran's current Islamic regime is strongly opposed to rapprochement with the United States or adoption of a softer policy towards Israel. Hence this option does not seem to be feasible.<br><br>Since none of these options is feasible in the short-run, Iran must look to alternative strategies to safeguard its nuclear policy. One strategy is to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Agency. This requires full submission to surprise inspections of all nuclear facilities and acceptance of a highly intrusive inspection program by international monitoring teams. Under this option Iran might be allowed to continue its nuclear program because the inspections will ensure the international community that Iran is not using its nuclear technology for military purposes.<br><br>A second strategy, available to Iranian policy makers, is to significantly slow down the nuclear program such that Israel and the United States are convinced that there is no need for an immediate military strike. This strategy will give Iran breathing time until the current international climate changes or Iran's ability to defend its nuclear facilities improves. It appears that Iran has chosen the opposite option in recent months. Instead of slowing down it has accelerated its nuclear development program and has revealed to the world that it will soon achieve self-sufficiency in development of enriched nuclear materials. This announcement has lead to a sharp increase in U.S. expression of concern about Iran's nuclear intensions. Some U.S. experts have warned that it is only a matter of months before Iran can produce weapon's grade nuclear materials.<br><br>It must also be kept in mind that even if United States and Israel decide that for, strategic or diplomatic reasons, a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities is not appropriate, they might resort to other means to slow down the pace of Iran's nuclear program. One option that they might consider is to deprive Iran of access to any type of technology that might have an application in its nuclear program. This means the continuation and even intensification of the current economic sanctions. Since the lack of cooperation from Europe and Russia might reduce the effectiveness of this option, the U.S. might try to weaken Iran's economy by contributing to political instability. Iran is currently in the middle of a power struggle between the conservatives and reformists, which has created a dangerous climate. There is a growing concern that the current conditions could deteriorate into political violence and social unrest. Clandestine foreign intervention could increase the probability of such an undesirable outcome. Those who are opposed to Iran's nuclear program might facilitate such an outcome because it will be very difficult for a country that is involved in a violent political crisis to pursue a nuclear technology program in an efficient and speedy manner. The opponents might also try to weaken Iran by assisting the violent opposition groups and promoting movements for ethnic independence.<br><br>In conclusion, unless Iran is able to convince the world community and the United States in particular, that its nuclear program does not lead to the production of nuclear weapons, it should significantly slow down its nuclear program during the next few months. Otherwise, Iran must be prepared for a possible military strike against its nuclear facilities and many other measures that certain countries might take to stop its nuclear program.<br><br>About the author:<br><br>Nader Habibi works for an economic consulting firm in Philadelphia as a regional specialist for Persian Gulf.
