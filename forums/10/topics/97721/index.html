            <div class='col-md body'>original post damn stupid! aiyoh! please lah! u go to school a not har? so many inaccurate things ! u know what communism is? hahahaha....<br>i have lots of time to write long answer for u today<br><br><blockquote>1 . Protests and demonstrations are banned.<br>In singapore, after the Iraq war, police are quickly called up to round up the protesters outside U.S.A embassy </blockquote>1. u know public order is priority here right. even when protesting about foreign wars doesnt exactly have anything to do with singapore. other people protest in other countries...got any effect? bush still so ya-ya. all the reports, evidence, senate hearings on NO wmd, no saddam-al-aqeda link got change bush's mind, or blair's mind? or howard's mind. u got something to say..go to speakers corner lah! or apply permit to hold outdoor gathering, or just fork out money for indoor gathering with no permit required, or write here lor (but no more nonsense pls)<br><br><blockquote>2. Normal people have no say in the dealing of the affairs other then the government opposite of Swiss Referendum system<br>In singapore,laws and bills are passed , and without any opposition.<br>Nobody had a say </blockquote>2. what swiss referendum system?? what things you want to be involved in har? people elect leaders and leave them to pass laws..same here, same other places..at the most may have public feedback which they are not 100% obliged to accept. u think every single detail govt here and elsewhere consult people meh? people have the expertise? dream on lah!<br><br><blockquote>3. One Party Control , CCP in China controls everything from what they watch.<br>In Singapore, Media Corp and Media works are fully owned by Temasek Holdings, GIC</blockquote>3. ccp may have complete say on what chiense people watch on TV, but internet mean chinese people aloso got other sources. and please.... mediaworks owned by sph, sph listed on stock exchange...u go and buy shares and u can own part of sph oso. same goes for sia, dbs, sbs transit, singtel etc. many of these companies are 50-60% owned by govt only. u want other news, got cable tv, can watch cnn bcc, cnbc, bloomberg...u no money to subscribe cable, go to internet and read websites....u think singaporeans really isolated from rest of the world...thousands of foreign publications, newspaper, magazine around u know...go holland v mama store to buy lah!<br><br><blockquote>4. Political members like to put people in POWER , who they like...<br>in USSR and CCP.. Hu Jintao , Jiang and Deng were all good ol' communist comrades.. </blockquote>4. what is your point? political appointees quite common, ESPECIALLY in usa where clinton, bush oso appoint people clsoe to them. in fact current bush admin, many officers from his father's admin in early 90s oso. that's what bush jr. is said to have called on his papa's golf buddies and kaki to help.<br><br><blockquote>5. Centrally-owned enterprises.<br>Temasek owns SMRT,NTUC,SING TEL ,DBS, MEDIA CORP and SINGAPORE<br>TECHNOLOGIES ENGINEERING.. and many many many more </blockquote>5. aiyoh...it's state owned enterprises! u got take history a not har? damn stoopid! the govt may have majority stakes in many major companies, but they are NOT always "fully owned"...u want to own shares, go buy shares in these companies lor! i copy and paste now...same goes for sia, dbs, sbs transit, singtel etc. many of these companies are 50-60% owned by govt only.if u read paper ...temasek make billions oso wat..not like china soes lose billions ...u complain for wat.<br><br><blockquote>6. Abandonment of it's past culture<br>Last time,the Red Guards went to destroy all those old cultural relics<br>In Singapore, we are losing our own racial and religious culture..<br>all being mixed up to become..Singaporean culture </blockquote>6. culture is not controlled by govt lah! please! u think all those britney spears, chritisna aguillera and all that govt mandated meh? in fact foregn (i.e western) pop culture due to globalization is threatening to engulf our own. people encouraged to speak mandarin as preserving chinese culture, many old buildings now being preserved by ura oso..but small land size means govt must balance with housing, industry needs oso....got take human geography in school? this kind of thing oso can blame govt..u quite pathetic hor!<br><br><blockquote>7. Dear Leader is idolised and welcome by many</blockquote>7. the only dear leader i know is kim jung il of north korea. but what is your point?<br><br></div>
