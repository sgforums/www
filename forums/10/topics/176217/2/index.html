It cannot be described by such a simple word as PASSION.<br><br>Leading from the front personifies courage, honour, adversity in the face of death and much more. It can even determine the tide of battle. The battle of Kasserine Pass showed how much impact a rejuvenated Rommel meant to his badly demoralised Afrika Korps, comprehensively inflicting the first defeat on the overconfident Americans, who were expecting the Germans to be dispirited and 'easy meat' after being pushed by Monty all the way into Libya.<br><br>These cannot be encouraged by MONETARY INCENTIVES.<br><br>It cannot even be described in words.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in the middle east wars, the Israelis did. Generals were in the battlefields to lead. Ariel Sharon is one of them. In the begining of the Yom Kippur War, Israel almost lose the war. He played a big part in turning defeat to victory. Many of the war dead were officers.<br><br>If Singapore do not have credible generals and senior officers to lead in the front and  to boost the morale of  the troops, they will flee in disarray.</div>

I don't think many have the guts to do that. Look at the size of the army, can you count how many reluctant soldiers inside? If singapore were to go to war or being attacked do you think these reluctant soldiers can fight for Singapore?<br><br>I feel that most people serve the army because they still want to keep their singapore citizenship. If they really don't want to serve they can just give up singapore citizenship and go some where to carry on thier lives. This is freedom of choice.</div>
