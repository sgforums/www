            <div class='col-md body'>i've encountered a similar situation. there was once i was smoking outside jurong east mrt station in school uniform without my college collar pin. there was this dark complexion guy who approached me and asked fer $2.80. he said he just arrived sg from manila few days ago and needed some cash to take train home to pasir ris frm jurong east beacuse he left his wallet in his office. out of compassion, i gave him all that i had which was coincidentally $2.80. he thanked me politely and walked away. HOWEVER, while i was still smoking, it flashed thru my mind that it might be a fraud, so i searched for him. i hid behind the pillar near the GTM machine and monitored his actions. he wasn't buying the transit card at all instead he was roaming around. so i approached him, 'hey man, why aren't u going to the platform?'. and he replied, 'eh no, i forgot i need some more money to take bus home frm pasir ris interchange.' at that moment, i flared up and grabbed him by his collar cuz I DID NOT WANT TO GET CHEATED FOR MY KINDNESS.' i didn't wan him to cheat others especially the old folks. so i talked nicely to him and asked him to FK off from my sight. i WARNED him not to do that again.(though i know obviously he will do it again) -i guess i became his target cuz i was in sch uniform, as u know this kinda ppl like to target both young and elderly ppl. this incident happened 4mths ago only and similar cases were reported on the chinese papers at that point of time featuring local elder and foreigner cheats</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I met those guys before.<br><br>His first story was that he left his girl in the flat locked up and lost the keys. Thus, he needed 2 dollars to get a locksmith to break open the lock.  I was with my friend.  I just gave him the 2 dollars.<br><br>About 2 weeks later, I was walking with a friend and decided to sat under block 124.  He and another guy approached us.  Apparantly, he doesn't seem to recognize me because he told me the exact same story.  Before he could mentioned about the money part, I asked him in malay, "Bro, I would love to help ya.. but can u help me first?  I need 2 dollars, my little brother is sick." And the ass just shrugged and walked off, LOL<br><br>Oh yes, my dad has also met him.  My dad (an Eurasian, btw) was carrying alot of stuffs at that time. He  approached my dad and asked if he could speak english.  My dad said, "<strong>I don't know</strong>".  Then he asked if my dad could speak malay (he could, btw).  My dad just shooked his head.  The fucker in anger said in malay, "What a stupid man. Couldn't even speak english or malay."  And he didn't even realized how ironic he was.<br><br>Basically, you guys living in Yishun got to learn to avoid them.  I haven't seen them in a month already.  I believe they might already been caught by the police. I remember the guy having dark complexion, about 1.74cm tall, curly hair and wearing glasses.  Oh yeah.. his lines are very simple.  If a guy comes up to you and ask if you could speak english.. then talk to you, he's pretty much that same bastard.</div>
