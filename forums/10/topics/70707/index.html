            <div class='col-md body'>Like most ppl, once you have a strangehold on power, you will unlikely release your grip. The 1st generation of leadership in singapore under LKY were asked to give way to the younger, "scholarly" batch of leaders that we seen now. Some have done the moral thing and stepped aside once their time was up, others continue to cling to their positions.<br><br>This is the result of that power struggle. A nation of ppl too afraid to speak their mind. A new generation too fearful to be censured and incapable of independent thought. A land of sheep with a handful of nomadic herders.<br><br>And all this while, those in power conveniently claim that it is not the opposition who are weak, it is the ruiling party who are strong.<br><br>Clearly these ppl have dellusions of grandeur. Coupled with a "we know best mentality", can anyone really wonder why we "fail" to ask the right questions?</div>

Its not so much that they're dense, I think its more a case of the whole system being so entrenched with yes-men and sychopants who are in a position to advise them of the "mood" of the people that they willingly swallow what these yes-men tell them. It also helps that what these yes-men tell them is what they want to hear anyway.<br><br>One fine day,the people will be pushed to a point when they will be forced to push back.

Whenever that may be. But I believe we who desire change, are thus a minority, a country must operate for the benefit of the majority. True democracy translates into such a virtue.
