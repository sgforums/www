              <p>We know what the politicians want, what the government want, do you know what you want? you talk politics only after you have done all the pay and pay, feed family, houses, car.....or you are talking politics now because you have already done all the pay and pay, feed family, houses, car.....</p>
              <p>You can't change life! if there is a change needed that is deemed more important than the pay and pay, feed family, houses, car.....I bet you people will come out to make the changes...what we don't want to see is that people whose whole life purpose is to fullfill their own ideology. When you talk politics but not a politician? </p>

              <p>Since you put it like that, I guess I'll take democracy over the fascists any day! :)</p>
              <p>But seriously, we might have side-tracked this thread a little too much with the political slant.</p>
              <p>The gist of it is, if you move to another country, and you start being aware of daily life and it's challenges in your new surroundings, we all start to gripe.</p>
              <p>The key to being happy wherever you are is being able to accept that there'll always be some issues, be it with the govt or society, no matter where you live.</p>
              <p>Llife is too short to bitch and moan about our place in the world, so I personally try to focus on the good things around me and find joy in waking up everyday healthy and surrounded by friends and family.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Ditto - just encapsulates my point succinctly.</p>
              <p>Is life not being too short and your need to find joy in waking up everyday healthy that motivated you to up stick and relocate in the first place? If you had everything you craved under fascist rule, you wouldn't have moved in the first place, would you? (I am not for a moment suggesting you now have everything you desire where you are, but obviously it would make little sense to believe you had chosen to relocate if you didn't believe your lot would be better off.)</p>
              <p>After all, being happy isn't entirely independent of your environment, is it? As such, your environment isn't entirely independent of politics, is it?</p>
              <p>As you acknowledged yourself (granted neither is a utopian reality), if you were forced to choose between the two extremes of a totalitarian regime and a free-wheeling democracy, the choice seems a fairly obvious one.</p>

              Why so many Chinese people are willing to cover such a long distance to SG and work so hard as a worker in factory and restaurant waitress. Does an ordinary worker earn $2500 in SG?
              Speaking of living in HK,
              I would say the cost of living in Hongkong is higher than SG. The living place will be likely to be crowded.  The food is as expensive as in SG.

              <p>Do want to spend the rest of your life in debt with no safety net whatsoever should anything unfortunate happen? <span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you planning for your own financial safety or are you counting on the safety net in the hands of any governement?</span></p>
              <p>Do you want to spend the rest of your life couped up in a tiny pigeon hole which will never belong to you in the first place? <span style="color: #0000ff;">It all depends on how big a pigeon hole you can afford. Whether it belong to you depends on whether you have paid up the bill. any where got free house where I can emigrate?</span></p>
              <p>Would you like to be able to own and drive a car after retirement or do you want to be struggling with public transport chasing after buses and squeezing into overcrowded MRT trains when you are grey and frail and no longer fit and healthy? <span style="color: #0000ff;">When I retire, I don't have to travel in public transport during peak hours. When you are grey and frail, no longer fit and healthy, put yourself behind a car is putting a major risk to you and to the other road users.</span></p>
              <p>If your children abandon you in your old age and your CPF runs out, do you have a financial plan in place that will ensure that you can make ends meet and you can live out your final days with dignity? <span style="color: #0000ff;">Your financial plan is put in place before you are old and your CPF runs out. look at it the other way, when your financial plan doesn't work out, you still have your CPF. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your children abandon you, you already have no dignity liao. Will you be abandoning your parents when you emigrate?</span></p>
              <p>Even if you are reasonably well off today, how sure are you that the country you are living in will still be around in its present form in 20 years time? <span style="color: #0000ff;">How sure are you that the world will be around, how sure you are you that you will be alive in 20 years time? </span></p>
              <p>Do you think your offspring have a secure future, given the political unrest that is inherent in the region you live in?<span style="color: #0000ff;"> What is the use of a secured future for your offspring if they are likely to abandon you? Europe and the US are in deep financial difficulty, the middle east are in political instability, many parts of asia are experiencing natural calamity, where is the safe house are you looking for?</span></p>
              <p>If you pay taxes, do you prefer that these taxes are used to make the rich richer or would you prefer that your hard earned money be used to help those who are less fortunate than yourself? <span style="color: #0000ff;">At least I don't pay 50% of my hard earned money as tax to pay for the safety net of the older generation and hope that there are enough young people to pay tax when I am old. Don't use your spare money to help the less fortunate, sacrifice one holiday, spend less on your expensive hobby....to help the poor. Tax payment, giving money to your parents, even if they don't need them, is your duty and obligation.</span></p>
              <p>If you had the misfortune of having a baby born prematurely, would you be able to pay the bill? <span style="color: #0000ff;">Same question as if you have the misfortune of losing one hand or one leg, will you be able to live on? </span><br></p>
