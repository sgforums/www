              <p><br>Well, your present leaders may call us quitters and other nasty names - but if you can give me a few solid reasons why people are not generally coming back for good after they have left, I'll be willing to admit that our migration was for nought. No, at one point in 1987, then-PM LKY was speaking to the Straits Times as to why there is such a brain drain of young professionally qualified SGPns...where I was studying, the SGP_consulate was trying to attract SGP students back to SGP with a guaranty of a job in the PSC and a bond. A bond?!?! Well, I guess they went home empty handed.<br>And PM Lee decided that we were the quitters. <br>Some of my friends who are LTCs in the SAF, closing in on 45 yrs. of age, can hardly wait to get their pink i/c back - and their luggage is already packed, ready to sell off everything and leave - just like that. Why? They gave and they gave and they gave - but they get virtually nothing back, except two miserable crabs on their shoulders. They lamented - alamak - should have left after getting the second kit-kat bar! Just look at the number of ex-SAF officers retiring in Perth..You will be surprised even these defender of Spores are leaving in droves<br><br>Can you see? Even top ranked officers get frustrated after a while. We are creatures of freedom, we're not slaves. If you have gotten used to being a slave , then good on you - carry on singing majullah singapura. if you want to know what a real democracy is like, for gawd's sake, get out there and take a year to live in a foreign western country like Oz or NZ, or even the STates. You might just - surprise yourself. <br><br>not a stable argument - that richer people want to satisfy their higher needs.<br>Some of us who emigrated early in life realised the fututre of SGP was not going to be easy, some see it some don't. Some have parents who saved up some don't, that's something we either were blessed with parents who foresaw the future and shred their vision with us and some didn't get to share a vision with their family lvoed ones. And thats alright. For me and several of my siblings, we saw that we cannot possibly be able to save and live comfortably in SGP as it stands today. Living in a chicken 3 room coop - come on lah, you know that the unit you "buy" with your CPF isn't really yours right? WHen you pass on either you sell it through your lawyer or you pas it on to your benefactor - but after 99 years, it has to be returned to the PAP, regardless of what you did to upkeep the unit.<br><br>We left not because of fear of living in an HDB coop - but because ther is little leeway that the rulers here give us. They make laws and rules to keep the people confused, suppressed, oppressed and oblivious to a clear unabridged version of the whole truth. The politicians who voted themselves into Parliament are not dumb fools you know, although many of us easily write them off as a bunch of fascist idiots. No ., they're more cunning and devillishly smarter than anyone will ever give them credit for. And their game plan is succeeding We who saw this taking place in the 80's saw there was no way we'd be able to live like a democratic community. There's no such thing as democracy in a socialistic society like SGP. We didn't quit the system - the system didn't allow us to carry on living there, more like. The system is set up such that either you are paralyzed financially that you cannot budge or you're strapped in by a set of rules that don't allow you to be the best you can actually be. Fail your A levels and you're a failure FOREVER. No, not so in the "western countries" ; here in my new homeland, we have community colleges where adults can get student loans (interest free) and get their degrees while working part-time. Can! can be done. In SGP, fail once and you're doomed for life. <br>Its not all about getting ahead financially. There are other factors such as freedom of movement - have you ever considered - you must get an Exit Permit before you're allowed to trravel? This is a form of unwanted control. Sure restrict us before NS so we don't run away; but after we've paid our dues and they still want to keep track of us? WHat the heck, thats ridiculous. <br>Another one is freedom of the press. you cannot buy or read certain newspapers in SGP becsue it is deemed to be too democratic. The ISPs monitor your internet surfing. <br>Money don't come easy, not even in our new homelands. We still gotta work hard for it. But, the stress levels are not even a fraction of what you experience in SGP. the SGP gov't loves telling you folks what you should be doing with your lives - I mean , who the bloody hell are they to tell you how you should live? You pay and pay and pay till you die, and then they turn around and tell you how you should live in SGP? <br><br>Yeah, we are forced to leave because the system don't work, and it still doesn't believe it or not. And for you who stayed, sorry you didn;t get the vision of the future from the 80's into the here and now, you snoozed, you loose. thats the gist. <br><br>any where that you go to that has the absence of all that you despise about the way the SGP gov't behaves - is better than SGP.<br>NZ, Australia, Canada, USA, UK even Scandinavia any of these is better. <br>No money to leave, yeah tough tough tough! just bite the bullet, grin and bear it. Or migrate to Malaysia or Thailand. Only a train ride North of the causeway.<br>My technical stream teacher retired a few years back -and moved to Chiangmai, now helives like a king, and owns a bungalow by the lake - he has emigrated, and his student - (ha!) showed him the ropes of migration!<br><br>correct - the SGP gov't wants you to help their economy grow, but no, they will not stretch out to help You the contributor grow. So when you get into trouble, all they'll say is: Good luck! <br><br>But, if you cannot tahan the freedom you experience in a free country after you get there, then I'll say to you : good luck !</p>
              <p>- Work overseas because you can  and it's fun!Later, you may consider migration (or long term employment) because you feel<br>settled in.<br><br>- No matter what, Singaporeans who desire bigger houses and big cars etc will<br>always find a better deal in places like USA and Australia. Singapore will always<br>be resource constrained.</p>

              <p>Why so many Chinese people are willing to cover such a long
                              distance to SG and work so hard as a worker in factory and
                              restaurant waitress. Does an ordinary worker earn $2500 in
                              SG?<br> Speaking of living in HK,<br> I would say the cost of living in Hongkong is higher than SG. The
                              living place will be likely to be crowded. The food is as expensive
                              as in SG.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The office worker in China earns RMB 1500  ($300).  Top management gets the most RMB 6000-10000  ( div by 5 only $2000).</p>
              <p>Lower rank worker earns RMB 300 to 400  ( div by 5  $60 ).  A normal china guy only earns $60 a month.</p>
              <p>Now you know why they are coming like the bees to work in Singapore?</p>
              <p>The top earners can earn $10,000  ( x 5 = RMB 50,000 ).  How on earth they can earn so much back in China.   Even a normal pay of $2000 = RMB 10,000.    Any job in Singapore that pays them $1500 is 5 times their salary back in China.  If they save and send home $500 , it is still much more than a normal office worker pay in China (RMB 1500 = $300)</p>
              <p>But these people lament about everything in Singapore, from food , flats, quality of flour ( for making their dumplings) to pets keeping.  And they never bother to fit in or follow the norm of living style in Singapore.  I have damn bloody noisy China neighbours who bang their door and gate when going out. And talk loudly on their handphones while walking along the corridor near midnight. They got no eyes to see or observe how quiet the whole neighbourhood is .</p>

              <p>honestly, if you have no regret emigrating, how does it matter what the politicians call you?</p>
              <p>I used to spend a lot of money on stock and shares and found it didnt make any sense for me to continue, so I quit!! and put my money as down payment for a property, a commitment which required me to continue to pay and pay for many years. But today, I am very happy with the money I made. To quit was a right decision.</p>
              <p>tell us in what way you have made a right decision. No point telling us how sucks this place is, but you are suffering where you are now.</p>

And thats alright. For me and several of my siblings, we saw that we cannot possibly be able to save and live comfortably in SGP as it stands today. Living in a chicken 3 room coop - come on lah, you know that the unit you "buy" with your CPF isn't really yours right? WHen you pass on either you sell it through your lawyer or you pas it on to your benefactor - but after 99 years, it has to be returned to the PAP, regardless of what you did to upkeep the unit.<br><br>We left not because of fear of living in an HDB coop - but because ther is little leeway that the rulers here give us. They make laws and rules to keep the people confused, suppressed, oppressed and oblivious to a clear unabridged version of the whole truth. The politicians who voted themselves into Parliament are not dumb fools you know, although many of us easily write them off as a bunch of fascist idiots. No ., they're more cunning and devillishly smarter than anyone will ever give them credit for. And their game plan is succeeding We who saw this taking place in the 80's saw there was no way we'd be able to live like a democratic community. There's no such thing as democracy in a socialistic society like SGP. We didn't quit the system - the system didn't allow us to carry on living there, more like. The system is set up such that either you are paralyzed financially that you cannot budge or you're strapped in by a set of rules that don't allow you to be the best you can actually be. Fail your A levels and you're a failure FOREVER. No, not so in the "western countries" ; here in my new homeland, we have community colleges where adults can get student loans (interest free) and get their degrees while working part-time. Can! can be done. In SGP, fail once and you're doomed for life.<br>Its not all about getting ahead financially. There are other factors such as freedom of movement - have you ever considered - you must get an Exit Permit before you're allowed to trravel? This is a form of unwanted control. Sure restrict us before NS so we don't run away; but after we've paid our dues and they still want to keep track of us? WHat the heck, thats ridiculous.<br>Another one is freedom of the press. you cannot buy or read certain newspapers in SGP becsue it is deemed to be too democratic. The ISPs monitor your internet surfing.<br>Money don't come easy, not even in our new homelands. We still gotta work hard for it. But, the stress levels are not even a fraction of what you experience in SGP. the SGP gov't loves telling you folks what you should be doing with your lives - I mean , who the bloody hell are they to tell you how you should live? You pay and pay and pay till you die, and then they turn around and tell you how you should live in SGP?<br><br>Yeah, we are forced to leave because the system don't work, and it still doesn't believe it or not. And for you who stayed, sorry you didn;t get the vision of the future from the 80's into the here and now, you snoozed, you loose. thats the gist.<br><br>any where that you go to that has the absence of all that you despise about the way the SGP gov't behaves - is better than SGP.<br>NZ, Australia, Canada, USA, UK even Scandinavia any of these is better.<br>No money to leave, yeah tough tough tough! just bite the bullet, grin and bear it. Or migrate to Malaysia or Thailand. Only a train ride North of the causeway.<br>My technical stream teacher retired a few years back -and moved to Chiangmai, now helives like a king, and owns a bungalow by the lake - he has emigrated, and his student - (ha!) showed him the ropes of migration!<br><br>correct - the SGP gov't wants you to help their economy grow, but no, they will not stretch out to help You the contributor grow. So when you get into trouble, all they'll say is: Good luck!<br><br>But, if you cannot tahan the freedom you experience in a free country after you get there, then I'll say to you : good luck !</p>
              <p>- Work overseas because you can  and it's fun!Later, you may consider migration (or long term employment) because you feel<br>settled in.<br><br>- No matter what, Singaporeans who desire bigger houses and big cars etc will<br>always find a better deal in places like USA and Australia. Singapore will always<br>be resource constrained.</p>

              <p>majority people are not perfect humans in spore.if they knew what was in store for them back in 1970s and took steps to prevent it all.....spore would be different and a happy place.but it so seems that those malaysians and foreigners coming in see no connections to being in a country other than to work and buy a big house back in jb and home towns in malaysia or home country at cheaper pricing for their own nationals.</p>
              <p>those foreigners in spore who converted to singaporeans when they had a choice are definitely not the brightest of the foreigner cohort that came to spore to work. most ended up desperate and insane,if not driving a taxi with a PHD to numerous suicide cases in bedok reservoir to bottom of a void deck with entire family.</p>

              <p>to give an update... i am happily and well settled in HK</p>
              <p>i live in a pleasant area around happy valley. the neighbours are nice people. i get a great view of the HK harbour. i have my friends over to my place whenever i can if i'm not travelling..... i feel its such an energetic and "can-do" community here. people are generally enterprising with lotsa ideas.... the night life is vibrant.... shopping is like x1000 more fun, with better variety and service.... food is excellent, can get either the cheap or expensive..... there are some great off-shore islands you can go to during weekends., especially in summers. take a boat out... have some beers...... or alternatively, hike around some great walking trails in the hills and great nature environment....</p>
              <p>i still continue to travel a lot in this region.... i am all around in mainland china a lot... i go taipei every other month... i am regularly in seoul and tokyo as well....</p>
              <p>i just wanna repeat what i said in the begining about relocating, about getting away from SG, about living overseas...</p>
              <p>again i urge more SG'reans to do it !! actively seek out these opportunities yourselves.... and take the opportunity when you have it to go overseas...</p>
              <p>the experiences you gained is fantastic.... the exposure you get is wonderful.... the next available opportunities after you take the first step overseas will readily follow because the amount of opportunities and potential out there is so much greater.... the learnings you will get is more enriching in a bigger and more dynamic market!</p>

              <p>It is an individual choice as to where we stay and work.</p>
              <p>If you feel comfy in sg, you have to feed the 1% from your hard earned money from any policy they imposed.</p>
              <p>But, at the end of your life, it is your choice, dun blame your age, time, family, work and the government.</p>
              <p>You have to rethink the conditioning that you have underwent and whether it still served you well in the next 10 - 20 years in the global world village that we live in.</p>

              <div class="thread">the trend is to invest in a cemetary urn place in those modern urn 
              building.<br>Taiwan has people who buy and sell the urn place for a quick profit 
              and one urn's place is being "fried" until very high .  The Taiwan mafia has a 
              hand in it.  They are now going into the dead people's business that can also 
              bring them lotsa of money.<br>In Singapore, the Nirvana Memorium already have 
              some people doing this type of trade ( like stock market), they buy a row of 
              urn's place at the original price and then sell them high for a profit.  The guy 
              that was shown on TV doing that is the drum player of True Buddha School. He is 
              a malaysian and he is starting this type of "dead people" business in 
              Singapore.  Making use of the dead.  He is a malaysian so he doesn't feel guilty 
              of using the dead in Singapore to make his first pot of gold.<br> <br>This guy 
              only studied till High School in Malaysia and only working as a technician in 
              Singapore. Where did he get the sum of money to invest in a row of urns? He is 
              only 31, does he need a row of urns? He only buy for investment and i am not 
              surprised if he has a mountain behind him who gives him the money to fry the 
              value of the urns place high.  This True buddha School disciple name is Lam Yew 
              Sin, his brother Lam Yew Kin is a staff of Nirvana Memorium.  With his brother 
              working inside, Lam Yew Sin can get the best row of urns at the cheapest price, 
              then he sold them off at a very high price. We Singaporeans become 
              *****ers.<br>The Nirvana Memorium is actually owned by Taiwanese and i am not 
              surprised if the Taiwan mafia has a hand in it.<br>They are coming to Singapore 
              to spoil the market of Singaporeans " resting place for the death "and earning 
              high Singapore money, laughing all the way to the bank.<br>They know Singapore 
              is short of land and sooner or later, we all need a urn's place, so the 
              Taiwanese and the Malaysians start first in our country. Fried the urn's place 
              value high and it won't drop in the future.<br>We are being made use of by these 
              people from other countries.<br></div>

              <p><br>Many of our military equipment came from US or Britain. Do u think Spore can afford to build arms industry? Many local migrate to other countries is not suprising, with NS becoming a libility, who care if they can spec or officers during full-time NS,this country is like a transit point to a better country. If u free, go ask those PR if they want to give up their citizenship for a local citizenship. U might get a shock reply.</p>

              <p>we have military equipement made in US, Sweden, France...we also have our own military industry. for the size of Singapore, we are punching way above our weight. that should have nothing to do with those who want to migrate.</p>
              <p>We will still have Singaporeans who want to migrate for a better future, Singapore is a small country, can't offer many things that the big countries can provide...we wish them good luck,</p>

              <p>Those students failing their "O" level second language will automatically disqualify them from going to study at JC, their only choice is the poly. After these students graduate from the poly, many of them head to other countries to futher their university studies n many of the never came back. In fact, the govt is trying to encourage them to come back. The health ministry launched a scheme in which they will pay the uni fees for a local Sporean student studying in other countries, there is a condition attached, these students need to sign bond with the govt.</p>
