              hi coffeebreak, all the best!
              which heaven are u heading to, may i know?
              what are so good over there?
              
              I think there is no good place in the world. There are some demerits in any places.
              We just pick the BEST place in OVERALL suitable to you and your family.
              
              When we want to leave, we tend to look at the positive side of the intended place.
              when we want to stay, we tend to look at the beauty of SG.
              
              This is NOT the way in decision making.
              
              we need look at two sides of a coin.
              Look the good, as well as bad points.
              Then weigh the overall factors.
              Wish the Almighty bless u with wisdom to make a wise choice.
              
              2. Coffee break is one of 1,000 SG citizen leave SG for good in a year.
              is about 330 per one million citizen.
              so what is a big deal for some 3.3 million citizen?
              
              FYI, among 22 millions OZ, about 80,000 left Oz for good.
              Half of them are born in Oz.
              is for 80,000 , it is 3636 per million . If u take 40,000 over 22 million,
              it is 1818 per million.
              
              Also, new comers to Oz is about 150,000 a year.
              
              3. i leave it to u to draw conclusion for SG and Oz immigrants / emigrants  issue.
              
              
              
              .

              <p>after much consideration, i have decided to be the so-called "quitter" and leave singapore...</p>
              <p>anyway, in the last few years i have already spend very little time in SG... typically i am travelling about three weeks of the time every month in the last few years... and the more time i spend overseas, the less i feel the need to be rooted to singapore</p>
              <p>here in SG... cost of living is expensive, people are toiling so hard for so little, housing cost is astronomical, the public transport is crap but they are raising prices and calling themselves "world-class", and i feel crowded out of my own country....  </p>
              <p>there seem to be so little benefits and welfare being a singaporean that i'm wondering why i should stay around, and the recent elections have left me disillusioned that there will be any REAL change</p>
              <p>our market is so small that if your job or your career is just purely serving the local market, then basically it is boring, static, and its a dead end.... worst if you have your own local business, and you find yourself getting pushed out by an organization that is linked to your government and have all the unfair advantages that you don't have...</p>
              <p>in the last few years in my travels overseas, i am finding greater satisfaction, excitment and challenge in a much bigger, dynamic and entreprenuerial environment out there... i feel so much more liberated when i am outside singapore</p>
              <p>and so, i am quitting singapore.... i am taking up a job offer overseas. i will live in hong kong, and i will spend my time in north asia covering china, hong kong, macau, taiwan, korea and japan...</p>
              <p>it is unlikely that i will return in the short term, if at all except for the occassion holidays... i will still call singapore my "home", although its a home that i am feeling more and more detached from, and its a home where i feel less and less affliated to... so its "home" in the technical sense of the word, as in i am born here.... yeah, so local food is great, but hey, do you know you can find singapore food in most major asian cities now, and even beyond asia?</p>
              <p>to all young singaporeans, i wish to say.... take the chance and seize the opportunity to live and work overseas whenever you can.... you are only young once... i can tell you that the exposure, your outlook in life, and the new experiences that you gain will be priceless... you will be so much more enriched by your experiences compared with "stayers" who stayed behind </p>
              <p>our malaysian friends have been more mobile than us... many are working in singapore and elsewhere... the japanese, they are everywhere around the world... so are the chinese... of course, even within china which is so big, most people living and working in chinese cities are not from the cities... so in this sense, they have moved and relocated themselves as well....</p>
              <p>hence, you are not as in-mobile or as rooted as you think!  you can also take the leap of faith, and have the courage to change your lives and to live overseas...</p>
              <p>the apprehension that i felt initially, and therefore i took sometime to decide whether to leave, is really the fear of the unknown or the fear of leaving my comfort zone... the area that i'm familiar with.... the family, relative and friends here....</p>
              <p>i can tell you that many thousands of singaporeans have made the move overseas... some have brought their families along... some have left their families behind and are adjusting to a new way of interacting and meeting up with their family members.... just ask many hong kongers, who typically have this "global" set-up of having family members and relatives in hong kong, canada, australia, uk or usa...</p>
              <p>the world is a big place, but it is getting smaller and smaller if you know what i mean... there are many many people whom i have met who are so much more "global" than I am, in terms of their life experiences and outlook... they were born in one city, brought up in another, studied in another, and have worked and lived in a few others....  </p>
              <p>so, go if you can... leave singapore... grab your chances... you will meet so much more people, you will live out many interesting experiences, you will see a big and vibrant world, you will feel the different energy and the vibes of different cultures and languages.....</p>
              <p>its not all a bed of roses of course... you might get cheated by some locals, you might experience culture shock, you may feel homesick sometimes, you may long for the comfort of your bedroom back home, you may find that the food takes getting use to, you may find it expensive if you don't know where to look for bargains, you may find the market even more competitive and cut-throat.... but as i said, you will find the experience priceless and the learnings you get out of it will be invaluable...</p>

              <p>When we want to leave, we tend to look at the positive side of the intended place.<br>when we want to stay, we tend to look at the beauty of SG.</p>
              <p>This is <span>NOT</span> the way in decision making.</p>
              <p>we need look at two sides of a coin.<br>Look the good, as well as bad points.<br>Then weigh the overall factors.<br>Wish the Almighty bless u with wisdom to make a wise choice.</p>
              <p>2. Coffee break is one of 1,000 SG citizen leave SG for good in a year.<br>is about 330 per one million citizen.<br>so what is a big deal for some 3.3 million citizen?</p>
              <p><span>FYI</span>, among 22 millions OZ, about 80,000 left Oz for good.<br>Half of them are born in Oz.<br>is for 80,000 , it is 3636 per million . If u take 40,000 over 22 million,<br>it is 1818 per million.</p>
              <p>Also, new comers to Oz is about 150,000 a year.</p>

              <p>and i still maintain my belief and conviction from my first post on this topic... i urge all young SG'reans to take the challenge to go overseas to work.. don't stay rooted in a small pond in SG (and I am not refering to the "ponding" term invented by PUB)... challenge yourself, take on new experiences, get out of your comfort zone, be open minded to try new things and new environments... i can tell you that you will benefit a lot from your experience</p>

              <p>My HK friend migrated here 10 yrs ago, he now owns a 1700 sq. ft apartment facing bishan park, if he were in HK, he recog he would still be paying for a 1000 sq. ft apartment with his family of 6, including his parents. His parents now can walk down to a park and exercized every morning with trees and ponds, in HK they would have to take a xiu pa, the mini bus for 15 mins, before they can see a park with more than 10 trees.</p>
              <p>His salary is indeed less than that in HK.</p>
              <p>If you own the great apartment facing with a nice view facing victoria habour, I am sure you afford to own a house in telok blangah facing the cruise habour at vivo city, or a smaller apartment facing MBS, or a landed property in east coast or tampines, facing the sea.</p>
              <p>If an HDB flat in Singapore costs more than an apartment facing the sea in HK, I think singaporean can buy up the whole HK waterfront.</p>

              <p><br> hi lionnoisy.....</p>
              <p>you must have mistaken my post <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>firstly i am not in OZ.... I am in HK.... thanks anyway for your
              info on OZ</p>
              <p>secondly i am not talking about emigrating, or giving up your SG
              citizenship and all that... I was more refering to working
              overseas....</p>
              <p>and i still maintain my belief and conviction from my first post
              on this topic... i urge all young SG'reans to take the challenge to
              go overseas to work.. don't stay rooted in a small pond in SG (and
              I am not refering to the "ponding" term invented by PUB)...
              challenge yourself, take on new experiences, get out of your
              comfort zone, be open minded to try new things and new
              environments... i can tell you that you will benefit a lot from
              your experience</p>

              <p>taking a chance to work and live overseas is indeed a good advice.</p>

              <p><br> if you really like SG food so much, there are also many restaurants
              selling SG food in many different countries... i am currently in
              beijing on a business trip and i just ate at this SG restaurant
              last night for dinner.. recommended by one of my SG fren staying in
              beijing... i had hokkien mee <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>anyway... just as you enjoy SG food... there are also just as
              many good food in other countries so after a while, you may not
              even miss SG food that much anymore! Just go to HK and I can assure
              you that there are so much great food that you can find! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
