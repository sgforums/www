              <p>Many who went the JC also never come back after studying overseas, for many reasons, better job opportunities, like the lifestyle there, married local girls....but if they leave because they don't like singapore, then don't come back, it is ok.</p>
              <p>It is easier to endure the ignorance of foreigners who know little about local culture, then to persevere with the born in Singapore but hate the government, hate NS, hate second language, hate the weather......</p>
              <p>but make sure that they take the money given by the govt and keep their words, Break bond with the govt, or anybody is giving their credibility away for money, they deprive others of the scholarship, and reflect very badly on their parents.</p>

              <p>it depends on what you want for retirement. I have many relatives in Singapore and then travel in the region as and when they like. If you have a roof over your head, then you can take MRT, spend S$3.30 for a simple meal (S$2.50 for a ONE TON noodle, and S$0.8 for a soya bean drink). In Perth, min. A$12.00 for a meal without drink.</p>
              <p>When you are old, do you still need to drive to get around? in winter time, do you need to drive to yum cha with your old friends? here it is easy to take MRT and meet at china town and watch china girls.</p>
              <p>If I want a maid, it is still cheaper in singapore.</p>
              <p>Of course, play golf on public courses is cheaper in aussie, but if you are member of a country club here, you don't even need to pay anything, except for the monthly subscription.</p>
              <p>and dont' forget the medical fee, it is cheaper in aussie, or govt bears all the costs, but if I have the $, I don't have to worry.</p>

              <p>I am diehard for singapore, not for government, but in deciding where I would live . My children will decide for themselves where they want to live in the future. But for me and my wife, we have given up the idea of retiring overseas.</p>
              <p>Our plan today, is first to cover ourselves with sufficient insurance (hospitalization, critical illness, and endowment with maturity at staggered timing), while we still have a clean medical record. I do spread my investments over a wide porfolio. Got low risk profile, so more on long term investment. Take care and spend time with my family. That is about all I can do now.</p>
              <p>When I retire, I will want to travel around, while I still can, short trips when I am between 55 to 70. Then after that, it will be more at home........that is a long time from now, I may not live that long....hahahaha...</p>

              <p>I am diehard for singapore, not for government, but in
              deciding where I would live . My children will decide for
              themselves where they want to live in the future. But for me and my
              wife, we have given up the idea of retiring overseas.</p>
              <p>Our plan today, is first to cover ourselves with sufficient
              insurance (hospitalization, critical illness, and endowment with
              maturity at staggered timing), while we still have a clean medical
              record. I do spread my investments over a wide porfolio. Got low
              risk profile, so more on long term investment. Take care and spend
              time with my family. That is about all I can do now.</p>
              <p>When I retire, I will want to travel around, while I still can,
              short trips when I am between 55 to 70. Then after that, it will be
              more at home........that is a long time from now, I may not live
              that long....hahahaha...</p>

              <p>Yup I've heard that Aussie very expensive food if eat out....but their housing damn cheaper than SG leh....its good that u bring up that point about medical....do you think A$800k is enuff for a retiree of 55y age ?</p>

              <p>Is A$800 enough? you really have to ask those who live there. I understand that the cost of living in Perth is very much higher than in Sydney, and of course, depends on whether you live in the city or the suburb.</p>
              <p>yes their housing is cheap, but can you borrow from the bank there? I am not sure. I need only one house to live, so once the decision is made, no need to think about it, till you want to upgrade or downgrade. Food is something you need everyday.</p>
              <p>Imagine at 60 years old you have to cook, have to drive.....not much fun, that is my opinion, may be I am very spoiled....</p>

              <p>I played golf 3 times a week, playing course is cheap, playing in driving range is damn expensive. then the rest of the day spend in city walk walk, .....quite boring....fully agree. Wanted to try fishing but didn't want to invest too much on the equipment. The best experience is to take the train from perth all the way to sidney, then to melbourne, then drive around tasmania, enjoy the flea market on saturday, have a homemade english hot dog and a beer....that is a travelling experience, not a retirement life.</p>
