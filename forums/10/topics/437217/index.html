              <p>after much consideration, i have decided to be the so-called "quitter" and leave singapore...</p>
              <p>anyway, in the last few years i have already spend very little time in SG... typically i am travelling about three weeks of the time every month in the last few years... and the more time i spend overseas, the less i feel the need to be rooted to singapore</p>
              <p>here in SG... cost of living is expensive, people are toiling so hard for so little, housing cost is astronomical, the public transport is crap but they are raising prices and calling themselves "world-class", and i feel crowded out of my own country....  </p>
              <p>there seem to be so little benefits and welfare being a singaporean that i'm wondering why i should stay around, and the recent elections have left me disillusioned that there will be any REAL change</p>
              <p>our market is so small that if your job or your career is just purely serving the local market, then basically it is boring, static, and its a dead end.... worst if you have your own local business, and you find yourself getting pushed out by an organization that is linked to your government and have all the unfair advantages that you don't have...</p>
              <p>in the last few years in my travels overseas, i am finding greater satisfaction, excitment and challenge in a much bigger, dynamic and entreprenuerial environment out there... i feel so much more liberated when i am outside singapore</p>
              <p>and so, i am quitting singapore.... i am taking up a job offer overseas. i will live in hong kong, and i will spend my time in north asia covering china, hong kong, macau, taiwan, korea and japan...</p>
              <p>it is unlikely that i will return in the short term, if at all except for the occassion holidays... i will still call singapore my "home", although its a home that i am feeling more and more detached from, and its a home where i feel less and less affliated to... so its "home" in the technical sense of the word, as in i am born here.... yeah, so local food is great, but hey, do you know you can find singapore food in most major asian cities now, and even beyond asia?</p>
              <p>to all young singaporeans, i wish to say.... take the chance and seize the opportunity to live and work overseas whenever you can.... you are only young once... i can tell you that the exposure, your outlook in life, and the new experiences that you gain will be priceless... you will be so much more enriched by your experiences compared with "stayers" who stayed behind </p>
              <p>our malaysian friends have been more mobile than us... many are working in singapore and elsewhere... the japanese, they are everywhere around the world... so are the chinese... of course, even within china which is so big, most people living and working in chinese cities are not from the cities... so in this sense, they have moved and relocated themselves as well....</p>
              <p>hence, you are not as in-mobile or as rooted as you think!  you can also take the leap of faith, and have the courage to change your lives and to live overseas...</p>
              <p>the apprehension that i felt initially, and therefore i took sometime to decide whether to leave, is really the fear of the unknown or the fear of leaving my comfort zone... the area that i'm familiar with.... the family, relative and friends here....</p>
              <p>i can tell you that many thousands of singaporeans have made the move overseas... some have brought their families along... some have left their families behind and are adjusting to a new way of interacting and meeting up with their family members.... just ask many hong kongers, who typically have this "global" set-up of having family members and relatives in hong kong, canada, australia, uk or usa...</p>
              <p>the world is a big place, but it is getting smaller and smaller if you know what i mean... there are many many people whom i have met who are so much more "global" than I am, in terms of their life experiences and outlook... they were born in one city, brought up in another, studied in another, and have worked and lived in a few others....  </p>
              <p>so, go if you can... leave singapore... grab your chances... you will meet so much more people, you will live out many interesting experiences, you will see a big and vibrant world, you will feel the different energy and the vibes of different cultures and languages.....</p>
              <p>its not all a bed of roses of course... you might get cheated by some locals, you might experience culture shock, you may feel homesick sometimes, you may long for the comfort of your bedroom back home, you may find that the food takes getting use to, you may find it expensive if you don't know where to look for bargains, you may find the market even more competitive and cut-throat.... but as i said, you will find the experience priceless and the learnings you get out of it will be invaluable...</p>

              <p>why so many people add GCT's word into your vocab? a person who quit Singapore may leave singapore but retain everything he has here, he may also migrate and don't call himselves singaporean, he may end his life on earth....</p>
              <p>interesting, you are not going to the traditional paradize like the america, canada or oz, but north asia.</p>
              <p>If you have been travelling to the cities in north asia, you should be aware that property prices in HK, Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul are more expensive than in Singapore, let alone Tokyo.</p>
              <p>There should be little cultural shock if you speak the local language and read their newspapers.</p>
              <p>Singapore is small so we need to travel overseas for business, you should not be surprised that people in north asia also travel extensively for business even within China or Japan. The only difference is where you call BASE.</p>
              <p>But the japanese will not become Chinese citizens, and the chinese will move in great numbers before chinese new year back to their villages and town, for reunion....these people know where they call HOME. The Malaysian Chinese are moving everywhere in search of a place where they can call home, for obvious reasons, if you feel the same in singapore, then I say you leave.</p>
              <p>Except for your frustration in the singapore politics, I dont' see much in your encouragement for migrating...the world is vibrant, full of great opportunities...we know that. What exist in the many countries are no secret or mystery if you care to find out, you can chose where you want to go,</p>
              <p>so the leap of faith is not about the faith in the new place, it is the faith in yourself.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am also like you. I travel a lot in my work. Although most of my work covers Cambodia, I also travel to Saigon, Dong Nai and Hanoi in Vietnam and Beijing and Houzhou in China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with you that there's a lot you can see overseas. It can get exciting but for me aftger some time, it becomes common and usual. I think you want to leave because of the Economical and Political problems in Singapore. But no matter what we say, we are always Singaporean at heart - the food we eat, the singlish culture, our say no die attitude, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you feel that living overseas is the place to be, so be it. But for me I miss home because my gf, friends and family are back home. I always feel some responsibility of taking care of my parents. They are now old and I want to be there for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next month, i am taking the opportunity to ask for my old position back. You see, I have the choice to travel abroad or to based locally, I took the latter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You say Australia is very gud. But there is two sides to a coin. I hear a lot of racial biasness particularly from our famous forumer, Hitman. I also have faced some racial abuse in Australia. As an asian student, I have been robbed in the Melb train before. I even experienced a half naked australian man drunked, one day came and sat next to me and my indian msian friend in the train - calling us yellow shit and black shit racist insults. My friend who thought he was happy when he got his PR in Aust, only to be disappointed when he found employment with a very abusive and racist lady Ang Moh boss. He quit after 3 months and is now back in Sg, comtemplating what he should do next.</p>

              <p>thanks for the advice, sgdiehard :)</p>
              <p>i guess in today's world, our search for happiness and sucess or whatever, has taken many people to many places away from their homes....</p>
              <p>its ture that today, many people already travel a lot for their work just like me... but its also true that to travel for your work versus to relocate entirely your base or your home for your work are two very different decisions.... </p>
              <p>i hope that more and more young singaporeans also have that sense of adventure and sense of challenge in them to make the second decision, that is to relocate out of singapore...</p>
              <p>sure everywhere has its good and bad.... and some places are not cheap as well... but i hope that many more people will cast aside their worries and fears of uncertainties and take the opportunity to live a new experience outside of sg</p>

              <p>hi lobo</p>
              <p>sorry to hear that it did not work out for your friend in oz.....</p>
              <p>for me i have also travelled to oz, but its not a place that i will migrate...</p>
              <p>sgdiehard mention that he was surprise i did not choose the traditional havens like oz, us or canada, etc...  but for me, these places have very mature markets so they don't grow very much and opportunities may be limited.. plus its not an asian majority place, so minorities like us will always have to work doubly hard to prove ourselves.. thats a fact of life there i guess...</p>
              <p>for me, i am still young so i wish to be base in asia for now where most of the growth, potential and opportunities are...</p>
              <p>anyway, what i'm trying to say its that even though i encourage people to leave and to go... only you yourself will truely know which places are more suitable for you and which places you know you will probably have trouble adapting to... its much like your personal preferences</p>
              <p>as for missing your gf, family and friends back home and taking care of your parents... those are indeed the hardest decisions when it comes to deciding whether to stay or to leave...</p>
              <p>i know many have stayed as a result of that... but on the other hand, i also know that many have left and made all sorts of alternative arrangements.. like bringing gf or family along, or travelling back and forth on weekends or on holidays or whatever... i guess there is no one solution, its how each manage and adapt</p>

              <p>Not wrong for sure.</p>
              <p>You like your coffee. perhaps without you noticing the coffee is changing a bit by bit by bit and you do not notice it as its a small change and you are conditioned not to notice it. Even if you notice then the mind makes an excuse and it become part of 'normal'.</p>
              <p>Racism will exist as long as humans are around simply because they do not like themselves and project it to others. If it's same in both places it does not give a reason to stay in Sg especially when perks are more in AUS.</p>
              <p>Yes a looser bound to be a looser will be. However if in one place it is conditioned to be a looser for others to gain then it's a stark difference.This guy coffee wants to make a change in life and is trying. I appreciate that fact.</p>

              <p>Not wrong for sure.</p>
              <p>You like your coffee. perhaps without you noticing the coffee is changing a bit by bit by bit and you do not notice it as its a small change and you are conditioned not to notice it. Even if you notice then the mind makes an excuse and it become part of 'normal'.</p>
              <p>Racism will exist as long as humans are around simply because they do not like themselves and project it to others. If it's same in both places it does not give a reason to stay in Sg especially when perks are more in AUS.</p>
              <p>Yes a looser bound to be a looser will be. However if in one place it is conditioned to be a looser for others to gain then it's a stark difference.This guy coffee wants to make a change in life and is trying. I appreciate that fact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you think is entirely up to you. I have just seen the 2 sides he spoke about :)</p>

              <p>Well, I respect person who choose to leave, and people who choose to stay. I am still looking for a reason why I should leave and where I should go. Coffeebreak hasn't said anything I don't know. So  it is just an individual choice to make.</p>
              <p>If he is going north Asia, it shows there are more in China, HK, Korea...than the perks in AUS. If racism exists everywhere, just make sure you are not being discriminated against for your skin colour wherever you go, and be a good man, don't discriminate others.</p>
              <p>Contrary to what you said, the more I drink coffee, the more I am aware of the differences in the different types of coffee, the acidity, the bitterness, the aroma...unless you have a taste bud problem, you will notice such difference if you are a coffee drinker, BUT you may not want to acknowledge the difference because of your own personal prejudice. it is normal for people to have prejudice, and people are entitled to have prejudice but a prejudice is a prejudice....</p>
              <p>I still prefer the kopi O prepared in the traditional way. When you think you have advanced to starbuck coffee, you must realize it doesn't come with kaya roti with half boil eggs anymore. You win some, you lose some. that is life.</p>
