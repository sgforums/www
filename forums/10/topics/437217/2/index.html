              <p>aiyo...of course they don't give out citizenship lah...but then hor, so many china women come to HK to give birth and then authomatic become citizens, you never see the local complain about how local women need to q up to give birth, the big and expensive private hospitals also kenna occupied by many rich china woman.</p>
              <p>you come back to sg to fight for the low and middle level job only huhh? that honestly we give to the FT because they are cheaper. What I cannot tahan here is the high end jobs also go to the FT.  If you can do low end or middle level job overseas and feel first class, i guess you have found the right place. </p>

              and sat next to me and my indian msian friend in the train -

              disappointed when he found employment with a very abusive and

              <p>The general term is discrimination. Racist is discrimination due to difference in skin colour.</p>
              <p>Beijing residents look down on the poorer, or less educated people, they don't discriminate them.</p>
              <p>Can't say much about the indian in their caste system.  </p>

              <p>My 2 cents worth...</p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean working in USA, experiencing a different lifestyle than what we have back home. It has been a good experience relocating, because I am able to better appreciate some aspects of Singapore, and to also better 'appreciate' that some statistics our Govt likes to sell are true nonsense (eg, credit themselves for a good economic year, and blame the world for .</p>
              <p>Granted, that I am an anti-PAP supporter (for the very exact fact that I think our leaders are the pigs in Animal Farm, rewarding themselves many times over, while attempting to hide the pains of the ordinary folks under the rug), but I am pro-Singapore. I especially hate it when our leaders tell our people that we are stupid, thus they need more foreigners. I have seen so many Singaporeans over here in USA, and we are all holding really high positions in the organizations we work for. All over, I hear people here saying that Singapore is a nice and beautiful city, and my heart swells with pride.</p>
              <p>I especially think that we should drop the silly term "quitters", because people who DARE to venture overseas do have a certain amount of guts and intelligence. As the world begins to learn how to protect its own citizens (except for our very own country, and certain other Asian countries like China), one will find it more and more difficult to venture overseas. Thus, those who do make it overseas really do possess certain skills that allow them to move across borders.</p>
              <p>I also find the fear of "racial discrimination" irrational. We encounter discrimination EVERYWHERE, and racial discrimination is but only a small little part of them. We encounter sales people who look at our dressing and discriminate against us. We encounter waiters that look at what we order at a restaurant and discriminate against us. In SG, we are discriminated for being locals (look at our leaders calling us daft and slow, look at how employers tend to discriminate against males who need to serve reservist). Therefore, I find discrimination a normal part of life. To fear against discrimination is akin to the fear of living life itself.</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to the topic. To leave or not to leave is really one's individual choice, as what sgdiehard said. You decide your own fate, and decide on the risks you want to take. I took the risk of relocating to USA, and have never looked back since. However, it has also made me more appreciative of the relative safety of our little home in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Granted, that the standard of living here is good, for I get to drive a sports coupe, own a landed property, and have groceries that are way cheaper here than in Singapore (Who can claim to eat snow crabs and lobster on a regular basis back in SG?), drive to different parts of the USA where the natural landscape is so beautiful (I have a huge waterfall 20 mins away, several lakes and reserviors, and the clean ocean is 3 hours away) , but the public transportation here is crap, and the roads we drive on are breaking apart (USA is in huge debt). I hear murders on a regular basis (turn the pages in the local newspaper, and one finds killings on a daily basis), and our property here is protected by a security device.</p>
              <p>However, I don't regret coming out here, because I get to experience a different life, learn how to appreciate life better, experience different natural dangers (hurricane Irene, earthquake in DC), and become a better person overall.</p>
              <p>AND, I do appreciate Singapore better. Just NOT our leaders <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm in the same boat as soul_rage, having been living in the US for over 14 years now.</p>
              <p>Got married to a US citizen, so I might be here for awhile...but my wife just asked me yesterday if I ever regret not going back to SG after graduation and living the "normal" SG life.</p>
              <p>Not the slightest, since living overseas, in my opinion, really does broaden your perspective by allowing you to experience so much more. And this makes you an even better resource should you decided to go back to SG one day. This is why the PAP notion of "quitters" is so steroescopic, no long term perspective.</p>
              <p>Of course, we're all part of the global economy nowadays, so I'm not ruling out moving back to SG, or any other country for that matter, if better opportunties become available.</p>
              <p>It's just realizing that each city/country does have its own pros and cons, and choosing the right fit for your particular stage in life.</p>
              <p>For me, I'm still planning to retire in SG one day. Better medical care, and not having to drive everywhere to do stuff is a big plus when I'm old.</p>
              <p>BTW, I couldn't agree with soul_rage more on having to now deal with natural calamities that we didn't have to even think about in SG. I've now been through 3 hurricanes, experienced a 5.5 magnitdue earthquake, got stuck in a blizzard, went through a wild fire/drought...no floods yet, thank goodness...</p>

              <p>I know I'm going to catch some flak for saying this, but here's my<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> personal opinion</span> about US politics compared to SG politics.</p>
              <p>The basis of the US gov't is that it's a free democracy. However, that's the ideal situation, and reality is much more dissapointing as usual. You see, in the US, most politicians speak and act just to stay in office. It's all about self prevervation, so they don't make the decisions that are best for the country as a whole, but what is most advantageous to the electorate in their district. Therefore, there is no long term decision making either, just enough action to get voted into office in the next elections. Many laws that are signed into effect are hundreds, if not thousands of pages long, because they contain favourable earmarks for the respective policiticans that will sign the law.</p>
              <p>For example, if the person who created the law wants a policitican from Iowa to sign the bill, he will include a part where it gives farmers in Iowa some kind of subsidy. This is why the bills have so many pages, since so many politicians need to have something that benefits them before they will sign it. </p>
              <p>And then here are private companies that represent industry, that lobby politicians to sign or not to sign certain law by making campaign contributions to them during the next elections. Call it bribery if you will.</p>
              <p>SG in reality is also a free democracy, but seriously, the politicians aren't under the gun to keep the electorate happy. So, they can do what they please, which might be good or bad.</p>
              <p>Case in point, the recent hullaballo about the US going into possible default, and the debt ceiling needing to be raised. Well, Congress was mired in so much partisan bickering that we almost did go into default, but was saved by a BS short term plan which still got our bond rating downgraded.</p>
              <p>However, if a similar situation arose in SG, the PAP, with it's single-party system, just passes whatever law immediately without any internal bickering.</p>
              <p>Now, don't get me wrong, internal checks and balances in a 2 or more party system is required in a fair democracy. But nowadays, partisan politics has become childish to the point that no one belives in the US govt much anymore.</p>
              <p>So once again, pros and cons, even with the political system. The system is SG is coldly efficient, but the danger becomes that the policitics get too big-headed and arrogant, which appears to be the case nowadays. They are ruling like a polical elite class. I imagine if SG has the same electoral system as the US, where the MPs must live in their respective wards, they will be more careful in making decisions that affect their fellow residents. The US system gives you plenty of freedom, and I dare say sometimes too much of it. In the end, a democracy only works if the electorate are educated enough to make the right decisions when voting. This is, sadly, never the case.</p>
              <p>Most ppl agree that Obama hasn't been able to do anything the economy, although I'm glad he didn't get us mired in the war in Libya.</p>
              <p>See, if you live in any country long enough, you'll start complaining about the political system too! :)</p>
