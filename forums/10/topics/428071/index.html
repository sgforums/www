              <p>http://satayclub.net/2011/04/mah-bow-tan-rejects-debate-over-hdb-prices/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has rejected opposition 
              calls for a debate over the PAP’s public housing policy, insisting that 
              the ruling party has ‘nothing to hide’ and that its position is ‘well 
              known’.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Mah has come under intense fire from the opposition regarding the 
              spiralling cost of HDB flats. The Workers’ Party has called for housing 
              prices to be pegged to to the median rate of income, claiming that 
              housing has become unaffordable because the HDB instead pegs the prices 
              of flats to those in the open market. Mr Mah called the WP proposals 
              ‘irresponsible’.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Separately, National Solidarity Party leader Goh Meng Seng – who will
               be contesting the coming general election in Mr Mah’s Tampines GRC – 
              has challenged Mr Mah to a public debate on the issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Mah rejected the suggestion, saying that there was ‘no need for a 
              debate’. He insists that public housing is already affordable, and that 
              the HDB is operating at a loss. He says there is no way for the prices 
              of HDB flats to be brought down any further without implementing cuts in
               other areas, such as education and defence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WP leader Low Thia Khiang, who is MP for Hougang, replied that the 
              only reason why the HDB was operating at a loss was because it buys its 
              land from the Singapore Land Authority, a government statutory board. 
              Land accounts for a significant proportion of the costs involved in 
              building HDB flats, resulting in a situation that Mr Low called “taking 
              money from the left pocket and putting it in the right pocket”. He has 
              also challenged Mr Mah to reveal the exact cost of the land it has 
              purchased from the SLA, something which Mr Mah and the HDB have not been
               willing to do.</p>

              <p>Scenario1:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i once saw people on a sinking ship fulla holes in the middles of a huge ocean...fulla holes.no one wanted to repair it even though it was sinking....then some people founded some material to repair the holes on sinking ship.then some found a dinghyand floated it in the middle of the huge ocean.</p>
              <p>so some started patching up the ship with material and found it was difficult because they didnt have the right engneer or people with knowledge to fix it.then some decided to climb into the dinghy b4 the ship sinks.</p>
              <p>so the situation ended where one group of people climbed into a small dinghy in the middle of the ocean.the other stayed back on sinking ship scratching heads trying to know how to fix the holes on sinking ship with water gushing out of the many holes.</p>
              <p>results:people in dinghy were found 1 month later dried up like ikan bilis.</p>
              <p>sinking ship sank a bit at a time until there was no way get materials to fix the holes underwater.everyone died on it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>scenario 2:sinking ship had people and no one cared much n pretended ship would fix itself somehow...everyone died  as ship slowly sank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>captain of ship was dry n comfy all the while until he was on the roof top of his sinking ship a few metres from circling sharks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>solution:</p>
              <p>1)either u get experts to fix the holes on sinkin ship.</p>
              <p>2) build another brand new ship b4 old ship eventually sinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Singapore housing policy is a failure. These apts are inferior in quality at the price we are paying. The contractors are appointed and controlled by HDB and have no incentive to improve but monopolize the job.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the government continue to sell land price at high cost and giving a false impression of a good managed budget to justify their high salary.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I supported the BTO but at the rate it allows for supply, it becomes a lottery. HDB should allows all eligible applicants to be successful with the BTO and at price affortable at average income level similar to GDP.</p>
              <p>As a citizen, how many aspire to resell the house for a pte condo if HDB quality is equal if not better?</p>
              <p>I believe if we take a vote, none of us wish to profit from the sales of a HDB if we wish to upgrade.</p>
              <p>Plse stop selling our public houses to the foreigners. Taking them in is not a long term solution to our manpower shortage.</p>

              <p>I would say it is rather substantial.<br>No where near 65%, but if u add up the rest from the other parts of Tampines plus this "strong" part, MBT is almost guaranteed his team will win another round.</p>

              <p>Let me give you two clues.</p>
              <p><br>MBT "owns" Tampines East. The certain area of support is NOT from Tampines East. It is on the other side. And the reason behind it is quite obvious...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the most densely populated section of Tampines, where you can literally throw a stone from a building and hit the other. In no other section can you do that. The MP doing this place is NOT running again, he is stepping down this election. MBT will enjoy this section's support because LUP is not done extensively in this area (unlike other areas of Tampines), and is now in full swing...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Needless to say they will support MBT to get their LUP. Pity, because I felt the MP also from PAP, who "governed" this region of Tampines to be a very humble man.</p>
