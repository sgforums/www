              <div class="quote_from">@ â˜ƒ®: i am not disputing the origin of prata. in fact, i could care less where it came from, just like where chilli crab originated. that discussion is a minefield.</div>
              <p>what i am saying is in india, there is such a thing called prata, or paratha. if i have seen it in the local menu, have had it in india; so what is that less-than-angelic7030 talking about? small matter this is, but there are far too many people here who wrote here like they are the subject matter expert. i am not saying i am an expert in prata but since i had it there, her statement cannot be right.</p>
              <p>and in malaysia, it is not even called prata. it is called roti chanai.</p>
              <p>@stevenson101: `roti' is a malay word that means bread, as you know it. it is a general classification word for all kinds of bread. paratha on its own may not mean much in this part of the world so `roti' is added to imply that prata is a kind of bread.</p>

              <p><br>The Taiwanese "hum" should be awarded an Indian degree for its incompetence to relate itself with Indian cuisines in a thread that is all about - <strong>Indian engineer wants Singapore to recognize more “degrees”</strong></p>
              <p>From its first post on Page 1 - it has been nothing but to distract the thread with its petulant mischief in making irrelevant replies that it had admitted as a joke- which is the typical form across every thread.</p>
              <p>The "hum" must have been buggered each night at the Bar where it work daily, and will need to find some relevance in its otherwise irrelevant life - the only way that the "hum" can find its form of relevance is to be completely "irrelevant" as is its real Life.</p>

              <p><br>Of course you had eaten paratha in India as anyone would have eaten it daily in New Delhi, Mumbai, Madras, and Kolkatta.</p>
              <p>It is like "yu tiao" which had its origin in China, and was brought by the Chinese migrants that left China and is a staple food amongst the Chinese communities in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Paratha is an Indian staple food and is eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner as it is prepared in different forms - even as all have their origin as the simple plain Indian bread known as Paratha.</p>
              <p>The Paratha is a traditional Indian staple food with a history that is as old as the "yu tiao" is eaten in China.</p>
              <p>Only the idiocy and ignorance of an immigrant Taiwanese "hum" will want to interfere and create controversy to a simple dish that was brought into Singapore by the Indian immigrants, and assume that paratha does not exist in India.</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese "hum" should be given a Taiwanese Degree for Idiocy and Ignorance.</p>

              <p>Only the ignorant Taiwanese "hum" will want to continue to dispute that there is any difference between the paratha served in India with that served in Singapore - when it has no knowledge of eating any whether in India or in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Its dispute is over a word "Roti" used in Singapore as "Roti-Prata"  and the way that "prata" is spelled in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese "hum" does not realise that "paratha" is a "bread" in India, and the word "roti" is a Malay word for "bread" used in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The paratha and prata in India and Singapore - is identically eaten with the many varieties of accompanying dishes, which are part of the Indian heritage and tradition.</p>
              <p>Why will a Taiwanese "hum" want to interfere with its total ignorance on a subject that it will insist to intrude in ?</p>
              <p>While rojak and laksa maybe differently prepared and served in Singapore and the different towns in Malaysia - is there any marked differences in the ways that chicken rice is prepared in Singapore and Malaysia ?</p>
              <p>How many ways can the "Hainanese" white chicken be boiled, or served with either loose or ball rice ?</p>
              <p>How many ways can the brown chicken be fried or roasted to be served ?</p>
              <p>How many ways can the accompanying chilli sauce of pounded chilli and garlic be made ?</p>
              <p>What does a Taiwanese "hum" know about local cuisines when all it knows about Singapore is that there are more "Singapore bitches than beaches" ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a surprise that it will want to be desparately accepted to be amongst the many Singapore Bitches that it sees and wish to be ?</p>
