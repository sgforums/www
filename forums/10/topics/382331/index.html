              <p><strong>Written by our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>An Indian engineer working in Singapore by the name of Amitesh Basu has written to the Straits Times Forum today imploring the Singapore government to recognize more degrees from Indian institutes!</p>
              <p>In a short letter, he wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s words on emerging technical institutions in China and India and his mention of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in a speech (’Cambridge faces stiff competition’, Nov 7) make me wonder why these institutes with respectable global rankings do not appear on the list of institutions whose degrees are recognised for registration by the Professional Engineers Board of Singapore.</em></p>
              <p><em>his is despite the fact that several alumni of these institutes are faculty at Singapore’s technical institutes. The QS ranking, for example, places the IITs and four leading institutes in China ahead of all but four of the 14 Australian colleges and all but five of 47 British institutions on the Professional Engineers Board’s list.”</em></p>
              <p>A quick search on <a href="http://sg.linkedin.com/pub/amitesh-basu/6/9a8/3aa"><span style="color: #a91b33;">linkedin</span></a> reveals Mr Amitesh to be the Chief Civil / Structural Engineer at Foster Wheeler Asia Pacific. It is not known if he is a Singapore citizen or PR.</p>
              <p>Mr Amitesh completed his education at the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagupur) and the La Martiniere College in Lucknow.</p>
              <p>With due respect to Mr Amitesh, his position can be easily replaced by a local engineering graduate with good honors or master degree from either NUS or NTU.</p>
              <p>He can hardly be considered as a “foreign talent” whose skills are solely needed and missed by Singapore since its universities produce thousands of engineering graduates each year.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of engineers from India and China has helped depress the wages of local engineers. Some of them are actually assistant engineers taking on the roles of qualified engineers at a lower pay.</p>
              <p>The starting pay of engineering graduate is currently between $2,400 to $2,800 a month, about the same as ten years ago. However, the cost of living has increased by more than doubled.</p>
              <p>Inflation was at a record high of 6.7 per cent last year. The prices of HDB flats have also sky-rocketed especially that of resale flats.</p>
              <p>The exact number of Indians working in Singapore is not known. Most of them work in the engineering and information technology sectors, jobs which can be taken up by locals.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up some 36 per cent of Singapore’s 5-million population, up by almost 20 per cent compared to a decade ago.</p>
              <p>Despite rising unhappiness and resentment on the ground, the Singapore government is adamant that immigration is essential to boost the nation’s flagging birth rates.</p>
              <p>MM Lee Kuan Yew told Singaporeans off in no uncertain terms lately to “bear” with the tide of foreigners.</p>
              <p>A Singapore ethnic Indian was shocked to find that his daughter being a minority in a kindergarten run by an Indian charity.</p>
              <p>He is not alone. Many ethnic Chinese are also unhappy with the large numbers of “Ah Tiongs” or PRC Chinese who have flocked to Singapore to work and live.</p>
              <p>With no political pressure or impetus on the ruling party to rethink its liberal immigration policies, Singaporeans have no choice but to try to “re-integrate” themselves into the new Singapore society.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong mused publicly to the press if Singapore should allow immigration “enclaves” to emerge in its HDB heartland.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans may soon find themselves living in the midst of a little “Hubei” or “Chennai” in the not too distant future.</p>

A friend of mine even had a PhD in engineering from India....and it was a joke.....could not do simple design work......many engineers from India's are incompetent......he might have finish university......but does not know the concepts of engineering. I am sure the Professional Board has a reason for not recognizing the universities from India. They might have professors in the university from India..maybe they are cheap........or the government doesn't care about the standards of the engineering gradutes......that is the reason why they are foreigners..........even Singaporean who become foreigners just because they went to engineering school overseas....Indian engineers might be book smart.....not practical......It is sad that the education in India mass producers such engineers..............but the better one survive in US,UK , Australia and Canada.<br></p></div>
