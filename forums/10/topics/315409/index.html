              <p>... papers keep harping about the rise in number of cases, but have they queried why, how, and where this HFMD come from and WHAT's causing the rise in fections?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>======================================</p>
              <p><strong>527 cases in a day raise concerns over outbreak  <br></strong> <br>A SHARP rise in the number of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases, coupled with the reappearance of a deadly strain, is heightening concerns about the latest outbreak of the disease.</p>
              <p>On Monday alone, another 527 pre-schoolers came down with the childhood ailment characterised by ulcers, rashes and blisters.</p>
              <p>This could push this week's total way past the record 1,245 people who fell ill last week. That figure was itself a 25 per cent jump over the preceding week's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br>So far this year, 7,560 people, mainly those under 10, have been hit. Most had mild symptoms and got well in 10 days; 16 were hospitalised.</p>
              <p>One other thing is worrying: The re-emergence of the potentially deadly EV71 strain, which killed seven children here in the 2000/2001 outbreak. Back then, schools were shut down too.</p>
              <p>Checks show that this strain caused 19 per cent of this year's cases.</p>
              <p>This was what pushed the Health Ministry into closing three pre-schools and five childcare centres for 10 days, starting today.</p>
              <p>Another 12 centres were also asked to do the same voluntarily to break the transmission of the virus, which spreads through contact.</p>
              <p>Although Monday's 527 new infections represented just 1 per cent of the more than 50,000 children enrolled in 744 childcare centres, the authorities have lowered the threshold for closing schools.</p>
              <p>Schools will now be asked to close voluntarily if children continue to be infected after 15 days; if over the same period, more than 13 children are infected or if more than 18 per cent fall ill, a mandatory closure is ordered.</p>
              <p>Previously, when a school hit these figures, inspectors were sent to do a check before a closure was ordered.</p>
              <p>The pre-schools and childcare centres asked to close, either mandatorily or voluntarily, spent yesterday informing parents about the closure so they could make alternative child-minding plans.</p>
              <p>Most parents accepted the need for the closure even if it meant some inconvenience.</p>
              <p>Administrative manager Jeandy Tan, 40, who has a four-year-old son, said the closure would 'put our minds at ease'. But some parents, like administrative executive Valerie Kway, 30, were concerned about getting time off from work.</p>
              <p>A Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) spokesman said that parents without any form of social support could arrange with childcare centre staff for one-to-one care.</p>
              <p>Many of the centres The Straits Times spoke to said they would use the 10 days to disinfect their toys and thoroughly clean their premises. Some are hiring professional cleaners.</p>
              <p>MCYS Minister of State Yu-Foo Yee Shoon said surprise inspections of the childcare centres would be stepped up. She had just visited Kidsville Child Care &amp; Development Centre in Yishun Street 21, which has only had three HFMD cases this year.</p>
              <p>She added that there was just so much the childcare centres could do, and that parents had to be responsible about keeping their sick children at home.</p>
              <p>Her point was echoed by Mrs Shirley Tan, the principal of the Holy Trinity Kindergarten, who urged parents not to treat the 10-day closure of schools as a holiday and take their sick children out as this would defeat the purpose of closing centres.</p>
              <p>Mrs Yu-Foo added: 'The devil is in the daily practice of personal hygiene. If it is observed, I believe we will be able to break the spread of the disease.'<br> </p>

              <p>more than 1 0 0 0 . 0 0 cases of infected children in 1,  just 1 , that means satu, numero uno, yi tian, jit lit, is totally unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Now, who is responsible for the health care of the pore?</p>
              <p>1. Why so much dengue for so long and what is the status?  Who is responsible after so long?</p>
              <p>2. HFMD 1000 in 1 satu day.  In the pore. Who is responsible? HFMD is not new. so long problem already.  Tiny pore. Tiny dot.  1 tiny city that is a country.</p>
              <p>I like to ask the leader involved, what have you been finding out? What is The Solution?</p>
              <p>Tell us.</p>
              <p>many cases....many hospitals? medical cost$?</p>
              <p>hmm....</p>
              <p>the pore is no miser. top dollar paid. solution demanded. Excellence is basic requirement and criteria.</p>

Your wife has piles...the government must take responsibility. Your son has worms wriggling out of his anus...blame it on the foreign talent. Ever wondered why shit always happens to you? :)</p>
