            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from straits times forum.<br><br>RECENTLY, my parents tried to hire a maid for the family. The maid was new to the job, with no experience working here.<br>She had to sit for a written English test at the Ministry of Manpower, which she attempted nine times but failed.<br><br>She was then not allowed to work in Singapore and was sent back to Indonesia - just because she failed her test as she was unable to understand some words.<br><br>As a result, my parents had to go through all the trouble of selecting another maid.<br><br>What is the actual purpose of having tests like this? Is it not sufficient to just understand some simple words for conversation?<br><br>Is it really necessary for the maids to be able to read a lot of English words? So long as they are able to converse in English, why do they even need to read up that much?<br><br>When my parents interviewed her in English, she was able to understand them and was also able to show her understanding of English in her answers.<br><br>The only problem was that her ability to read English words was limited. And because of that, she failed her test.<br><br>Are maids here to work as maids or as clerks? They could slowly learn how to read while working for the family.<br><br>Another thing - if there is no language barrier between the family and the maid, why should the maid not be hired?<br><br>In our case, being a Malay family, we would have had no problems conversing with her in Malay or Bahasa Indonesia.<br><br>Jefferey Loh Ridwan Loh<br><br></div>
