              <p>Just watched the repeat telecast. Tharman and Josephine Teo brought up a lot of statistics about how they're helping the poor....it's such a different picture from the ground.</p>
              <p>Tharman says that 85% of the bottom 20% own their flats. Yes, the reason why they own their flats is because all their savings have gone into these housing and that's why we still see old old $600 a month cleaners and old aunties and uncles picking cardboards.</p>
              <p>JosephineTeo misses the point and says that 80% of the production operators in manufacturing are foreigners while 80% of managerial positions are singaporeans. If they were to remove foreigners, these foreign companies would move elsewhere. For fuck's sake, I think she completely missed the point. Nobody's asking for these unskilled or semi skilled workers to go, it's just that the managerial and professional positions....a lot are taken by pple from india, china and the phillippines. That's why there are so many unemployed PMETs.</p>
              <p>Josephine Teo also mentioned that unemployment rate is very low at 2.1%. Well, if the sampling for the stats are based on residents, which includes PRs, then how many jobs are actually created for Singaporeans? We could have had a lot of locals unemployed but the percentage is mitigated by many other new PRs getting the jobs. The negative thing about such public debates is that they can quote any kind of figure they want and god knows it it's true?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think of the opposition members, only the males are worth listening to. Chiam's wife......she seems to talk without substance and expects the govt to get things done. At one point, she seemed to be opinionless and struggled to opine something out of thin air.</p>
              <p>I really wished CSJ was on the show. Vincent, his replacement was pretty good though. He quoted the mas selamat incident, high ministerial salaries, said that PAP's productivity policy has failed etc. Good! He got balls!</p>
              <p>Anyway, it has come to the point where sgporeans will just vote any opposition. I hope the PAP gets a tight tight slap on their faces this time.</p>

              <p>We need foriengers in Spore, that I agreed.</p>
              <p>Especially foreigners set up their companies here and they need 100+ staff.</p>
              <p>When they set up their operation here in Spore, they will bring their pple over here too. Of course local staff must be recruited. Here gain, local manager will either recruit locals or go for foreigners (cheaper).</p>

              <p>It is easy to comment in hindsight.</p>
              <p>But, even if they are better prepared and the croonies are being thrashed during the debate, will the scene be telecast ?</p>
              <p>Or the debate is edited to show certain portion ?</p>

              <p>Opposition need to prepare , studied before taking this debate. Need to have solid proof.</p>
              <p>I kind of feel very pity on the opp esp chiam wife, look at the notes she is holding..crumpled,  Vincent is well prepared as you can see. WP also, he look calm and not nervious facing the paps.</p>
              <p>Yeah maybe is has been edited? Nobody's know.</p>

              <p>i think atobe mentioned this in TR; about tan howe liang's $100,000 medical bill. If got medifund, medishield and whatever medifark acting as safety nets, like what josephine teo claims, then why cases like this?</p>
              <p>I think for such debates, they should put time slots at 3-4 hours. I will glue my face to the screen the entirety.</p>
              <p>I'm most impressed with Vincent from SDP and Gerald from WP. Very systematic thinking. The Nazem from SDA sounds rather incoherent at times. Lina Chiam from SPP looks like she's bewildered...came to a point where Melissa Hyak had to ask what her party would do if they were govt. And she had to repeat the question three times in three different ways to her! Really bad impression but i hope people of PP will still vote her for husband's sake.</p>

              <p>Best opposition speaker for the show <br> 1) Vincent<br> 2) Gerald<br> 3) Lina<br> <br> I think Vincent helped boost SDP's credibility by a lot today in the show. <img class="inlineimg" title="Laughing" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/forums/hwz/smilies/laugh.gif;pv6fedd93166a15ba5" border="0" alt=""><br> I think he clearly expressed and lets the audience knows what SDP stands for. <br> <br> Gerald probably a bit too nervous but nonetheless expressed what WP stands for. <br> <br> Heard from others saying Lina works on the ground, probably. But if 
              you notice her speech, she looks more like an auntie going to a seminar 
              to learn more about the PAP.<br> <br> The PKMS guy, I really dunno what to say. Like some normal uncle sent in
               to represent PKMS. I have to presume what he is trying to express, and 
              sometimes he just blabbers off. Should have sent the young female 
              candidate they introduced that day. She is better in her speech.<br><br>Looking forward to the Mandarin version today... <img class="inlineimg" title="Laughing" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/forums/hwz/smilies/laugh.gif;pv6fedd93166a15ba5" border="0" alt=""></p>

              <p class="legend">Political parties' representatives debate on challenges facing Singapore. (CNA screenshot)</p>
              </div>
              <p>It was described as an "unedited", "uncut", "no holds barred" forum 
              that would, for the first time in more than 20 years, pit four 
              opposition parties' representatives against two <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Peoples+Action+Party&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz">People's Action Party</a> (PAP) members.</p>
              <p>But according to public reaction, some parties were clearly 
              unprepared for their big moment on television, while others took the 
              chance to shine.</p>
              <p>Present at the debate entitled "A <em> </em>Political Forum on Singapore's Future" that was aired on <em>Channel News Asia </em>on Saturday night were:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh Josephine Teo. Both are from the PAP.</li>
              <li>Lina Chiam, second vice-chairperson of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Peoples+Party&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz">Singapore People's Party</a> (SPP).</li>
              <li>Gerald Giam, assistant webmaster of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Workers+Party&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz">Workers' Party</a> (WP).</li>
              <li>Mohamed Nazem Suki, assistant secretary-general of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Democratic+Alliance&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz">Singapore Democratic Alliance</a> (SDA).</li>
              <li>Vincent Wijeysingha, assistant treasurer of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Democratic+Party&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz">Singapore Democratic Party</a> (SDP).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The hour-long debate, which focused on Singapore's long-term and 
              immediate challenges, touched on topics such as the rising cost of 
              living, housing costs and influx of foreign workers, as well as what 
              each party had to offer. It was moderated by TV presented Melissa Hyak.</p>
              <p>Based on the people Yahoo! Singapore spoke to, and judging by the 
              reaction online on platforms such as Twitter, the Workers' Party and 
              Singapore Democratic Party emerged with the most credit.</p>
              <p>Undergraduate Chew Rushan, 23, said she was "impressed" by 
              Wijeysingha -- the son of former long-time Raffles Institution 
              principal, Eugene -- who spoke "very clearly".</p>
              <p>"After the forum, I even went to check out more about Dr Vincent Wijeysingha and what he does," she said.</p>
              <p>Undergraduate Terence Lee, 24, also enjoyed the debate between Wijeysingha and Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.</p>
              <p>"They went at each other, they raised good points and counterpoints," he said.</p>
              <p>The two participants crossed swords over topics such as whether basic
               services should be free of GST and if the standard of living is as good
               as the government says it is.</p>
              <p>For instance, the minister said Singapore's median income is "much 
              higher than anywhere else in Asia, apart from Japan" and the lower-end 
              incomes and quality of life is "far higher than anywhere else in Asia".</p>
              <p>"Just do a walking around test and you'll know what I mean," he said.</p>
              <p>"No, I don't know what you mean," retorted Wijeysingha. "We walk 
              around every week and I'm not sure whether our neighbourhoods are as you
               say they area... We see quite a different picture to the picture you've
               been painting."</p>
              <p>WP's Giam, a former foreign services officer, also appeared to have won over some members of the public.</p>
              <p>Retiree Steven Lye, who is in his 70s, said Giam fared the best of all the candidates.</p>
              <p>"He was calm, very balanced and also very articulate and persuasive," he said, clearly impressed.</p>
              <p>Lye added, "Nazem represented the ordinary folks well on housing and 
              transport issues" while Wijeysingha had a "firm grasp of the issues and 
              made his points well". Chiam, however, was "too hesitant and not very 
              persuasive".</p>
              <p>During the course of the debate, Chiam required the moderator to 
              repeat a question to her several times before she responded. Others also
               felt the first-time candidate and wife of Potong Pasir incumbent Chiam 
              See Tong failed to impress.</p>
              <p>Microblogging platform Twitter lit up with people using the hashtag #sgCNAforum to discuss how each candidate performed.</p>
              <p><em>Wakkaismusing</em> tweeted, "am a tad disappointed with Lina Chiam… I fear for Potong Pasir."</p>
              <p>Another <em>seewhySEF </em>went further by tweeting, "No wonder they said it's unedited. They wanted to humiliate certain individuals."</p>
              <p>In an earlier interview with <em>Today </em>newspaper, Chiam said it was her first time in such a forum and she was "a bit nervous" initially.</p>
              <p><em>Totallyguan </em>also<em> </em>tweeted, "PAP needs a breakdown of
               their 'pretty' stats (statistics), SDA and SPP should have better 
              speakers who do their homework and CNA should reduce PAP's two rep 
              (representatives) to one."</p>
              <p>Summarising the debate, <em>thinkalexissg</em> tweeted, "PAP won hands down... but pretty good Gerald &amp; Vincent."</p>
              <p>However, those looking for a robust debate were left a little disappointed.</p>
              <p>Political observer and law lecturer Eugene Tan, who watched the forum, told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>,
               the reliance on a prepared text took away the cut-and-thrust of the 
              debate and the arguments from the PAP were "as expected, not new," 
              adding that the PAP participants were "not ruffled in any significant 
              way".</p>
              <p>The quality of the opposition participants "varied significantly," said Tan.</p>
              <p>The party that stood out for him was WP. When it come to the debate 
              on cost of living and foreign worker policy, Tan felt the party fared 
              best among the opposition parties.</p>
              <p>He said, by articulating their arguments in a dispassionate way, 
              "they left a relatively good impression of being fair and balanced".</p>
              <p>Others, however, were "active on criticism" but did not have clear or concrete suggestions.</p>
              <p>In the end, these were the main points the different parties made to the watching audience.</p>
              <p><strong>PAP</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>A team that is fair, proven, experienced and knows how to deal with crisis</li>
              <li>New leadership</li>

              <p>Just watched the repeat telecast. Tharman and Josephine Teo brought up a lot of statistics about how they're helping the poor....it's such a different picture from the ground.</p>
              <p>Tharman says that 85% of the bottom 20% own their flats. Yes, the reason why they own their flats is because all their savings have gone into these housing and that's why we still see old old $600 a month cleaners and old aunties and uncles picking cardboards.</p>
              <p>JosephineTeo misses the point and says that 80% of the production operators in manufacturing are foreigners while 80% of managerial positions are singaporeans. If they were to remove foreigners, these foreign companies would move elsewhere. For fuck's sake, I think she completely missed the point. Nobody's asking for these unskilled or semi skilled workers to go, it's just that the managerial and professional positions....a lot are taken by pple from india, china and the phillippines. That's why there are so many unemployed PMETs.</p>
              <p>Josephine Teo also mentioned that unemployment rate is very low at 2.1%. Well, if the sampling for the stats are based on residents, which includes PRs, then how many jobs are actually created for Singaporeans? We could have had a lot of locals unemployed but the percentage is mitigated by many other new PRs getting the jobs. The negative thing about such public debates is that they can quote any kind of figure they want and god knows it it's true?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think of the opposition members, only the males are worth listening to. Chiam's wife......she seems to talk without substance and expects the govt to get things done. At one point, she seemed to be opinionless and struggled to opine something out of thin air.</p>
              <p>I really wished CSJ was on the show. Vincent, his replacement was pretty good though. He quoted the mas selamat incident, high ministerial salaries, said that PAP's productivity policy has failed etc. Good! He got balls!</p>
              <p>Anyway, it has come to the point where sgporeans will just vote any opposition. I hope the PAP gets a tight tight slap on their faces this time.</p>

              <p>Did anyone catch the Political Debate on Ch 8 last night? Saw snippets of it and on first look, there wasn't any opposition that particularly impresses me.</p>
              <p>__________</p>
              <h2>The Long-term Challenges of Singapore</h2>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I am 
              Zeng Yeli. Every political party in Singapore has activated its election
               machinery, in anticipation of General Election any time. This will be a
               watershed General Election. The number of SMCs has increased while some
               GRCs have become smaller. Also, the number of seats in Parliament has 
              increased too. It is expected this General Election will be the most 
              intense one in 2 decades.</p>
              <p>That’s why MediaCorp took the opportunity to organise this political 
              forum to allow representatives from each political party to discuss the 
              long-term and short-term challenges facing Singapore. We hope this will 
              improve the electorate’s understanding of each political party’s policy 
              position. We have invited the ruling party (PAP) and 4 opposition 
              parties to send representatives to participate in this forum and debate 
              public policies face to face. However, the Singapore People’s Party 
              (SPP) decided at the last minute not to send any representative.</p>
              <p>Now, I will introduce the representatives of each political party. 
              The People’s Action Party (PAP) is represented by Minister in Prime 
              Minister’s Office Lim Swee Say and Member of Parliament Sam Tan. On the 
              Opposition, there is Sebastian Teo of the National Solidarity Party 
              (NSP), Alec Tok of the Reform Party (RP) and Koh Choong Yong of the 
              Workers’ Party (WP).</p>
              <p>According to rules of the forum, the ruling party PAP and the 
              Opposition each has 50% to express its stance on public policies. After 
              every representative has elaborated his stance, the next segment will be
               an unmoderated caucus for each representative to exchange views and 
              debate policies. As moderator, my role is to ensure each representative 
              will keep time quota and to keep the flow of debate on topic and civil. 
              As such, I will disrupt the discussion if necessary.</p>
              <p>The first segment of the forum is Singapore’s long-term challenges, 
              which include economic growth, education for the next generation, future
               healthcare needs of the population and upgrading of urban facilities in
               Singapore.</p>
              <p>Now I shall invite PAP representative Lim Swee Say to initiate the debate.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> Thank you, Yeli. Hi, everyone.</p>
              <p>Singapore today is an excellent country. Our country is prosperous 
              and stable, while Singaporeans have roofs over their heads and are 
              secure in their jobs. Such an outcome is neither God-given nor achieved 
              effortlessly. On the contrary, Singapore achieves this because the 
              people are united and industrious while the government has foresight and
               is able to administrate effectively. We achieve this together through 
              our hard work.</p>
              <p>Reflecting on our future, will Singapore of tomorrow be better than 
              the Singapore of today? This is the crux of the question for the coming 
              General Election. We believe the challenges we face in the journey of 
              nation-building will increase not only in numbers but also magnitude. 
              The range of challenge includes food and shelter to education, 
              healthcare, social development, economic growth and other aspects. On 
              top of overcoming these challenges, there will also be more inertia from
               the electorate in response to new public policies that are designed to 
              overcome the challenges faced by Singapore.</p>
              <p>In another words, the success of the past wasn’t achieved 
              effortlessly while it will be even harder to achieve success in the 
              future. That’s why the mentality of the PAP is one that has no room for 
              failure. We believe as long as the political environment of Singapore is
               stable while the people remains united and the Singapore government can
               administrate effectively, there is an insurance for Singaporeans 
              against the future.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you, Minister. Your time has just 
              lapsed. Now, it is time for the Opposition to respond. It is the turn of
               Sebastian Teo from the NSP. He also has 2 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> Thank you.</p>
              <p>What challenges Singapore faces is a very wide topic, but it is 
              definitely an area of concern for the People, so we must approach this 
              topic from the angle of the People.</p>
              <p>From various emerging phenomena, we know that some pockets of our 
              citizen army of the Singapore Armed Force are unsure what they are 
              fighting for, so wouldn’t it be timely for the government to examine the
               social cohesion and/or the sense of belonging in Singapore?</p>
              <p>If there are more and more highly educated Singaporeans becoming taxi
               drivers shouldn’t the government be re-evaluating its labour policies 
              and find the root of the problem?</p>
              <p>If the Singapore government pursues a GDP growth while ordinary 
              Singaporeans cannot share the fruits of this effort, shouldn’t we be 
              examining what’s wrong with the national economy?</p>
              <p>Also, despite contributing their youth to nation-building in the 60s 
              and 70s, the elderly today are not self-sufficient. They have to sell 
              their flats to raise money and implore their descendents to take care of
               them. They have no means to take care of themselves. Shouldn’t we 
              examine the structure of society and find out what exactly has gone 
              wrong in the challenge of aging population? Let’s take the opportunity 
              to raise the debate on the aging population to next level.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you, Mr Teo. Next in line will be Alec Tok of the Reform Party. He will also have 2 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> Thank you, Moderator. Hi Everyone, I am Alec Tok of the Reform Party.</p>
              <p>Although the RP only has a short history of 2-3 years, our members 
              are very concerned on the issues faced by Singapore. They have personal 
              and practical understanding of these issues. We also have views on the 
              challenges faced by Singapore. In short, we have to find a new 
              equilibrium in every aspect.</p>
              <p>The first aspect to consider is whether there is any balance in the 
              pursuit of economic growth. For example, Sebastian Teo of the NSP 
              touched on whether GDP growth will lead to the betterment of the country
               at large. During the last 10 years, no ordinary Singaporeans were the 
              beneficiaries of GDP growth. This is reflected by the statistics that 
              average real wage has grown by 1% in the last 10 years. As a whole, 
              Singapore has experienced growth but none of the benefits of growth have
               trickled down to ordinary Singaporeans. This is a very important 
              problem and I hope we can spend this evening to debate this issue. Which
               is more important – the improvement of Singapore or the improvement of 
              the People’s lives?</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you, Mr Tok. We now invite Koh Choong Yong of the Workers’ Party to speak. He also has 2 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> The Workers’ Party believes 
              the immediate challenges Singapore faces are: (1) whether GDP growth is 
              beneficial for the people; (2) how to cultivate and develop the next 
              generation; (3) the emerging social and healthcare needs of Singapore’s 
              aging population; and (4) whether social welfare net is adequate and 
              effective in catering to the underprivileged groups.</p>
              <p>We believe that benefits of GDP growth should be shared equally by 
              everyone and not a small class of Singaporeans. Citizens should have 
              priority to national resources, so they wouldn’t feel second-class in 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>On the economic front, we need to develop an entrepreneurial culture 
              and facilitate economic opportunities to develop a local class of 
              entrepreneurs, so that the national economy can evolve to the next 
              level. We can begin through education: (1) foster curiosity and an 
              interest in learning; (2) cultivate an attitude of endeavour and no fear
               towards failure; (3) move away from rote learning and rigid adherence 
              to the examination system.</p>
              <p>We believe the social safety net should be based on needs regardless 
              of income status, so that no Singaporean will fall through the net and 
              struggle for survival.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> You [Koh Choong Yong, WP] still have 30 more seconds.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> Then I will elaborate further 
              on GDP growth. The benefits of economic growth are not distributed 
              equitably. We understand that underprivileged groups need more 
              assistance than any other social classes.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you, Mr Koh. Every party has 
              expressed their stance. Now we have moved into the sub-segment of 
              unmoderated caucus. This sub-segment lasts for 7 minutes. Sam Tan of the
               PAP has yet to speak, so this segment shall be initiated by him.</p>
              <p><strong>Sam Tan [PAP]:</strong> Thank you, Yelin.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows that starting something is difficult and keeping it 
              going is even harder. The success that Singapore has achieved over the 
              past 50 years wasn’t achieved easily. It depended on government policies
               and support of the people. Precisely because the people and the 
              government complemented each other in Singapore’s development, that’s 
              why Singapore has transitioned itself from third word to first world. To
               even do a better job than we already had, we have set the bar very 
              high.</p>
              <p>This is why the Singapore government has initiated on many levels to 
              seek and evaluate new policy directions, so as to strengthen its support
               for Singaporeans. On the economic front, we have to develop high growth
               industries domestically and enter Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 
              many countries, so that our merchants have more economic opportunities.</p>
              <p>On the education front, we have to provide students with 
              opportunities to explore and tailor the education system to their 
              potential. The government has also initiated a set of public policies on
               healthcare, aging population and social development. However, the 
              Singapore government cannot work alone. It requires the cooperation of 
              the people for its policies to be effective.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Sam Tan, your time is up. Now everyone else can speak up freely.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> If the reality is indeed as portrayed
               by the PAP, then the GDP growth experienced so far would be equitable, 
              but this isn’t true. The rich-poor gap is one of Singapore’s key 
              pressure points and it is gradually widening as we speak. If a citizen 
              sees stellar economic growth rate in the national economy while the hole
               in his pocket is becoming bigger, why should he continue to support the
               policies of the Singapore government?</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you. The other representatives shall speak now.</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> I would like to touch on the 
              topic of aging population. The aging population is a serious problem, 
              but it didn’t begin yesterday. Based on demographic structure of the 
              population, this problem should have been recognised twenty to thirty 
              years ago. For the past twenty to thirty years, why hasn’t the Singapore
               government come out with anything concrete? If the government had 
              anticipated the issue of aging population earlier, there wouldn’t be 
              some pockets of the elderly population facing problems today.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> Sam Tan mentioned that 
              starting something is difficult and keeping it going is even harder. 
              However, he didn’t address whether the PAP approach for the past 50 
              years requires rethinking and injection of new ideas. The Singapore 
              Parliament has been dominated by one party for a very long time. Since 
              new challenges are increasingly complex, shouldn’t there be more 
              Opposition voices in Parliament to boost the diversity of ideas and 
              adopt a multi-faceted approach in Parliament to overcome these 
              challenges?</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> [Pointing to PAP] Either of you can respond.</p>
              <p><strong>Sam Tan [PAP]:</strong> Sebastian Teo has touched on the 
              aging population. I used to work for the People’s Association in the 
              1980s, so I can vouch that the People’s Association has started working 
              on this problem during the 1980s. During my time there, I have worked on
               many projects to the People’s Association on how to meet the needs of 
              the elderly when the elderly constitutes for 1 in 5 people in Singapore 
              in the year 2030. The ruling party has certainly made preparation for 
              the day aging population confronts Singapore head-on. This is one 
              strategic issue the PAP has considered as far back as 50 years ago.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> There is still 2 more minutes. Does anyone want to speak?</p>
              <p><strong>Sam Tan [PAP]:</strong> Can I? Just now…</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> No, it is the Opposition’s turn.</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> I would like to ask a question.
               In the blind pursuit of GDP growth, did the government consider there 
              may be unwanted side effects? I believe high income groups receive all 
              the benefits of this GDP growth while low income groups receive zero 
              benefits. The 14% economic growth has no relevance to the lives of low 
              income groups. Can both representatives from the PAP clarify what 
              exactly is the government pursuing?</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Last one minute…</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> If the PAP had considered the 
              challenge of aging population 30 years ago, why did the PAP government 
              decide that Singapore shall become a medical tourism hub? Wouldn’t this 
              lead to a rise in healthcare cost?</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> The last 20s shall be allocated to Sam Tan of the PAP.</p>
              <p><strong>Sam Tan [PAP]:</strong> I would like to address Koh Choong 
              Yong’s assertion that country needs more Opposition voice in Parliament,
               so that Singapore can be governed better against emerging challenges. 
              Administrating a country well doesn’t depend on the number of Opposition
               voices in Parliament, but whether the government can attract the best 
              talent to join its ranks to serve the people. Just depending on 
              Opposition voices alone isn’t sufficient for the betterment of 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Time’s up. I would like to invite Minister Lim Swee Say to respond to the comments made so far. Minister, you have 2 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> The problems raised by the 
              Opposition are not unique to Singapore. Aging population, widening 
              income gap and inflation are problems faced globally. However, where 
              Singapore is different from other countries is that the PAP not only 
              discusses the problems, but also exercises practical policies to solve 
              the problems.</p>
              <p>For example, Singapore’s economy grew by 14.5% last year. Did this 
              benefit the workers? What I saw was different from the Opposition 
              because I am active in the trade unions. As a result of the economic 
              growth, there was shortage in labour supply while bonuses for 2010 were 
              far better than that of 2009.</p>
              <p>On ageing population, the government has been deliberating on this 
              problem many years, so I object the assertion that the government has 
              never looked into it.</p>
              <p>Which is more important – the country’s needs or the people’s need? 
              Both are equally important, however there cannot be a family if there is
               no country. In another words, if a country does not progress, I believe
               it is definitely more difficult for the people to progress. The mission
               of the PAP is to serve the People and to overcome problems effectively 
              for the People, so that workers have shelter and enjoy job security.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you, Minister. The first segment 
              has ended. In the next segment, we will discuss the Cost of Living and 
              the impact of Foreign Labour.</p>

              <h1>Impact of Foreign Labour &amp; the Cost of Living</h1>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Welcome back to the Political Forum on 
              Singapore’s Future. In this segment, we shall be discussing short-term 
              challenges. According to a recent MediaCorp survey, every 1 in 2 
              Singaporeans considers the cost of living is the next most pressing 
              issue after housing and foreign labour; and it will very likely have an 
              impact on their voting choice.  We now enter into an unmoderated caucus 
              with a total time of 6 minutes. Now, timing begins.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> The WP believes there are many
               areas the government can intervene in curbing the rise in cost of 
              living. For example, the supply of land, the collection of rent, taxes 
              and other administrative charges by government agencies, Electronic Road
               Pricing, Goods &amp; Service Tax, Road Tax, etc have some effect on the
               price level, so the government should not use the excuse of external 
              factors to shred its responsibility on curbing inflation. Therefore, it 
              should be a question of whether the government has the political will to
               combat the rise in the cost of living.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> One in every two Singaporeans finds 
              the cost of living here too high. I can understand. Let me share my 
              experience of living in New York City (NYC). Although the rent in NYC is
               much higher than that in Singapore, the purchasing power of New Yorkers
               are also much higher than Singaporeans. That’s why the Singapore Dollar
               (S$) is a lot smaller than the currencies of Europe and the United 
              States. I would like to ask the PAP how it would respond to this 
              comment.</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> Cost of living encompasses 
              food, shelter, clothing and transport. Housing and transport seem to be 
              most pressing factors while various signs pointed out the problems of 
              housing and transport arise from monopolies. For example, public 
              transport is dominated by 2 operators while the Housing Development 
              Board (HDB) is responsible for over 80% of the housing supply.</p>
              <p>These 2 factors combined together make it increasingly difficult for 
              Singaporeans to cope with the rising cost of living. On top of that, 
              Singaporeans face wage depression due to labour competition by foreign 
              workers. As such, life is especially difficult for the lower income 
              group.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> Are you saying that the HDB in fulfilling its mission to provide housing for majority of Singaporeans is actually a bad thing?</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> No, it is not a bad thing, but 
              the only 2 beneficiaries of high HDB prices are the government and 
              foreign immigrants. To Singaporeans, high HDB prices doesn’t mean 
              anything because we have to buy a new flat to replace the old flat we 
              had sold to meet our housing needs. On the other hand, foreign 
              immigrants can cash out on their residential properties when they return
               to their home countries. For the government and HDB, higher prices 
              translate to more profit and stamp duties.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> The Workers’ Party believes 
              that it is a good thing that 80% of Singaporeans are living in HDB 
              flats, but finds that HDB flats are getting too expensive. Many people 
              have told us they find HDB flats unaffordable. We believe there is a big
               gap between the cost of building a HDB flat and its market price. The 
              selling price of a HDB flat should be based on a multiple of the median 
              household income instead of utilising the market mechanism. Under such a
               non-market pricing regime, the price of HDB flats becomes regulated.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> I would like to add to Choong Yong’s 
              point that the government is not only responsible for supplying land to 
              HDB, but also provides housing loans. Under such an arrangement, it is 
              inevitable that HDB price will go up.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> The PAP’s view and approach on 
              housing policy consist of 3 points. The first point is that home 
              ownership is the cornerstone of the housing policy.</p>
              <p>The second point is there must be gradual appreciation in property 
              prices. Why is this important for hdb price to appreciate gradually over
               time? Consider the hypothetical situation of a Singaporean who bought a
               HDB flat for $200,000. In 20 years time, would he benefit if the 
              selling price is less than the price he bought today? If the Opposition 
              thinks depreciation of HDB price is good, it can use this point as a 
              platform to fight for more votes.</p>
              <p>The third point is housing must affordable for young couples.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Time’s up, Minister, but you will be 
              allocated time to reflect on all the comments spoken in this segment. 
              Now it is time for you to share your position on the cost of living and 
              the impact of foreign labour.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> Inflation is indeed a key 
              problem faced by Singapore. This year’s inflation rate will be higher 
              than that of the last few years. The long-term outlook for inflation is 
              expected to be higher than the inflation rate of the last 4 years. 
              That’s why the PAP is very serious about this problem.</p>
              <p>There are 2 ways to tackle the problem of inflation. Water located 
              too far cannot be used to put out the fire nearby, so the government, 
              through various mechanisms, put up assistance to lower income groups 
              under the Grow &amp; Share Package (Budget 2011). The rebates and the 
              GST credits they receive would be able to offset the impact of 
              inflation. The second way to tackle the problem of inflation is to boost
               productivity, so that the income level would rise. Job security, salary
               increment, sharing benefits and discipline enable Singaporeans to cope 
              with inflation.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you minister. Now we proceed to 
              next sub-segment on the impact of foreign labour. According to the same 
              MediaCorp survey, 7 out of 10 voters expressed their concern on 
              competition from foreign labour. We now enter an unmoderated caucus of 6
               minutes to discuss this topic.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> On foreign immigrants, they are not 
              only competing with Singaporeans for jobs, but also residential 
              properties. Earlier on, Minister Lim said that the PAP would like to 
              achieve steady growth in property prices, but the reality isn’t so. For 
              the last 2 years, the lax foreign labour policy has resulted in many 
              immigrants qualified to purchase HDB flats, thus HDB prices grew by 60% 
              over the past 2 years.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Now, it is time for Sam Tan of the PAP to speak.</p>
              <p><strong>Sam Tan [PAP]:</strong> Singapore’s progress is intrinsically
               linked to its economic development. The key reason for Singapore’s 
              stellar economic growth for the last 10 years is twofold: (1) the 
              government has been assisting workers to upgrade their skills, so they 
              can earn higher salaries; (2) foreign talent and foreign workers take up
               the jobs that Singaporeans reject. These 2 factors are complementary 
              and cannot do without each other. Hence, the crux of the question is not
               how many foreign immigrants are competing in our domestic labour 
              market, but rather how we can achieve economic growth.</p>
              <p>A more important point is when a country achieves excellent 
              performance, how do we share the fruits of the economic growth among our
               workers and the rest of the electorate? This is why the Finance 
              Minister was very generous in Budget 2011 to hand out S$66M to 
              Singaporeans. We are able to do this because we are able to synergise 
              the 2 pillars of economic growth – (1) Singaporean workers; and (2) 
              Foreign labour.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> Fundamentally, the Workers’ 
              Party does not oppose immigration and foreign labour. Foreign labour 
              should make up for jobs that Singaporeans don’t want to fill. However, 
              many Singaporeans now feel their jobs have been stolen by foreign 
              labour. Moreover, the rate of absorbing immigration shouldn’t exceed the
               rate at which our basic infrastructure can cope with growing resident 
              population. Singapore is so small. If we continue to take more 
              immigrants, then basic infrastructure such as MRT and HDB flats would 
              not be absorb the stress due to the growing immigrant population.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Mr Teo, now it is your turn.</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> If we don’t tighten the influx 
              of foreign labour, there is no way we can rise the productivity of 
              Singapore’s workers. Minister Lim’s approach of raising productivity 
              level is actually quite difficult to comprehend. Firstly, competition 
              from foreign labour leads to wage depression for Singaporean workers. 
              Secondly, there is an impact on the quality of life here because the 
              basic infrastructure wasn’t designed to cope with so many users 
              considering the resident population increased from 3M to 5M. Did the 
              ruling party take this into consideration when it liberalised the 
              immigration policy? Inflation is also partially due to higher demand 
              because there are more foreign immigrants in Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Now, it is time for the PAP to respond.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> Mr Teo has mentioned that HDB 
              price has rocketed in the past 2 years. The PAP is also very concerned 
              on this development. This is why the Singapore government has 
              implemented measures to cool the red-hot housing market and there 
              appears to be sign of cooling in the housing market. It is impossible to
               avoid short-term turbulence in the housing market, but it is okay as 
              long as there is long-term stable growth in housing prices.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Would any of the Opposition like to speak?</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> I would like to ask why the 
              government does not tighten the regulation on how local companies hire 
              foreign labour. For example, the employer may have to prove that he is 
              unable to hire a Singaporean worker before he is allowed to hire a 
              foreign worker.  The Australia government requires the employer to prove
               there he cannot find a domestic resident to fill the job before he is 
              allowed to hire a foreign worker, while the foreign worker may find 
              himself eligible to apply for Australia citizenship.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> Since Minister Lim is here, I would 
              like to ask him this question: Residents feedback to us that it is 
              baffling that the Reform Party calls for minimum wage legislation 
              despite objection from the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC). Why 
              does the NTUC object minimum wage legislation?</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Now we can invite the Minister to respond to the questions raised.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> There are many problems with the
               minimum wage legislation. If the minimum wage is set too low, many 
              low-wage workers will continue to face many problems. If the minimum 
              wage is set too high, many low-wage workers will loose their jobs. 
              Hence, our approach is not to raise the minimum wage, but to raise the 
              minimum skill level through retraining and skill upgrading, thus 
              providing low-wage workers opportunities to earn higher wages.</p>
              <p>On labour, the PAP and NTUC are unified in its view: if employment 
              rate is high, then there is job security and prosperity. On one hand, we
               work to ensure unemployment rate is low. On the other hand, we work to 
              ensure employment rate is high, so that job opportunities are abundant. 
              There is a question I hope everyone here can consider calmly and 
              rationally: while we can ban companies from hiring foreign labour, can 
              we stop these companies from relocating overseas? In another words, it 
              is a question of more or less foreign labour, and not zero foreign 
              labour. There is no free flow of foreign labour into Singapore. On the 
              contrary, the government’s approach is to raise the skills and 
              productivity of Singaporean workers while raising the skill profile of 
              the foreign labour in Singapore so that as a whole the Singapore 
              workforce becomes more competitive.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Time’s up. Thank you, Minister. Let’s 
              take a short break. In the next segment, each party representative will 
              summarise what has been discussed so far.</p>

              <h1>Summary and Solutions to Singapore’s challenges</h1>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Welcome back to the discussion at our Political Forum.</p>
              <p>With regards to the challenges that Singapore faces in the short term
               and the long run, we have already listened to the arguments of the four
               political parties present. Now I would like to invite each party to 
              propose solutions to those issues, so that the electorate will 
              understand your policies. Everybody shall have 2 minutes to summarise.</p>
              <p>First, I invite Sam Tan of the PAP.</p>
              <p><strong>Sam Tan [PAP]:</strong> Thank you Ms Zeng, thank you 
              everybody. Now everything can be examined from a macro as well as a 
              micro perspective, and of course we may have different views based on 
              these different angles.</p>
              <p>It’s like the hand of a man, which has five fingers. If we look at 
              them separately, we may criticise, why is the thumb so fat, why is the 
              ring finger so small (pointing at right little finger), and the middle 
              finger so long. But if we combine all fingers together, so that they can
               unleash their power as one, then we will be able to handle anything, 
              take up anything or let anything go at ease.</p>
              <p>Government policies are the same. When you look at things separately,
               you may wonder why there are such differences in length and thickness, 
              but when the policies are combined together, they will function as a 
              whole. In the last 30 years, Singapore has managed to emerge from being a
               third-world country and upgrade into the first world, all because its 
              policies have functioned as an integral whole. So this is something that
               we all should treasure, it is a reality that we need to understand.</p>
              <p>Now in this coming General Election, the significance of what we are 
              voting for, is not merely about people electing their representatives, 
              but more importantly, it’s an election of our fourth-generation leaders.
               Therefore this General Election is a very important one, and the 
              casting of one’s vote is a very important responsibility. This 
              responsibility is in the hand of every citizen of the electorate.</p>
              <p>I am convinced that the Singapore electorate should be able to look 
              at this election very rationally, and decide which political party will 
              be able to contribute to the prosperity and progress of Singapore in the
               next 50 years most effectively. This vote that is sacred, that is in 
              their hand, will then be the wisest decision for themselves and for 
              their next generation.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you, Mr Tan. Now we will have the National Solidarity Party to summarise their arguments. Mr Teo, please.</p>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> The slogan of the National 
              Solidarity Party’s campaign is “Your Voice! Your Choice!”. So here we 
              shall express three different voices to the ruling party.</p>
              <p>The first is the voice of the elderly. They wish that after 
              sacrificing their lifetime to sow the seeds of many trees from which we 
              now enjoy the good fruits, they should be given reasonable care by the 
              government. Another thing they wish to voice out is that hospital beds 
              need to be increased. From what I know, since 1999 till now, we only 
              have over 11,000 hospital beds, which have never been increased, that’s 
              the situation.</p>
              <p>The second voice is that of the workers. All enterprises should 
              consider hiring local citizens, and wages should be tied to profits, one
               should not insist on keeping their wages down. Finally, it is a wish 
              that our party would like to present to the ruling party. I hope that in
               this coming General Election, PAP will not make empty promises like 
              signing ‘black cheques’.</p>
              <p>From what I know, the cheque that was issued in year 2000 has still 
              not been honoured. Back then, our Prime Minister, who is now our Senior 
              Minister, said that in 10 years’ time, we would be able to enjoy a 
              standard of living on par with Switzerland. But we didn’t have that. 
              This time he is issuing another cheque, saying that in 10 years’ time, 
              workers’ actual income will be increased by 30 per cent. I hope this 
              time it is really something that can be honoured. This is the voice that
               I mean to present to everybody.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Time’s up, Mr Teo. Thank you. Next, we have Alec Tok of the Reform Party to sum up. Time limit is again 2 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Alec Tok [RP]:</strong> The conviction of the Reform Party is
               very simple: The nation is its people. Can a country without its people
               be considered a nation?</p>
              <p>Our mission is very simple too. We want public housing to return to 
              what a young couple, a hardworking couple is able to own, a nest that 
              they are able to buy. That is our mission.</p>
              <p>Secondly, we want to make living expenses something that will really be within the control of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Thirdly is that the low-income families we need to help most will all get proper assistance.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the Reform Party hopes that CPF savings will be returned back to the our own control.</p>
              <p>To sum it up, it’s again very simple, it is to enable those who wish 
              to work, to work; to enable those who wish to buy a house, to buy a 
              house; and to enable those who wish to retire, to retire.</p>
              <p>The objective of the Reform Party is as simple as that. The nation is its people.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> You still have 30 seconds. Would you like
               to use up? Fine, thank you. Mr Koh, would you please summarise the 
              viewpoints of Workers’ Party? Time is again 2 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> Just now we mentioned that to 
              face up to challenges of the future, the parliament that promulgates its
               policies is a key point. Apart from what was mentioned, what the people
               should think about, is whether we still want a parliament that is 
              completely dominated by PAP.</p>
              <p>If, one day, the ruling party has declined, what should Singapore do?
               Will there be another group of people to take up the task of leading 
              the country? Someone has asked Workers’ Party in another forum whether 
              it is capable of substituting the government. Our reply was very honest,
               we said at the moment not. For setting up a substitute government is 
              not something that can be done overnight, and WP would not make such a 
              boast.</p>
              <p>Our approach is to take things step by step, to first establish a 
              rational, responsible and respected political party, to introduce 
              candidates of high calibre at each election. However, the efforts on our
               part alone would not be enough. A candidate of high calibre would still
               need the help of the electorate to be sent into the parliament.</p>
              <p>So one issue that the electorate should think about in this General 
              Election is, for the sake of the future of the country and its people, 
              should we not correct this situation of an overwhelming dominance? We 
              need to have more candidates voted into the parliament, in order to form
               a counterweight to the ruling party. At the same time, we would also 
              then be able to nurture leaders who will be to take up the formidable 
              task of leading the country when the ruling party declines.</p>
              <p>So in this coming General Election, what we have to do is to convince
               the people to send more WP candidates into the parliament, as a first 
              major step for a more ideal political system, to ensure the future of 
              Singapore. We hope more Singaporeans will understand how crucial this 
              long-term challenge is. Support Workers’ Party, create a better 
              Singapore with us.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Time’s up. Thank you. Finally, we invite Minister Lim Swee Say to give a 2-minute summary.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> A healthy person does not mean 
              that he would never ever fall ill. Similarly, someone who is ill does 
              not mean he is unhealthy person. For whether one is healthy or not does 
              not depend on the fact of whether he is ill or not; the question is 
              whether it is a major or minor illness, whether he falls ill frequently 
              or infrequently. If one’s illness is minor and infrequent, he is 
              considered healthy; if the illness is major and frequent, then it’s 
              unhealthy.</p>
              <p>We feel that a country is the same. Of course, we have our 
              imperfections, but on a whole, Singapore, Singapore as it is today, is 
              indeed a healthy and strong Singapore. On this point, I believe even the
               opposition parties would not deny. Of course, looking into the future, 
              the Singapore that we want to strive for is a more perfect Singapore. I 
              can say confidently that we have not neglected in all these years the 
              concerns of the elderly or of the common workers. That is why Singapore 
              has full employment today. In the years to come, we will continue to 
              improve.</p>
              <p>WP asks what if PAP declines one day, there should be preparation for
               an opposition party to substitute. Actually, we have a different point 
              of view, for what our country needs now, if we want to ensure our 
              future, is not to wait for PAP to decline, to wait for opposition 
              parties to replace it. Instead, we need to elect the best people into 
              the parliament as soon as possible, for it is with good candidates 
              elected into the parliament that we will have the best MPs possible, and
               with the best MPs, we will have the best cabinet, and with the best 
              cabinet, we will have the best government to develop Singapore to its 
              best.</p>
              <p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Minister Lim, time’s up. Thank you 
              Minister and everyone who has participated in the discussion. Tonight, 
              we have conducted a very meaningful debate of political views. We have 
              heard voices of the ruling party and the opposition parties, their views
               on policies, and their approaches. The video of this discussion will be
               uploaded on the MediaCorp website. Thank you for watching this 
              programme tonight. Goodbye.</p>

              <p>While for Lina, she's probably a little stage fright. Gerald has the content, but probably need to be a little cool.</p>

              <h1>Impact of Foreign Labour &amp; the Cost of Living</h1>
              <p><strong>Sebastian Teo [NSP]:</strong> No, it is not a bad thing,
                          but the only 2 beneficiaries of high HDB prices are the government
                          and foreign immigrants. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">To Singaporeans, high HDB prices doesn’t
                          mean anything because we have to buy a new flat to replace the old
                          flat we had sold to meet our housing needs. </span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>On the other hand,
                          foreign immigrants can cash out on their residential properties
                          when they return to their home countries.</strong></span> For the government and
                          HDB, higher prices translate to more profit and stamp duties.</p>
              <p><strong>Koh Choong Yong [WP]:</strong> The Workers’ Party
                          believes that it is a good thing that 80% of Singaporeans are
                          living in HDB flats, but finds that HDB flats are getting too
                          expensive. Many people have told us they find HDB flats
                          unaffordable. We believe there is a big gap between the cost of
                          building a HDB flat and its market price. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The selling price of a
                          HDB flat should be based on a multiple of the median household
                          income instead of utilising the market mechanism. Under such a
                          non-market pricing regime, the price of HDB flats becomes
                          regulated.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> The PAP’s view and approach
                          on housing policy consist of 3 points. The first point is that home
                          ownership is the cornerstone of the housing policy.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The second point is there must be gradual appreciation in
                          property prices. Why is this important for hdb price to appreciate
                          gradually over time? Consider the hypothetical situation of a
                          Singaporean who bought a HDB flat for $200,000. In 20 years time,
                          would he benefit if the selling price is less than the price he
                          bought today? If the Opposition thinks depreciation of HDB price is
                          good, it can use this point as a platform to fight for more
                          votes.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The third point is housing must affordable for young
                          couples.</p>
              <p><strong>Lim Swee Say [PAP]:</strong> Mr Teo has mentioned that
                          HDB price has rocketed in the past 2 years. The PAP is also very
                          concerned on this development. This is why the Singapore government
                          has implemented measures to cool the red-hot housing market and
                          there appears to be sign of cooling in the housing market. It is
                          impossible to avoid short-term turbulence in the housing market,
                          <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">but it is okay as long as there is long-term stable growth in
                          housing prices.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Translated by <strong>Donaldson Tan</strong></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Let's read the lines in blue again and slightly go through in easy point format.</p>
              <p>1. Singaporeans need to buy house to sell house.</p>
              <p>2. Foreigners cash out when leaving/quitting the country.</p>
              <p>I can understand gradual inflation. The property that I currently owned has now appreciated by 100% in 6 years. My income had appreciated by 50% in the same number of years.</p>
              <p>Is this a long stable growth?</p>
              <p>Assuming I try to buy my current property now, as compared to purchasing it before. I would not be able to own my current property and have to settle for something smaller/remote.</p>
              <p>Taking the same measure again, if I would to wait another 6 years more, I would not be able to afford anything.</p>

               protests about our exclusion to Talking Point and other programmes, 
              Channel NewsAsia (CNA) finally extended an invitation to the SDP to its 
              forum which was aired last Saturday evening and on which Dr Vincent 
              Wijeysingha spoke for the party.<br><br>But now CNA's Chinese section is
               doing it again. At its televised debate last night, the SDP was 
              excluded even as the PAP and other opposition parties were invited.</p>
              <br>When we queried why this was so, we were told that the PAP, SPP and 
              WP were invited “because there are elected representatives in the 
              Parliament for these parties.” (See exchange of letters below). <br><br>The
               explanation makes no sense but we will leave that to another 
              discussion. We later found out that the National Solidarity Party (NSP) 
              and the Reform Party (RP) were also on the programme. Both NSP and RP do
               not have MPs.<br><br>The Chinese programme reaches out to a very 
              different segment of the electorate and it is important that a party 
              contesting in a general election be given equal opportunity to 
              communicate with all segments of the voting public.<br><br>Again, this 
              discrimination is highly unfair to the SDP. All we ask for is for an 
              even opportunity to address voters. We are confident that when the 
              public sees and watches our candidates explaining our policies and 
              platform they will support us.<br><br>Unfortunately, there seems to be this effort to give the Singapore Democrats minimal coverage.

              <p>Just watched the repeat telecast. Tharman and Josephine Teo brought up a lot of statistics about how they're helping the poor....it's such a different picture from the ground.</p>
              <p>Tharman says that 85% of the bottom 20% own their flats. Yes, the reason why they own their flats is because all their savings have gone into these housing and that's why we still see old old $600 a month cleaners and old aunties and uncles picking cardboards.</p>
              <p>JosephineTeo misses the point and says that 80% of the production operators in manufacturing are foreigners while 80% of managerial positions are singaporeans. If they were to remove foreigners, these foreign companies would move elsewhere. For fuck's sake, I think she completely missed the point. Nobody's asking for these unskilled or semi skilled workers to go, it's just that the managerial and professional positions....a lot are taken by pple from india, china and the phillippines. That's why there are so many unemployed PMETs.</p>
              <p>Josephine Teo also mentioned that unemployment rate is very low at 2.1%. Well, if the sampling for the stats are based on residents, which includes PRs, then how many jobs are actually created for Singaporeans? We could have had a lot of locals unemployed but the percentage is mitigated by many other new PRs getting the jobs. The negative thing about such public debates is that they can quote any kind of figure they want and god knows it it's true?</p>

              <p>yes, they are excellent in selective quoting. when discussing about unemployment, we all know what we are interested is unemployed singaporeans/total singaporeans. the way they dodge here a bit, there a bit, we know the truth may be this; oh this data is better there - got it; resident unemployment/total residents (includes PR as we know). and since some PR are from JB but work here so have no local address but with employment records.</p>
              <p>when comparing public transport costs, they will quote hong kong, london. when talking about GST, suddenly hong kong (which has no GST) is not there anymore.</p>
              <p>she was already caught once by the online citizen on selectively quoting germany unemployment benefits disadvantages to support claims of not favouring such benefits. as for the old uncles and aunties cleaners, we should also pity them. they also face competition of $300/month bangladeshi workers for their jobs. we may be facing same problem as them in future.</p>

              <p>I dont like Dr Che but then I would love to see how he put his messages and debate across to the mps. Why they are not included by telling them they are not representative?</p>
              <p>Maybe pap prefer those that is not too outspoken or dare not to question them out of the box? Or pap prefer to see the questions first then decide whether they can go on live debate so pap can prepare the script and read from the script?</p>
