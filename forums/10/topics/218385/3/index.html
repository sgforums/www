They will continue to flow with the ebbing tide and unable to steer the boat to any specific direction. They will not restore their sense of direction for a long long time and would be leaving things as they are.

The dark sides are the unjust, the oppression of employers, the rejections, the isolation, the struggle, the cost of living - brought about by globalisation, compeitition, and the imperfections of country's policies.<br><br>When they reach 30s to 60s, they will be just like me/us, trying to point out the dark sides of ourselves, and not really asking the gov to help us, but asking to make the dark sides a little brighter.<br><br>If the dark remains dark and becomes darker, when they reach 60s-100s, they will be like us also....self-fish, unwilling to volunteer, complain only, push everything to the gov...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
