              <p>Spoiling the vote is not a good statement. It only serves to keep the PAP in power. If a person wants a change to the current situation, spoiling the vote is useless, meaningless, and absolutely irresponsible.</p>
              <p>It's like, "don't blame me for anything. It's not my fault. Someone else voted for the PAP or the opposition"</p>
              <p>It's a bunch that has no guts to go with the opposition, or against the PAP, and instead choose to aid the PAP indirectly by spoiling their votes. They are no different from those who vote the PAP coz they don't care, they fear the PAP, etc.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, crane operators in PSA are very well taken care of. To put it simply, they are like the revenue-generating dept of any other corporations. They are the most important group of workers in PSA, because PSA needs them to move containers efficiently in order to generate those huge revenues.</p>
              <p>If the Govt likes to rant about how lazy or useless or unproductive Singaporeans are, I would say, look no further to our PSA workers for their dedication and productivity.</p>
              <p>Crane operators in PSA earn $4k or even more, putting in extra time. They earn better than graduates in white-collar jobs. Of course, the timing is long. The longer you are on the job, the more you earn. However, they are taken care of with a good union and by the organization.</p>

              <p><br>True, but my stance is that the Govt should not make it any worse.</p>
              <p>Given that human beings are usually short-sighted (that's why probably only 1 in 10 succeed in what they do with the ability to see long-term), bringing in cheap labour to prop up Singapore's economy is a big no-no. It is at the huge expense of the average local.</p>

              <p>I don't want to be one of them, so I am out of Singapore. Even though I am in a position where the cheap labour cannot replace my job, that doesn't mean that 10 years later, they won't be able to. The blatant import of foreigners is like a parasitic situation. Jobs higher up will slowly get hit by this as well (Lawyers, doctors, etc).</p>
              <p>How many people are like you or myself, who find a way out by ourselves? The average John Doe depends on their job to survive, and depraving relative stability and security to them is suicidal to Singapore in my opinion</p>

              <p><br>Coming back to the above, there are different types of positions at the ports, and all of them are paid really well.</p>
              <p>In Belgium, there is this group of workers, that props some form of protection on the top corners of a container, before another container is stacked onto it. I believe their pay is like 3 - 4k EURO per month.</p>
              <p>Then, there is another group of workers, who are in charge of driving new cars out of the containers and parking them neatly at the docks. They are paid really well, because they have to ensure that not a scratch is made to any of the new cars in that narrow space.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are the harbour pilots, ie tugboat captains, who use their tugboats to direct huge ships (like container and cruise ships) into the harbour. Their pay is easily in the 5 figure.</p>
              <p>Of course, all of the above are specialists. They are certified and trained to do their job.</p>
