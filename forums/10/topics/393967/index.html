              <p>Ok, you might say it's propaganda at work. I'm just posting the news I saw:</p>
              <p>==============================================================</p>
              <p><span class="postbody"><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20100319/a28.jpg">http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20100319/a28.jpg</a> <br> <br> FOR upwards of 12 hours every day, Mr Abdul Rahim Muhamed Rashid sits 
              alone in his 20th-storey 'corner office'.
              <br> <br> The place is small, no bigger than the inside of a Toyota Camry, but the
               23-year-old says that he does not leave it except for emergencies.
              <br> <br> He has a little fridge in there for drinks, a small radio for company 
              and some plastic bags and newspapers to take the place of the toilet.
              <br> <br> 'It takes 10 minutes for me to climb up there, and I'm young. The older 
              ones take longer. So we don't go up and down when we don't have to. We 
              do everything in the cabin,' he says.
              <br> <br> His job involves using the crane to pick up building materials from the 
              ground and hoist them to where they are needed. 'It's a little bit like 
              playing a computer game,' he notes.
              <br> <br> But that is perhaps the only upside to it. Long days, isolation and some
               very questionable toilet habits are all part of the life of a tower 
              crane operator, he says.
              <br> <br> And it is clear why people like Mr Abdul Rahim - Singaporeans working in
               construction - are becoming an endangered species.
              <br> <br> Indeed, if not for having dropped out of school at Secondary 4 because 
              of financial problems, he does not know if he would have strayed into 
              the field.
              <br> <br> 'Before doing this job, I was delivering pizzas. I saw a newspaper ad 
              which said that a company was willing to sponsor a crane operator course
               for workers so I thought I would go and try it out,' he says.
              <br> <br> He was selected to attend the week-long course. He passed the theory and
               practical tests and has not looked back since.
              <br> <br> He started as a tower crane operator in 2008 and eight months later took
               a government grant for another course on how to operate a different 
              crane.
              <br> <br> He does not intend to stop there.
              <br> <br> 'If I have the ability to operate many different cranes, I am more 
              flexible. If there are no jobs for a tower crane operator, maybe I can 
              work as a crawler crane driver,' he says. A crawler crane has tracks and
               can therefore be driven around easily.
              <br> <br> He admits that it will not be easy getting Singaporeans to do the job, 
              especially those with higher education and options.
              <br> <br> 'It's hard work and a lonely life. And we work very hard seven days a 
              week. Your girlfriend needs to be very understanding,' he jokes.
              <br> <br> But with a monthly salary of around $4,000 including overtime and the 
              prospect of making up to $6,500 as he gains experience, he isn't about 
              to give it up.
              <br> <br> 'There are not that many opportunities for people of my qualifications 
              to earn this kind of salary.'</span></p>

              <p>PSA crane operators earn about this rate as well, adding in overtime. For a blue-collar job, a crane operator's take-home pay is actually pretty similar to a white-collar job.</p>
              <p>Not to mention that they are protected by a union that does have a bit of teeth.</p>

              <p><br>Why will the resident<strong> </strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm"><strong>‘Drama Queen’</strong></a> - who prefers to be a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Narcissist"><strong>“narcissist”</strong></a> at the same time - even bother about the opinions formed by others ?</p>
              <p>Pessimist fence sitters - who will accuse others of being "tinpot wannabe dictators" - can only be as bad as those who can only advocate and promote the idea of "<strong>casting blank votes to make a statement</strong>".</p>
              <p>What kind of statements can a blank vote make - except to express the hollow and impotent statement from a hopelessly helpless and bankrupt mind ?</p>
              <p>It was the blank votes cast in the Referendum of 1962 that allowed LKY to carry the day  - with his false offer to allow blank votes to be counted in favor of those who oppose the merger with Malaysia - which allowed LKY to avoid further publicity and closer scrutiny to the 3 non-choices in a falsely conducted Referendum.</p>
              <p>Can the political values of The Bear be trusted in its advocacy of 'blank votes' - considering its preferred politically neutered position ?</p>

              <p>Read btw the lines. It is the spirit and the motivation for a better living that this guy is going for the job. Do you believe what the govern say that Singaporean are lazy and not motivated to justify for the import of more foreigners after reading this story?</p>
              <p>Is this only an isolated case of how Singaporean desire for better life and are taking jobs like these?</p>
              <p>No..obviously, there are many more Singaporean who are taking on jobsif given the chance. At least, I am working in a -30c place where my PRC colleagues are surprise at how we Singaporean can survive in places even the local shuned.</p>

              <p>What I want to say is, opportunities are all over the place. It's easy to complain because it requires virtually no work. But to identify opportunities, you have to be thinking and looking for it constantly. Most people don't do it.</p>
              <p>There's this story of this person who constantly look out for money to pick up from the sides of the road. And it so happens that this person really did pick up coins and notes very frequently. As for me, when I was young, I was always into the vending machine change returning area... and I remembered I found coins inside quite frequently... This is not to tell you to go do this all the time... My main message is that one has to open their eyes to see opportunities waving at them.</p>
