              <p>Personally to me, you are nothing but a fool. Obviously, you don't have any pubs, and are just pretending to be successful, because you are nothing but an insignificant bug in life.</p>
              <p>To the most stupid forumer I have ever seen</p>
              <p>Just to repeat my reply to you in another topic which you fled
                                      with your tail between your legs. I just don't understand why you
                                      do not learn how to shut up when you have so little knowledge, and
                                      instead continuously making a fool of yourself</p>
              <p><em>"If you have nothing to contribute, just shut up. Sometimes,
                                      opening one's mouth too much makes one look real stupid (like what
                                      you did with the chicken wing article). It only shows how fake you
                                      are, that you have not travelled the world, your knowledge is
                                      myopic, and you are nothing but just a little insignificant bug
                                      living in a make-shift world of pubs and prostitutes.</em></p>
              <p><em>you want to believe you are successful, but my profiling of
                                      you, is that you are just a little insignificant person in life,
                                      who then comes to this forum to spread lies of how successful you
                                      are, in the hopes of impressing others (but sadly, making a fool of
