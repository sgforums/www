              <p>truth to $4k/mth job in spore:</p>
              <p>1)u can never get that job even if u immigrated back from say switzerland to singapore</p>
              <p>2)it depends on luck</p>
              <p>3)it depends on who u know in that organisation to improve job prospects</p>
              <p>4)unless u go setup yer company .....no way gettin that salary</p>
              <p>5)just another propaganda</p>
              <p>6)story is made to make u feel bad and feel u are the loser!</p>
              <p>7)if u pluck everyone on the street inorchard road...less than 90%earn less than $2k .</p>
              <p>8)if u pluck anyone in any random town who are o level holders...chances are that they would have not enough money to feed themselves or their family!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if sporean ministers who have degree can earn $1million /year,,,,,,,,,then they should publish around the world telling the other 1st world leaders that they are poor performers and losers and earn sooooo little money!!</p>

              <p>Spoiling the vote is not a good statement. It only serves to keep the PAP in power. If a person wants a change to the current situation, spoiling the vote is useless, meaningless, and absolutely irresponsible.</p>
              <p>It's like, "don't blame me for anything. It's not my fault. Someone else voted for the PAP or the opposition"</p>
              <p>It's a bunch that has no guts to go with the opposition, or against the PAP, and instead choose to aid the PAP indirectly by spoiling their votes. They are no different from those who vote the PAP coz they don't care, they fear the PAP, etc.</p>

              <p>Bravo - for a fresh and daring view.</p>
              <p>You have expressed exactly my attitude already directed towards all these kind of fence sitters over the last few years.</p>
              <p>These dim wits will damn the PAP and will also damn every and any Singaporean -who does not meet their own miserable and hollow standards or expectations to their own hollow ideas of what an Alternative Candidate should be to represent Singaporean.</p>
              <p>What possibly can be their own standards - when they do not even dare to speak their mind in public, and have no facility to articulate their political thoughts - and cannot even overcome their own frustrated impotence ?</p>
              <p>Still they will dare come out openly to propagate the bankrupt values of casting a blank vote and screw the opportunity for the Alternative Parties.</p>
              <p>The PAP can only wish for more blank votes to spoil the opportunities for the Alternative Parties - and allow them to win even by the narrowest of margin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are two known fools in this Speaker's Corner who possess such dim intelligence and are active advocate to this dumb idea.</p>

              <p>Are they trying to compare a road sweeper job to a crane operator ? Are they joking ?</p>
              <p>Crane operator is a <strong>specialist</strong>. Much like an airline pilot.</p>
              <p>Not any tom dick and harry can do ok?</p>
              <p>There are plenty of jobs that does not require a O level. But they still need you to be professionally trained.</p>
              <p>Does a Plumber need O level ? NO</p>
              <p>Does a cook need O level ? NO.</p>
              <p>Does a bus driver need O level ? NO.</p>

              <p>With some significant differences from what I understand.</p>
              <p>A belgian property is more affordable compared to Singapore's. A decent home is anywhere &lt; 100k to 300k.</p>
              <p>Not to mention that Belgium is a welfare state via their social security system</p>
              <p>"The amount to be paid by an individual is calculated based on gross
              salary but is around 13 percent, employers' contributions account for
              over 34 percent. The balance is made up by state subsidies and more
              recently other sources such as a percentage of the income from VAT"</p>

              <p>a crane driver is same as forklift driver only mechanisms are bigger!</p>
              <p>it needs practise similar to car driving....</p>
              <p>if everyone in the world ended as a forklift driver and crane driver...god bless this planet.</p>
              <p>.............but the issue is not the undereducated or overpaid welder or crane driver as compared to the guys who are able to build,repair  and design the cranes.if the crane driver can end up earning more than the people who built those cranes or machines.....then why bother even building the cranes???might as well forget bout the cranes and let fellow humans carry load like coolies forever.</p>
              <p>as u can see here...ITS THE PAY ISSUES!!ITS THE GOVERNMENTS BIG PROBLEM!IF THEY CANT PAY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,THEN DONT WERK!!!!!UNLIKE THE CRANE DRIVERS AND MOST SPOREANS...THEY LACK UNITY!!ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL!!!ITS MORE LIKE U DIE YER BUSINESS....I GET MY $$$$$ AND WHO CARES A DAMN BOUT ALL OF U EDUCATED OR UNEDUCATED PEEPS OR WHATEVER LOW SALRY U GET KINDA ATTITUDE.</p>

              <p>IM HERE NOT TO ARGUE BOUT A OCCUPATIONS SALARY BUT TO SHAME SINGAPORE FOR ITS EFFORTS WITH A NATION OF UNDERPAID MAJORITY WITH STINGY EMPLOYERS IN SMC AND MNC GLOBAL COMPANIES!</p>

              <p>This is a niche skill job. Even if there is money, you cannot find this type of people in Singapore. The entry barrier is extremely high, risk is high, pay is high. </p>

              <p>.............but the issue is not the undereducated or overpaid
              welder or crane driver as compared to the guys who are able to
              build,repair  and design the cranes.if the crane driver can
              end up earning more than the people who built those cranes or
              machines.....then why bother even building the cranes???might as
              well forget bout the cranes and let fellow humans carry load like
              coolies forever.</p>

              <p>Since you cant change the world, change yourself to suite the world. </p>
              <p>It is a fact that crane operator, chef.... and many other "low-level" jobs are specialist job, they are professionally trained  (even without O level, N level), they are paid well. These blue collar "professional" is equivalent to those "PhD" registered consultant. </p>
              <p>They are trained by work experiences which is in parallel to education.</p>
              <p>I say that because my dad (sec 2 educated) is earning more than me (degree holder) for a similar age comparison.  </p>
              <p>But who want to work in a oily, smelly, dirty, sweaty old environment, compare to computer, office, air-con?</p>
              <p>When you look at those dark-skin construction worker under the hot sun, when you think that their paid is low, then you are wrong, they are a portion who are "professionally trained"  specialist, but their pay is shockingly high. </p>
              <p>They are not reflected in the manpower survey because they are the minority which is consciously left out. </p>
