              <p>if getting a good education is not to get good jobs, then why the fark you go study for it. why the fark so many jobless people go back to retrain for another skill or qualifications. another dumb ger shooting off her mouth. go back to being a vase.</p>

              <p>I am not saying that education is no good, it is certainly good, but what i meant is, we or our society should take education as a mean of improving ourselves, our knowledge and our well being, not merely just for getting a good paid and a job, that is also important but on the secondary note. By modelling ourselve as such that taking education as a daily need to improve our well being and perspective will certainly make us continuing our studies and re educate ourselves in a way of long life learning journey.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in the begining, MOE had wrongly emphasized on education, this end up we creating labourers rather than entrepreneurs, and most after graduated, failed to embark on long life learning. And because of this, most end up getting no jobs and low paid while holding honor degrees and start to blame back on the society. It is a mistake. More so are peoples fail to do their TNA before embarking on what they need to improve themselves, our workforce are mainly ending up with jack of all trade, but master of done. It is not something like people said, training and re education, so you go on and take up a course without analysing on the Training needs.</p>

              <p>frankly, between the MIW and some of the assholes who are in the
              opposition (read the fight club and some of the other useless
              bastards who have destroyed the opposition), the MIW is a better

              <p>but of course, a lot of people out there think differently...
              and would try to cram their opinions down my throat...</p>
              <p>if you can't for the life of you vote for either, what would you
              do?</p>
              <p>i'm not a fence sitter.. what if i find both candidate
              abhorrent? i'm supposed to choose one of them?  i made a
              choice.. by deliberately spoiling my vote, i say that neither of
              the candidates are worth a vote.. </p>
              <p>or if the whole goddamned constituency chooses to spoil their
              votes and you come up with the MIW - 30%, opposition 20%, spoilt
              votes 50%... then what?</p>
              <p>i've said this ad nauseam but no one seems to understand this
              simple fact that your enemy's enemy may not be your friend...</p>
              <p>and also that the sins of the MIW do not exonerate the
              opposition of theirs..</p>
              <p>anyway, it's a free country... as long as we exercise our
              freedoms... which is there no matter what some deluded people
              say...</p>
              <p>hell, the "evil one" to many, Lau Lee said something in the past
              which is very very true.. <em>the right to swing your arms ends
              where my nose begins</em>...</p>
              <p>go think about that...</p>

              <p>I won't seek to judge you. As you said, I do not have the right, and I agree with you.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are one of those that truly spoil the vote because you don't want to vote for either. I cannot say for sure about the other voters who spoil the votes, whom I am pretty sure are just people who don't want to take responsibility on their country's future.</p>
              <p>Still, the reason why the opposition is in this state today is largely because the MIW has used all means that they have to ensure the opposition cannot grow. Not giving a chance to an opposition to grow, is tantamount to not giving a chance to your future generations to get out of this vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>You may still think that SG today is still good. I tend to believe otherwise, given my views having changed after seeing different systems in the world.</p>
              <p>Our strategy is incorrect. We try to make ourselves cheap and good. But given our city's cost of living, there is only so much 'cheap' that can happen. There will be economic and social consequences in 20 to 30 years time, mark my words.</p>
