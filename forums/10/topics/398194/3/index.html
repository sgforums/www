              <p><br>no wander so experience. in fact because lost money before that's why. Now i know one thing i am better than them. at least i understand never to gamble big and even have to invest always be very careful. and also if i have big funds in any gamble make sure i monitor it day and night every second, and also make sur ethe gambling investment allows me to pull most of the funds out in times or unrest. these people claims they very smart but actually looks more like noobs</p>

              <p>Accuse me, i will like to  rephrase what you called them as noobs, these are president scholars and top investors who works for millions in paid , return and bonuses. Years of trust in the foreign western market had make them complacent as years goes by with very nites having good dining and wineing  with gals and drinking sessions.</p>
              <p>And more so, is that the funds they used are public funds, funds that you and me are in a way forced to pay and contribute thru  laws and orders set by them. They just sit back and play with your money, not theirs, only the profit are theirs. Unlike  private fund managers, he/she have to work hard to get funds, and he/she needs to answer the prople ,s o called shareholders who put their money in the funds, if he perfromed badly, he is gone and can go back to drive taxi or be account teacher in some stupid commerical centre school, because as a funds manager your credibility is very important, once you cannot make a return to the shareholders, the whole financial industrial knew you and you are doom or dome.</p>
              <p> Bout our so called PM or President scholars who do not hold any responsibility nor the need to answer anyone can just walks away free,  and enjoy life, and at the end of the day, they also no need to work hard to rise funds, just increase CPF, ERP, Conservative charges  and consumers price index, the funds willa tuomatically flows in. And with this type of scholars who can hardly survive in a private sector, do you thaink they can invest wisely.</p>
              <p>Again i am not saying they are the noobs, because if you really look closely into it, we are the noobs. No offend. </p>

              <p>Accuse me, i will like to  rephrase what you called them as noobs, these are president scholars and top investors who works for millions in paid , return and bonuses. Years of trust in the foreign western market had make them complacent as years goes by with very nites having good dining and wineing  with gals and drinking sessions.</p>
              <p>And more so, is that the funds they used are public funds, funds that you and me are in a way forced to pay and contribute thru  laws and orders set by them. They just sit back and play with your money, not theirs, only the profit are theirs. Unlike  private fund managers, he/she have to work hard to get funds, and he/she needs to answer the prople ,s o called shareholders who put their money in the funds, if he perfromed badly, he is gone and can go back to drive taxi or be account teacher in some stupid commerical centre school, because as a funds manager your credibility is very important, once you cannot make a return to the shareholders, the whole financial industrial knew you and you are doom or dome.</p>
              <p> Bout our so called PM or President scholars who do not hold any responsibility nor the need to answer anyone can just walks away free,  and enjoy life, and at the end of the day, they also no need to work hard to rise funds, just <strong>increase CPF, ERP, Conservative charges  and consumers price index, the funds will a tuomatically flows in</strong>. And with this type of scholars who can hardly survive in a private sector, do you thaink they can invest wisely.</p>
              <p>Again i am not saying they are the noobs, because if you really look closely into it, we are the noobs. No offend. </p>

              <p>ERP i don't care. Those who can afford it drives, those who cannot but still want to wear big hat can continue driving.</p>
              <p>Conservative charge i agree. so many foreign labor cos already don't why still increase? sometimes after 7am the light in public places still on is that a waste or energy? then charge to residents the cost? again i stress CPF don;t use the term increase. If they after restorating the total amount including ordinary then they increase again i do not mind.</p>

              <p><br>CPF is my alternative savings. This is the way i look at it. Win win for me. They take the money invest, use higher interest pay us back at 100% security to principal amount.</p>
              <p>i am not a risk taker so it works for me.</p>
              <p>But they should restore the deduction back. no more silly excuses.</p>
