            <div class='col-md body'>Day by day it is becoming clear that what we see today may not be what it seems. Take the example of the casino issue. DidnÂ’t our parents at some point in our lives tell us that womanizing, drinking, gambling and smoking are the greatest evils. So why are we being bombarded daily nowadays with all the beautiful reports of having a casino and at the same time the evils of smoking. How much can a Singaporean take it? DonÂ’t you feel like a fool? It is so blatant that having a casino is a black mark and yet it is made out to be like virginal white. This could not be the only isolated incident. Let me make some points:<br><br>1)	If smoking is that bad, why not ban it entirely? It is not beyond the government to take such draconian measures. Remember the policy on chewing gum, the new law of topping up your Medisave or else you goto jail. Is there a hidden agenda? The taxes collected are in the millions, good cash cow. The strategy is to use the propaganda machine to sway public opinion negatively about smoking. Then increase taxes as much as possible so much so that the people even support it. So at the end of the day, the intention is not for the peopleÂ’s good, it is down to $$$. Sounds familiar?<br><br>2)	Having a casino is not about providing jobs for the people, nor having a huge entertainment center for the people. It is about prostitution (it goes hand in hand with a casino, check out Macau and Las Vegas and you will know what I am talking about) , gang activities, gambling addicts (as bad as smokers), broken families. Check Australian national news and you have so many stories about how screwed up some families became as a result of their casinos. You wonÂ’t find these news reported here in Singapore as the propaganda machine is in full swing. Only positives get reported.<br><br>3)	Do you believe that PAP MPÂ’s are so clean. What is not reported is not lying. Look at the Americans, they are experts in this. Why harp only on the oppositionÂ’s shortfalls? We are all human, we canÂ’t be perfect. At every elections, new faces are being drafted, in the name of renewal. But have you noticed that those that are being replaced have failed miserably, but all these kept quiet and swept under the carpet.<br><br>4)	 Has the propaganda machine swayed us so much that we only believe that those with PHDÂ’s and Masters Degrees will be the only ones capable to lead us? LetÂ’s look at the policy so far. Did all these talented people really showed their talent? Some talented ones (TO) created Mediacorp and Mediaworks and look what happened today. TOÂ’s created NEL and SMRT. NEL is bleeding. TOÂ’s did not foresee that we can have a Disneyland here instead of a casino and HK got it. TOÂ’s got really excited about Lucasfilm investing here and they start propaganda about animation. Just read the ending credits for DisneyÂ’s 102 Dalmations plus all subsequent sequels for Lilo and Stitch and you would see that the Koreans are way way ahead. TOÂ’s ideas are all re-inventing the wheel. Remember footballÂ’s Goal 2010 ie. to qualify for the world cup? For all the brilliance of the talents in Singapore, nobody dares to take up the challenge and succeed. It shows a lot about the mettle and credibility of our leaders. They want the easy way out. Give an excuse and close the matter. It is not so easy when real calamities/dangers arrive. There are a whole lot more of such screw=ups by the TOÂ’s when you open your eyes to it. At the end of the day, are they really that talented?<br><br>I am neither pro-opposition nor pro-government. My points are merely to open up more Singaporeans to reality. DonÂ’t be like the sayingÂ” have eyes but are blindÂ”. You will then be doing yourself and your loved ones a great disservice.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What your actually asking for is total transparency with regards to 2) and 3),and sadly, that can never be possible, there is no1 government that would intentionally harm its citizens with social ills, but theres no1 government that would purposefully shoot themselves in the foot, in this case, since the PAP is effectively the majority in the government,to comment on the postives of the opposition would not only be stupid,it would be contradictory.<br><br>Why not ban smoking entirely?<br>If the government actually did that,the state would be leaning to a totalitarian side,moreover,with singapore's new agressiveness to get the FTAs,banning smoking,or cigarettes would appear,however insignifcant it may seem,to become  an obstacle.Just look at the example of the relaxed rule on chewing gums,the apparent consequence of a usa fta.<br><br>another thing to add is that for your 4th point is that it seems a bit too critcal,especially when u stated that "we all are human"and "nobody's perfect"<br>But you are right,koreans are way ahead of us in animation,mediacorp's split was a disaster economically but as far as NEL is concerned,im not sure if it is actually bleeding (if im ignorant plz forgive me),but if it really did have a high cost,it would most likely be unavoidable,as it would probably be resulted from the economic crises that we have faced.As for the football thing, seriously,what can you expect, we are are only an effective 3 million strong population,the other one million would a immigrant pop.,though it would be nice to hear if someone did take that challenge up,i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt,we dont have a "david beckham" or a "pele" or even a "maradonna", what we have is basically just fandi ahmad,and he has since not been playing on the field expect as being the role of a coach,in additon, the funding for soccer is horrendous.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: OllieChong,<br><br>How to be truly efficient, competitive or talented to attain goals and bottom line ?<br><br>Establish all goals and tasks in hands-on doable processes.<br><br>First, let's have a quick overview of management practices.<br><br>Four centuries ago, Mark Twain, has advised: Â“The secret of getting ahead is to get started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex and overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.Â”<br><br>Today, due to the accelerating pace of technologies, many tasks can no longer be carried out by issuing instructions or undoable policies of all kinds.<br><br>Many tasks are inevitably planned out in divisible doable component smaller measures defined in quality-time-cost task relationship or parameters as demonstrated in on-line banking, real-time accounting, e-trading, travel-ticketing, tradenet, computerized logistics and telecommunications etc.<br><br>DOABLE WORK PROCESSES<br><br>Only when our talented scholars are doing tasks in smaller doable steps, such as (1) Study of Ideas, (2) Enquiry, (3) Securing Contracts and (4) Contract Administration (Operations) are they able to mobilise the whole civil service or private sector economy to attain real efficiency and results.<br><br>Only when the top echelon stop talking of all sorts of goals and start getting things done in doable processes by all will they achieve real excellence.<br><br>Operations can easily be set up in departments like: 1.(General) 2.(Human Resource) 3.(Revenue) 4.(Accounts) 5.(Marketing) 6.(Services-all outsourced activities) 7.(Facility) 8.(Enforcement) 9. (Production) 10.(Compliance) as follows:-<br><br>1. Identify 3-4 Core Activities for consistent and focused performance.<br>2. Assign 2-3 quality-time-cost parameters to each core activity.<br>3. Perform Core Activities in sequential workflow detailed in work<br>form to attain parameters.<br><br>Top officers enjoying higher pay should be made responsible for supervision of all administration and operations using simple one-page supervisory Department Reports (checklists), generating feedbacks against parameters as Â“1Â”, Â“2Â” or Â“3Â” (or percentages) representing Â“non-attainmentÂ”, Â“attainmentÂ” and Â“excellent attainmentÂ”.<br><br>There is no use to keep talking about football talents without the real abilities among our own people to come up with doable training work processes where problems are reliably reported in quantified feedback variances or "1s" in a two-way interactive communication task-lines to allow corrective actions by all.<br><br>SEQUENTIAL WORK FORMS<br><br>In summary, if Singapore wants to call itself talented or the best, the question to be asked is: have they made all goals and policies doable at three levels : (1) administrative forms, - head office (2) department reports - operations (3) work forms - knowledge application as stated aforesaid.<br><br>Have they eliminated current complexities the real cause of all the problems, wastages and self-interests attributable to our leaders' fondness to play with IQ and meritocracy of a few.<br><br>Problems caused are mostly due to un-planned intuitive or ad hoc approaches. Many ISOs, handbooks, SOPs, and expensive SPRING training courses and programmes have only created benchmarks unrelated to efficient performance or adopted for advertisement purpose.<br><br>Many governmental and departmental circulars, policies or directives played up by the press over the years as if they are solutions or potential solutions have not solved our problems of high costs, bureaucracy and over-controls which stifle growths, creativity and entrepreneurship.<br><br>Take control of complexities by simplifying tasks into doable processes involving (1) manpower, (2) programs, (3) equipment in time-activity workflows to assure that all Singaporeans will contribute to actual efficiency and productivity.<br><br>Motivate and train all staff to attain organizational efficiency (as opposed to individual efficiency) that can only be better performed with oordination (teamwork) and knowledge application (mass participation) afforded by doable work processes just mentioned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by olliechong:</div><div class="quote_body">Day by day it is becoming clear that what we see today may not be what it seems. Take the example of the casino issue. DidnÂ’t our parents at some point in our lives tell us that womanizing, drinking, gambling and smoking are the greatest evils. So why are we being bombarded daily nowadays with all the beautiful reports of having a casino and at the same time the evils of smoking. How much can a Singaporean take it? DonÂ’t you feel like a fool? It is so blatant that having a casino is a black mark and yet it is made out to be like virginal white. This could not be the only isolated incident. Let me make some points:<br><br>1)	If smoking is that bad, why not ban it entirely? It is not beyond the government to take such draconian measures. Remember the policy on chewing gum, the new law of topping up your Medisave or else you goto jail. Is there a hidden agenda? The taxes collected are in the millions, good cash cow. The strategy is to use the propaganda machine to sway public opinion negatively about smoking. Then increase taxes as much as possible so much so that the people even support it. So at the end of the day, the intention is not for the peopleÂ’s good, it is down to $$$. Sounds familiar?<br><br>2)	Having a casino is not about providing jobs for the people, nor having a huge entertainment center for the people. It is about prostitution (it goes hand in hand with a casino, check out Macau and Las Vegas and you will know what I am talking about) , gang activities, gambling addicts (as bad as smokers), broken families. Check Australian national news and you have so many stories about how screwed up some families became as a result of their casinos. You wonÂ’t find these news reported here in Singapore as the propaganda machine is in full swing. Only positives get reported.<br><br>3)	Do you believe that PAP MPÂ’s are so clean. What is not reported is not lying. Look at the Americans, they are experts in this. Why harp only on the oppositionÂ’s shortfalls? We are all human, we canÂ’t be perfect. At every elections, new faces are being drafted, in the name of renewal. But have you noticed that those that are being replaced have failed miserably, but all these kept quiet and swept under the carpet.<br><br>4)	 Has the propaganda machine swayed us so much that we only believe that those with PHDÂ’s and Masters Degrees will be the only ones capable to lead us? LetÂ’s look at the policy so far. Did all these talented people really showed their talent? Some talented ones (TO) created Mediacorp and Mediaworks and look what happened today. TOÂ’s created NEL and SMRT. NEL is bleeding. TOÂ’s did not foresee that we can have a Disneyland here instead of a casino and HK got it. TOÂ’s got really excited about Lucasfilm investing here and they start propaganda about animation. Just read the ending credits for DisneyÂ’s 102 Dalmations plus all subsequent sequels for Lilo and Stitch and you would see that the Koreans are way way ahead. TOÂ’s ideas are all re-inventing the wheel. Remember footballÂ’s Goal 2010 ie. to qualify for the world cup? For all the brilliance of the talents in Singapore, nobody dares to take up the challenge and succeed. It shows a lot about the mettle and credibility of our leaders. They want the easy way out. Give an excuse and close the matter. It is not so easy when real calamities/dangers arrive. There are a whole lot more of such screw=ups by the TOÂ’s when you open your eyes to it. At the end of the day, are they really that talented?<br><br>I am neither pro-opposition nor pro-government. My points are merely to open up more Singaporeans to reality. DonÂ’t be like the sayingÂ” have eyes but are blindÂ”. You will then be doing yourself and your loved ones a great disservice.<br></div></blockquote>I think the casino issue is already settled --- with some group willing to pump in the money, who cares about the "vocal minority" as the ST puts it. The govt really treats its citizens as morons. The truth is that tourism in Singapore is not going to survive without a major attraction. Sentosa cannot make it, shopping district in singapore cannot compete with those in up and coming cities.<br><br>That Singapore's million-dollar ministers give such low-grade idea makes me think that they are seriously overpaid. I thought paying them high salaries can produce brilliant ideas? I can do better lah. Might as well legalise the sex and porn industry together with the casino. Sure can attract tourists to come, especially after thailand cleaned up its image.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get Anheusier-Busch to build a theme park or Universal Studios.That will bring in a more varied and wide range of tourism dollars from both local and overseas sources.A casino does not appeal to a mass spectrum of the tourism industry.It's a case of simple marketing and economics.I wonder where the hell all our tax money went. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it would be fun to make a small-old temasek -settlement-like theme park.  Our history is unique . One malay village, little india and chinatown in one go  in the old days where we can see malay kids playing games, malay fishermen , chinese coolies and indian chattier men/dobhis go around their business.  Then a time for the "rich" chinese , penarakans , indian and malays to parade about in their finery , i.e. weddings, official meetings etc .AND of course , the stuck up brits in their victorian clothing going about - pushing all asians aside. Handicraft , traditional food stores can be set up.  Streetside hawker eating sites etc.....I think it will boost the economy- create jobs plus allow people to learn history in a combined real time ( rather than in a museum)  and old traditions(educational).  The east india company store can also set up shop.<br><br>The old melting pot of the past where people were segregated yet unified in one common sense of Singapore. Where communities intermingled yet did not integrate totally. Where early identity of Singaporeans were formed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 25, 2004<br><strong>Lasik price cuts raise disturbing question </strong><br>By Salma Khalik<br><br>WHEN patients see a price cut in treatments, the instinctive reaction is to cheer.<br><br>But when prices drop by 40 per cent - or almost $1,000 - within 10 months, then something is probably amiss.<br><br>Hence, the bewilderment that has greeted the new prices at two institutions for lasik operations, which correct short-sightedness.<br><br>The substantial cut in such a short period raises questions about why was the price so high in the first place.<br><br>Was the Singapore National Eye Centre - the most expensive last year but now the cheapest - cavalier in its pricing? Worse, was it trying to rip people off? Or was it just plain inefficient?<br><br>Practical Singaporeans shrug off any need to revisit the past and prefer to jump on the Lasik bandwagon instead.<br><br><strong>But Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan believes it all boils down to consumer ignorance, which has allowed such high charges to remain for so long.</strong><br><br>It was one of the reasons that prompted him to require hospitals here to declare the size of their median bills.<br><br>If ignorance led to the high prices at such institutes, then they speak volumes about their misguided missions.<br><br>It implies carelessness towards cost, indifference towards bringing their healing powers to as many as possible and a cavalier attitude towards pricing.<br><br>Singapore's battle to keep a lid on ever-rising health care costs is well-known. For many years, the Government has urged Singaporeans to do their part by being sensible when seeking treatment.<br><br>Refrain from going for the most expensive when a less-costly treatment brings the same outcome, it continually reminds the people.<br><br>Many Singaporeans have responded even as they come to terms with the inevitable: over time, health care costs will go up.<br><br>But what has unsettled most people, after the Lasik turn of events, is that part of the problem lies with the medical institutes which always had the power to correct the situation.<br><br>The Eye Centre is not the only one to cut its rates, but its revision is the most stark. From being the most expensive, topping even the rates at the private sector's up-market facility in Mount Elizabeth, it is now the cheapest.<br><br>But what sticks in the craw is the way the centres tried initially to justify high prices, saying 'private patients are free to choose any hospital they want'.<br><br>Perhaps the difference of $1,000 means little for doctors and hospital administrators with five-digit salaries.<br><br>Perhaps in their pursuit of quality care, cost was not viewed as a major factor, particularly for a procedure such as lasik which does not receive any Government subsidy.<br><br>Or perhaps, it is just plain apathy by an administration not under pressure to evaluate and do things better.<br><br>Indeed, cost may not even have been on the radar screen of these public-sector organisations, unlike the private sector where bottom-line considerations constantly require them to strive and seek out more efficient ways.<br><br>Whatever the reason, the Health Ministry's publicising of the bills patients pay for similar procedures at different hospitals woke them up to the need to cut waste and fat.<br><br>In the past year, various hospitals have found glaring inefficiencies, such as having too many unnecessary tests or using expensive brand-name drugs when cheaper generics could do the job. The price of several treatments, such as gastroenteritis in children, has since come down.<br><br>Hopefully, they will look beyond the list made public and apply the new approach to all treatments offered.<br><br>This is not only being fair to their local patients, but would also make them more competitive against regional rivals.<br><br><strong>As Mr Khaw notes: 'When there were no regional competitors, we could get away with high prices and there would still be foreign patients coming here. Now that competitors have emerged, we would have to relook and recalibrate.'</strong><br><br>Doctors may have to work harder for the same handsome salaries. But they are not likely to become poorer for it, not when patients and Singapore as a whole will benefit.<br><br>More importantly, it is a moral obligation, especially in the public sector, to provide medical care in the most cost-effective way.<br><br>Make a profit, but do so without over inflating your bottom-line.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">An old article but relevant to the topic. Look at what the Health Minister says! If they can get away with high prices, they will. That is why Singaporeans must be smarter or else we will lose out. As he says, it is due to the consumer ignorance of Singaporeans, so do not blame anyone if you do not become smart enough to see through the illusion.<br></span></div>
