            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by olliechong:</div><div class="quote_body">1)	If smoking is that bad, why not ban it entirely? It is not beyond the government to take such draconian measures. Remember the policy on chewing gum, the new law of topping up your Medisave or else you goto jail. Is there a hidden agenda? The taxes collected are in the millions, good cash cow. The strategy is to use the propaganda machine to sway public opinion negatively about smoking. Then increase taxes as much as possible so much so that the people even support it. So at the end of the day, the intention is not for the peopleÂ’s good, it is down to $$$. Sounds familiar?</div></blockquote>You're right, it is down to money.  Cigarette companies are so rich that they can pretty much destory an economy by pulling out their subdiraries (sp?).  This is a reason many countries (including the almighty US of A) do not ban smoking entirely.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>2)	Having a casino is not about providing jobs for the people, nor having a huge entertainment center for the people. It is about prostitution (it goes hand in hand with a casino, check out Macau and Las Vegas and you will know what I am talking about) , gang activities, gambling addicts (as bad as smokers), broken families. Check Australian national news and you have so many stories about how screwed up some families became as a result of their casinos. You wonÂ’t find these news reported here in Singapore as the propaganda machine is in full swing. Only positives get reported. </strong></blockquote>Now, how many stories is that exactly??  It's easy to say "so many" and assign blame to something you think something is wrong.  Give an actual figure and don't exeggrate.<br><br>Irresponisble people make irresponisble choice, it's not what's given to them.  Just like drunk driving, stabbings or houses catching on fire.  You can't blame having cars, alcohol, stoves, kitchen knives for all the bad things that happens because some idiot can't think.  And trust me more of those incidents (that I mentioned above) happen then families being broken up because of a casino.<br><br>Casinos provide as much good as they do bad, just like cars and knives, etc.<br>It's up to the people to use them responisbly.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>3)	Do you believe that PAP MPÂ’s are so clean. What is not reported is not lying. Look at the Americans, they are experts in this. Why harp only on the oppositionÂ’s shortfalls? We are all human, we canÂ’t be perfect. At every elections, new faces are being drafted, in the name of renewal. But have you noticed that those that are being replaced have failed miserably, but all these kept quiet and swept under the carpet.</strong></blockquote>Ever spend an election year in the US?  Trust me you'll be sick of all the trash that goes on TV.  Sometimes you'll just wish they focus on how to excerise their policies instead of trashing the canidate on what he did 30 years ago.  And some of these commericals are approved by the 'most powerful man in the world'.<br><br>I don't know how it works in Singapore but in a democracy, the people have the power with their vote.  If you don't like the way the party/canidate do the job then don't vote for them.  Looking from the outside, I can't say that they have done a bad job running the country.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>4)	 Has the propaganda machine swayed us so much that we only believe that those with PHDÂ’s and Masters Degrees will be the only ones capable to lead us? LetÂ’s look at the policy so far. Did all these talented people really showed their talent? Some talented ones (TO) created Mediacorp and Mediaworks and look what happened today. TOÂ’s created NEL and SMRT. NEL is bleeding. TOÂ’s did not foresee that we can have a Disneyland here instead of a casino and HK got it. TOÂ’s got really excited about Lucasfilm investing here and they start propaganda about animation. Just read the ending credits for DisneyÂ’s 102 Dalmations plus all subsequent sequels for Lilo and Stitch and you would see that the Koreans are way way ahead. TOÂ’s ideas are all re-inventing the wheel. Remember footballÂ’s Goal 2010 ie. to qualify for the world cup? For all the brilliance of the talents in Singapore, nobody dares to take up the challenge and succeed. It shows a lot about the mettle and credibility of our leaders. They want the easy way out. Give an excuse and close the matter. It is not so easy when real calamities/dangers arrive. There are a whole lot more of such screw=ups by the TOÂ’s when you open your eyes to it. At the end of the day, are they really that talented?</strong></blockquote>Propaganda only works when people start buying into them.  That's all I have to say about that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first of all, why are we complaining so much about everything and yet asking for everything? Fact of life is, we are indeed fearful to face up to the harsh environments. The fact that walking along the streets after 1am and still be safe even till the wee hours of the morning can be done outside of singapore? Go try it and i think you might be poorer or i wont get to know what happened to you. Do you think all of this is available by 'nature'? Go take a look at the african continents where raping and killing is such a common pasture that their kids take no fear or effect from killing or the death of a love one.<br><br>Gambling is such a universal thing but why make it so critical? Yes it brings social ills, Yes it brings many undesired factors into our lives but thats life. Everyone in the world is doing it and they survived and lived it except for us. Its like abortion and prostitution. We all know the health risks and social ills but we do it anyway. If you want to make a difference start with yourself and avoid social ills and encourage others to do what is responsible. If not, then complaining 100% of the time wont help except to waste space on this forum and incur more costs.</div>

He is the man who built SAF from scratch and he is the man who made sure singapore has every capability we now have today. Yes, we all have to serve NS because of him but do you think we have alot of regulars in the army now? If not for the concept of the civilian army, we would have a very pathetic force and may not be singapore we know today.

Yes, we all have to serve NS because of him but do you think we have alot of regulars in the army now? If not for the concept of the civilian army, we would have a very pathetic force and may not be singapore we know today.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by olliechong:</div><div class="quote_body">Day by day it is becoming clear that what we see today may not be what it seems. Take the example of the casino issue. DidnÂ’t our parents at some point in our lives tell us that womanizing, drinking, gambling and smoking are the greatest evils. So why are we being bombarded daily nowadays with all the beautiful reports of having a casino and at the same time the evils of smoking. How much can a Singaporean take it? DonÂ’t you feel like a fool? It is so blatant that having a casino is a black mark and yet it is made out to be like virginal white. This could not be the only isolated incident. Let me make some points:<br><br>1)	If smoking is that bad, why not ban it entirely? It is not beyond the government to take such draconian measures. Remember the policy on chewing gum, the new law of topping up your Medisave or else you goto jail. Is there a hidden agenda? The taxes collected are in the millions, good cash cow. The strategy is to use the propaganda machine to sway public opinion negatively about smoking. Then increase taxes as much as possible so much so that the people even support it. So at the end of the day, the intention is not for the peopleÂ’s good, it is down to $$$. Sounds familiar?<br><br>2)	Having a casino is not about providing jobs for the people, nor having a huge entertainment center for the people. It is about prostitution (it goes hand in hand with a casino, check out Macau and Las Vegas and you will know what I am talking about) , gang activities, gambling addicts (as bad as smokers), broken families. Check Australian national news and you have so many stories about how screwed up some families became as a result of their casinos. You wonÂ’t find these news reported here in Singapore as the propaganda machine is in full swing. Only positives get reported.<br><br>3)	Do you believe that PAP MPÂ’s are so clean. What is not reported is not lying. Look at the Americans, they are experts in this. Why harp only on the oppositionÂ’s shortfalls? We are all human, we canÂ’t be perfect. At every elections, new faces are being drafted, in the name of renewal. But have you noticed that those that are being replaced have failed miserably, but all these kept quiet and swept under the carpet.<br><br>4)	 Has the propaganda machine swayed us so much that we only believe that those with PHDÂ’s and Masters Degrees will be the only ones capable to lead us? LetÂ’s look at the policy so far. Did all these talented people really showed their talent? Some talented ones (TO) created Mediacorp and Mediaworks and look what happened today. TOÂ’s created NEL and SMRT. NEL is bleeding. TOÂ’s did not foresee that we can have a Disneyland here instead of a casino and HK got it. TOÂ’s got really excited about Lucasfilm investing here and they start propaganda about animation. Just read the ending credits for DisneyÂ’s 102 Dalmations plus all subsequent sequels for Lilo and Stitch and you would see that the Koreans are way way ahead. TOÂ’s ideas are all re-inventing the wheel. Remember footballÂ’s Goal 2010 ie. to qualify for the world cup? For all the brilliance of the talents in Singapore, nobody dares to take up the challenge and succeed. It shows a lot about the mettle and credibility of our leaders. They want the easy way out. Give an excuse and close the matter. It is not so easy when real calamities/dangers arrive. There are a whole lot more of such screw=ups by the TOÂ’s when you open your eyes to it. At the end of the day, are they really that talented?<br><br>I am neither pro-opposition nor pro-government. My points are merely to open up more Singaporeans to reality. DonÂ’t be like the sayingÂ” have eyes but are blindÂ”. You will then be doing yourself and your loved ones a great disservice.<br></div></blockquote>The greatest deception are the two opposition puppets in parliament.<br><br>WP has become Weaklings Party without JBJ.<br><br>When LKY talks JBJ rebuts him.<br><br>Low is really lousy.</div>
