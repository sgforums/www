That he and his PAP cronies are now justifying their daylight robbery by claiming the credit for the foundation built by one man is simply outrageous.<br><br>Those who don't know history will repeat it. Those who don't know who REALLY contributed will be exploited by the PRETENDERS!<br><br>As these PRETENDERS heap millions upon themselves, is a pension more generous than any they reward themselves given to Dr Albert Winsemius' widow?<br><br>Is a generous trust fund and foundation be set up for the Winsemius' family for their patriarch's immense contribution to Singapore - more so than all the PAP past, present &amp; future combined?<br><br>want to learn more about him....<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/main.asp?webtag=sammyboymod&amp;nav=messages&amp;msg=137578&amp;prettyurl=%2Fsammyboymod%2Fmessages%2F%3Fmsg%3D137578" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/main.asp?webtag=sammyboymod&amp;nav=messages&amp;msg=137578&amp;prettyurl=%2Fsammyboymod%2Fmessages%2F%3Fmsg%3D137578</a><br><br>Did ever Mr Lee Kuan Yew mention about this guy?NO!!!
