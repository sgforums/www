She will never be able to do a good job, no matter how good she may be. If she did something well, people will say it's her husband who blows her trumpet. If she does badly, people will say her husband hides her faults.<br><br>In contrast, Lee Hsien Yang is smart to step down whilst the going is good. He leaves at a time when Singtel has made lots of profits and he has plenty of bonus in his bank account. Ho Ching has left it too late but rather late than never.<br><br>However the Shin Corp issue will pan out, Temasek is likely to lose money and even her husband has said that if Temasek loses money over Shin Corp, they will have to be held to account. Having her husband, being Minister of Finance, as effectively the regulator of Temasek is a bad idea from the start. Whatever fault is attributed to Temasek eventually, LHL cannot escape responsibility as the regulator. The question will be raised as to why the Minister for Finance had been sleeping on the watch. He can hardly distance himself from the CEO, as he could if someone else held that position. The fact that his wife is head of Temasek will no doubt cast suspicion on his independence whilst carrying out his duties, even if he is beyond reproach.<br><br>Justice has to be done and seen to be done. In view of Ho Ching's relationship to LHL, any mistake she makes will have an adverse impact on her husband, the ruling party and the entire government. In other words, she is becoming a liability for the government. Get rid of her before it is too late.<br></a><br><br>What happened to you recently???<br><br>Did you knocked yourself on the head again, or, did you take my advice and went for a lobotomy???<br><br>You felt very strongly against Ho Ching being the CEO for Temasex, then you took a 180 degrees turn here.

When do we ever agreed we have enough money! Its the same all over the world. Gov takes from private citizens. You are saying that too little capital has been injecting into domestics economy. how much it can inject before inflation kicks in, and bare in mind which sector are absorbing the surplus? i believe some funds already inject into private sector by releasing some CPF into banking lenders for HDB flats and insurance. To maintain the incremental rate of higher income faster than the incremental rate of inflation is not easy.<br><br>The surplus capital has to keep up inflation rate and finance domestics consumption.  given the size of SG economy, lack of domestics economy n import everything under the Sun.  Surplus capitals are thus channel back into the system to finance consumption.  The alternative way to finance doemestics consumption is thus thru off shore lending or accqusition of asset.<br><br>As said, how it was done and the way it was done was in question.  i did not disagreed the lack of transparency due to the fact that a prolong single party in power, such as political appointees n spouses and cultivating a system of elites etc. But does not necessary implied that the approach to treatment or strategy to deal with surplus were wrong or the intend was corrupted.<br><br>As mention oversea capital investment were to maintain regional growth so that SG can substain growth path. Spillover benefit intend to be comparative advantage with the region. It was not intended as AIDs. Channeling of funds thru gov agency are done throughout globally. As for any investment there are Risk, Even for top investment bank they too suffered the lost of such as Sub Prime.<br><br>what is lack by Sg gov is a basic system of social welfare program that helps if a person fall off the economic cliff and i think over the last 40 years it has crowd out the private human resources and cannibalized social resources.<br><br>Failure by GCK to reform the government in separating civil servant and political party afflation resulted in an ever expanding size of government role. The continuing perception of Talent for gov vs Talent for private sectors are identical will continue to spiral inward for SG economies.<br><br>At the end of the day it takes 2 hands to clap, gov are made up of people; both citizen and gov too fail to rise to meet the expectation. Hopefully diversify Sg demographics will help to transform some of its weakness in the system.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

The Singapore companies plan to appeal the decision in Indonesia's district court.<br><br>The five-member panel from Indonesia's anti-monopoly agency took more than three hours to read out its verdict on a case closely watched by foreign investors in the country.<br><br>The panel said Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings and its subsidiaries were guilty of monopoly practices through their cross ownership of two of Indonesia's largest mobile phone companies Â– Telkomsel and Indosat.<br><br>Temasek owns 56 percent of SingTel, which has a 35 percent stake in Telkomsel.<br><br>And Singapore Technologies Telemedia, which Temasek fully owns, controls 75 percent of Asia Mobile Holdings (AMH). AMH, in turn, owns 40 percent of Indosat.<br><br>Indonesia's competition law stipulates that a foreign company or business group cannot have more than a 50 percent share in an Indonesian business outfit.<br><br>Temasek has argued that it does not directly hold majority shares in each of the Indonesian mobile phone companies.<br><br>But the panel is maintaining that Temasek had violated cross-ownership regulations and, as a result, dominates 80 percent of the market.<br><br>According to the panel, Temasek and its units have control over appointments of key posts and have access to sensitive information from the two companies. Therefore, they are able to dictate the market.<br><br>Temasek has maintained that the Indonesian government actually holds majority stakes in Telkomsel and a golden share in Indosat.<br><br>But the panel rejected this notion, saying the government is not a business entity and its shareholding is in the national interest.<br><br>TemasekÂ’s lawyer said the decision has plunged Indonesia into a crisis of confidence in the country's legal system.<br><br>Lawyers from Temasek and ST Telemedia said the watchdog's decision is not final and they plan to file an appeal to the country's district court within two weeks.<br><br>In a statement, Temasek's executive director Simon Israel said the decision "makes no sense" and "ignored the facts".<br><br>He added that the charge is groundless because Temasek has no shares in Indosat and Telkomsel, and has played no role in business decisions and operations of both companies.<br><br>And as the Indonesian government controls Telkomsel and has a golden share in Indosat, Mr Israel said it is inconceivable that the government and telecomm regulator would allow prices to be fixed.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia spoke to a political analyst who believes the ruling sends caution and concern for all investors.<br><br>Simon Tay, Chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said: "This kind of signal can be badly read by the international community.<br><br>"I think companies need to invest in political risk, invest in goodwill so it really benefits the Indonesian people or whichever country you're investing in, as well as the shareholders."<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
