            <div class='col-md body'>wow ok i was trying to stop you from looking silly, but if that's how it's going to be, here goes. By the way, you must be taking lessons from Andrew. This is the exact kind of denial he goes into when faced with proof.<br><br>Details!<br><br><blockquote>Has Gazelle got me by the horns ? </blockquote>yes, yes he has. His math here is infinitely more sound than yours. If you read my previous posts, you would have understood where you went wrong.<br><br><blockquote>That is only his vain dream, and your own mistaken perception from a flawed point of view - especially when you are not certain of the infamous Gazelle antics.<br></blockquote>I don't have to know how Gazelle used to act, because I spotted your error independently. It's wrong. Just look at it.<br><br><blockquote>Why will you suspect that I have deliberately misuse the quote tags to prevent others from quoting my posts ? </blockquote>Probably because you did it twice in a row on posts you were destined to be rebutted on?<br><br><blockquote>Is this your excuse in not putting an effort to work on your views ? </blockquote>No, that's my complaint. Notice I still went ahead and tried to point out kindly why you were wrong. But hey, gloves are off now since you requested it(rather unkindly btw)<br><br><blockquote>In my exchange with CX in the other thread ''Pedra Branca D-Day is 6 Nov'' - CX and I have no difficulty in quoting each of our posts even as we presented our respective replies by breaking up entire passages into individual issues that were seemingly important to be clear. {See our exchange on Page 3 of the referenced thread dated 13 Nov 2007 12.01 PM onwards} </blockquote>You will of course agree with me that this has no relevance as to whether you botched up the quoting in the two long posts before. You may have passed primary school math years ago, but you still screwed up a simple problem sum here on this thread.<br><br><blockquote>Gazelle's calculated reasoning was not erroneous, except that his interpretation of my position was wrong - as he did not read the manner in which I had posted my sentences with words purposefully and carefully chosen that sought clarification, as much as pressing in the same general direction.<br><br>I had hoped that you were able to discern this fact in stating that you had been able ''to read between the lines'' - evidently you did not. </blockquote>Actually if you scroll up a little, I redid your calculations based on your interpretation(which is obviously wrong btw, but more on that later) and revealed how even with your interpretation, your math was still wrong.<br><br><blockquote>What makes you think that the banker only lost 10% of the portfolio with only 3 investments ?</blockquote>I don't. Just like you don't know if he made a net profit of 20% in the end. But like i said, the onus is on you to develop the argument. And without any real information, all you're sprouting is pure fiction.<br><br><blockquote>Even in a private enterprise, the CEO of Citibank was forced to quit on one single Sub-prime issue despite his sterling records over the years leading Citibank.<br><br>What makes you think that Temasek's dealings with PUBLIC MONEY should be treated with more generosity ? </blockquote>Public vs Private. Job security. We know the drill. Need i say more?<br><br><blockquote>Somehow, in your own inflated view of your position as an observer without committing your own position on this subject until this event occurred, you have the audacity to pass judgement on the views that others dare to publicly post. </blockquote>In the reality that I live in, we do not consider mathematical answers "views". They are facts. Which alternate dimension did you say you came from again?<br><br><blockquote>How relevant are your views in your flawed responses to everyone's stated positions, when we have at least given you the courtesy to give your unsolicited criticism made in such a condescending tone ? </blockquote>math is wrong, your point goes the same way. When I point out your terrible math errors, that's pretty relevant. Considering your answer happens to be on the opposite side of zero compared to the actual answer. (by the way, see how hard it is to understand posts when they're written this way?)<br><br><blockquote>The mathematical calculation itself was not flawed, but its outcome depended on the correct interpretation of the '2 percent paring' - which was offered as a question.</blockquote>According to my dictionary, which I can only assume is VERY different from the one you brought over from the beyond, there is only one interpretation of "2 percent paring". It means '2 percent, a sliver'. How you can compare that with "almost 50%" is beyond me. Ever seen a big sliver? That's because it doesn't exist.<br><br>Also, look at it again. Your math calculation was wrong, whatever the interpretation was. 2 out of 5.9 is not even remotely close to 50%.<br><br><blockquote>In your own anxiety to hit the nail on the head, have you considered the fact that it was reported that - the current high level of divestment activities from China's state owned banks is an attempt by Temasek at window dressing, after its public statement reported in an earlier August 2007 Reuter's article - ''Temasek reported a 29 percent drop in net profit to S$9.1 billion ($6 billion) for its 2006/07 financial year, from S$12.8 billion a year ago, on lower divestment gains and an impairment charge on Thai telecoms firm Shin Corp , which lost one third of its stock market value during the period''. </blockquote>Not sure if you understand the phrase "drop in net profit". That means Temasek isn't in the red. Because I understand how investments work before i make silly posts way out of my league, I also understand what a stop loss or profit realization is. Another advantage of mine is that due to the common sense I happen to be in possession of, I understand there is no need for Temasek to hide the fact that they are still making money. To hear you speak, any investment that loses money in the short run is doing something wrong.<br><br><blockquote>The fact remains that with so many years of non-transparent disclosures, and so many attempts at window dressing the Annual Reports prior to the Financial Year coming to a close - how certain can anyone of us be that Temasek will come up on top of all the losses ? </blockquote>Temasek investments are none of your business. Unproven alleged "attempts at window dressing".  I think that covers it in the least amount of words necessary.<br><br><blockquote>Until a full and complete transparent public audit is carried independently, how will you know that Singaporean funds are in safe hands ? </blockquote>I urge you to understand how funds work before talking about transparency.<br><br><blockquote>From the declaration made by the PRC Government in setting the goals for its own China Investment Corporation in managing its own cash reserves - which was reportedly recently to have reached USD1 TRILLION - it clearly shows that it has seen the flaws with the manner that Temasek is being managed. </blockquote>OR, it could mean that they are a different country with different goals. Or maybe the PRC government is run in a different manner. Or maybe their economic status is vastly different from Singapore's.<br><br>Seriously, which is more plausible? My alternatives, or your interpretation? Keep in mind Temasek is currently PROFITABLE.<br><br><blockquote>Even the political model of a strong ONE PARTY RULE that Singapore has offered is not accepted by the PRC Government. </blockquote>This point of yours puzzles me. The monarchy rule of britain was not supported by the americans. They even fought a war over it. I guess that proves Britain should be in shambles today.<br><br>What exactly were you trying to say here? The PRC government is suddenly the expert in governance?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, let's settle the issue once and for all.<br><br>Whoever thinks that Temasek Holdings is not being transparent, please do engage any or all of the big 4 accounting firms (ie KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) and do a thorough audit. Of course, you pay for the auditing process lar.<br><br>Until we have the full facts and figures, what we are arguing here is just based on an incomplete set of data. There's no point extrapolating conclusions from such a limited set of data as extrapolation is inherently flawed by itself.<br><br>Unless we have a full set of facts and figures, what everyone here is arguing about amounts to little more than hot air.<br><br>And one last point I wish to make, although Temasek Holdings is a sovereign wealth fund (SWF), I do not wish to judge it by the sovereignty it is created by. Rather, when judging such SWFs, including others like Norway Pension Fund, Dubai International Capital, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority etc, we should just it based on its financial performance and just financial performance alone.<br><br>There is really no point basing your judgement of such SWFs on the type of government it represents. After all, an autocratic government with less-than-ideal transparency does not necessarily mean that it manages its wealth badly.</div>
