The rest of the funds would be spent on Agricultural Bank of China and China Development Bank. The bank acquisitions are likely to be profitable for CIC.

I think they took over this company for at least 500 million (guessing, can't remember the exact figures, could be more) some 4 years back. They thought they could turn around a chapter 11 company (bankrupt) within 1-2 years, but they failed miserably.
