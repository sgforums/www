              <p>for me, i kinda think starbucks as the `macdonalds of the world' when i travel. the choices are safe and predictible. especially in areas where you are not familiar with, starbucks and macdonalds offer safe choices. here in singapore, i frequent it much less as i am obviously familiar with the surroundings here, and a nice cuppa costs only s$1 here.</p>
              <p>when overseas, i actually frequent starbucks, esp. breakfast becos it actually saves me money, more for my employer actually. the breakfast in my hotel will set me back s$35, so starbucks breakfast for less than s$10 is a good deal. my hr will be happier too. and if i eat out, it's also easier to order. real life experience in seoul, korea where it is virtually impossible to order food at food joints becos they don't speak a word of english. but at the starbucks in seoul, there will be at least 1 staff who speaks english. so, it is really a convenient factor for me.</p>

              <p>if you ever have a chance to go to guangdong province, `chow si' or smuggling is rampant. officials all thru' the foodchain are `bought'. my business associates can slip thru' products to any countries outside china without passing thru' proper channels.</p>
              <p>there, you can also buy jeans for s$1 and nice jackets for s$3-5 if you know where to look. some are rejects but there are alot also that slips thru' the backdoor of factories, etc.</p>

              <p>Yes.. they expanded so fast.. it's ridiculous..</p>
              <p>In fact some cities banned starbucks from starting up store there. Because they can't stand the invasion.</p>
              <p>Yah, I also wonder how starbucks can survive in China.</p>
              <p>It's crazy to pay so much for a cup of coffee.</p>
              <p>But then again.. they pay for the novelty. And starbucks is like a place you go to be seen.</p>
              <p>Fancy paying $50 for a tub of ice cream in China.. they call it a treat !!</p>
