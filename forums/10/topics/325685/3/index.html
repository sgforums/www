              <p>so, how does that refute my earlier reply to you? it actually reinforced what i said.</p>
              <p>you still do not get my point. your last sentence about enabling banks to venture overseas due to this consolidation doesn't hold, because crisis or not, m&amp;a is happening already.</p>
              <p>and was it explicitly mentioned in your link that consolidation allow singapore banks acquiring `crippling banks in the region' or that it is a strategic objective to merge so singapore banks can acquire `crippling banks' overseas? as it states explicitly, it is a matter of survival.</p>
              <p>your 2 `tests' and small A talking (OoO) again?</p>
              <p>you still have not shown me the facts.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Please dont try to discount the work MAS has done to ensure the survival of Singapore banking system during the crisis, because many big US banks have failed while trying to stay afloat.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is always easy to speak like an armchair critics after the dust has settled down, but without liquidity and financial muscle, how on earth is our local banks able to be opportunistic by venture overseas?</span></em></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>6) This is my reply</strong></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">You have to remember that YOU have specifically asking me about the health of Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;">banks</span> during the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">financial crisis</span>.

              <p>1. you made 2 premise in your posts about banking in singapore which are highly debatable. i merely addressed these 2 points. to get my second point across, i need to reference other country and industry to get it across. i am not sure if you deliberately duck my replies to you or you really do not understand.</p>
              <p>2. on your constant tirade about my going out of point (which i didn't btw), aren't you the bigger culprit when we were talking lattes and you suddenly jumped in and talk banks?</p>
              <p>or are you the fall guy for lionnoisy becos his thread is so bad and illogical that you have to come in and play hero? he must have thank you profusely because instead of him looking the part of a fool, you actually surpass that with you nonsensical tirade about banks, when all we want to talk here is double expresso and a flat white.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Didnt I answer your question concerning about Singapore banks? If you think that we should compare Singapore bank performance to other bank, then can you tell us which bank should we be comparing because there are 1000s of different banks in this world, and how do you want to compare the bank performance?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Although the article is talking about ANZ bank, however what I was trying to highlight is that ANZB bad loan provision is due to homegrown domestic problem, such as deteriorating of credit condition and Australia housing market, and not simply CDOs exposure.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And obviously that is the main reason why Starbucks is closing so many branches across australia isnt it?  </span></p>

              <p>I think you have got it wrong again.</p>
              <p>When I am quote the article about ANZ Bank, I am not interested to talk about bank, or suggest that starbucks decision is due to ANZ bank, but rather the bleak outlook of the Australia economy due to <span style="color: #000000;">deteriorating of credit condition and Australia housing market. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are already an adult who is paying your own bills and mortgage, you should know that housing loan is the biggest liability for any household or individual during uncertain time, especially when mortgage interest is above 9%. hence you should know how big the impact it is going to be on the an economy that has been supported by people who are highly geared.  </span></p>
              <p>As you have rightly pointed out, it is a business decision based on facts, numbers, not emotions and gut feeling, and that why starbucks are still keeping 23 stores in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CBD areas</span></strong> only.</p>

              <p>yeah, i did. i am just having some fun with your moronic statement, but it doesn't mean i want to discuss with you further. you makes no sense after your your litany of trip and stumble with your replies, which ended with you asking me what i my question to you was.</p>
              <p>sorry, but i am in no mood for small talks with you.</p>
              <p>you have your work cut out for you with your property and stock market discussion, so keep at it. </p>
