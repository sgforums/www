              <p>I believe it is due to good spectulation from the owners as Australia has been holding off pretty well thus far in the oil crisis by having high interest rates. and is predicted to  free-fall soon. Investors are thus withdrawing capital in Australia before their mony devalues to nothingness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said that Aussie will bottom in 2-3 years before it picks up again.</p>

              <p>noisy, you continue to baffle me with your utter lack of intelligence to grasp almost anything.</p>
              <p>starbucks is going thru' a bad patch right now and not only its aussie's operations are affected. the ones in north america is equally brutal.</p>
              <p>let me anticipate your next question, `what about our lion(noisy) city? how come we do so well still?"</p>
              <p>well, the only reason is starbucks in singapore is run by bonfood, which is not a direct operation from starbucks inc like the US or elsewhere, including australia. one will not know if starbucks is doing well here. bonfood could be taking its losses by the chin or they are indeed making money. if push comes to shove, bonfood may indeed close some of their outlets here in singapore. i was just at plaza singapura at lunch catching up with an old friend and the starbucks there is not filled to the brim like it usually is.</p>
              <p>if you follow the starbucks story, you would know that it went on a growth rampage 2-3 years back where the ceo proclaim that it will open 2-3 stores every day around the world. it even took on traditional expresso joints in mediterranean europe, considered untouchables. perhaps arrogance has gotten in a way of starbucks management; which is why they are reeling now. i am not fond of writing at lengths here, so if you search sites like businessweek or the wall street journal sites, i am sure you will read about starbucks' business challenges now.</p>
              <p>if you must whip australia, pls find something more meaningful to post. or at least do your homework first.</p>
              <p>because almost everything you slimed on australia has boomeranged back in your face.</p>

              <p><br>i have heard of this before recently, some predict a hard landing towards the end of this year but most frens there i spoke with said this is just a correction, nothing in the scale of what we saw in the states side.</p>
              <p>one reason for this is the crippling interest rate that is charge for housing loans and a streneous checks on affordability or repayment by home loaners is buffering the `fall'. the homes affordability index is rising in australia, in other words, aussies are less able to afford housing there due to various reasons. other factors include the rebuilding of housing in key cities like melbourne is does not equal to the numbers of (old) housing torn/making way for redevelopment. that buffered the dd/ss of housing from collapsing. some form of corrections is expected after almost 5 years of continous housing boom down under.</p>
              <p>now, the question for you is, does singapore banking sector grew and grew each year? and with the economic meltdown that happened not too long ago, were our big 4 continue to post healthy growth and profits?</p>

              <p>I believe the underlying reasons is very similar to USA and UK market, where majority of the Australians are spreading themselves too thin with hope that their lifestyle will be financed by their "ever appreciating" property investment. And I also believe that the growth in Australia over the past few years are mostly related to the mining industry and thats why property in perth are now one of the most expensive in Australia.</p>
              <p>And now that the property prices is starting decline while interest rate remain high (due to inflation) most home owners will very soon be holding on to negative asset properties and fore closures will rise.</p>
              <p>During the last Asia financial crisis, which center around SE Asia, several banks (OUB, Keppel Bank, Tat Lee Bank) in Singapore merged and that has given them the additional size and liquidity to go around the region to acquire crippliing foreign banks.  Hence to answer you questions, the financial crisis didnt actually slow Singapore bank down, it actually gave them the opportunity to venture overseas.</p>

              <p><br>Please dont try to talk yourself up by calling other names because this sort of behavior are always linked to sore losers who are running out of facts to support his argument.</p>
              <p>Our discussion started when I  posted a link to ANZ Bank article, and you started questioning me about Singapore banks during the financial crisis. Hence our conversation should be talking about financial, Singapore and Aussie banks.</p>
              <p>Hence I am just puzzled why you suddenly started talking about San Miguel, Malaysia Maybank and telling us that M&amp;A happens all the time. Who are you trying to impress? Yourself who is living in the well?</p>

              <p>like i said, you are entitled to walk your narrow plank. when you mentioned <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"how on earth is our local banks able to be opportunistic by venture overseas?"</span></em></strong>  you yourself expanded the topic of discussion. so, you pull back your OB line just because your bootlicking claim about your allmighty government is only capable of doing the right thing is disputed?</p>
              <p>and btw, what facts have you posted on this thread?</p>

              <p>now, the question for you is, does <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>singapore banking sector</strong></span> grew and grew each year? and with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>economic meltdown that happened not too long ago</strong></span>, were our big 4 continue to post healthy growth and profits?</p>
