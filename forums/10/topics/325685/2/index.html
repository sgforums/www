              <p>When you ask me the below question, (i repeat, it is a question from YOU to me asking about Singapore banks during the finacial crisis) how on earth am I supposed to know that I cant talk about Singapore banks going on a shopping spree during the Asian financial crisis. which btw I am inviting you to challenge me if you think that is not FACTS.  </p>

              <p>There is a link to the <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/news_room/parliamentary_questions/2001/Ministerial_Statement_by_DPM_Lee_Hsien_Loong_on_Banking_Consolidation__11_Jul_2001.html">facts</a></strong> which you have been asking for.</p>
              <p>I have created a link to the word 'facts' because the url address to the MAS article is too long for your arse if you know what I mean.</p>

              <p>During the last Asia financial crisis, which center around SE Asia, several banks (OUB, Keppel Bank, Tat Lee Bank) in Singapore merged and that has given them the additional size and liquidity to go around the region to acquire crippliing foreign banks.  Hence to answer you questions, the financial crisis didnt actually slow Singapore bank down, it actually gave them the opportunity to venture overseas.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>don't kid yourself, it is a matter of survival. otherwise some of these banks would have gone under.</em></span></p>
              <p>so, how does that refute my earlier reply to you? it actually reinforced what i said.</p>
              <p>you still do not get my point. your last sentence about enabling banks to venture overseas due to this consolidation doesn't hold, because crisis or not, m&amp;a is happening already.</p>
              <p>and was it explicitly mentioned in your link that consolidation allow singapore banks acquiring `crippling banks in the region' or that it is a strategic objective to merge so singapore banks can acquire `crippling banks' overseas? as it states explicitly, it is a matter of survival.</p>
              <p>your 2 `tests' and small A talking (OoO) again?</p>
              <p>you still have not shown me the facts.</p>
