              It is due to economy slow down and a drop in consumer spending power. So Starbucks need to reinvent themselve by coming out with cheaper product mix and reducing operation cost, in order to stay relevant in uncertain times. 
              
              I hope you are not going to argue that the changes in consumer lifestyle has got nothing to do with the economic slow down.

              <p><br>Jojo, if you dont have basic knowledge in business studies or marketing, my advice to you is to avoid spreading yourself too thin bcause that wil really expose your weaknesses.</p>
              <p>a) Setting up smaller stalls for Starbucks is like comparing running a restaurant (which you own the whole premise) to running a stall in the food court selling similar food. The only difference is that in a resturant, you are expected to pay more for the services and ambient, while in the food court you are only paying for the food.</p>
              <p>That JOJO, this is an example reinventing themselves to ensure that their coffee business remain relevent even during the economic slow down.</p>
              <p>b) When you claim that they can still keep their "BRAND" in the market just by focusing on the stores they already established, it only goes to show your lack of knowledge in brand building.</p>
              <p>When you have lesser stores, you have less channel of communication with your customers, less brand awareness and you will have less product distribution channel. When that happens, you will lose marketshare and destory your brand value.</p>

              <p><br>Starbucks is already a branded coffee... But what are the chances that if you wanted to drink from Starbucks and you're in Pasir Ris while the store is in Jurong?</p>
              <p>By upp-ing more stores all over the place and in this case capitalising on the market where they is a constant traffic(Supermarket) it captures the market, imbueing a stronger "on-the-go" coffee movement. You may get a drink and what better than a coffee bean while grocery shopping</p>
              <p>While for the price variance, some strings of shops do differ prices from location to location due to the rental differences, but some do not have to. Usually the factors to consider would be outbound franchise or inhouse franchise shops. In-house franchise would most likely be able to absorb the price indifference due to the increased traffic from the location of the shop as well as over-all profits from branding due to the what can be described as a pseudo-omnipresence. Whereas in the reversed position due to branding or specialty, the coffee might invite standard prices.</p>
              <p>The hypothesis for CBD shops would be it serves as a meeting place between for business enterprise representatives and clients(hypothically speaking). As well as a overall well-balanced traffic due to the location. Also consider that employees do not actually pay for the purchases(claimable) in some of the cases thus the increased spending power(also consider the affluence of the office working class).</p>
              <p>And there is no need to debate about these, I'm sure coffee bean has consulted analysts(be it inhouse or external parties) and concluded that this would prove to be beneficial, while it might not yield good rewards or even losses, it is a analysed decision that should be well-backed and propose to the related parties before it is implemented.</p>

              <p>The main reason might be because of the weather in Singapore. In Germany or any other European countries, the external temperature is usually very cooling. It is indeed a pleasure to buy a nice cup of hot coffee or tea, and sit outside the cafe, enjoying the cool breeze, the warm sun and the sight and view of people walking around doing their daily things.</p>

              <p><br>i think the high price that Starbucks charges there could contain elements of bribery inside.</p>

              <p><br>I remembered when they open their flagship store in Liat Towers, there was like long queue everday. But I guess with the passage of time, the novelty wears off and moreover there are more coffee chains competing for the same piece of pie now.</p>
              <p>Starbucks used to pay premium per hour rates for her frontline staff, think it was about $6.50 an hour (or was it $7.50 after laundry encashment). But these days the rates is slightly better than McDonalds.</p>
