(CDIC) would be taking over Chinese Bank -- a member of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- beginning midnight Saturday, in the wake of a bank run sparked by the insolvency of the group's two member firms, China Rebar Co and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co.<br><br>Some clients of the cash-strapped bank complained that they have been unable to withdraw funds despite the FSC's assurance that inter-bank withdrawals and transfer services by other banks' ATMs were operating as usual.<br><br>Chang said this could not occur theoretically, since the ATM system is a data-processing system linking computer facilities of financial institutions to those of the country's central bank on a 24-hour basis, and is a system designed for the real-time transfer of funds across the institutions' deposit reserve accounts at the central bank.<br><br>But, she added that if clients complain they are still unable to withdraw their money, the FSC will deal with such extraordinary situations on a case-by-case basis.(By Y.L.Kao)ENDITEM/diG </blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/ceplist.php?class=2E" rel="nofollow">	NO SYSTEMATIC BANK RUN RISK: TOP FINANCIAL REGULATOR</a></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/dailyphoto/images/5a64403971abce3S.jpg"><br><strong><a href="http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/" rel="nofollow">BANK RUN CONTINUES</a></strong><br><blockquote><br>The run on the financially troubled Chinese Bank continues Monday morning as anxious customers line up at its Panchiao branch in Taipei County to withdraw their deposits.
