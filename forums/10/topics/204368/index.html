            <div class='col-md body'>My player spoil by the eighth day. useless crap. This was my complain letter...<br><br>what crap product and customer service.<br><br>To Creative.<br><br>I bought your latest Zen-V (2gb, black) on 12 July 2006. Less then 8 days later, the whole screen screwed up, although the sound is still working fine.<br><br>I was quite annoyed, as this is my first Mp3 player. I was seriously considering between the iPod Nano, and Zen-V, but decided to get a Zen-V as it is cheaper, with Â‘supposedÂ’ better functions, and produced by a Singaporean company who I would like to support. Plus my friends have been telling me how difficult it is to get customer service for their iPods, as they have to send faulty players back to the factory in India.<br><br>So I was hopeful, I told myself not to worry, and that Creative would probably just get me a replacement in a matters of few days, since Creative is based in Singapore.<br><br>I was wrong.<br><br>I went to the service center at Marina Square, and the person told me that it would take Creative TWO weeks, FOURTEEN days, or so before they can get a replacement for me.<br><br>I enquired why, and she said that they have to wait for the new shipment to arrive, before I can get it. I asked her why canÂ’t I just get a 1-for-1 replacement when I just bought the players for EIGHT days. She just said no.<br><br>So I ask her if it is possible for me to change the colour of the new replacement player. She said no, unless they do not have the stock for the black one. I do not see why Creative cannot be flexible when I just want to change the color of the EXACT player.<br><br>I was beyond irritated. I asked her could I have an EXACT date at which I can get my replacement, she said no. That they will contact me. I asked her for the number to call to check when., she said she could give me the customer serviceÂ’s number, but they wouldnÂ’t know.<br><br>So I asked her WHO in the whole company knows, and she told me itÂ’s the logistics side. I asked her for that number, and she say she canÂ’t give that number to me.<br><br>So you mean I am sending my EIGHT-days old of your LATEST mp3 player for replacement, and there is NO WAY I can call or contact ANYONE in the whole of Creative to enquire about when I can get back my player.<br><br>I paid $200 over for a player that I only used for EIGHT days, and I canÂ’t ask for a direct refund or a 1-for-1 exchange. What kind of customer service is this?<br><br>I didnÂ’t want to pursue the matter initially, and just wait FOURTEEN days to get my player replacement.<br><br>And now, itÂ’s been TWENTY DAYS, and I still have NOT gotten my replacement.<br>The reason I bought the player then instead of the Zen-V plus is because I didnÂ’t want to wait till August for itÂ’s release (call it impulsive shopping).<br><br>And now itÂ’s freaking August already. And I donÂ’t think IÂ’ll ever have the option to upgrade my replacement player to a Zen-V plus.<br><br>I just called Marina Square yesterday, and asked them if my replacement is ready. They said no.<br><br>ItÂ’s been NINETEEN days. And his reply was that it could take up to THREE WEEKS. ThatÂ’s twenty one days for you. To pay $200+ for a player, use it for eight miserable days, have it SPOIL by itself, and now I have to wait Â“aroundÂ” THREE WEEKS!?<br><br>I might as well have not bought the player. All my friends say that I should have bought a iPod Nano instead. I couldnÂ’t have agreed and regretted on my foolish decision more.<br><br>So I ask the person who can I call, his reply was that he will get the customer service to call me. I ask him for the number, and he declined to reveal it to me.<br><br>I donÂ’t even have the RIGHT to call the customer service, and I have to WAIT for them to call me?<br><br>I asked him to ask the customer service to call me NOW, or by today. But his reply was that it would take one working day.<br><br>ItÂ’s been one working day already, and CreativeÂ’s customer service havenÂ’t called! *Grrr<br><br>I am appalled. I didnÂ’t pay my hard earned $200, to buy a mp3 player thatÂ’s non-existent.<br><br>I donÂ’t understand whyÂ…<br><br>1.	I could not get a direct 1-for-1 exchange when there are so many players lying around on the shelves.<br>2.	I have to wait 2 weeks (and it is the 20th day already), when Creative is located in Jurong East.<br>3.	ThereÂ’s no one, not a SINGLE one in the whole company for me to call to check on my player<br>4.	I canÂ’t change the color of my replacement player, and I doubt that I can even pay to upgrade to a ZEN-V plus considering that itÂ’s ALREADY August, and itÂ’s released.<br>5.	A brand new mp3 player with the latest technology, and having gone through product testing, can have its screen blacked-out by the eight day. I seriously wasnÂ’t expecting the product quality to be like this.<br><br>I want you to get back to me (no, not in another twenty days) ASAP. Or I will probably post my experience with your latest mp3 players on online forums and blogs.<br><br>I hope I can get my replacement player NOW, or be even offered the chance to upgrade it to a Zen-V Plus. I am utterly disappointed with the product quality, customer service, and efficiency of Creative. This is my first mp3 player, and stupid me had to choose Creative, and be let down entirely. I do not think I will ever get another player from Creative should my replacement player be worn out (it had better not like spoil in another eight days). Prove me wrong.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Titus Phoon, disappointed, disgruntled and annoyed customer.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The experience mirrors mine.<br><br>After only 2 weeks, the mp3 I bought from Creative went kapuk.  Went to customer service at Jurong - was told only able to get it back in about 2 weeks as they need to check and "repair" it.   Sh*t ! !  The mp3 is only 2 weeks old !<br><br>I asked for a replacement but they also said the same thing - no stock at that moment.  And Creative does not know when the stock will be in.  But without any stock, how does Creative continue to retail it in the outlets ?  Customer service answer : we have it for sales inventory but not for replacements.<br><br>Subsequently, they offered to replace it with an mp3 of lower value and an older model.  Not wanting to wait forever for the "repairs", i took up the mp3 offered.<br><br>Would you believe it ? This replacement broke down after 4 weeks.  For what happened this time round, just re-read the above paras.  "Need 2 weeks to repair" , "No stock for replacement", etc etc.......   Now the whole family's sworn off creative products.  Is it any wonder that they are losing $$ in the millions ?<br></div>
