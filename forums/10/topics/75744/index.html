            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>How many PRC students is the Singaporean government sponsoring? </blockquote>Not very sure<br><br><blockquote>What is the value of each grant? </blockquote>It depends on whether you want to calculate the fees in terms of subsidise or unsubsidise school fees. Gov is supposed to have paid 80% of school fees for us. If going by subsidise school fees, the total fees for 4 years should be 5000X4 about 20k. However the school fees should be somewhere between 5000-6000, not 5000. Actual figures uncertain. Every month they get about $500++ total for living expenses and hostel expenses. That will be 4X12X500 = 24k.<br><br>This figure has not included the period they stayed over in singapore to learn english (range from 1/2 year to 2, depend on whether you have been selected from their university or from their High school) or the coming over and return airline tickets. (Coming over to singapore is sponsored while after graduation they get a free ticket back to China too)<br><br>If you ask me, the value is about 60k++. If going by unsubsidise school fees, it will be much more<br><br><blockquote>What does the Singaporean government get out of sponsoring these students</blockquote>They must stay here for 6 years. The good thing is that since they are scholars studying Engineering, they do help in increasing the number of engineers here. They are also good in studies making them worthy reseachers. Singapore need a lot of engineers here. Either one forced singaporean to be engineering or one have to resort to this costly method to increase the numbers of engineering here.<br><br><blockquote>In relation to question 3, what can the PRC students do that the local population cannot</blockquote>They offer an increase in numbers in engineers here. They seems to be better academically. They boost the racial mix here. They increase the singapore population. This policy is relatively appreciated by China Gov too as a sign of friendship between the 2 countries. They "widen" the gene pool here.<br><br><blockquote>Does this kind of grant apply to students of other nations</blockquote>It is applied to Indian scholars too. ASEAN scholars have another scheme where they work for 2 years studying at subsidised school fees.<br><br><blockquote>What the hell's a "study mama"?</blockquote>Well... it seems that China student coming over here to study tend to suffer from depression since they have no kins here. Some of them are also intimidated by the Chinese scholars here.<br><br>They appears to be very attached to their parents since they are the only child. Heard that there are a number of China scholars committing suicide after they arrived over here and cannot cope with depression. Therefore Singapore allow their mother to come over to work. The mother appear not to get any grant of money, just a work permit and had to find work to support themselves.</div>

All I can say is I guess most people do not want to be in engineering  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . All these years we can see university dropping their standard of admission for engineering student. Now students DO NOT have to take physic in A level to qualify to take up Engineering course, which I feel is ridiculous. Getting a pass in GP is not necessary too. Engineering is one of the hardest course to learn yet becomes one of the easiest to enter. Despite these attempts, people still put engineering as the worst possible course to take up. Even when they graduate with a Eng degree, they refuse to take up Engineering job too.<br><br>Most people prefer to be in other fields like teacher, policemen, fiancial but not engineer. IMO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> engineering is one of the worse job...

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, but how does that square with all the anecdotal evidence around that shows that there are large numbers of Singaporean engineering graduates who are out of work?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Considering how Singaporean engineers were sent to Suzhou to help out, for example, would the need in fact not be acting in the other direction</blockquote>The numbers of engineers going to be fixed. Even if there is a serious demand of engineer here, these engineer still need to go to suzhou to help out. I think this does not reflect on the actual demand for engineers here.<br><br><blockquote>but how does that square with all the anecdotal evidence around that shows that there are large numbers of Singaporean engineering graduates who are out of work? I don't think -all- of them are refusing to take up engineering jobs, right? My unemployed engineer friends certain aren't. </blockquote>Well... I think there may be a need to ask what is the honours that some of these people got. Looking around, I see a lot of people already being recruited by companies even before they graduate. Now the Microelectronic sector is MASSIVELY recruiting more people.<br><br>Another point is, before the economic downturn, there is an acute need for engineers. It is during these years of turmoil that the demand had reduced. Now things are looking up again.<br><br><blockquote>Not to sound anti-Chinese, cos I am partially Chinese but I think that they should throw the damn racial quota's to the air.Chinese supremacy my ass.The proportions will change given the mixing of the different ethnic groups in Singapore.For god's sake,many Malay and Indian men marry Chinese women as they are the most numerous.I forsee a decline in the Chinese population to perhaps half of the population within a few generations.Singapore is not a chinese country nor is it a part of Greater China.Singapore should be true to its multiracial heritage,not like it is now.That is why I bear a resentment to this country,for betraying its multiracial,multicultural heritage though I still love it.I just feel that certain ethnic groups are treated "more equally" than others.Witness the Speak Mandarin campaign,the predominance of PRC scholars over those from other countries,the restriction on Malays serving in the SAF(though that is justified given the religion),the superiority complex that some people </blockquote>Actually I do not blame you for feeling that the Gov seems to be all for certain races.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  It had to resort to artificial means to establish the racial proportions of the people.<br><br>However if the racial mix has changed drastically for the country, it may means some problems. Some of them are, as you have said, the number of people able to be selected for army. There may arises some other problems such as social injustice where a small minority of races get the most of the riches. As can be seen in Indonesia, the chinese turn out to be the richer group of people which cannot be accepted well by the majority of the citizens. Anyway this is just my opinion...<br><br><blockquote>Also,seeding Singapore's future penetration into the PRC market,it is pragmatic to take this approach,but must it be at the cost of the locals?China's rise is inevitable,but we should balance out our investments by taking Thai's,Indonesians,Indians and Filipinos also.That way we get to penetrate the markets of these countries as well.Thailand is a rising star under Thaksin,and Indonesia has amazing potential.All they need is some discipline and efficiency and they could outstrip even us! </blockquote>Actually they do not just recruit people from china, they too recruit a lot of people from ASEAN such as from Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Malaysia etc. When one is in university such as NTU, one can also see their vast numbers of these other foreigners around too.<br><br>When giving scholarship to other countries citizen asking them over here to study, it had to be approve by their Gov as well. Looking it from another angle, this is a brain drain from their country.</div>
