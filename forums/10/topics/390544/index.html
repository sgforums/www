              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">I believe I’m speaking for my generation who are post 80s.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">I’m a natural-born Singaporean and I have done nothing to warrant a criminal record. I belong to the group who are armed with a university degree and will contribute to the society at large.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">These are my rights as a Singaporeans and I insist that the government (aka PAP) accede to my demands:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">1. I have listened to the call of government and have studied for 16 years including university. Because of my NS I’m delayed to go to the workforce. Hence when I graduate, I <strong>demand</strong> <strong>my rights</strong> that PAP provides sufficient jobs that I can choose. PAP must enforce the companies that I should not work overtime. Otherwise my life with my girlfriend will be affected and I can’t go clubbing and dining at night. PAP must insist that the citizens have a work-life balance at all times. The foreigners can take the low -end jobs but at no times they are allowed to take over our jobs. Even if they can work longer hours for lower pay, they are not allowed to replace us. WE have the rights to demand that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">2. HDB must provide flats at low cost for us. This despite the fact that we will earn more than 8K soon we should be given the <strong>rights</strong> to own a flat. The past generation of people had bought low and sell high and hence I <strong>demand</strong> that we should be given the rights to do so too. <span> </span>I demand to buy new 5 rm flats at Queenstown at not more than 400K so that I can sell it off at a profit and upgrade to a condo later. In the meantime HDB cannot have rental flats built near my area as it will lower my housing value. HDB better accede to my demands or I’ll ask the Tampines citizens to vote MBT out. Don’t dismiss the people power.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span> </span>3. As a result of COE supply cut, the prices of car have gone up. This is <strong>not fair</strong> to us now and I demand that the supply to be increased so I can buy cars cheaply. ERP must be removed so I can take the expressway to work. I belong to the educated generation and I have my rights to demand that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">4. If my girlfriend and I get married and decide to have children, PAP must provide more cash relief and benefits for us as Singapore is an expensive place to live in. We have our own personal activities that I’m not willing to give up. Hence PAP must provide childcare cheaply, free medical and hospitalization etc. Otherwise we will not have children and it will be <strong>PAP’s</strong> fault. PAP is not allowed to entice foreigners to make up the numbers. PAP must give us citizens more so we can be persuaded to have children.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">5. Once I retire, PAP must provide for the elderly as we have contributed so much to the society. I demand free medical and hospitalization, free transport rides and discounted rates for food and pleasures.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">I’m a Singaporean and these are my deserved rights. If <strong>PAP</strong> does not do what we say, we will vote them out and make them see how powerful we are.</span></span></p>

              <p>Am I extreme in my demands? Definitely!<br><br>Yet I'm sure these are what most of my generation will want IF they are given the opportunity.

              <p>LOL! You seriously need to rethink your demands.</p>
              <p>You think you are some hot shot that the Government will listen?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of us do think like that!!! We see evidences all the time @ST forum where writers demand explanation why their needs are not met by companies / government boards. <br>Isn't it?</p>
