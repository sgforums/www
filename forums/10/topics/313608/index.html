              <p>Lee Hsien Loong<br>Thirteen more years<br>For reason of age, present cabinet ministers won’t make the grade; the next PM could be a a party outsider who knows nothing about politics or statecraft. By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com</p>
              <p>Apr 4, 2008<br><br>In most democracies, a Prime Minister who tells his party colleagues that they can rule themselves out as contenders to succeed him would have a political rebellion on his hands.<br><br>Evidently not in Singapore, where leadership succession is centrally planned, possibly decided by a handful of people.<br><br>This mass exclusion is what has just happened in Singapore, when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 56, made the following points: -<br><br>- He will remain as Prime Minister until 2021 when he will be 69 years old.<br><br>- He will urgently “look and groom” contenders, including a successor.

No one can foretell if very one in the party hierarchy will stay united behind him once the Minister Mentor is no longer around.<br><br>PM Lee had to consolidate his power by putting in people of his own choice into the cabinet, so a future without Lee Kuan Yew will be less vulnerable.<br><br>The recent cabinet reshuffle – with more changes to come – was seen as part of the process.<br><br>For the moment, the objective has been achieved.<br><br>As long as Mr. Lee Kuan Yew continues to exert such powerful influence over the country, the party remains under his control.</p>

              Thirteen more years<br>
              For reason of age, present cabinet ministers wonâ€™t make the grade;
              the next PM could be a a party outsider who knows nothing about
              politics or statecraft. By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com</p>
              <p>Apr 4, 2008<br>
              <br>
              In most democracies, a Prime Minister who tells his party
              colleagues that they can rule themselves out as contenders to
              succeed him would have a political rebellion on his hands.<br>
              <br>
              Evidently not in Singapore, where leadership succession is
              centrally planned, possibly decided by a handful of people.<br>
              <br>
              This mass exclusion is what has just happened in Singapore, when
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 56, made the following points:
              -<br>
              <br>
              - He will remain as Prime Minister until 2021 when he will be 69
              years old.<br>
              <br>
              - He will urgently â€œlook and groomâ€� contenders, including a
              successor. Because of the long gestation period, the next Prime
              Minister must currently be in his 30s or early 40s.<br>
              <br>
              - This virtually rule out the entire batch of current ministers by
              reason of age, if nothing else. Unless, Mr. Lee added, he is â€œrun
              over by a busâ€� in which case one of them will take over.<br>
              <br>
              I do not know who had the bigger shock when first given the
              information â€“ the general public or Peopleâ€™s Action Party cabinet
              ministers who had aspirations for the top post?<br>
              <br>
              The first question I have is: Why was such a big national issue not
              made in a policy statement to the nation or delivered in
              Parliament? Instead, it was made in an interview with two
              newspapers.<br>
              <br>
              In fact, why was such a topic, which affects every Singaporean and
              his children, not discussed in Parliament first?<br>
              <br>
              There have been no comments from any senior leader. Every one who
              is in it knows the game.<br>
              <br>
              There had been PAP conflicts in the past but always confined within
              four walls with the losers quietly leaving. After the Barisan
              Sosialis (Socialist Front) breakaway, there had been no open
              intra-party confrontation.<br>
              <br>
              This explains a large part the PAPâ€™s longevity.<br>
              <br>
              There will be unlikely be any immediately impact in the cabinet to
              Mr. Leeâ€™s bombshell possibly at most one or two ministers resigning
              â€œfor personal reasonsâ€� over a decent period of time.<br>
              <br>
              It is unrealistic to expect many people to walk away from two or
              three million dollars a year.<br>
              <br>
              Why the move?<br>
              <br>
              The answer: The Charisma of Power!<br>
              <br>
              To be effective, a political leader in Asia has to be seen as being
              able to exercise control over his subordinates.<br>
              <br>
              For nearly four years â€“ especially during the past year or so - Mr.
              Lee, who once suffered and was cured of cancer, has publicly been a
              rather quiet Prime Minister.<br>
              <br>
              It contrasted sharply with his much more assertive, high profile
              father, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who at 84 is 28 years older,
              and seen as overshadowing the Prime Minister.<br>
              <br>
              Lee Senior still makes the important speeches and trots all over
              the world to carry out state matters.<br>
              <br>
              Recently, there had been periods when the Prime Minister had not
              attended a big function or delivered a major speech (the last was
              when he announced hosting the 2010 Youth Olympics).<br>
              <br>
              This had led to frequent questions in the Internet whether he was
              ill and receiving treatment or if he was contemplating quitting in
              the next five-10 years.<br>
              <br>
              The first order of the day is then: To make it clear that he will
              be around for a long time and himself â€œfind and groomâ€� contenders
              from whom a Prime Minister will be chosen.<br>
              <br>
              In other words, he still retains the charisma of power.<br>
              <br>
              The Prime Minister had to impress on his people â€“ and his party
              subordinates - that he wields this power and ready to use it.<br>
              <br>
              His father, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, is advancing in years. No one can
              foretell if very one in the party hierarchy will stay united behind
              him once the Minister Mentor is no longer around.<br>
              <br>
              PM Lee had to consolidate his power by putting in people of his own
              choice into the cabinet, so a future without Lee Kuan Yew will be
              less vulnerable.<br>
              <br>
              The recent cabinet reshuffle â€“ with more changes to come â€“ was seen
              as part of the process.<br>
              <br>
              For the moment, the objective has been achieved.<br>
              <br>
              As long as Mr. Lee Kuan Yew continues to exert such powerful
              influence over the country, the party remains under his
              control.</p>

              like to remind him:</em></p>

              <p>Will the situation be like what had happened in the last Malaysia General Election?<br><br>Will PM Lee say if the percentage of around 50+% who voted for the PAP to be considered as good?<br><br>What if the ruling party loses a GRC or perhaps a few of them? Will he consider that as good performance too? As they still managed to retain over the government.....</p>
              <p>Will his term be shorter than?</p>
