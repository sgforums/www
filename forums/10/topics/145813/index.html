            <div class='col-md body'>It is very clear that anyone offering alternative solutions to current leadership and talent approach will be deemed a threat and sidelined.<br><br>Sim Wong Hoo will be frown on as a kind of smart alec not in the class of academic elites as our leaders. However he had proven himself to be more entrepreneurial and has successfully created world products based on practical applications and  consistent management philosophy like "Creating Huge Excessive Advantages Tactics".<br><br>The hugely competitive Taiwanese Computer entrepreneurs have done the same with CHEAT by creating compatible industrial standards for the Taiwanese PCs which finally broke the stranglehold of the invincible IBM standards. Singapore lacks practical technology applicators and entrepreneurs who can think out of the box like these Taiwanese PC Entrepreneurs. The present leaders are too concerned with image and self-importance and we are left behind technologically because of such pride or face and we are not paying attention in applying technologies from schools being overly concerned with paper chase or look-good examination results.<br><br>I believe we need more people with practical abilities less rhetorics and more results. To build a new team to take Singapore higher to meet the next challenges ahead in the real world we need to cut out all the pretentious look-good approaches in managing the economy and get more action types of people to start up new technology. There is too deep a culture here to avoid liability for mistakes. Sim's "No U-Turn Sydrome" will be a good philosophy to help the present leaders to be more accountable and transparent and be willing to accept responsibility for mistakes.</div>

Now the entire team of them takes over the products . MP3s are not really promoting the copyright industry of the music industry. So its not really a good Idea.<br><br>If creative sticks to its Sound Card and maybe create hifi systems , they may score better overseas.<br><br></div>
