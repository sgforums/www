            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Why call it an abuse of free speech? That is unless you yourself are starting to feel uncomfortable with the indepth discussion of the concept of death and organ removal. That's too bad for you because others might want to discuss theirs or voice their opinions. It's a public forum and I am doing nothing wrong or illegal.<br><br>I won't call OM antagonistic - at least he answering my questions as well as stating his opinions very neutrally, not you. For that I do actually thank him for his efforts at explanation - unlike others who took personal potshots, he just said that I am fully entitled to my views , defended the diagnosis of brain death protocols, and gave me the warning that I will be at the bottom of the list . I do not see it anyway as antagonistic , he is just voicing his opinions as well and I can respect that. </blockquote>As I said... why does one need to restate things that others have already said? One people uncomfortable with their crumbling wall of logic will seek to constantly full up the gaps appearing in it from the pounding of enemy attack, even if it means using material that has already proven to be worthless in the past. Given the case, facts, answers and rebuttals against you are quite a clear, solid wall, would it not be a duplication of effort just to drive another nail into your coffin that others have already more or less nailed shut? Something you do not seem to understand- some just do not see the need to restate SOLVENT GREEN and other logical fallacies over and over again.<br><br>I have no issues with the indepth discussion here and read is as well (if not better) as you. What seems to have escaped your notice is the fact that in your haste to do dig deep you have apparently let your mind fall through the hole you dug... evident by the way your arguments were often torn to shreds in the "indepth" matters when they were really put to the test.<br><br>Is not your common final statement on things that go in the line of "I don't care it's just my belief and you all should respect that" after having reaching the end of your rope of reasoning while your opponents still had plenty to dish out an indication of your opinions... while respected as your right by others in here to hold... don't really seem to hold up to the test of discussion at all?<br><br>Yes, anybody can go "indepth"... but if their position really has true depth is another issue. Anyone can collect a large amount of facts to draw from at ammunition but it is the wise that know where to direct it as opposed to you firing a constant barrage of blanks?<br><br>Am I really taking potshots? Or am I painting the rather obvious? Would it not do you far better to actually see what I am trying to point out to you about you and see how you can improve your own case instead of denying it as a potshot and go on to make more errors leaving yourself as easy prey in here?<br><br>Is anybody saying what you are doing is wrong or illegal? But if it is not silly is another thing entirely... not to mention quite obvious in here. Given the long list of errors you have constantly made even in making simple logical connects and refused education on that?<br><br>By every means you have the right to say anything that is no illegal, but please don't be surprised when you get the proper reception simply because what you spoke... while not illegal... hardly makes sense at all.<br><br>Am I or other people really being antagonistic? Or are you simply getting in return a proper response to the pompus antagonism you took in your orginal position? I seems to me your reluctance to engage OM as you do others (as well as label him "non-antagonistic") comes from the fact that you realize you cannot possibly reveal anymore of your case without having them taken apart rather swiftly? As much as I usually disagree with him, I know a good position when I see one.<br><br>At the end of the day, have you not failed to make even a dent (despite all your efforts) on your attack on the current law as it is? What's more important... and the end of the day... despite all our differing views, opinions and beliefs do we all not need ONE law that we still have to be under at the end of the day? Is it still not applied regardless of what we think unless we supposed there was sufficent reason to change it? Is that not something you have totally failed to prove in here?<br><br>In other words, I must say that given the way things have turned out... were not all your efforts in here for naught? Or worse, actually boosted the case of the opposition? In the end all we have is you being the rough equal of a child who having being outwitted in all areas in the playground, covering her ears, shutting her eyes and chanting "ijustdon'tlikeit-it'smyopinionrespectit" over and over and over again.<br><br>Given how well you were demolished, do I really need to add more to the overkill? Is not musing on your rather amusing and repeated blunders in here far more interesting and productive for others who will come across this and draw the proper lessons so as they will not become like you? After all who wants to be a person who desperately wishes to retcon 7 plus previous pages of history to get a better footing in here?<br><br>A potshot? Or an armour piercing shell that strips away all jibber jabber and cuts to the rot and rubbish in the core of your "case" in here? Given the way things have turned out I think the answer is quite clear.</div>

OM was the only one who did an indepth discussion and if you did notice - he didn't actually rebuff it but was explaining the physiological reason behind the brain death issue. He just dismissed my concerns as useless but I do not think they are. He is entitled to his opinion and I am entitled with mine . That has been established in his replies.<br><br>As for you - you are arguing on emotional defence of the compassion through organ transplant. You did not move on , you just did a stand still on the political winner.<br><br>You also conveniently forgot to rebuff my statement about fear and legality of death vs the reality of death. You also conveniently neglected to answer the part about a brain dead mother giving birth to a living baby . It is an actual fact that it happened . Life in a corpse or life carried by life? As far as I can understand about death, a corpse cannot carry a life inside it but the legal definition makes her a corpse despite her living body.<br><br><strong> Legally dead does not mean really dead and this point cannot be proven or rebuffed. </strong><br><br>Therefore I can only conclude you are reprimanding me based on your personal opinion that "organs should not be wasted- it's morally wrong" and striving to hit me on conveniently selected comments. Yes it is my opinion and I have reiterated it to the context of another forumner who alleged that it is discouraging others from donating - so sue me if you don't like it.<br><br>Wait til one day if your loved one is knocked down by a car , you see the same person in the ICU looking alive on a ventilator and next thing - they take them away for organ transplant because they declare the person brain-dead. But wait , the loved one looks so alive still . Emotional ? Yes it is and it will be but that is the question which haunts some families because it happened to them - is my loved one really dead?  If you are even in their shoes, you will probably see the view of another forumner like gLc, not just mine.</div>

Patients in PVS have severely damaged the cortical brain and have lost all higher functions. They are in a deep coma but are not brainstem dead. Most of the neurons in the cerebral cortex may be dead but not those in the brain stem. The clinical tests for brain death will show that the brain stem is alive and such patients not not deemed brain dead.

Yes, but in very extraordinary circumstances. If a person is brain dead, the heart and lungs will usually stop within hours.

She suffered from cancer which metastasize to the brain , lost consciousness , declared brain dead in Virginia Hospital Center,and was placed on life support for the duration of the last trimester . Whether she has brain stem death or brain death remains to be seen but this case will likely to be published in medical journals soon enough. I remembered reading another case where the patient was declared brain dead but also carried a child to full term. I will look it up for you when I can.<br><br><strong> All vital functions ceasing aka circulatory and neurological cessation , is what I can accept of the definition of death is the triad of Bichat :<span style="font-style: italic;"> "the failure of the body as an integrated system associated with the irreversible loss of circulation, respiration and innervation"</span>.  </strong> The concept of brainstem death - declaration of death depending only on one vital function and one region of the brain- is not exactly the most comforting or convincing of all .<br><br>Bodies of brain-dead patients who is about to become an organ "donor" has a beating heart : in some cases, the patients were discovered to react strongly to the incision. The heart rate increased rapidly and blood pressure rose dramatically until general anaesthetic was given whereupon the blood pressure and heart beat returned to normal. Is that not an indication of pain, my good doctor ? Or let me see the excuse given : partial medullary response is the reason. That is not good enough a reason at all. Reaction to pain is not your normal run of the mill reaction to a stimulus when the tendon hammer is used to jerk a knee.<br><br>The body may live on for some time, and this life is not to be dismissed merely because of the loss of brain function or brain stem death . Another vital organ such as the heart should be allowed to cease function.  Even with brain stem death , higher cortical functions could be present and there could be consciousness residing inside that former legal definition of a human being , there which current technology cannot detect.<br><br>It seems  apparent to me that the brain-stem dead ventilated heart beating alleged cadavers who are used as organ donors are in fact living patients. To kill them because they are brainstem dead and declared legally is not a good reason to inflict suffering or kill off their living bodies, so that a good can be achieved for another patient or patients.<br><br>If the concept of being brain dead is not questioned but accepted, the perpetuation of a system where one set of patients is killed to obtain organs for a second set of patients.

U eat food u can get choke to death. U get bitten by a mosquito u may die of dengue.

Much of this discussion is the result of the awareness of continuing technological advances, neurodiagnostic developments, and clinical insight. Thus, this ongoing dialogue can be viewed as a dynamically developing process of achieving a multidisciplinary consensus that is responsive to a continually changing technological environment.4-12<br><br>Although the concept of death determination continues to evolve, clinical and scientific <strong>experts have generated clinical practice parameters for the diagnosis of brain death that are grounded in empirical knowledge, supported by sufficiently rigorous research, and substantiated by moderate to high degrees of clinical certainty.</strong>2,13 Neuroscience experts continue to define brain death as irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. This definition remains consistent with the definition of brain death initially presented by the PresidentÂ’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research.1,13</span><br><br><a href="http://www.aacn.org/aacn/jrnlccn.nsf/0/5ebf8de743ead0fa8825674e005a8950?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacn.org/aacn/jrnlccn.nsf/0/5ebf8de743ead0fa8825674e005a8950?OpenDocument</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Uniform Act refers to "accepted medical standards" without specifying what these standards may be. Accepted medical standards may vary from state to state and can change over time. Most published guidelines for determining brain death have relied on the findings of prospective clinical studies. Important findings include those from the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain Death and from the Collaborative Study of the National Institutes of Neurological Diseases and Stroke. <strong>These studies indicate that a patient will not survive with irreversible coma, apnea, absence of brain stem reflexes, and an isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG) that persists for 6 hours after the onset of coma and apnea. </strong></span><br><br><a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/bioethics/policies/braindeath.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandclinic.org/bioethics/policies/braindeath.html</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Therefore I can only <strong>conclude</strong> you are reprimanding me based on your personal opinion that "organs should not be wasted- it's morally wrong" and striving to hit me on conveniently selected comments. Yes it is my opinion and I have reiterated it to the context of another forumner who alleged that it is discouraging others from donating - so sue me if you don't like it. </blockquote>Please don't avoid the issue- it seems that you have a strange habit of revisiting the same old debunked conclusions to give yourself any kind of a reasonable justification to even speak in here.<br><br>Am I hitting you on conveniently selected comments? Or are not these comments but vital to your entire case in here? Just not a few pages ago these were but most of the gutter you were spewing in here until your opponents really took you to task and suddenly you became all prim and proper about demanding a "in depth debate", and striving to retcon your previous comments... when quite obviously indicate a serious flaw in your entire premise to begin with?<br><br>And if you can refer to OM's "in depth" (by your standards) posts as not a debunking of your position but simply "information"... you might be more spaced out then most of us suspect in here. The fact that you need to add "he's entitled to his opinion and I to mine" goes to show that you seem to have missed out the rather vital fact that nobody's saying you are not entitled your opinion, but there mere entitlement never contributed in any way to the validity of them. By all means you are also entitled to think that cows can fly, but once you are in here you need to justify that belief. Please don't get fustrated and scold people for rejecting your logic and reasons when by all measures... they have been considered by most reasonable people to be invalid.<br><br>As I said, is it not like you having run out of reasons, resorting to insisting on your rights like the little girl in the playground? People who are clear on their opinion and the validity of it never see the need to highlight their "rights" to hold that opinion or "entitlement". It is the Poodle, feeling lost in size that needs to highlight issues of "rights" and "entitlement" next to the Great Dane, the Great Dane sees no such need and is clear on its own position. The fact that you see my posts as attempted censorship, as opposed to a rather inpartial critique of your inherent dishonesty and flip flopping in here is rather indicative of your Poodle mentality.<br><br>You adventures are is prehaps as amusing as having been told in detail what underwear should be and how it should be used reasonably, you choose to use the very same facts, apply fallicious logic to them, and wear them on your head and face instead. Is this not amusing and worth mentioning?<br><br>Do I not like what you are saying? As a matter of fact I do find your attempts to defend your increasingly weak and crumbling position by revisiting the same old arguments rather amusing and interesting, and of course am pointing out the sheer lunacy of your position out for the rest to see... which is certainly quite a sight worth seeing- a person who has apparently mixed up her rights with actual justifications.<br><br>So by all means, do carry on with what you are saying, if you insist on your rights to say what you want. I don't insist on our rights to be entertained by you, but it seems you fufill that purpose by automatically opting into it.</div>

Thus, this ongoing dialogue can be viewed as a dynamically developing process of achieving a multidisciplinary consensus that is responsive to a continually changing technological environment.4-12<br><br>Although the concept of death determination continues to evolve, clinical and scientific [b]experts have generated clinical practice parameters for the diagnosis of brain death that are grounded in empirical knowledge, supported by sufficiently rigorous research, and substantiated by moderate to high degrees of clinical certainty.</span></strong>2,13 Neuroscience experts continue to define brain death as irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. This definition remains consistent with the definition of brain death initially presented by the PresidentÂ’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research.1,13<br><br><a href="http://www.aacn.org/aacn/jrnlccn.nsf/0/5ebf8de743ead0fa8825674e005a8950?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacn.org/aacn/jrnlccn.nsf/0/5ebf8de743ead0fa8825674e005a8950?OpenDocument</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Uniform Act refers to "accepted medical standards" without specifying what these standards may be. Accepted medical standards may vary from state to state and can change over time. Most published guidelines for determining brain death have relied on the findings of prospective clinical studies. Important findings include those from the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain Death and from the Collaborative Study of the National Institutes of Neurological Diseases and Stroke. <strong>These studies indicate that a patient will not survive with irreversible coma, apnea, absence of brain stem reflexes, and an isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG) that persists for 6 hours after the onset of coma and apnea. </strong></span><br><br><a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/bioethics/policies/braindeath.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandclinic.org/bioethics/policies/braindeath.html</a><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>That is not really proving human consciousness ending with a brainstem death.<br><br>Let me quote what you pasted "Neuroscience experts continue to define brain death as irreversible cessation of <strong> all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem </strong>" - however medical confirmation of death in Singapore is focused upon <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brain stem death </span>not <strong> inclusive of </strong> higher cortical functions - that is just in case you have not read OM's post about me asking why some tests like EEGS are complementary not compulsory.

See below - that is what I copied out of MOH's website.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>There are situations where the seven clinical criteria cannot be fully performed. For example when the eyes or ears are severely injured, the doctors would not be able to test the response of the eyes or ears. Or if the patient had been sedated and the medications that depress the brain function are still circulating in the blood, then additional tests would have to be performed.<br><br>In such situations, supplementary tests - like angiography - can be used to measure cerebral blood flow and certify brain death. These supplementary tests are already used in many developed countries for such situations.<br><br>On 1 July 2004, the Interpretation (Determination and Certification of Death) Regulations were amended to allow the following supplementary tests to be used for brain death certification.<br><br>1. Cerebal angiography to confirm that there is no intracranial blood flow.<br>2. Radionuclide scan to confirm that there is no intracranial profusion.<br><br>The supplementary tests are to complement the clinical tests. <strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are not a substitute for the clinical criteria. </span></strong> If six of the seven clinical tests can be performed, the criteria for these six tests must be fully met, that is 6 upon 6, before the doctor proceeds to carry out an ancillary test.<br></blockquote>In gist , it means that it is not compulsory to do all these tests to declare brain death. Means a person who tested positive for 7 out of 7 clinical criteria for brain death does not qualify for the tests at all which means that they are not going to bother about your higher cortical functions shutting down as according to the statement you made about neuroscience defining the shutdown of <strong> ALL </strong> neurological functions in the brain.<br><br>That also means that  MOH guidelines are just focusing on one part of your brain- the brain stem- to declare death.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It seems apparent to me that the brain-stem dead ventilated heart beating alleged cadavers who are used as organ donors are in fact living patients. To kill them because they are brainstem dead and declared legally is not a good reason to inflict suffering or kill off their living bodies, so that a good can be achieved for another patient or patients.</blockquote>All it boils down to is this: you reject the concept of brain death. As I said before, we die in bits and pieces. Just because a brain dead woman can deliver a healthy baby given the medical support we can offer today does not negate the fact that she is brain dead. She will never recover and stripped of the mechanical support, her heart and lungs will stop functioning.<br><br>You choose to define death as the point in time when all the bits and pieces of the human body stop to function; in essence, ruling out completely the possibility of organ transplant.<br><br>All that is clear, so there is no need to go over agreed territories.<br><br>I maintain that most Singaporeans accept the concept of brain death, which is accepted by the overwhelming majority of doctors all over the world. As you have admitted yourself, your view of death is a minority view.<br><br>So what's the dispute about? It seems to me that your objection is with an opt-out system as practised in Singapore. You prefer an opt-in system, although given the inertia of people, that will mean that whilst many are willing to be donors, many organs end up wasted. You are zealous that the right to refuse organ donation be protected and object to the default consent that the system presumes on Singaporeans.<br><br>Fair enough...but in a democratic society do you not agree that it is the majority view that prevails in a dispute? I believe that Singaporeans accept the opt-out system. Those who feel strongly against it are free to opt out by just downloading the required forms from the internet. The majority of Singaporeans are prepared to be organ donors but the inertia to do something active is so great that they wouldn't sign a donation form, although they won't object if that happens to their organs. I think that the minority of Singaporeans who are not comfortable with the idea (perhaps because they do not want to think of death) do not hold strong views against. I put it to you that for most Singaporeans who are not happy with the scheme, their inertia to do something about it far outweighs their unhappiness. And given all the information available, many who will say they disagree with the system do not disagree so strongly that they are prepared to bother with opting out.<br><br>So our system makes it easier to donate than to refuse donation? Yes, it does. It is tilted in favour of organ donation. Is it fair to those who object to organ donation? No, but in the interest of the many patients who need an organ, I believe that the policy is right even when it is not fair. And I believe most Singaporeans agree with me. If they don't, let's hear their protests and let them signal their displeasure at the polls. As it is, not a single Opposition Party candidate has raised this issue at the Election debates. Why? Because it is a lost cause...people are not interested in it.<br><br>So those who object to the system like you have to overcome your inertia to register your objection. In the democratic system that runs according to majority opinion, you have to take the extra step. You can exercise your right to opt out so your organs will never be used for donation. If you need an organ transplant yourself, you will be placed at the bottom of the queue, which essentially means you will never get one. You are happy with that decision, we who champion organ donation are happy for you to exercise that option...everyone's happy.</div>

Bichat lived between 1771 and 1802, during which time the <strong>established </strong>treatment for syphilis was with mercury.<br><br><blockquote>That factor will never be known but the fact that the late Mr Sim's family had to begged and then resort to an aggressive manner in their time of grief to prevent  the medical professionals keen on harvesting his organs from doing so.

The medical professionals were entirely correct in following procedures set out in law. If you disagree with the law, there are processes in place for law reform through your elected representatives in Parliament. The doctors had acceded to the request to delay harvesting for a reasonable period of time. They had to act finally or jeopardize the success of the transplant.<br><br>It is unacceptable to me that the rule of law should be set aside just because someone is unhappy with it. If we allow that, we allow society to descend into anarchy and chaos. Majority rules and society must abide by those rules.<br><br><blockquote>Even though I might be a moral objector to the definition of death and transplant but I know this much : Families, if explained to properly and factually , would have a 50/50 chance of actually donating the organs under a volunteer opt in system. It will be their choice and decision unless their loved one has discuss it openly with them and signed an organ donor card. </blockquote>We had an opt in system for years but despite lots of public education and publicity, the donor rate was far too low and increasing number of patients are dying from the lack of organs. That is why the government brought in the opt-out system and I believe that most Singaporeans are in favour of it.<br><br>On the other hand, if you are right we should see a massive backlash in the media pressing the government to change the law.

There was plenty of publicity and consultation before the law came into being. However, I agree that more publicity can and should be done.<br><br>It is precisely because of this taboo to talk about death that makes it difficult for people to even want to sign an organ donation card. That is why an opt out system is the only way to give a second lease of life to those dying of organ failure. If people really object to it, they can opt out like you.<br><br><blockquote>To the Late Mr Sim's family - it's too late , their loved one has been violated , his organs taken forcibly by the word of law.  Not a single shred of dignity at all for a grieving family. For that , I feel sorry for them.</blockquote>That's your sentiment. I disagree. If he did not opt out of organ donation, he may well have wanted his organs to be used to save lives. By all the major world religions, that is a good deed.<br><br><blockquote>The bad publicity that the auto opt in actually gathers will make it clear to people who usually won't bother but actually start bothering and objecting to HOTA even midst the threats of not receiving an organ when they need one despite having no preconceived notions unlike me. </blockquote>No need to argue that....we'll see. Like those who champion organ donation, I hope that will not happen but people have the right to choose either way, so long as they act according to the law.</div>

Bichat's views are hopelessly outdated, I am afraid. At the time, they hardly know much about anatomy and the concept of brain death is completely beyond them.<br><br>You can hold on to those views just as a religious person will forever believe that there is heaven and hell. You cannot prove the Pope wrong, just that you cannot demonstrate it. As I said, there is no scientific basis to dispute the concept of brain death. Your problem is a religious and cultural one...<br><br>I believe the balance should be tilted in favour of organ transplants to save lives. We can do no more for the dead...it is the living that needs our help. So I have no problem with making it easier to donate even though it makes it more inconvenient for people to opt out.<br><br>Since you are an activist against the opting out system, go ahead and warn Singaporeans of the current law and help distribute opt-out forms. You can distribute emails with the opt out forms to everyone you know. You can set up websites to educate Singaporeans etc...That is not illegal and you will be more credible by doing something useful for your cause.<br><br></div>

I have ask u to name a medical organisation tat reject brain dead and u can't come out with one. Furthermore, tis paper is 10 years ago. If it has an impact, brain dead is already outlawed. And there r tons of papers tat support brain dead.

Yup, Mr and Mrs Sim r not happy, but tis is superficial compared with the many many lives tat can be saved with the organs. Even if their child had opt in volunteerily, who is to say their parents will not grieve or complain ?<br><br>Have u ever consider from the side of the organ receiver ? They r dying fymk. If u chose auto opt out system, u have effectively killed their hope of survival. I felt strange but u felt compassion for crying parents but no compassion for dying people. U even have compassion for little animals to have a dose of anaesthesia before they kill them. If u have compassion and not because u wanna win the argument, then u should save more lives instead. Compared to the grand scale of saving lives, is grieving parents even worth consideration ?<br><br>Your second reason is  the test of brain dead is faulty. The fact is almost the whole medical field reached a consensus on the test for brain dead. Even if u consider in the past, the person is dead since they cannot breath and control their heartbeat anymore. The test had undergo many tests and clinical verification tat nobody in tis forum, except u, believe tat the test is not good enough and u want to proposed your own test where nobody can get organ donations.<br><br>If I am not wrong, u will not answer to the above and come out attacking from another tangent. So far all your replies refuse to answer other people queries and when cornered, u will just use back an old point and start all over again.<br><br>U have use paper from doctor before. U have used crying parents before. U have used brain dead test and whether is it adequate before. U have attacked MOH from not following procedure before. U have talked about low risk and how some religious people donate their organ in a mistake. U have talked about vegetable giving birth. U have talked about drugs leading to brain dead test being faulty. U even talked about free speech and rights of individual. All these arguments have been said and countered.
