The dead person should never be seen as a source of organs . That is my moral belief that the dead person used to be a living human being with loved ones . Doctors take full consent of surgeries and the risks involved - I am sure OM will be well aware of the Bollam Test when it comes down to informed consent. Likewise I want people to have the full disclosure of what happens when they harvest organs from them other than the usual practice of explaining that "your body will be treated with utmost respect". I am for informed consent. Like it or not. </strong></blockquote>Since you mentioned me, I will have to respond. For those who are not acquainted, the Bolam test arises from a 1957 case 'Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee', in which Bolam sustained a fracture following electroconvulsive therapy. Mr Bolam claimed that the doctors were negligent in not giving him a muscle relaxant and he had not been warned of this possible side effect of treatment. The court ruling forms the standard for determining dereliction of duty in the tort of negligence.<br><br>Put simply, the standard of care expected is that of an ordinary workman who professes an ordinary level of skill. With regard to consent, one might consider if a side effect is of such minute significance that it does not have to be revealed eg. is it necessary to reveal to a patient that an operation carries a 1 in a million chance of a particular adverse effect? If other surgeons who perform the same operation do not reveal that minute level of risk routinely, the defendant can invoke the bolam test to argue that his practice is acceptable.<br><br>In the present issue, I am not sure why fymk has raised the issue of consent. We have legislation that facilitates an opt out system of consent. If you do not consent to have your organs donated in the event that you become brain dead, you can register your objection and opt out. If you do nothing, the law makes it legal to assume that you have consented.<br><br>The law therefore makes it unnecessary to invoke the bolam test in any dispute about consent for organ donation. It is unnecessary for the doctors to obtain consent from the next of kin with regard to a brain dead victim. All it requires is to check the register of those who have opted out.<br><br>As for your statement that 'the dead person should never be seen as a source of organs', your view may well be a minority opinion. According to you then, there will not be any cadaveric transplants and thousands of patients with organ failures are doomed to die along with those who are already dead.<br><br>I agree with informed consent but i maintain that the law does not necessarily take it away, provided there is adequate dissemination of information. I do agree that Singaporeans should be aware of the law and its implications, something the recent case in SGH has highlighted. However, the law itself is fine.<br><br></div>

If deprived of oxygen for 3 minutes, the brain becomes damaged irreversibly and dies very quickly. However, other organs can survive longer. If the brain is severely damaged as a result of a stroke or physical insult such as head injury, parts of the brain may shut down and die but the heart and lungs can continue to function, keeping the other organs alive.<br><br>The brain is a complex organ with many parts. The part of the brain that maintains vital functions such as the heart and lungs are in the brain stem. So if the brain stem dies, the heart and lungs will stop eventually, but there is a period during which the brain stem is dead but the heart/lungs are still working. This is the window for cadaveric transplant.<br><br>The organs are harvested quickly and perfused with cold University of Winsconsin (UW) solution. As long as the transplant is done quickly after the blood supply is cut off, there is a good chance of success.<br><br>Because the brain stem is dead, there is no hope of recovery. The person can be deemed to be dead and soon the traditional signs of death, such as the cessation of heart beat, will come about. Whilst the heart and lungs are still functioning, however, the other organs are kept alive. With modern medicine, we can continue to ventilate the lungs mechanically and keep the other organs alive until such time when the heart stops beating. This is the small window of opportunity during which we can harvest the organs for transplantation.<br><br>All the major religions of the world have accepted the concept of brain death and the good of cadaveric transplants. Obviously there may be others who believe otherwise. Those who object to it can opt out in Singapore, whilst the majority who do not are allowed to help others have a second lease of life.<br><br></div>

I am the minority who has actually seen something that terrifies me about organ transplant .<br><br>Informed consent should let people know about what they expect about how they might look after death and what happens when they donate their organs if they wish to know. All I ever get is " you will be treated with respect and dignity" PERIOD.<br><br>Do they use anaesthetics or paralytic agents in removal then? Full disclosure of what drugs they use to paralyse the body if the "reflexes" aka "convulsions" play up . If they do feel that it is not acceptable , they can fully withdraw from opting in or they can request that their body gets an adequate amount of anaesthesia to treat their dead body with the same respect of a live body  If they feel that the information is adequate - then they can continue opting in.<br><br>Brain death is a concept which major religions might accept but not everyone. I am also the minority who refuses to believe in death or that the soul has fully left the body (I do believe in afterlife) until all vital functions has finally ceased.</div>

How the heck do they keep organs from deteriorating - ask yourself this. That is why I prefer to have people KNOW the FULL disclosure of how transplants are ran and then make the decision themselves. </blockquote>Dismissing? That is a rather weak attempt at trying to define your opponent's positionÂ… and as anyone who has read my posts will see, a failed attempt to do so as well.<br><br>For the record, I for myself do not dismiss the issue of people being accidentally harvested for their organs. In fact by my reckoning these deaths are every bit as tragic as those who die because organs are needlessly wasted. The DIFFERENCE between you and me is that I do not rely overtly, irrationally, and in an unbalanced way on either side of the argument to make my caseÂ… which is really more then I can say for you.<br><br>Also if you didnÂ’t note, the reason why nobody tried to REBUFF you is simply because you have left such a big hole in your own arguments could other people not help but exploit it before moving on to more balanced debate?<br><br>Does anybody here think that the risk of being accidentally harvested is an acceptable cost as long as thereÂ’s a supply of organs? I doubt so, and I think they can put up a lot more elequoent, reasonable, and honest arguments against such practices then you should it come to it.<br><br>IÂ’m afraid you attempting to see your opponents as being dismissive of the other side comes more from your desire to equate them and SOLVENT GREEN then actually and proper correlation in reality.<br><br>The truth is most reasonable people in here know we should be striving towards a system that is as zero-error and works for as many different beliefs as possible, where no organs are wasted and nobody accidentally (or maliciously) harvested. What we are however making clear is that the mistakes we are making not should not discourage us from working towards correcting and rectifying the entire thing.<br><br>ItÂ’s like one person saying Â“you like having your vegetables moderately freshÂ… why not have them totally fresh instead.Â” And another who goes Â“letÂ’s throw out the loaf and eat bricks and centipedes instead.Â”. I think itÂ’s quite clear whoÂ’s who.<br><br>And the point remainsÂ… at least most of your opponents have proper, solid ideas on how to improve the system while reducing the number of lives lost to organs wastedÂ… what has yours possibly been except stating out some rather commonsensical improvements but declaring quite proudly that you are happy to take a course of action counterproductive, or even outright contradictory to the very thing you suggest?<br><br>At the risk of using weasel words, I have plenty of friends who work in healthcare, seen plenty of death, the screw ups and what have you not. They however, seem to have a far more balanced view of organ donation then you do.<br><br></div>

I suggest that you read up on the definition of brain death before calling me a selective looker.<br><br>I am stating that no one ever know what the proper declaration of death is especially pertaining to consciousness in a brain dead ...wait brainstem dead patient. Never mind that the higher functions could be possibly existing in a brain stem dead patient or that a person with a form of neurological disease may not be responding to the clinical assessment criteria and therefore declared as dead wrongly. Note that they said the advanced tests like EEG are just "complementary"<br><br>I am not stating that people don't deserve a second chance. I am very paranoid of the current definition of death in favor of organ harvesting. Once brain death occur , I believe that the body should be allowed to shut down. Cardiac death always follow brain death.<br><br>In my opinion, that is the only way to declare a person fully and properly dead but it will never be done because they want <strong> better quality organs </strong>.

Some hospitals have official code blue document that actually contains the a special comment box for the Lazarus phenomenon and even has a special space for time of phenomenon happening from "death" to "autoresuscitation" aka life without any intervention.<br><br>Lazarus don't happen everyday for every patient and not everyone will have seen it but once you see it you would think twice about the definitions of death.<br><br>Does the means really justify the ends if a person declared brain dead but able to feel pain gets cut up ?

The DIFFERENCE between you and me is that I do not rely overtly, irrationally, and in an unbalanced way on either side of the argument to make my caseÂ… which is really more then I can say for you.<br>The truth is most reasonable people in here know we should be striving towards a system that is as zero-error and works for as many different beliefs as possible, where no organs are wasted and nobody accidentally (or maliciously) harvested. What we are however making clear is that the mistakes we are making not should not discourage us from working towards correcting and rectifying the entire thing. [/quote]<br><br>If it cannot be zero error - it should not be done on an automatic basis. If it is done - informed consent will  have to be taken - risks explained.<br><br>[quote]<br>ItÂ’s like one person saying Â“you like having your vegetables moderately freshÂ… why not have them totally fresh instead.Â” And another who goes Â“letÂ’s throw out the loaf and eat bricks and centipedes instead.Â”. I think itÂ’s quite clear whoÂ’s who.<br><br>And the point remainsÂ… at least most of your opponents have proper, solid ideas on how to improve the system while reducing the number of lives lost to organs wastedÂ… what has yours possibly been except stating out some rather commonsensical improvements but declaring quite proudly that you are happy to take a course of action counterproductive, or even outright contradictory to the very thing you suggest?<br><br>At the risk of using weasel words, I have plenty of friends who work in healthcare, seen plenty of death, the screw ups and what have you not. They however, seem to have a far more balanced view of organ donation then you do.<br><br></div></blockquote>First of all , have you read the rest of the arguments? You opened the door to my reasons - I told you. I am now expanding on reason no. 1 and 2 since the door has been opened. Don't start running a <span style="font-style: italic;"> vatican</span> on a <span style="font-style: italic;"> galileo </span> because later down the road, Vatican found that the earth wasn't so flat.

            <div class='col-md body'>Now u r attempting another battle of yours by challenging the medical opinion of the whole world of doctors and researchers. R u sure u have wat it takes to challenge their medical opinion ?<br><br>First thing I have to say is, singapore is not the only country tat practise auto opt in for organ donations.<br><br><strong>In some nations (for instance, Belgium, Brazil, Poland, Portugal and France) everyone is automatically an organ donor, <span style="font-style: italic;">although some jurisdictions allow opting out from the system</span></strong><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_dead" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_dead</a><br><br>If u really felt tat singapore is a babaric nation, take note tat the more developed nations are practising auto opt in for organ donation. In fact some country don't even give u the option of opting out of the system.<br><br><blockquote>Unacceptable but oh wait . There are sedatives which can overcome a criteria like that . There are freak cases which do not comply with the criteria. More to come about supplementary tests. </blockquote>Tis is on the test for brain dead. First, there is a need to explain tat brain dead is<br><br><strong>Brain death is defined as a complete and irreversible cessation of brain activity. Absence of apparent brain function is not enough. Evidence of irreversibility is also required. </strong><br><br>Now u say tat there r drugs tat overcome the criteria. Now which drug can overcome all the criteria of brain dead ? U r not dismissing the singapore gov in here, u r challenging the medical opinion of the medical field. R u trying to say tat the doctors r stupid and u r better than them to know who is dead or not. The doctors proclaim a man dead but u can proclaim them to be alive ?<br><br><blockquote>All in all unacceptable when it is a life involved. And like I said - no one has ever returned from the afterlife to tell us whether that method of declaring death is correct. There are however some who returned from the afterlife who saw the great white light when they were actually pronounced as dead. So I think I rather trust the latter than the former. </blockquote>I think tat is stupid. Wat do u mean by afterlife and asking someone to come back from afterlife ? U mean we have to wait till then before we start organ donation ? R u being unreasonable or childish here ? And the people who u claim tat had returned from the dead r either in time later than 1980 or in ulu hospital at ulu country or have never go through the brain dead test.<br><br><blockquote>I am sure that there are a lot of individuals who would be interested in details of how organs are harvested from a presumably dead person. Body kept alive on ventilator or not? Heartbeat and blood pressure measured after death prior to organ removal or not? Anaesthetics used in procurement or paralysing agents ( yes those are used in harvesting) ? If there is a need for paralysing agents - why? If anaesthetics - why? </blockquote>It is interesting to know, if I have the time, but I can say most don't really care because they knew it will be a very complicated surgery and require a lot of cuts etc. I went to remove appenditic (don't know spelling) before and I don't even know wat r the steps they have taken. U mean u go and study how the medicine is derived, how the operation is done, how u get anesthetic etc before u went for a surgery ? U have taken panadol before, wat is derived from it ? Wat r the dangers of it ? U got find out before now ? I believe 99% of the population knew they r going for an operation but do not know every single detail of the operation. The rest of the 1 percent r freaks and actual doctor themselves.<br><br>Furthermore if they put in all the details, it is going to be as thick as a medical textbook. U want the gov to send a medical textbook to every home ? U expect the FAQs for organ transplant to include the whole 900 pages on how to transplant organ ? Is it even necessary ? U think the people who know their organ r being harvested do not know it is going to be a complicated surgery ?<br><br><blockquote>What's wrong with having a brain and cardiac death to declare a person dead? Some religions do believe that as long as the heart is still beating and the blood still flows - the person is alive regardless of a brain function. It has a spiritual meaning to them. </blockquote>I think almost all religion now believe in the authority of medical doctors now. Tat is why pope, head abbot, and possibly almost all head of religious organisation accept brain dead as dead (and not beating heart and flowing blood) and accept organ donations. Even cults r not stupid enough to challenge the viewpoint of the whole world of doctors and medical researchers. But surprisingly u seems to think u know better medical knwoledge than doctors and more about spirituality than priest and popes<br><br><blockquote>LOL as for the last statement , I worked in hospitals . I seen major fuckups so don't ever try and even question me on this one again. Doctors are only humans who can make mistakes . Medical science is only at the tip of the iceberg . Science does not equate other spiritual beliefs and science does not have answers for everything. </blockquote>Major fuckup ? u r already dead for goodness sake. Even if u aren't dead because a super incredible wrong dianosis was given, a major fuckup is still gonna kill u as the doctor will arrange for u to be burnt instead. Science does not answer for everything but tat is the best we got. U prefer to find a bomoh/priest/witch doctor for a stomachache than a doctor ?</div>

The locked-in syndrome is usually a consequence of the destruction of the base of the pons. The patient cannot move the limbs, grimace, or swallow, but the upper rostral mesencephalic structures involved in voluntary blinking and vertical eye movements remain intact. Consciousness persists because the tegmentum, with the reticular formation, is not affected. The condition is most often caused by an acute embolus to the basilar artery.26 More dramatic is the reversible GuillainÂ–BarrÃ© syndrome involving all the peripheral and cranial nerves. The progression occurs over a period of days, and knowledge of the history should prevent the dangerous error of diagnosing brain death.31<br><br>Accidental hypothermia from prolonged environmental exposure may mimic loss of brain function, but alcohol intoxication and head injury are often major confounders.27 Hypothermia causes a downward spiral of loss of brain-stem reflexes and pupillary dilatation. The response to light is lost at core temperatures of 28Â°C to 32Â°C, and brain-stem reflexes disappear when the core temperature drops below 28Â°C.27 These deficits are all potentially reversible, even after extreme hypothermia.32<br><br>The effects of many sedative and anesthetic agents can closely mimic brain death, but aspects of brain-stem function, particularly the pupillary responses to light, remain intact. When ingested in large quantities, many drugs can cause a partial loss of brain-stem reflexes. Formal determinations of brain death documenting conditions that are entirely similar to those caused by structural lesions are exceptional but have been reported in cases of intoxication with tricyclic antidepressants and barbiturates.28,29 A more complex problem is the possible confounding of the clinical determination of brain death by metabolites or traces of circulating pharmaceutical agents. Screening tests for drugs may be helpful, but some toxins (e.g., cyanide, lithium, and fentanyl) may not be detected by routine screening tests.29 A clinical diagnosis of brain death should be allowed if drug levels (e.g., of barbiturates used to treat increased intracranial pressure) are below the therapeutic range. A reasonable approach is as follows: If it is known which drug or poison is present but the substance cannot be quantified, the patient should be observed for a period that is at least four times the elimination half-life of the substance, provided that the elimination of the drug is not interfered with by other drugs or organ dysfunction. If the particular drug is not known but high suspicion persists, the patient should be observed for 48 hours to determine whether a change in brain-stem reflexes occurs; if no change is observed, a confirmatory test should be performed.

Since it became possible to revive some people after a period without respiration, heartbeat, or other visible signs of life, as well as to maintain respiration and blood flow artificially using life support treatments, an alternative definition for death was needed. </strong>In recent decades, the concept of "brain death" has emerged. By brain-death criteria, a person can be pronounced <strong> legally dead even </strong> if the heart continues to beat due to life support measures. The first nation in the world to adopt the brain death as the definition of legal death was Finland in 1971. In the United States, Kansas had made a similar law at an even earlier date[1].<br><br>A brain-dead individual has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no electrical activity</span></strong> and no clinical evidence of brain function on physical examination (no response to pain, absent cranial nerve reflexes (pupillary response (fixed pupils), oculocephalic reflex, corneal reflexes), absent response to the caloric reflex test and no spontaneous respirations). <strong> It is important to distinguish between brain death and states that mimic brain death (eg. barbiturate intoxication, alcohol intoxication, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma or chronic vegetative states). </strong>Some comatose patients can recover, and some patients with severe irreversible neurologic dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions such as spontaneous respiration, loss of both cortex and brainstem function. ......<br><br><strong> Note that brain electrical activity can stop completely, or apparently completely (a "flat EEG") for some time in deep anaesthesia or during cardiac arrest before being restored. Brain death refers only to the permanent cessation of electrical activity. Numerous people who have experienced such "flat line" experiences have reported near-death experiences, the nature of which is controversial </strong>." </blockquote>Legally dead does not equate to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really dead </span>.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Informed consent should let people know about what they expect about how they might look after death and what happens when they donate their organs if they wish to know. All I ever get is " you will be treated with respect and dignity" PERIOD.</blockquote>During the period before the HOTA was enacted, this was discussed extensively in the press. After the transplant, the donor's appearance is as if he had a major surgery: a laparotomy incision if the liver and kidneys were removed, a thoractomy if the heart and lungs were removed. You are free to ask the organ transplant coordinator in any hospital if you have questions about transplant. In the opt out system, there is no need to request consent prior to organ transplant under HPTA.<br><br><blockquote> Do they use anaesthetics or paralytic agents in removal then?</blockquote>Once brain death has set in, what is the point of anaesthesia? Some patients may have been anaesthesized before brain death but to anaesthetic agents have to be withdrawn before the transplant for at least 2 good reasons.<br><br>First, anaesthetic agents may damage the transplant organs, especially the liver and kidneys which are needed to excrete them; and we need these organs to be in the best possible condition.<br><br>Second, you cannot certify brain death with anaesthesia, which brings me to your other question.<br><br><blockquote>Heard of Guillain Barre'?<br><br>Or maybe if you want the wise medical research that says so</blockquote>The doctors cannot certify brain death if the underlying cause of brain death eg. a stroke, head injury is unknown or if the possibility of neurological conditions such as Gullian Barre or locked in syndrome cannot be excluded. The certification is doen by at least two independent senior doctors not connected to the transplant, one of whom has to be an expert in anaesthesiology or a related field.<br><br>The other important exclusion is anaesthesia. Many drugs eg. barbiturates can mimic signs of brain death and so even if the patient had been anaesthesized previously, this has to be stopped and the body cleared of such drugs before testing for brain death.</div>

Our law in this regard protects the minority view in that they can opt out if they so wish. As you said, your understanding of death is rooted in a personal belief which the majority of people do not share. You are entitled to your belief and you can opt out.

Even if u have hypothermia and drug intoxification, it can still be check if the test r conducted properly since they don't affect the eyes.<br><br><blockquote>Some doctors challenge it as well like Dr David Evans .

There r many doctors in the world and it is not surprising if u find a few doctors tat do not support the test of brain dead. I think it wil be more substantial if u can back up your claim with reputable scientific organisations. There r many scientific organisations but they consists of a panel and discussion among the members thus r more credible compared with single individuals. I mean if all the scientific organisations support the test of brain dead, then I don't see why it loses to a mere individual<br><br><blockquote>You neglected to even fully read the brain dead side of it.<br><br>Note the bold </blockquote>I have read the whole article before and I find nothing is wrong<br><br><blockquote>" Traditionally, death has been defined as the cessation of all body functions, including respiration and heartbeat. Since it became possible to revive some people after a period without respiration, heartbeat, or other visible signs of life, as well as to maintain respiration and blood flow artificially using life support treatments, an alternative definition for death was needed. </blockquote>Tat is true. Traditionally there is no cure for headache, or stomachache and operation has a high mortality rate. Traditionally there is no such thing as a life suppor machine. Note the word "traditionally". In the past people do state tat death is when the heart stop beating. But now with more medical knowledge brain dead is the real dead<br><br><blockquote>A brain-dead individual has no electrical activity and no clinical evidence of brain function on physical examination (no response to pain, absent cranial nerve reflexes (pupillary response (fixed pupils), oculocephalic reflex, corneal reflexes), absent response to the caloric reflex test and no spontaneous respirations). It is important to distinguish between brain death and states that mimic brain death (eg. barbiturate intoxication, alcohol intoxication, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma or chronic vegetative states). </blockquote>U need to re read the article. It say brain dead individual and list etc as brain dead. Then u read there r possible sickness tat mimic brain dead (meaning coma, hurting it have no effect), but the brain dead test still can check for sure if it is brain dead or not.<br><br><blockquote>Note that brain electrical activity can stop completely, or apparently completely (a "flat EEG" for some time in deep anaesthesia or during cardiac arrest before being restored. Brain death refers only to the permanent cessation of electrical activity. Numerous people who have experienced such "flat line" experiences have reported near-death experiences, the nature of which is controversial ." </blockquote>Note tat EEG is not part of the major test but supplementary one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
