            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Brain stem death has no cure . I think it would be more of the  health system owing him a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> duty of care </span> to him while he is in the process of dying and to ensure that all his vital functions such as of the heart fully shut down to make sure he has truly and properly passed on to the next world prior to organ removal.</div></blockquote>The medical team has a duty of care to correctly apply the clinical criteria for brain death. Once that is done and he is certified brain dead, he is legally dead. Whether or not there is another world and if he has passed into it is none of the doctor's concern. Once he is certified brain dead, organ transplant can take place.<br><br>If you are one of the minority who reject the concept of brain death, then no organ transplant would be possible. The moment the heart stops, all vital organs are rendered rapidly unsuitable for transplant. As I said, I believe the vast majority of Singaporeans support organ transplant. Accepting that brain death is the point of no return and using it as the legal definition of death is the only way to facilitate organ transplant. And therefore the vast majority of Singaporeans who support organ transplant will also accept brain death.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Not take him while he looks alive to his family members or at least give them 24 hrs more as they requested out of the compassion that they have not come to terms with his death - never mind if 2 other organs degenerate because kidneys and corneas still can be harvested for others. It is better than nothing at all.</div></blockquote>You can't harvest the organs when he looks well on the way to decomposition. The hospital has already delayed it by 24 hours. The price of that delay was one liver failure patient, because the liver was no longer suitable for transplant. Another 24 hours more may well render <strong>all the organs </strong>unsuitable for transplant.<br><br>A wait of 24 hours beside the corpse of a brain dead patient may be psychologically satisfying to his relatives but it has come at the expense of a living patient who might well die from liver failure, with another lot of grieving relatives. The tragedy is: the second death could well be prevented.</div>

What you quoted relates to an opt out clause (to register an objection tpo organ donation) that can be made either by the deceased person or if the person was not legally competent to make such a decision (a minor or mentally handicapped), his legal guardian. His relatives are not necessarily his legal guardians and someone who is legally competent to handle his affairs will not have one. That is also true in Singapore.<br><br>Please note also that the declaration to opt out has to be made before the person has been proclaimed brain dead.

After all it is prior to the utter demise of the poor soul when the doctor asks his family to consider donation .'<br><br>First, there is a difference between relatives and legal guardians, as I have mentioned. Not every relative is a legal guardian or vice versa. Secondly, legal guardians, who have the legal right to make decisions on behalf of the patient, can only make a declaration to refuse organ donation BEFORE the certification of brain death. Once brain death is certified, such a declaration cannot be made. Third, unless one is mentally incompetent or is a minor or is incompetent as a result of illness eg. Alzheimer disease (http://www.alzheimer-europe.org/?lm4=E1714A531042) , most people will not have a legal guardian. This applies to the small number of people in society who are not legally competent to manage their own affairs. A corollary might be someone with power of attorney. You can delegate the power to make legal decisions for you to another person, such as a relative. In the case of organ donation, you can grant a relative or trusted friend durable power of attorney. In the event that you fall into a coma (bit not yet brain dead), he or she can make the decision for you and opt out of organ donation or request that the ventilator be turned off etc...Of course, if you opt out now, you won't have to worry about that in future.<br><br>In summary, the opt out system in Austria is very similar to that in Singapore. Relatives in Austria do not have the right to object to organ donation in the event of a brain dead patient who had not previously made a declaration to opt out.<br></div>
