We don't see mandatory blood drives do we?<br><br>However some of your other posts have raised other concerns. It seems you are mixing up your distaste of the current policy with what saving lives is all about, with all your previous posts about it just being too bad for people with organ failure and what have you not. In fact many of your posts seem to me to be highly dismissive of an issue with has a lot of moral and humanitarian implications... which is prehaps highly contradictory to your own stance of principle of having choice in this affair.<br><br>If it is our right to all be selfish about this issue, then we really have no say in a greater power then us deciding to be selfish for their own needs and imposing such a policy and saying "too bad" for us.<br><br>What is your personal stance however, on being an post-mortem organ donor? In the same vein of argument, would we all choose not donate blood in protest if the government one day decides to choose the easy way out with keeping the blood bank in stock?<br><br>The current policy may be screwed up, however in working against it one must realize that they do not make another mistake in the opposite direction... we don't stop policing just because some policemen are corrupt, or pull out all our teeth because some are decayed.</div>

It's a gray area . But to remove it without the explicit consent of a person or families who might have a different ideal due to their beliefs - well that is outrageous.<br><br>If anyone who truly wants to be a cadaveric donor - they make the effort to sign on like my friends who had the orange organ donor card prior to the automatic scheme.<br><br>If those who cannot be bothered to even sign on the simple piece of paper stating they will donate their organs and YET  want the convenience of an auto opt in in the midst of calling objecting parties selfish , that is a whole lot of hypocritical crap.<br><br>At least I know , I bothered to be on the bone marrow donation list because I know it is hard to get matches and it is a live donorship in where I have the choice to go through a painful procedure to extract a marrow. I explicitly consented because they bothered to let me know how the whole procedure is like if I am a match ,and they have my name on record .<br><br>I don't know what is life after death like and I sure don't feel like risking any of my organs unless it is a family member whom I love and treasure. I also don't entertain the idea of an accidental removal which might cause my death . I have alot of suspicions. No one to reassure me except tell me that I am selfish . Hilarious.<br><br>So here I am thinking in terms of those who do not have much knowledge about such things like the auto opt in and they deserve the right to know what happens to their body after death. So they should relinquish their <span style="font-style: italic;"> selfish </span>rights just because the government and health authorities are too lazy to campaign for organ donations?</div>

I explicitly consented because they bothered to let me know how the whole procedure is like if I am a match ,and they have my name on record .<br><br>I don't know what is life after death like and I sure don't feel like risking any of my organs unless it is a family member whom I love and treasure. I also don't entertain the idea of an accidental removal which might cause my death . I have alot of suspicions. No one to reassure me except tell me that I am selfish . Hilarious.<br><br>So here I am thinking in terms of those who do not have much knowledge about such things like the auto opt in and they deserve the right to know what happens to their body after death. So they should relinquish their <span style="font-style: italic;"> selfish </span>rights just because the government and health authorities are too lazy to campaign for organ donations? </div></blockquote>You are barking up the wrong tree, it seems that in your haste to point out what is currently wrong with the system, you miss out the rather obvious fact that I am agreeing with you on most of your points on what is wrong.<br><br>What I am not agreeing on however, is your rather flippant attitude towards opting out purely on matter of principle.

I was adding sarcasm with the naturistic arguments - they are just a sarcastic remark.<br><br>I already said well it is all good if people are willing to donate their organ with full knowledge of how their bodies will be used . i did recall mentioning it as a good deed .<br><br>My point is simple- it is about a right of choice. Those who refuse to be organ donors have the right to refuse on the basis of their beliefs. Those who are willing to donate organs have the right to donate their organs. I am not going against that measure .<br><br><strong> Not once did I say I was against organ donation. I am for organ donation provided the deceased had given their consent to it in the first place. </strong><br><br><strong> I am arguing against getting automatic organ cadaveric status out of people who might not be aware of the fact that they are going to one. </strong>What is so inhumane about that?<br><br>What if someone whose religion objects to it but they still remove it because the person did not fill in the opt out form due to ignorance? Just dismiss their beliefs and cannibalise their body because someone else needs organ? Well doesn't it sound like soylent green itself? Just don't tell people how they are eating people likewise don't tell people their bodies are being farmed for organs.<br><br><strong> What is so wrong with a volunter opt in system other than you instantly gain a lot  potential unsuspecting and unknowing cadaveric donors in the automatic  opt in system?</strong><br><br>I am on the bone marrow registry. That's fine with me because it's my choice and I have an idea of how they extract donor bone marrows and I am well aware of the risks. I do not go around calling people who do not put themselves on the registry selfish or inhumane.<br><br>I believe that people should have a right to make their choice. <strong> One incursion on rights  like this will come with another in the future </strong>. Did you know that some transplantation organisations already started discussing taking fresh organs out of people they deem as unlikely to survive? What makes you think the day has not come yet? It has already came - they taken out organs of a man who was not declared properly as dead in USA. So what makes you think Singapore won't follow suit?<br><br><strong> I rather have an opt in system where people sign the papers and agree to donate their organs. </strong> Rather than to have some doctors hesitating about taking organs or not in fear of the family and wasting possible donor organs. Rather than to have some family shocked by the plain desecration of a loved one's body because they were ignorant of the policy.  Who is to say some of the opt out forms  won't be lost in the mail or the system?<br><br>So yes , I think going for an volunteer opt in system is better. This way people like you and stupidissmart can go volunteer happily via signing a full consent form with the heavenly bliss of knowing you can save someone. That is not a problem with me. Is that a problem with you?<br></div>

As SIS said, there are too many Singaporeans who are just too lazy to take the effort to sign up. Given that among the small numbers who have signed an organ donation card, an even smaller number would be brain dead for some reason before their heart stops (that is the window of opportunity needed for cadaveric organ transplant), the number of organs available for transplantation is very limited. Meanwhile, many patients die from the lack of an organ whilst every year, healthy organs are buried or burnt along with brain-dead victims.<br><br>I believe that an opt-out system does not take away consent. It presumes consent for the vast majority of Singaporeans who do not object to organ donation, but would not take the time and effort to sign an organ donation card. However, that minority has the right to register an objection and withdraw consent. Death is not something people want to think about. That is the reason an opt-out system is also being considered in the UK, where thousands die for the lack of a transplant organ or risk all sorts of complications going to India to buy an organ.<br><br>The government can do more to make it easier for Singaporeans to opt out. I agree there can be greater public education and opt-form forms can be made available in more public places, eg. polyclinics, all hospital information desks, RCs and community centres, petrol kiosks even...It should also be possible to opt out online and the web address should be published in the media.<br><br>I understand the reluctance to 'encourage' people to opt out but Singaporeans should be given a choice.

It presumes consent for the vast majority of Singaporeans who do not object to organ donation, but would not take the time and effort to sign an organ donation card. However, that minority has the right to register an objection and withdraw consent. Death is not something people want to think about. That is the reason an opt-out system is also being considered in the UK, where thousands die for the lack of a transplant organ or risk all sorts of complications going to India to buy an organ.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The government can do more to make it easier for Singaporeans to opt out. I agree there can be greater public education and opt-form forms can be made available in more public places, eg. polyclinics, all hospital information desks, RCs and community centres, petrol kiosks even...It should also be possible to opt out online and the web address should be published in the media.<br><br>I understand the reluctance to 'encourage' people to opt out but Singaporeans should be given a choice. However, I would advocate that those who opt out would [b]not</span></strong> be given an organ transplant in the event that they need one, or unless there is no other suitable recipient in the entire transplant queue. <br>[/b]</blockquote>Overall the government as I recalled never did to emphasize much on organ donation during my time as a student or when I was working. It would be interesting to see what the UK residents say about an auto opt in system.<br><br>HOTA stated they will be placed on a lower priority list if they opt out than those who opt in.<br><br>One way to raise opt in rate is to register consent on driver's licence or identification cards. When the person acquires either of them - ID being redone at 30 for the age of consent - they should be asked if they wish to be an organ donor. That is the way to go .  I do believe the americans have the driver licence system of documentating organ donors in some states. Some are legally binding and some are not.</div>
