I am not from any sect ....I belong to a major religion and there are conflicting views. Politically it cannot seen as good if organ donation is objected to on any stance so every major religion is at least obliged to say it is good. On the other side where I stand , other clerics are questioning the definitions used in brain stem death ,and when the body and consciousness separate. I know that some priests have the idea that brain death is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> total </span> cessation of neurological function , they have no idea that it just means brain stem gone.<br><br>And by the way , there are other legitimate religions in the world which object to it  like orthodox judaism.</div>

They were behaving like robbers," said Sim Chew Hiah, one of Sim's elder sisters.<br><br>The Sim family's experience has prompted a wave of letters to the local media, with some people saying they would opt out in protest, and added fire to a debate about organ trading. Lee Wei Ling -- a prominent doctor who is the daughter of Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of modern Singapore -- last month urged the government to legalise organ trading, or the buying or selling of human organs for cash.<br><br>"Organ trading is frowned upon and usually not allowed in countries where political correctness reigns," said Lee in a letter to the Straits Times.<br><br>"If monetary incentive makes a potential living donor more willing to save another life, what is wrong in allowing that ?"<br><br>Her views have some support from the public.<br><br>"If I can sell my organs, give my children a better life, and save someone else's life too, why not? Not everyone drives a Mercedes," said Khalid, 32, who gave only his first name.<br><br>Currently, anyone caught buying or selling human organs in Singapore may be jailed up to a year or fined up to US$6,500.<br><br>POOR DONORS<br><br>Those who oppose the trading of human organs say it promotes greater social injustice.<br><br>"To trade it and sell it for a 100 pounds, 200 pounds, or to the highest bidder, that is to prostitute your organ," said Dr Choi Kin, president of the Hong Kong Medical Association.<br><br>Such donors are likely to be the poor and uneducated people from countries such as Brazil and India, who can sell a kidney for as little as $1,000, the World Health Organisation said.<br><br>And they are usually exploited by organ traffickers, who can charge wealthy clients up to $100,000 to $200,000 for a new organ, according to the WHO.<br><br>The chronic shortage of organs available for transplant is a global problem. In the U.S. alone, more than 6,200 patients die each year while waiting for an organ, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a U.S.-based non-profit medical group.<br><br>The shortage has forced doctors and governments to look for alternatives, such as the use of pigs' kidneys, hearts and lungs, or the purchase of human organs.<br><br>Many patients have also travelled abroad for transplants, notably to China, which has been accused by rights groups of harvesting organs from executed prisoners.<br><br>Since 1995, more than 270 Singaporeans have gone abroad, mostly to China, for organ transplants, the Health Ministry said.<br><br>DEFINITION OF DEATH<br><br>To ease the organ shortage, Singapore amended its Human Organ Transplant Act in 2004 to expand the pool of organ donors and the type of organs that could be donated.<br><br>Hospitals can remove the kidneys, liver, heart and corneas of all non-Muslim Singapore citizens or permanent residents when they die, unless they have objected.<br><br>Muslims can choose to donate their organs, as in Iran and Malaysia, although many believe that the dead should be buried with all their organs intact.<br><br>Doctors say a system which assumes all citizens are organ donors is necessary because even though many people are in favour of donating their organs, few actually come forward.<br><br>While many European countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, and Spain, have laws similar to Singapore's Transplant Act, it can still be a sensitive issue.<br><br>When Brazil passed a similar law in 1998, it triggered a public outcry. The Federal Attorney later conceded that families could prevent the removal of organs for transplant.<br><br>Critics say laws which assume all citizens are organ donors are inadequate because the definition of death is debatable. Others are concerned that life-support may be turned off prematurely or that people may be unaware of the opt-out option.<br><br>"It should be up to the citizens to decide. These are their bodies, their organs, and therefore their decisions," said Dr Choi Kin. "If an accident should occur, it would be too late for them to opt out, even if they do not agree to donate."<br><br>In Singapore, some doctors had urged amending the Transplant Act, giving families the right to block such donations.<br><br>After the outcry over the Sim family's forced donation, the hospital and health ministry said in a statement that they would "continue to find practical solutions to minimise the emotional distress of families and staff in such situations."<br><br>Sim's kidneys went to patients who had waited six to eight years for donor organs, the ministry said.<br><br>His parents were offered five years of subsidised hospital fees -- and his family received a thank-you letter from the ministry for their "generous organ donation."</div>

So if donating will cause more grieve, i feel he is incline not to donate afterall.<br><br>Ironically, our Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has a different interpretation from me.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Mr Khaw said: "The donor was (probably) around 21 or 22 when HOTA was introduced in this House. I remember there was widespread public debate. He was an educated man. I'm sure he was fully aware of HOTA and the fact that if he did not opt out, it would mean that he wanted to save lives in the event of a sudden death.

A person who is in a coma may recover but one who is certified brain dead will never recover. He is brain dead and will never regain consciousness, talk or walk again...never. If the criteria of brain stem death are satisfied, not a single person ever recovered in extensive clinical studies done. In most instances, even with artificial life support the heart stops within days.</blockquote>I am not a doctor so I could not comment on your affirmation that a brain dead person is definitely and totally dead and without any chance of a recovery.<br><br>From reading a letter to the forum page by certain doctors on this case as published in Today's newspaper (28.2.2007) it would appear that there were differing medical opinions on this matter.<br><br>Furthermore is the process of certifying someone brain dead an absolute and objective process or is it one likely to be subjective and affected by personal judgments of attending doctors. If such doctors are employed by the state they too might well have a vested interest in hastening the brain dead's departure in order to take his organ for transplant.<br><br>Many citizens might not have objected to their organs' being used for transplant but the opt-out system appears to be highly presumptuous in that there is actually no consent at all by the individuals just because the state says "if you do not object you are deemed to have accepted".<br><br>This is typical of our system of running the government and such a presumption were often seen in the making of many government policies.<br><br>Such a presumptuous legislation is not healthy and if not moderated or reasoned will lead to more tyranny. As it is we already have many legislations made in this manner by presuming that citizens agree if they do not object.<br><br>Let us take the opportunity to discuss and reason whether the state should use its power to trample on the right of many as well. No matter how the state argues its presumptions is right or proper it is still a fact that many people have not really agreed to their organs' transplant even though the state says that it has made a lot of publicity warning them of opt-out.<br><br>Many people who are uneducated are totally unaware of the past public airing as the uneducated did not read the newspapers or follow the publicity Minister was so sure have reached every one.<br><br>In the particular case in question, the doctors who advised the family members concerned that the brain dead was dead appeared to be unable to convince the family there was no chance of a recovery.<br><br>It would appear in this case the state is more interested in taking the organ of a dying person said to be brain dead ignoring the anguish of the family members.<br><br>Is this issue fully understood by the state or is the state only trying to score points in a one-sided manner as usual to secure the state power and policy for its own purpose.<br><br>As long there is a chance of a recovery and the brain dead certification is far from conclusive, then the public will have the perception that the doctors are only interested in transplanting the organ instead of giving another chance to the certified brain dead to recover.<br><br>This is in short the crux of the whole issue being debated. Does Minister Khaw really cover the whole hog of issues or is he hogwashing the issue to favor state being developed into a monster only interested in pursuing its own purpose and power.<br><br><blockquote>quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>In certain very personal situation, a person's family or love ones may not want to see the dying or dead cut up for society's purpose akin to religious belief.<br><br>OM:<br><br>It is the decision of the individual, not the family or anyone else. Whoever objects to organ donation for religious or other reasons can opt out. If you do not, you have given implied consent, as the law provides for.</blockquote>If the minister has passed the HOTA no matter how he argues his case, he will forever be biased because he is merely defending his biases.<br><br>In this case, the crucial issue is should the state use presumption that a dying person has presumably agreed to donating his organ without any consideration whether such a person has actually agreed to so donate his organ.<br><br>It will always be a problem if what seems to be honorable is done in an unhonorable manner to the extent of even wanting to hasten the brain dead or dying to score point for the transplant.<br><br>The opt-out methodology is never a clearly defined consent and this is a fact no matter how persuasive is the state's purpose or saving another life with the organ. It is not correct to err on presumption the dying does not want to keep his organ till the very last minute of his life for as long as he has the last breath and last hope.<br><br>It will be highly irregular in such a case for the state to hasten the dying to die and pressurize the family members into leaving their love one for dead entirely for the state purpose.<br><br>This case reminds me of the incident of how MM Lee reacted to the doctors in London when his wife was suffering symptom of a stroke. He even went to extent of chartering the whole plane in order to fly back his beloved one to Singapore to seek imminent cure.<br><br>Citizens must have their right to love their love ones to the same extent. They should be respected for that right to do their very best to care for their family members who are on the verge of dying even to the extent of keeping them alive to the last breath wherever humanly possible.<br><br><blockquote>   quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>Must we run a country where the government or state is always to be that almighty that it must always take from citizens from monies to all forms of controls in the name of society good or the state.<br><br>There are many personal and family matters for which the state shouldn't not intrude.

There is no point transplanting organs from donors above the age of 60 because organs from the elderly will not function well when transplanted. That does not mean you will not receive a transplant once you pass the age of 60. However, a transplant at that age may not be suitable for other medical reasons.<br><br>On the other hand, if you opt out of HOTA, you will be placed at the bottom of the waiting list even if you are 30.

More residents now appear to be thinking about<br>donating their organs and taking concrete steps if they don't want to.<br><br>Requests for opt-out forms have gone up since the much-publicised incident<br>at  Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on  Feb 6.<br><br>"There has been feedback from hospitals and polyclinics that forms are<br>running out and that there are more queries from the public," a Health<br>Ministry spokesperson told Today.<br><br>While such feedback has been anecdotal so far, an increase in the number<br>of those opting out of organ donation is expected.<br><br>In the past, many people had dragged their feet on exercising the opt-out<br>clause under the Human Organ Transplant  Act (Hota) until it was too late.<br><br>Enacted in 1987, the law allows for the mandatory removal of kidneys if a<br>person dies in an accident - unless the person has specifically opted out.<br>The scheme covers all  Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who are not<br>Muslim.<br><br>The Act was revised in 2004 to include the harvesting of livers, hearts<br>and corneas and expanded to cover non-accidental deaths. Between then and<br>last month, some 6,000 had opted out of Hota.<br><br>The issue made headlines after a 43-year-old crane operator suffered a<br>stroke at work and was pronounced brain-dead at SGH on Feb 5.<br><br>His family, on learning that his organs might be harvested, first pleaded<br>for a 24-hour extension in the hope that he might recover.

I owe a debt to them , not the government.
