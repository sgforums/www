A person who is brain dead is dead...that is no chance of recovery. Once the clinical criteria of brain death have been satisfied, the patient is DEAD.

There is no 'differing medical opinion' that once a person is brain dead, HE WILL NEVER RECOVER. <strong>He has passed the point of no return in the dying process.  </strong><br><br>There ARE clear definition of brain death and the clinical criteria have been well tested.

We are not talking about a remote chance. We are talking about a certainty.<br><br>Medical science has allowed us to determine the certainty of death before the body has completely decomposed to a skeleton so that skeptics like you will admit the person has died. There is no possibility of a cure...maybe there's one in the fantasy you have created in your mind whilst organ failure patients live each day in the nightmare of pain and impending death.<br><br>I maintain the minister had correctly applied the best medical science available and through this Act, gave many Singaporeans a chance to live.<br></div>
