Why is that so?  As stated by yourself, there are more people needing an organ donation than those dead who's organs are still fit enough to be transplanted.  In such a case, aint the Govt making a practical solution to save the living?<br><br>2) As for your anti-rejection drugs issue.. go and ask -anyone- on a transplant waiting list, i bet everyone of those wont complain about having to do so. Obviously they rather take those drugs than have the alternatives.<br><br>3) There is an opt-out option available and anyone who bothers and wants to can opt out.  It is NOT like the government owns your organs like livestock(ie against your will even if you refuse)<br><br>4) At the age of 21 (is that or 18?) You are inform of the organ donation scheme and the opt out option is stated right there. Hence you can make a choice.<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br><br>I remembered when I opt out after asking a very specific question - the doctor made a lousy attempt at 'making me feel bad'.

[/b][/quote]<br><br>I understand your stance of opting out to give your own family priority in case of emergency.<br><br>So the question now is, if you family's safe, which i gladly hope they are, and no one you know needs organs, what would you do with your organs when you die since you now have opt out?<br></div>

Yes I do care about my rights and my beliefs as long as it does not infringe on other people's right. Last I checked - non donation does not mean infringement. However having an opt out option rather than an opt in is somewhat dubious in terms of informed consent and it is somewhat a borderline infringement  .  I do not have that religious belief of donating organs. Others want to do it - good of  them .<br><br>If people don't want to donate their organs , they don't deserve a guilt trip. Like I said , it is not my fault or anyone's that a person die from not receiving any organs. It is the nature of disease that killed them . Not I.<br><br>My priority is my family . Between a family member and a stranger - I choose to save my family member especially if it is my parents or sibling. Blood is thicker than water. I do not and will not give priority to  a stranger hanging by the thread when my family member is going to hang by the same thread if they do not receive my organs. I make no apology for that .<br><br>They will never get any part of my organs if they cannot promise me that in an event should a relative require it ,my relative should take precedence due to the likelihood of a  genetic match.<br><br>The body is mine made up of genetic structures of my ancestors , the DNA match is likely to be within my family. Do you even know anything about organ tranplants? It is all about the luck of the draw for matching organs between strangers. Alot of people still die on waiting lists because they cannot even find a matching donor from those who die suddenly . If the donor is within the family and has a match, the person have a lower rate of organ rejection than taking a donor organ of a stranger?<br><br>Anyways they are experimenting on transgenic pigs for organ transplant. There you go - organ donation for the future. </div></blockquote>nobody said that yr body ain't yrs.<br>it is yr decision that u have to live with.<br>i know about DNA, but even blood relative can have non-matching organ. furthermore, it is about matching blood type n acceptance by the body more than DNA.<br>the doctor will try to find those organs that has a chance of matching rather than to transplant one that is going to fail.<br>u talk as if u know everything, but don't assume everyone else is as ignorant as you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>it just a wonder whether those ppl can hang on till the future is here.</div>
