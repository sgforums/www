Why don't you go talk to people who do not and will not believe in organ transplantation due to their own personal/religious/cultural beliefs?<br><br>Besides I do not think it is selfish . It is the right of an individual to protect the sanctity of his body even after his/her demise. How one wants to deal with their body is based on their own decision. An automatic opt in is not what many are aware of and it is unfair to them.<br><br>Yes we can play out all we want about how sad it is for people awaiting transplants but we cannot force others to donate when they clearly do not wish to or have no idea of.

            <div class='col-md body'>U wanna opt out can opt out. U wanna give your organ can give organ. Muslim no matter if they opt out or not, won't get their organs donated because hospital do not want trouble. I do not believe the doctors r so stupid to dig out your organs when u r still breathing to get themselves into serious potential trouble tat can land them in jail. To the doctors, it is additional work and they seems to use people organ too seldom. Frankly speaking, I heard the doctor r so cautious with taking organ out tat they only do it if u suffer an accident and not due to sickness.<br><br>I am going to opt in. A pig organ is more valuable than the organ tat is going to be burnt. If u donate it to someone who need tat organ to survive, it is priceless. Saving a person life is better than building a 7 storey pagoda. If everyone donate their organ more frequently, then u r more likely to get an organ when u need it. So we should encourage people to donate organs</div>

Like I say I think people who become willing organ donors are doing a good cause. Nothing against full and willing organ donors. I have something against automatic opt in - it is about depriving a person of the right or knowledge of what might occur.<br><br>The point is about auto opt in being absolutely ridiculous and violating the rights of others who are not aware of it.  Secondly like one person said , sometimes the doctors also <strong> might hesitate </strong> to remove it. For kidneys, it takes about 30 mins before it becomes unviable. Corneas and the rest I am not sure.<br><br>An opt in form signed by the person prior to his death will instill a lot of confidence in the doctors to remove the organ in time for transplant instead of pussy footing around. It means full consent. No family member will want to challenge it in court.<br>That is fine with me. It also means that in order to get organs, the government or health authorities will have to raise the awareness of the benefits of organs which is surely a good thing since a person will be able to fully consent with the knowledge.<br><br>It won't happen with live donors though , because the doctors <strong> explain the risks and what to expect after is  to us </strong>and we can still make the decision on whether we do it or not so that a stranger will live.  That is why I am on the bone marrow donation list  . I won't argue if someone requires my bone marrow when I am well aware of what goes on.<br><br>I am arguing this on principle of having full consent with knowledge. Like I said I think organ donors <strong> who gave full consent to their bodies being used </strong> are doing a good deed. Nothing against them.<br><br>I have an issue with bodies being automatically cannibalised for organs regardless of whether the family or deceased have the knowledge or not. It just stinks of SOYLENT GREEN except they feed humans with humans.</div>

We all have the right to our rights but it still follows what we do with our rights determines what kind of person we will end up being.

They took the effort to make their consent clear. Why can't you if you allegedly feel so strongly about donating your organs?<br><br>BUT just because you are conveniently opted in to be a donor makes it right for doctors to take organs from unwary people who might not be as knowledgeable as you ?

Well now you have some law abiding citizens with a lack of knowledge who might not be agreeable to the opt in component. So they are getting treated the same way as criminals - a lack of knowledge is not an excuse, let's remove your organs.<br><br>What a load of crap. To find out the criteria of how they pronounce a person dead and harvest their organs took me a while to look for it . It does not come with the damn form.<br><br>I am for organ donation with full consent of the person or their family. I am not for organ donation which is automatically placed on the onus that one did not opt out so therefore the parts of the deceased is taken apart like a piece of machinery cannibalised for another.<br><br></div>
