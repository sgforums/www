There is a delicate balance and I refuse to tilt it either way.<br></blockquote>Well in the end it's still your choice, however I wonder where exactly do you draw the line at "nature taking their chance away".<br><br>By the <span style="font-style: italic;">natural</span> extension of your logic, there is really no need to help provide medical care to the poor and needy or make affordable medicines and treatments for those who are at the mercies of market forces.<br><br>If fact you are pretty much saying if I come across you lying broken and bleeding on the side of the road after a hit and run, I have every right to take one hard look at you, stare you in the eye, and walk away muttering somthing about "survival of the fitness" under my breath and sleep well at night. After all, unfortunate circumstances are simply "population control" and those too weak to save themselves certainly aren't worth tilting the balance of nature or karma invoking this bizzare thing called "compassion".<br><br>For if you truly decide to "refuse to tilt it either way", and go the way of true Social Darwinism, this would be the natural conclusion of your reasoning. For one thing I find such a notion rather hard to accept... and as you indicated... even you are willing to bend and tilt nature's laws and rules when it comes to your family members... in fact you more or less totally contradict and deny your previous position on naturalism when you made that statement.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Donating your organs while you are alive to anyone (loved one or not) is prehaps the most unnatural to do, going by your own thesis of "nature". There is a high chance of mortality in your loved ones who are revieving your organs anyway, and in many cases following transplant there is a increased chance that the person will be unable to have children.<br><br>Hence what is happening is that you are compromising your own health and genetic fitness (the chance to pass on your genes) by devoting resources to aid the survival of another individual who is all but genetically irrelevant to the human race and through which nature is removing by totally natural processes.<br><br>In fact, what you said you are willing to do (donate while alive) is more anti-nature then giving up organs after you are dead. You are compromising the chances of a fit individual to pass on their genes for the sake of a weak (and by many chances) individual who is unlikely to make that investment pay off in gene-survival.<br><br>In fact, donating your organs after you are dead, by all reasoning is certainly more natural given that your ability to carry on your genes has now terminated and at the very least, the most rationalistic gamble to help the human race in survival is to have one last shot in boostering some other person's gene fitness in the survival of the fittest.<br><br>I am afriad you are contradicting yourself. I understand your personal stance in this issue... but I regret to inform you that your justifications are quite illogical. You can only justify your appeal for your choice on emotional grounds, certianly not the "nature" and "natural" talk you tried to spin out to make it more tasteful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frankly, with regards to -this issue- of presumed constent of organ donation, i dont see why not just let it be, it is afterall for saving of lives. I agree it is a bad call when the family requests for an additional day but these two issues are only linked because of HOTA. The odds of such thing occuring is very low (ie comatose/brain dead).<br><br>Presumed organ donation helps for most people who just die suddenly(accidents)/naturally. This will help because when the body dies the doctors dont have to waste time seeking constent when every moment the organs are losing their "freshness". Imagine you are dead already from accident and you opt out...your family is in a shock and delays deciding, then you cant save others...would that make you feel any better?<br><br>If you are dying/near dying i dont mind being live stock to save others. In FACT, i would be very very angry(if there's such a thing after you die and come back to haunt them), if NOK opt to not let my organs be used to help others.</div>
