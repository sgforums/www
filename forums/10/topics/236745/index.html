If cannot use, do they still cut you up?<br><br>Knowing the Singapore way, I presume no matter how bad your organs are, you'll be cut up first, organs removed before anything else. So then another question, if your organs cannot be used, will they be put back into your dead body or are they thrown into some dustbin and sent to incinernary(sp?) plant and burn?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Serious question here.

As far as i -believe- if you opt out, you are just letting others die(worse suffer!) when you have a chance to better their lives after you are dead yourself. I mean seriously how would you feel if you were told hey someone just died and matched your X requirements but you cannot get transplant cause he/she opt out already....think about that.  Opting in/out is your own decision to save the lives of others.</div></blockquote>Agreed!<br><br>We hve downloaded the forms and signed up the opt out forms,it is better done now than regret later!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
