            <div class='col-md body'>Usually in a real democratic countries,the politicians are usually more concern for their ppl.They try to control inflation rate,raise their workers pay to a "reasonable wages",improve their workers benefit n their ppl lives.Of coz,those foreign ministers are not kind soul,it is just that they hope to win more votes for their party in the general election.<br>But look at our ministers,when we want to look for a job that is 8-9hrs,they say we are choosy n criticize us dont want to work 12hrs jobs.Whereby they themselves work only 8-9 hrs n 5 days per week!!!When we want to look for jobs that are closer to our home,they criticize us not serious in finding jobs whereby they themselves got their own car to "deliver" them to their working place!!!!When we demand for higher pay due to inflation of our cost of living,those ministers criticize us as greedy whereby they themselves take a pay that is higher than that of the U.S president or foreign countries ministers!!![]<br>Becoz of the democratic election system,foreign countries ministers know how to take care n serve their ppl n handle criticism in a "professional" way.Whereas due to lack of competition,the PAP ministers tend to push the blames to the public if anything goes wrong.So,do our ministers lack of servicing DNA,post your views here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They do have servicing DNA.<br><br>Proof are below:<br><br>- Servicing their wallet<br>Although they have pay-cut few years ago, they get the salary rise last year when the economy is recovering slightly. That shows that they service their wallet and finance very well and efficiently.<br><br>- Ministers Visit<br>When the PM or SM or MM are coming to their constiuency, the MP ensure that their MASTER is well serviced with lots of kids performance, scrubbed street and patriot party supporters eager to shake the Master hands.<br><br>- Servicing their company<br>The recent transport hike is a very good example that the MP ENSURE that the individual transport company that they hold directorship MAKE HUGE HUGE HUGE profit so that they GET HUGE HUGE HUGE bonus.<br><br>Servicing themselves<br>- Except for SM Goh, the rest of ministers are globe-trotting every week. But, there are no sight of any business agreement. Except for the faliure to buy over certain shares of foreign company. At least they get a free trip, free accommodation and a chance to be treat like a celebrity.<br><br>Servicing Singapore INC<br>- Singapore is run like a business entreprise. If you are a liability, you are a burden. But, there are always channel to get foreign talent to replace the  local people who are alway picky about work and their government. They can buy false patriotism with foreign talents. They just forgot they cannot buy loyalty with $$$. But, they are not staying here for the rest of their life. Do they really care at all ????<br><br>They are no longer into fighting for your HDB falt issues, your carpark fine isssue and your livihood issues as that does not improve the servicing of their wallet.<br><br>Of course, there are still some hardworking MPs out there doing their work efficiently without blowing trumpets and sprouting rubbish to the media.<br><br>For these MPs, I wish them good health and blessed life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing i really dont understand,when we all come out n work n make some mistakes.For example not serious with our jobs n keep getting late for work,or keep making a mistake repeatedly,we will definitely get screwed by our supervisor or colleagues.Sometimes even we make a mistake unintentionally,we will still get screwed.<br>But our politicians treat themselves sooooo "special" that they cannot allow the public to openly criticize them,they cannot allow any demonstration to voice out different views,they cant even allow opposition leaders to criticize them during general election,as if the opposition leaders have to praize them during the "general election",HAHAHA!!!!<br>That is something i really dont understand,why the PAP leaders dont have the "guts" to accept criticism????Becoz everyone who comes out to work have to more or less get criticized by the others when we make mistakes,not that we like it,but we simply dont have any other choices.This is the "price" we have to pay for when we come out n work.But why cant our politicians tolerate criticism from the opposition party members n some professions n even from the public?That is something i really dont understand!!!Nowadays,even women come out n work n have to endure critics when they make mistakes,i think our leaders are worse than women!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore have been successful for the first 30 years.<br><br>Now, after achieving the peak status, we have lost our direction and slide down, typical case - SIA.<br><br>The Government have become complacent and forgot that they have to serve the people.<br><br>While some of them are doing a good job, they are seriously lacking in listening to the people.<br><br>The "listening to the people" session is, true sense, false ear.<br><br>Take the Casino and the transport hike.<br><br>After a decision is MADE, the media is being used to hype up the discussion and, at the same time, convincing pple that gambling is GREAT and the transport company is NOT making money in true sense.<br><br>Lots of money are wasted in trying "convince" the people that the Government is "listening".<br><br>In the end, the policy is implemented.<br><br>I rather they cut the crap, save people time from chatting on the topic and just do the policy.<br><br>So, after certain MP mentioned that they are getting active feedback, I smiled as what the people have "feed" is throw "back".<br><br></div>
