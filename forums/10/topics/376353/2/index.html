              <p>reminds me of this conversation i once had with a caucasian. in a bid to show he doesn't discriminate black people, he bought beer for his black neighbours when he was getting some for himself. i asked him why didn't he buy his white neighbour any beer and why the emphasis on his neighbour's color, he didn't know what to say.</p>
              <p>if we display extra tolerance, acceptance and even provide preferential treatment for people of other race, does that mean we are gracious or we are closet racists?</p>

              <p>There are Chinese who speak only their own dialects, and not a

              <p>There are also Indians who came from the small villages in
              India, can you accept their different body odour?</p>
              <p>When sharing table with muslim in a crowded hawker center, do
              you think you should be sensitive enough not to order bak kut teh
              or you think they should respect your choice of food?</p>
              <p>There is more to racial harmony that can be ignored.</p>
              <p>And please DO NOT ACCEPT this as a politically
              issue!</p>
              <p>There are Chinese, Malays, Indians, .....among those who are for
              and against the government. We need all races to accept one another
              to maintain racial harmony, regardless who is in power. and the
              most despicable politicians are the ones who would use racial
              conflict for their own agenda.</p>

              <p>This thread is becoming interesting.  Sgdiehard, you are confusing ethnicity with culture and religion. "The Malays are proud of being
              Malays, with their own culture, especially religion." As for religion and culture, which is independant of race, I agree that we should 'embrace and accept' as these vary from different groups. (GROUPS, not races) I know of one mediacorp actress (elderly one), who acts in the Tamil channel, who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chinese by race</span>. She was born in a Chinese family, but was adopted by an Indian family subsequently. She grew up as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hindu</span>, and followed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tamil culture</span>.</p>
              <p>What I mean is,  by race, I mean what is biological, in your genes. We should ignore that. Culture, religion, and language should not be confused with race. I remember how my teachers would always talk about Indians celebrating Deepavali, and Malays celebrating Hari Raya. Obviously, they mean Hindus and Muslims, instead of Indians and Malays.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of something different (probably irrelevant). During my sec 3 camp at the begining of this year, we were on a sort of scavenger hunt, and we passed a mosque. That was when my class in-charge, who was the person conducting these activites wanted to ask me about my religion.  He asked me whether I am a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hindu</span> or a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tami</span>l. He did not know the difference between language and religion. However,  I understood what he meant and I told him that I am not religious.</p>

              <p>Anyway, all blood run red in color, in our small n fragile
              multi racial society, racial harmony is the last thing that we
              should embrace, funny how, we are an envision of most country, eg,
              when i am in Taiwan, where the population is homogenous, they do
              not understand why and how can people of different races live
              together, an indian to them is like a black skinned man, good for
              low job only.</p>

              For your info angel7030, i had the pleasure of touring Taiwan in June with 3 of my Chinese friends, i was the only Indian guy in the group. I admit that at times people did mistake me for a "hei ren", however i can't blame them. Taiwan is a homogeneous country and they have probably never seen an Indian dude in their country, but i knew they didn't mean it in a racist manner. All in all i was taken aback by their friendliness and hospitality..
              
              There were times when my group got attention because of me, but in fact i liked the attention, i knew it was just out of curiosity and in return i showed my gratitude. I was in their country, i respected them and i spoke as much Mandarin as i knew to every person i met and a few of them were pleasantly surprised. Overall i liked the trip and i would definitely go back in future..
              
              Basically if u treat another person regardless of his race like a human being, then u get respect in return, its a two way thing..
              
              Obviously angel7030 u have displeasure over EVERYTHING, and u call yourself Taiwanese? What crap, i don't think u are, yur just another typical Singaporean SPG!

              How can they questioned a 16 year old about his / her loyalty to the country when the leaders and ministers are paid millions?
              
              <p>You should probably write "Pay me millions or better billions of money and the country will have my loyalty unquestioned." :)</p>
