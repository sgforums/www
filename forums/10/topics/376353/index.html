              <p>Hi. I am a Sec 3 student from a government school. In my school, we have this thing called "Values Education" (many schools have it) where they teach us 'morals' , 'ethics', and so on. There have been numerous lessons about race, and racial harmony. We had to complete a worksheet once, and there was one question: "What can we do to maintain racial harmony?" I wrote "Ignore ethnicity." When the worksheet was returned to me, my teacher had written "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cannot really ignore</span>. How about accept and embrace?"</p>
              <p>Cannot really ignore? Why? I have been ignoring race for as long as I can remember. When I meet someone, I do not even regard their ethnicity. I see them as individuals, I do not generalise or whatever.</p>
              <p>My teacher's idea of 'accepting and embracing' will never work. The day there is no more racism, is when people stop talking about race.</p>

              <p>Not very. We do not talk much about politics as a class, but within my group of closer friends, we always talk about politics. With the teacher, we do not discuss any politics at all.(Obviously, since it is not part of the system)</p>

              <p>There are also Indians who came from the small villages in India, can you accept their different body odour?</p>
              <p>When sharing table with muslim in a crowded hawker center, do you think you should be sensitive enough not to order bak kut teh or you think they should respect your choice of food?</p>
              <p>There is more to racial harmony that can be ignored.</p>
              <p>And please DO NOT ACCEPT this as a politically issue!</p>
              <p>There are Chinese, Malays, Indians, .....among those who are for and against the government. We need all races to accept one another to maintain racial harmony, regardless who is in power. and the most despicable politicians are the ones who would use racial conflict for their own agenda.</p>
              <p>But I think you are smarter that. </p>

              <p>Hi. I am a Sec 3 student from a government school. In my school, we have this thing called "Values Education" (many schools have it) where they teach us 'morals' , 'ethics', and so on. There have been numerous lessons about race, and racial harmony. We had to complete a worksheet once, and there was one question: "What can we do to maintain racial harmony?" I wrote "Ignore ethnicity." When the worksheet was returned to me, my teacher had written "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cannot really ignore</span>. How about accept and embrace?"</p>
              <p>Cannot really ignore? Why? I have been ignoring race for as long as I can remember. When I meet someone, I do not even regard their ethnicity. I see them as individuals, I do not generalise or whatever.</p>
              <p>My teacher's idea of 'accepting and embracing' will never work. The day there is no more racism, is when people stop talking about race.</p>
