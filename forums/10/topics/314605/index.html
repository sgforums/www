              <p>i agree with jdi77 that it is how much you save that counts, not how much you make. just like so, i save a lot of monies many years ago, and you might have forgotten it; when i received (very) good discounts on an apartment i bought from hpl. i bought it for my kiddo because he will not be in a position to be as successful as i am (ahem) and therefore i want to make sure i have the best of his interest in my heart. some made noise, but i ask you, `is it wrong to think of the future?'</p>

              <p>There are many reasons why people unhappy other than money. You go to Aunt Agony forum and see how many of them unhappy because of money.<br>If you want to make more money in the future, you should donate more money to the needy and charity. You will see your money luck becomes better gradually.</p>

              <p>in meritocratic singapore, money may equal success, but not happiness. if one is marginalized, they would blame the dog if they can.</p>

              <p>Success and happiness usually goes hand in hand. if you are not successful in life, be it relationship or career, chances are you wont be a happy person.</p>
              <p>Actually I am very puzzled to why you say that Singaporeans are being marginalized, when the government is doing so much to help Singaporeans  upgrade their knowledge and skills so that we dont have to compete in low skill jobs?</p>

              <p>your indoctrination starts if you attend PAP-run kindergarden. Otherwise, it's Primary 1. Your parents, well, sure they will have an influence. You may not have realized it, but directly/indirectly, PAP decide for you if you are a burden or asset to Singapore by streaming you in schools at various level throughout your education life. unless you are rich, you can't get out of that system. if you are considered normal-technical, well, be prepared for some singapore hardship. if you are gifted, you will be assimilated into the elitism world that will set your path towards prosperity. and like it or not, you have to do NS. by the time you ord, your path is well set for you. you are almost at the end of the PAP production line....</p>

              <p>A few of my uncles didnt even finish their secondary education, and yet they are all doing quite well. 3 of them are driving Merc, staying in big house and supporting a family of 5 to 6 and maid.  </p>
              <p>I believe it is our hunger for success that makes the difference. Pre-university education only provide us with the foundation for higher learning, it doesnt dictate our future.</p>
