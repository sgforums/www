              <p>i can only say that you are mixing up a lot of things here. you seemed unsure with what you are asking/commenting. i am replying you on your question on PAP's influence on you. I have no doubt about your success of your relatives. i am sure they are successful, regardless of education level.</p>
              <p>as for me, you don't know me. i can tell you this much that i am happier than i am unhappy. if i tell you that i am completely happy, i will be lying. but i don't equate happiness with monies as you imply, though i have more than enough material things with me to keep me (very) happy. my happiness derive from seeing that my family does well, that we are healthy and nothing untowards happens to them. helping others in many ways too add to my happiness quotients.</p>
