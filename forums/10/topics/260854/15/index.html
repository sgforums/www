Not that it really any surprise to our own government who has already stated this problem many times. The only surprise is how some keep trying to assume that the problem of our best brains leaving to other nations lies in the leavers and the nations they are going to, and not within ourselves.<br><br>If this attitude is not self delusionary and destructive, I don't know that is.<br><br>If you don't want to believe then don't believe lor, there's no need to bring people's parents into this ESPECIALLY when they have told you quite clearly how they came about their current financial state?<br><br>How far do you think you could have really gone by going on this "parent's gave you fund" thead of argument anyway? It still impacts little, if not nothing on the fact that there are some people getting a very much better deal elsewhere then in here, as gone by plenty of other stuff that fmyk seems to be telling you, but appear to be trying to dismiss them out of hand without even considering them if for a split second, if they could be true.<br><br>People are willing to share details about their financial lives on request, so the very least you could do is to pay that some common courtesy instead of trying to accuse them of cheating or lying at every turn.<br><br>fmyk's arguments are certainly not the one-track, everything Australia is better kind that you try to paint everything into, they are detailed, presented from the first-hand account, as well as in very much answer to most of the objections you have attempted to raise up.<br><br>If you simply don't believe fmyk or what those who have been living in Australia have been saying, then by all means you can personally consider them liars and thieves but I guess that's just an opinion that few will hold in here for the simple reason these people have probably given everybody around far more reason to trust them then you, even if we ignored your questionable antics in BAR.</div></blockquote>When something sound too good to be true, usually it is not true, or maybe just half true.<br><br></div>
