Note that I said I never ever draw on a pay of 36k per year in Australia - the forum posting I made with so many examples are hypotheticals with an "IF" . But I wish ATO think what I am earning now is just 36k- so that they don't tax me so much  HAHA.<br><br>36k per year in Canberra does not allow a person to fly from Canberra into Melbourne at my frequency, let alone pay a mortgage and rent an apartment in another city- let alone accumulate frequent flyer points to get a free ticket within less than a year. Like I say , go ask Rhonda or Ged how often I fly into Melbourne. I just cannot believe that you are so stupid not to get that.  Any logical person will know that.<br><br>In fact, the social security agency holds [b]my money</strong> because there was a legal way to secure permanent residency for my parents faster since they decided they wanted to come to Australia soon.  Heard of contributory migration? My parents cannot touch their social security for 10 years. If they do, I pay through my bond and if there is no bond left, they come after my assets. So do you think they will let my parents in if I cannot support them?<br><br>And I can afford an accountant. That is why I won't get myself into trouble with ATO. Accountant tells me what I can and cannot do - and I let the accountant fill in my tax forms. Are you an Australian qualified tax accountant?<br>If not, get over it.<br><br>HAHAHAH SO FUNNY!<br><br>Oh ya my postgrad education - I cannot claim anything from ATO now because my employer decided to pay for it. <strong>Note : Sponsored with no bond. </strong>However I can claim my study expenses such as textbooks and stationary and laptop ..HAHAHAHAh[/b]</blockquote>fymk, why do you need to give us such long grandmother story just to answer a simple question. ie. are you gaining more benefits (in value) than you pay in income tax in Australia?<br><br>Honest there is no need to impress me with your traveling, aparment and your housing etc, because that can easily be translate to someone that is heavily in debt. Plus I am sure you are aware that the interest rate in Australia is about twice have here in Singapore hence I wont be surprise that majority of your income has gone into servicing your debt</div>

Those who can leave, are beginning to vote with their feet.<br><br>The one problem is that, the ministers refused to face the truth, that the pay hike was the terminal stage of a cancer, and it has caused a big disgruntlement amongst even the elites in Singapore.<br><br>I have another friend, top notch in Accountancy, who is irritated with how the govt rewards themselves unjustifiably. He is earning good, but he is irritated that such people, whom he regards as only his equal, can get so good benefits, when the private sector talent has to face stiff competition on an open market.<br><br>The last I heard, he has gotten himself posted overseas, and brought his wife with him.</div>
