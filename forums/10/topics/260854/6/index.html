We absorb the bad of the Japanese culture of doing OT.<br>Unfortunately, the Govt chose not to tell you, that Japanese white collar workers get OT pay, and that's the motivation why they OT like nuts.<br><br>I doubt the Govt wants to change it, because like I said, its beneficial to them.<br><br>Advertisement on Singapore Workers<br>"Come to Singapore to open your company. We offer companies workers with the following attributes:<br>- Can terminate them anytime as long as you give them 1 month's notice, and don't need to give any reasons<br>- They are lowly paid as compared to other developed economies, yet highly productive<br>- They can do overtime without any overtime pay"<br><br>Judging from the above, if they seek to make life better for us, is to make life difficult for them<br><br>So my suggestions are as follows for the current outlook:<br>- Keep those conditions if they want (lowly paid, terminate anytime), so that they attract investments, but work on killing the culture of overtime. (In many foreign companies, the bosses actually kick you out of the office, the moment knock off time arrives). Don't make people feel guilty about leaving on time. Instead make people feel guilty about doing overtime. People should OT ONLY IF they need to, and not becoz they want to show the boss they are 'working'.<br>- Push the new culture of working from home. Allow people to work 4 days office, 1 day at home. Make it happen, not just talk.<br>- Lower the cost of living. I feel our costs of living is exceedingly high, and with lower costs of living -&gt; lower demands of pay.<br><br></div>
