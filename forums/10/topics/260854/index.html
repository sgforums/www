            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why are Singaporeans leaving?<br>(Think Centre)</strong><br><br>08 April 2007 by Leong Sze Hian<br>Why are Singaporeans leaving and may not be returning, when it is the best place in the world for expats to live and work, and the best for quality of life in Asia?<br>Singapore has been voted as the top choice of location for expats in the world and also the best asian city in the 2007 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. The Senior Minister has voiced his concerns about Singapore's brain-drain. So, why are Singaporeans leaving and may not be returning, when it is the best place in the world for expats to live and work, and the best for quality of life in Asia?<br>The answer may lie in some statistics for the last year or so.<br><br>The Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in his inaugural speech in the Distinguished Speakers Lecture series of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) on March 21, said that "it is quite puzzling that Singapore is still aspiring to be world class, when it has exceeded world-class standards in many areas" and cited "10 dimensions in which we have achieved or exceeded previous 'world-class' standards".<br><br>In the annals of corporate history, many once revered brand names have fallen by the wayside, because they failed to adequately, constantly and continually address their shortcomings, and internal and external criticisms. This failing may arguably be applied to the history of nations too.<br><br>In the context of his speech which was on building the Singapore brand and national branding, I think we may want to take a step backbards, and do some critical self-analysis of our current weaknesses, and try to improve on them. In our perhaps zealous attempts to become world-class in so many things, we may have paid insufficient attention to some 10 dimensions, which I shall describe below.<br><br>Singapore was ranked 130th out of 178 countries for Happiness, 40th out of 41 countries for Libido, 30th out of 35 countries for Courtesy, 5th in the world for Prisoners Per Capita, 105th in the world for Income Equality, 140th out of 167 countries for Press Freedom, and 15th out of 16 countries in the Asia Democracy Index.<br><br>Dimensions relating to income:-<br><br>1. Income distribution continued to widen - the Gini coefficient increased from 0.468 to 0.472.<br><br>Percentage of employed households with household income from work below $ 1,000, increased from 5.4 to 5.7%. Average monthly income from work per household member among employed households was only $ 300 for the 1st to 10th decile, and $ 540 for the 11th to 20th decile. Average monthly income from work per household member among non-retiree households was only $ 160 for the 1st to 10th decile, and $ 470 for the 11th to 20th decile. With about over one million households, does it mean that about 90,000 non-retiree households are still surviving on only $ 160 average monthly income from work per household member?<br><br>The 1st to 10th decile among employed households had the lowest number of working persons at 1.28, supporting the highest number of average persons in the household of 3.92 persons. Generally, the larger the average household size, the lower were the average number of working persons. This trend persisted until the 70th percentile for average number of working persons.<br><br>Number of part-timers has more than doubled over the decade from 51,400 to 112,300 expanding their share of employment from 3.5% to 6.3%. The median monthly income for part-timers is still the same at $ 500 compared to 10 years ago. In view of the 118 per cent increase in part-timers for the last decade, does it mean that more residents are working for income of $ 500 that has not changed for 10 years?<br><br>Since "retiree households who had no income from work comprised 5% of all resident households in 2006", and "8.5% of resident households had 0 number of working persons", does it mean that 3.5% or about 37,000 households are not retired but have no income from work ? How many of these - about 37,000 households are living with no income from work, because they have sufficient funds to sustain themselves indefinitely or for a prolonged period of time?<br><br>Whilst the Resident labour force increased by 27 per cent for the last 15-year period from 1.373 to 1.737 million, Unemployed Residents increased by 149 per cent from 28,000 to 69,600. This means that the Resident labour force increased by 1.6 per cent per annum, and Unemployed Residents increased by 6.3 per cent per annum.<br><br>Dimemsions relating to expenditure:-<br><br>2. As at the end of last year, banks have repossessed 1,445 HDB flats financed with bank loans since the start of bank origination in January 2003. In recent months, the rate is about 60 cases a month. This means that 1.6 per cent of HDB flats on bank loans have been foreclosed. 7 per cent of the 89,000 HDB flats with bank loans which is about 6,230 HDB flat owners have not been able to pay for more than 3 months. Some of these may become foreclosures.<br><br>From 2002 to 2006, some 360 households voluntarily surrendered their flats after defaulting on their HDB concessionary loan repayments. HDB's annual report said that it provided financial assistance to 28,386 flat-owners in its last financial year, Does this mean that 28,386 flat-owners had difficulty paying their HDB concessionary loan monthly repayments or HDB rental?<br><br>In the HDB's last two offers of 2-room flats, about 42 per cent of the applicants were 55 years and older, and 56 per cent had household incomes of less than $ 1,000 a month.<br><br>3. According to the Yearbook of Statistics Singapore, water, electricity and gas tariffs increased by 8.6, 2.8, and 4.2% per annum from 1995 to 2005, against inflation of just 1%. The number of electricity accounts in arrears is about 3,600 and the number of Pay-As-You Use (PAYU) meters is about 12,500.<br><br>4. MediFund paid out $40m to 290,000 Medifund applications approved last year. Does this mean that the average Medifund payout per patient was about $138? According to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) web site, "for FY2001, a total of 157,190 Medifund applications were considered, of which 156,780 applications or 99.7% were approved, amounting to a total disbursement of $27.2m ". Does this means that the average Medifund payout per patient in 2001 was about $174? Why is it that the average Medifund payout per patient has declined from $174 in 2001 to $138 last year, when as I understand it, the average costs of hospitalisation have gone up? According to MOH's "Affordability of Healthcare Data", the average hospital bill size for Class C was $858 and $495 at the 50th percentile. So, does this mean that some needy patients may still be financially stressed in having to pay the shortfall between their bill and the Medifund payout, by instalments to the hospital after their discharge?<br><br>According to the MOH's web site, polyclinics "served about 100,000 dental patients". According to the DOS, there were about 104,900 households in the 0 to 10th decile with no income from work and about 104,900 households with average income of $1,180 in the 11th to 20th decile. Each visiting the public dental services once a year, would total about 377,640 dental attendances per year (assuming 3.6 average household number of persons x about 104,900 households with average income of $1,180 in the 11th to 20th decile, and that all the 0 income households are mostly retirees and others who can afford private dental care). How many can afford the private dental consultation rates starting from $45 compared to the polyclinics' rates from $12 to $20.50 for adult Singapore citizens, and from $6 to $10.50 for children and the elderly? Since the polyclinics only served about 100,000 attendances last year, and some went to private dentists under the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) and about 3,000 under the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, where did the rest of the lower-income Singaporeans go to for dental treatment?<br><br>5. The Ministry of Education helped 35,000 school children in its Financial Assistance Scheme.<br><br>At the announcement of the setting up of the ComCare Fund on 19 January 2005, it was said that the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) handled 35,000 hardship cases in 2004, granting almost $ 40 million in assistance. Why is it that it would appear that about two years later, the amount of assistance given out has only increased by 70 per cent ($ 68 divided by $ 40 million), against an increase of 157 per cent in the number of needy families (90,000 divided by 35,000) ?<br><br>About 60,000 Singaporeans did not sign up for the Progress Package.<br><br>6. In 2005, the $4 million Public Transport Fund set up and funded by SMRT, SBS, Comcare Fund, the 5 CDCs, SLF and NTUC, received more than 92,000 applications for 80,000 vouchers worth $50 each. The funding organisations pitched in with the $600,000 needed to pay for the extra vouchers. The total of $4.6 million divided by $20 means that about 230,000 people received about $20 each to help pay for the transport fares increase in 2005. Even if we assume that all the about 104,900 households in the 0 to 10th decile with no income from work are retirees and others who can afford the fares increase, we are still missing about 147,640 (377,640 (3.6 persons x about 104,900 households with average income of $1,180 in the 11th to 20th decile) - 230,000). Does this mean that they did not apply for transport vouchers?<br><br>7. According to studies at the National University of Singapore, the average propensity to consume (APC) which is measured as the ratio of private consumption expenditures to GDP, has fallen steadily over time from 0.82 in 1960 to 0.43 in 2003.This has produced the lowest ratio of private consumption to output in the free world.<br><br>Dimensions relating to net worth:-<br><br>8. Household Net Worth increased by 3.8 per cent per annum from $ 548 to $ 660 billion from 2000 to 2005. However, after adjusting for inflation, CPF contributions and the interest on CPF balances, and cash savings and investments, does. it mean that household net worth may actually have declined?<br><br>65, 69 and about 75 per cent of CPFIS investors did not beat the 2.5 per cent interest on the CPF Ordinary Account for the first 9, 10, and 11 years of the scheme on a cumulative basis. What were the statistics after 12 and 13 years of the scheme ?<br><br>Other dimensions:-<br><br>9.Last year, there were 120,000 ex-offenders whose records were spent, 11,000 ex-offenders are being released every year, plus the current 14,453 prison population - how many ex-offenders in total are there in Singapore , since only those convicted of minor crimes and who remain crime-free for five years may have their records marked as spent and those convicted of serious offences and jailed for more than three months or fined more than $ 2,000 cannot have their records erased ? According to the World Prison Population List of King's College London International Centre for Prison Studies, the prison population rate (per 100,000 of national population) for Singapore, at 350, was the fifth highest in the world.<br><br>10. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook Database September 2006, Singapore is ranked number one in the world for current account balance in percent of GDP ratio. Singapore's ratio of 28.5 in 2006, is more than double the second ranked country, Switzerland's ratio of 13.3. Singapore's US$132 (S$205) billion foreign reserves has been ranked number one in the world on a per capita basis.<br><br>The Budget Debate is over. Like a company making its strategic plans and setting its goals for the future, perhaps we could look at some of the above statistics, with the view that some of them may be considered useful as benchmarks for measuring Singapore's progress and performance in the future.<br><br>Some of the above may also help some of us in thinking about what we hope to achieve and concerns to address for our future.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Sources and Relevant Links:<br><br>The Straits Times Better work-life balance to stem emigration flow Gilbert Goh Keow Wah - 2 Apr 2007<br><br>Business Times Time to temper focus on monetary rewards Leong Sze Hian, 27 Mar 2007<br><br></div>

In our perhaps zealous attempts to become world-class in so many things, we may have paid insufficient attention to some 10 dimensions, which I shall describe below.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Singapore was ranked 130th out of 178 countries for Happiness, 40th out of 41 countries for Libido, 30th out of 35 countries for Courtesy, 5th in the world for Prisoners Per Capita, 105th in the world for Income Equality, 140th out of 167 countries for Press Freedom, and 15th out of 16 countries in the Asia Democracy Index</span>.[/quote]<br><span style="color: darkred;">This is a damning revelation of all that has been boastfully trumpeted but with the realities being blurred by clever statistics; until some brilliant thinker come along to unravel the threads that have been cleverly woven into a huge tight ball that cleverly wrapped up the <span style="font-style: italic;">''truths''</span>. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Dimensions relating to income</strong>:-<br><br>1. Income distribution continued to widen - the Gini coefficient increased from 0.468 to 0.472.<br><br>Percentage of employed households with household income from work below $ 1,000, increased from 5.4 to 5.7%. Average monthly income from work per household member among employed households was only $ 300 for the 1st to 10th decile, and $ 540 for the 11th to 20th decile. Average monthly income from work per household member among non-retiree households was only $ 160 for the 1st to 10th decile, and $ 470 for the 11th to 20th decile. With about over one million households, does it mean that about 90,000 non-retiree households are still surviving on only $ 160 average monthly income from work per household member?<br><br>The 1st to 10th decile among employed households had the lowest number of working persons at 1.28, supporting the highest number of average persons in the household of 3.92 persons. Generally, the larger the average household size, the lower were the average number of working persons. This trend persisted until the 70th percentile for average number of working persons.<br><br>Number of part-timers has more than doubled over the decade from 51,400 to 112,300 expanding their share of employment from 3.5% to 6.3%. The median monthly income for part-timers is still the same at $ 500 compared to 10 years ago. In view of the 118 per cent increase in part-timers for the last decade, does it mean that more residents are working for income of $ 500 that has not changed for 10 years?<br><br>Since "retiree households who had no income from work comprised 5% of all resident households in 2006", and "8.5% of resident households had 0 number of working persons", <span style="font-style: italic;">does it mean that 3.5% or about 37,000 households are not retired but have no income from work ? How many of these - about 37,000 households are living with no income from work, because they have sufficient funds to sustain themselves indefinitely or for a prolonged period of time?</span><br><br>Whilst the Resident labour force increased by 27 per cent for the last 15-year period from 1.373 to 1.737 million, Unemployed Residents increased by 149 per cent from 28,000 to 69,600. <span style="color: red;">This means that the Resident labour force increased by 1.6 per cent per annum, and Unemployed Residents increased by 6.3 per cent per annum</span>.</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The consequences of the loudly acclaimed <span style="font-style: italic;">'No More Iron Rice Bowl'</span> proposal are now clearly seen.<br><br>Singaporeans were pushed to accept the Government and NTUC sanctioned plan of for Employers to implement <span style="font-style: italic;">'Short Term Employment Contracts'</span> so as to give Employers <span style="font-style: italic;">''flexibility to respond to economic cycles''</span><br><br>Instead of putting up plans that help advance the cause of the Singapore Workforce, the million dollar Ministers can only come up with the easy option of having the Singapore Citizens bear the consequences of the ineptitude of the Government to prepare the economy to absorb the uncertainties of the global economic cycles.<br><br>Why should the Singaporean workforce bear the burden and the consequences of the economic downturn ?<br><br>Is this the best that a super-talented Government can offer despite claim to a deserving million dollar wage packages ?<br><br>Why are the lower paid Scandinavian Governments able to help their respective economies to face global competition and ride out the global cycles without affecting the Scandinavian Standard of Living ?<br><br>Even Switzerland - which is landlocked, and has a population size equal to Singapore - do not require the Swiss citizens to such employment uncertainties in the face of global competition.<br><br>The lower paid Swiss Government is able to create a stable economic environment that allow Swiss Citizen Workforce a high <span style="font-style: italic;">Standard of Living</span>, with wages and employment security that allow them to be comfortable with their <span style="font-style: italic;">Cost of Living</span>. </span><br>[quote]<strong><br>Dimemsions relating to expenditure</strong>:-<br><br>2.

In recent months, the rate is about 60 cases a month. This means that 1.6 per cent of HDB flats on bank loans have been foreclosed. 7 per cent of the 89,000 HDB flats with bank loans which is about 6,230 HDB flat owners have not been able to pay for more than 3 months. Some of these may become foreclosures.<br><br>From 2002 to 2006, some 360 households voluntarily surrendered their flats after defaulting on their HDB concessionary loan repayments. HDB's annual report said that it provided financial assistance to 28,386 flat-owners in its last financial year, Does this mean that 28,386 flat-owners had difficulty paying their HDB concessionary loan monthly repayments or HDB rental?<br><br>In the HDB's last two offers of 2-room flats, about 42 per cent of the applicants were 55 years and older, and <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">56 per cent had household incomes of less than $ 1,000 a month.</span></strong></div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkred;">The high rate of mortgage default is the result of the short term employment contracts pushed by the Government and the NTUC on Singaporeans.<br><br>Such short term employment contracts can only result in instability to any long term mortgage planning, as no one can be certain of any secure transition from one employment contract to another.<br><br><strong>continue below</strong></span><br><br></strong></div>

MediFund paid out $40m to 290,000 Medifund applications approved last year. Does this mean that the average Medifund payout per patient was about $138? According to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) web site, "for FY2001, a total of 157,190 Medifund applications were considered, of which 156,780 applications or 99.7% were approved, amounting to a total disbursement of $27.2m ". Does this means that the average Medifund payout per patient in 2001 was about $174? Why is it that the average Medifund payout per patient has declined from $174 in 2001 to $138 last year, when as I understand it, the average costs of hospitalisation have gone up? According to MOH's "Affordability of Healthcare Data", the average hospital bill size for Class C was $858 and $495 at the 50th percentile. So, does this mean that some needy patients may still be financially stressed in having to pay the shortfall between their bill and the Medifund payout, by instalments to the hospital after their discharge?<br><br>According to the MOH's web site, polyclinics "served about 100,000 dental patients". According to the DOS, there were about 104,900 households in the 0 to 10th decile with no income from work and about 104,900 households with average income of $1,180 in the 11th to 20th decile. Each visiting the public dental services once a year, would total about 377,640 dental attendances per year (assuming 3.6 average household number of persons x about 104,900 households with average income of $1,180 in the 11th to 20th decile, and that all the 0 income households are mostly retirees and others who can afford private dental care). How many can afford the private dental consultation rates starting from $45 compared to the polyclinics' rates from $12 to $20.50 for adult Singapore citizens, and from $6 to $10.50 for children and the elderly? Since the polyclinics only served about 100,000 attendances last year, and some went to private dentists under the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) and about 3,000 under the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">where did the rest of the lower-income Singaporeans go to for dental treatment</span></strong>?</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">This clearly shows that despite the Government fear of Singaporeans being addicted to <span style="font-style: italic;">'State Welfare'</span>, and makes nonsense to all the reason that this Government has given to its paranoia towards <span style="font-style: italic;">'Welfarism'</span>.<br><br>Either Singaporeans are too proud to seek assistance, even in the most desparate economic state; or that these Singaporeans are ignorant to the poorly publicised health programs that are available ?<br><br>The latter seems more credible and is too much of a co-incident with the long held government reluctance to accept its own role of providing welfare to the most needy and to the Aged. </span><br><blockquote><br>5. The Ministry of Education helped 35,000 school children in its Financial Assistance Scheme.<br><br>At the announcement of the setting up of the ComCare Fund on 19 January 2005, it was said that the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) handled 35,000 hardship cases in 2004, granting almost $ 40 million in assistance. Why is it that it would appear that about two years later, the amount of assistance given out has only increased by 70 per cent ($ 68 divided by $ 40 million), against an increase of 157 per cent in the number of needy families (90,000 divided by 35,000) ?<br><br>About <span style="color: red;">60,000 Singaporeans did not sign</span> up for the Progress Package.</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">This clearly confirms the Government attitude towards its reluctance to encourage the <span style="font-style: italic;">''addiction towards welfarism''</span>.<br><br>Despite all the hoopla of special programs available to help the needy and the under-privileged, it is ironical that the RC's - (under the control of the Peoples' Association that is itself headed by a Political Appointee) - are effective tools of the Government to monitor the ground - (serving as the eyes and ears of the Government), but could not be as effective in dispensing help to those who are in more dire need. </span><br><blockquote><br>6. In 2005, the $4 million Public Transport Fund set up and funded by SMRT, SBS, Comcare Fund, the 5 CDCs, SLF and NTUC, received more than 92,000 applications for 80,000 vouchers worth $50 each. The funding organisations pitched in with the $600,000 needed to pay for the extra vouchers. The total of $4.6 million divided by $20 means that about 230,000 people received about $20 each to help pay for the transport fares increase in 2005. Even if we assume that all the about 104,900 households in the 0 to 10th decile with no income from work are retirees and others who can afford the fares increase, <span style="color: red;"><strong>we are still missing about 147,640</strong></span> (377,640 (3.6 persons x about 104,900 households with average income of $1,180 in the 11th to 20th decile) - 230,000). <span style="font-style: italic;">Does this mean that they did not apply for transport vouchers?</span> </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Is it odd that the Singapore phenomena of <span style="font-style: italic;">'grabbing freebies'</span> is not at work here ?<br><br>What could be the problem after all the hoopla publicity given for such generosity that could have extracted political benefits for the Government ?</span><br><blockquote><br>7.

According to the World Prison Population List of King's College London International Centre for Prison Studies,[b] the prison population rate (per 100,000 of national population) for Singapore, at 350, was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the fifth highest in the world</span>.</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The brilliance of a million-dollar Government in the administration of arbitrary justice is displayed here, in which even minor offences can be meted out the harshest punishment, with the rod unsparingly dispensed for many offenses.<br><br>The humane face of justice remained absent as a typcial characteristic of this faceless Government that seems only good at politiking, fixing the Opposition, and fixing their own compensation while in Office. </span><br><blockquote><br>10.
