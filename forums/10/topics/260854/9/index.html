            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Not cheap, a Singapore stint </strong></span><br><strong>Singapore more expensive to live in than New York; fifth most costly in Asia: Survey </strong><br><br>Christie Loh<br>christie@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>THE by-product of a long-running economic boom has inevitably materialised.<br>.<br>For the fourth straight year, a comprehensive survey shows Singapore scaling the ladder of expensive cities, raising concerns about whether rising costs will start to put off businesses and foreign talent.<br>.<br>On a global scale, the Republic has overtaken New York to become the 14th most expensive city, up from 17th last year. Asia-wide, Singapore moved up a notch to fifth place behind Osaka, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.<br>.<br>Pushing the island up the rungs were housing rental hikes, higher transport costs and costlier groceries, said Mercer Human Resource Consulting, which yesterday released the annual Worldwide Cost of Living Survey of 143 cities.<br>.<br>The results are of interest to multinational companies and governments, which buy the reports to determine compensation allowances for their expatriate staff.<br>.<br>Already, some foreign investors here are having second thoughts.<br>.<br>"We have heard of at least one case where the company plans to staff a particular Asia-wide role in Hong Kong instead of in Singapore, given the difference in costs under new rents," Mr Fermin Diez, Mercer's worldwide partner and market development director for Asia-Pacific, told Today.<br>.<br>Several of his multinational corporation (MNC) clients have also started worrying about the burden on current expatriate staff here and the impact on profitability.<br>.<br>As leases run out, "everyone balks at the rapid rise in rental", said Mr Diez.<br>.<br>Overall private home rents surged 14.1 per cent last year from 2005, official figures showed, but landlords in prime areas have reportedly asked for as much as 50 per cent more.<br>.<br>Some MNCs are now providing their expatriate employees with extra funds to cover their rental differentials, he said.<br>.<br>Meanwhile, other Asian capitals may look more alluring.<br>.<br>Mercer's survey shows that all cities in this region slid down the table, except Singapore and Indian cities. This trend was part of a major reshuffle in the 2007 rankings, due mainly to the weakening US dollar and the stronger Euro, explained Mercer.<br>.<br>While Moscow remained the most expensive city for the second consecutive year, several European capitals Â— such as London, Paris, and Copenhagen Â— have moved closer to the top.<br>.<br>Mercer compared the cost of some 200 items including transport, food, clothing and entertainment.<br>.<br>Expats paid in US dollars Â– whose value slumped to the lowest since 1997 last year Â– would have less spending power in, say, Singapore, where the currency has strengthened.<br>.<br>And even though cities Â— say in China Â— may be cheaper, some are often viewed by expats as "hardship postings", said Credit Suisse First Boston economist Sailesh Jha, an American citizen living here for the past five years. Pollution, for instance, is causing some expats to move out of Hong Kong.<br>.<br>Since 2004, Singapore has gone from 46th place on the Mercer survey to 34th, then 17th, and this year 14th. The ascent mirrors the economy's steady recovery from the 2003 Sars crisis to the present good times of perkier wages and bigger profits.<br>.<br>But although the horizon looks clear for Singapore over the next 12 to 24 months, it remains to be seen if the rosy picture would stay intact three to five years down the road.<br>.<br>"For any company wishing to expand in Asia, it'll need to measure costs of relocation versus strategic value in nurturing growth of the company," said Mr Diez.<br>Singapore more expensive to live in than New York; fifth most costly in Asia: Survey<br></div>

Its impt to maintain a calm thought.<br><br>I am not angry. I am just saddened, like I said, that so many Singaporeans, whom can live better lives, still continue to live in a breathless environment, becoz it is beneficial to the govt.<br><br>And as I have stated before, the doubling of my pay is my credit, and no one else. I fought hard and proved that I am worth of such a pay.<br><br>If the govt can have it, they would want ALL companies to adopt their low pay, 'high' bonuses approach. Its extremely beneficial to the businesses (esp the 'high' bonus part, a good excuse to save money), and detrimental to the Singaporean, given rising costs of living<br><br>Its ok to love Singapore, and yes I do, but I don't practise turning a blind eye to wrongs of the govt, just becoz I love my country and my fellow countrymen.</div>

Another 5250 were registered between last June and February, suggesting the total this financial year could push towards 8000. That compares with just 4544 in 1999-2000.<br><br>Labor has used the figures from the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia to highlight a rising trend in personal insolvency over the past six years.<br><br>The number of personal bankruptcies and debt agreements across Sydney rose by more than half between 1999-2000 and 2005-06. Parts of western Sydney have been hardest hit with a rise of 99 per cent in Blacktown and 70 per cent in the outer west. A slump in property prices since 2004 and relatively high rates of unemployment in some parts of west and south-west Sydney may have contributed to the surge in bankruptcies and debt agreements.<br><br>The jobless rate in both Fairfield and south-west Blacktown was above 10 per cent - more than double the national rate - in the December quarter, figures published by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations show.<br><br>However, some of Sydney's wealthiest areas have also registered big increases in insolvency. Sydney's inner west had an increase of 83 per cent between 1999-2000 and 2005-06 while there was a 74 per cent on the northern beaches and 60 per cent in the eastern suburbs.<br><br>The shadow treasurer, Wayne Swan, said the figures showed many families are under significant financial pressure.<br><br>"Household budgets are being hit by rising petrol prices, high child-care costs and spiralling mortgage repayments caused by eight consecutive interest rate rises, despite John Howard's promise to keep rates at record lows," he said.<br><br>Roger Mendelson, the chief executive of debt collection company Prushka, said easy access to credit was contributing to the rise in bankruptcies and debt agreements.<br><br>"These people are not normally the high-flyers and the total amount owing to creditors is often not all that large, it's just beyond their capacity to repay," he said.<br><br>The total debt burden on Australian households has reached almost $1 trillion and the ratio of household debt to income has reached 160 per cent, one of the highest in the world.<br><br>Interest payments now soak up more than 11 per cent of all household income, about 2 percentage points more than in 1989 when mortgage interest rates were 17 per cent.<br><br>Labor has also highlighted Government figures showing a record amount of superannuation savings has been released to individuals early to assist with financial hardship.<br><br>Those in financial difficulty can apply to withdraw cash from their super account if they are in acute financial need.<br><br>The amount released for this purpose jumped from $70 million in 2005 to $135 million last year, Government answers to Labor questions on notice show.<br><br></div>
