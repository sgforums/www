If the figure of the citizens migrating keeps going up, it does not reflect well on the gahmen of Singapore.  Besides, they will lose the chances of "earning" $$$ at these people's expense and losing talents as well.  So it goes without saying why gahmen is so keen to encourage them to come back.<br><br>Who cares if the citizenship in Singapore is not easy to get??  If those who have migrated are enjoying their life there and find that it is better to be there than Singapore , so why worry about obtaining Singapore citizenship in future!!!  Mind you, those who have migrated are not coming back to Singapore for good.<br><br>It is because of people like you that the ruling party is getting more and more daring to do so much at our expense to please and satisfy themselves!!!

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CannotTahan:</div><div class="quote_body">i dont understand a logic.  While I am still a singaporean, what is so scary to know that there will be much fewer singapore citizens around 500K versus 6 mio of residents in the future? People emigrate out does not really matter.  Why is PAP so keen to encourage people to stay?  Simply open the doors for more immigrants.  There is no need to even say anything about it, let alone "quitters" etc.  I think "quitters" came out of GCT only and does not really represent the view of singapore government.  rather, i think the government's efforts to attract back overseas singaporeans and ex-singaporeans is simply a generous attempt.  singapore does not need them, really.  they can go if they like.  each individual has only one life.  he decides what to do with it, how to better its meaning etc.</div></blockquote>CannotTahan, whenever it has come to explaining and justifying its decisions and actions, such as NS, GST, ERP and government salaries to name a few, the government has always taken the stand that it bases decisions on necessity.  That being the case, why would the Singaporean government try to attract overseas Singaporeans back if it was simply out of generousity instead of necessity?  It's simply out of character for them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CannotTahan:</div><div class="quote_body">Another logic, i dont understand.  A singaporean emigrates because of many reasons one of which is he does not like foreign talents taking up his jobs in singapore.  But at the country he emigrates to, he is a foreign talent there in that country, he will also take up jobs there, naturally the locals there wont be happy with HIM especially during recession when life is tough for everyone including ang mos even with safety nets.   when the pie gets smaller, they will ask, why should we subsidize our safety nets for the f..king chings ?</div></blockquote>I left Singapore in 1994, well before foreign talents became a debated issue.  However, if I was to have left more recently, it would be the pull factor of Australia rather than the push factor from Singapore that would have driven my decision.<br><br>Still, let's say for example that you have a point and that FTs are a cause of migration out of Singapore.  That point in itself defeats the "second-class citizen" argument against migration, does it not?  The first-class Singaporean citizen sees the second-class foreign talent coming in, making good money and having a nice life.  Why, then should the Singaporean not want to take a stab at being a comfortably and happy second-class citizen somewhere else?<br><br>Over more than half a century, Australia has received waves of immigrants, starting with the Greeks and Italians, then the Vietnamese, then the Southeast Asians, Eastern Europeans and Africans.  Over that period there have been a number of lean periods, none of which resulted in any backlash towards the immigrant population.<br><br>I'm sure at this point somebody's going to mention the Cronulla riots as an instance of racial disharmony in Australia, but that had nothing at all to do with the foreign talents issue.  The impetus there was that a mob of Lebanese youths had finally worn out their welcome at Cronulla by beating up a lifeguard and harrassing women at the beach for years - even Lebanese women have outright said that these youths were offensive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you Gedanken for sharing.  I might come back to you for more understanding of life in aus.<br><br>since i am in this thread, i state my gut feel of some aspects of singapore.<br><br>our govt has made singapore looks like being run as a private enterprise, corporate singapore.  then if temasek loses lots of money and shown in their annual report audited by recognised auditing firms, i think ho ching should be made responsible.  otherwise votes will swing and more opposition members are in.  people will think that all these tax increases are to subsidize the loses made by temasek and to stabilise the country's finances.  too bad, these bad investments are too high profile to be covered up.<br><br></div>
