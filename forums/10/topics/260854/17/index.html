            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore lacks options, period. There's no way we can offer as many options as other larger nations with more resources.<br><br>But the problem is this, are we offering <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span> options then we ought to be offering? Or are we attempting to become the kind of nation that will only accept one kind of person with one kind of thinking? A person that places the unique qualities of Singapore as Gazelle mentioned above all else?<br><br>Even our government sees the folly of trying to encourage this kind of thinking given their numerous attempts to introduce "creativity" and "innovation". A nation with only one form of thought cannot hope to compete and prevail, it's akin to the Cheetah having so many speed adaptations that it is unable to hunt other more generalized prey, leaving it's fate tied to that of its limited selection of prey. Not to mention the very thing that makes it fast makes it unable to be on the top of the food chain (Cheetahs are routinely harrased and killed by Lions and other predators)<br><br>However the intractable problem is that as long as we remain the way we are, we can never hope to improve. If we encourage oneness of though in politics and the focus on pragmatic issues, then they can forget about trying to push creativity and innovation. If you want to foster security at all costs, then don't blame Singaporeans for becoming soft and whiny, it's what you made them to be. If you want them to follow you above all without any viable alternatives, don't blame them for turing off their brains and not using them when you want them to.<br><br>Don't be surprised people leave when you offer them such a limted set of options.</div>

Hence instead of telling us that you have manage to save about $100 to 150K in cold hard cash by your own as a student from 21 to 26, why dont you just tell us that your parents have give you some fund to kick start your life in Australia? No?<br><br></div></blockquote>My dad has made it clear to me when I was young that he was not about to spoil me rotten. Christmas presents were either books or lego set. They never bought me fancy toys. If I cannot accept the clothes they bought for me, I have to earn my own money to buy the clothes I want. Want to talk with a friend on a phone? Get my own phoneline and work to pay for it. Internet? Work and pay for it. All of which I did.<br><br>Both my parents grew up in post war Singapore and they know the real meaning of hardship- being bullied for being poor , sleeping in a room with a family of 6.<br><br>No mercedes benz for dad - he didn't believe in going into debt - he bought the cheapest car and paid in full for it , no maids nothing. We lived in a HDB flat not condominium like so many of his colleagues.  And I had to learn to sleep without aircon because aircon is a luxury. We go on holidays to learn about another country, not waste time in amusement parks.<br><br>My family did not believe in wasting money. I actually worked after primary school was over for the day being a free store keeper for my aunt who ran a shop.<br><br>Just because someone's daddy may have a good job , doesn't mean the father will spoil the person rotten. And I think my parents did a good job of bringing me up.<br><br>Anything else to personally attack me with? This is amusing. I don't think you ever worked like that and I don't think you can survive this with my parents.<br></div>

They have been told by their government (during their own famine) that the supermarkets overseas have well-stocked shelves because their citizens are too poor to buy the goods! And all too often they have been told that the rest of the world is much poorer and less advanced then them.<br><br>Simply put, it seems your disbelief in what some are saying about what they found overseas comes not from it actually being that good, but simply because it looks massively better compared to the deal many Singaporeans are cut here, and have grown to accept.<br><br>A bird that has been caged may not want to leave the cage even when the door its open, it might point to the immediate availability of food and water, security and cleanliness (self-replacing newspaper). But until it spreads its wings and decides to fly, or at the very least fly a mile in the shoes of the free bird, and learn about the life of the free bird, it can never have the right to say anything about freedom being an unnecessary thing.<br><br>I donÂ’t think any rational Singaporean in here thinks migrating to Australia is a free lunch or cakewalk, but they are not so proud or blind to recognize that there are very attractive benefits to making to move there.<br><br></div>
