And unlike that particular nation the Australian govt. actually LISTENS to the voices of its people and can decern between what is irrational racism and fear of the "yellow peril", and what is shortchanging their own citizens for the economic bottom line. On the other hand, a certain nation seems to have embraced FT policies in the same way they did the Â“Stop at TwoÂ” policy, which is a blind pursuit in total ignorance about the potential disadvantages until it becomes all too clear and then transfer the bulk of the damage done to the common man.<br><br>As it stands, it becomes clear which nation is better for locals when it comes to dealing with an influx of cheap labour.<br><br>More interestingly, can you make a coherent argument that goes beyond a one-liner or mere hyperbole?<br><br>Does your nick of "CannotTahan" refer to reality? That's why you deem it fit to engage in such unproductive one-liner-ing?</div>
