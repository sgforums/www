Can we find rolling mountain plains or snow? Do you think our IR resorts and the like can match up to what mother nature has carved for other nations.<br><br>Not saying Singapore is bad, but I think by only wanting to emphasise the bad points of other countries and toot our own horn he is but missing the big picture and the true reason why Singaporeans leave and many do not come back.<br><br>Are they willing to risk the drugs and guns and crimes because they are stupid and donÂ’t know better? No, the real reason why we are losing are people lies in ourselves, his lionnoisy-style of trying to find solutions to our migration problem by tooting our own horn and highlighting the problems of others is like saying whatÂ’s good about our house and bad about others while ignoring the fire that is in the kitchen.<br><br>ItÂ’s not that Singapore is a bad place to stay, but there are strong factors that are alienating the locals from it and until the root is found the problem will contuine and all of GazelleÂ’s attempts to curse the local as a tame quitting cat, paint our local variety of food as worth staying for, and the crime rate of other nations will simply not help the problem at all.<br><br>Basically he is just screaming, and rather ineffectively as well.<br><br>If he truly wanted to be productive, he ought to face the true root of the problem instead of declaring the local is a tame useless cat and ought to buck up.<br><br>The irony is that they are indeed bucking up and becoming wild, thatÂ’s why they are leaving the safety and tameness of Singapore. It is the tame cats that stay and take whatever is happening lying down, not saying that all locals are tame cats, but that if you want to find a tame cat, the Â“quitterÂ” is certainly NOT one.<br><br>If anything all too often the Â“quitterÂ” is the WILD cat that our government is so desperate to keep, to the extent that it has become a problem.<br></div></blockquote>NOw I see this Gazelle for who he truly....a pathetic MIW dog who licks them up</div>
