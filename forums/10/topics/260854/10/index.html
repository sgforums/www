Another 5250 were registered between last June and February, suggesting the total this financial year could push towards 8000. That compares with just 4544 in 1999-2000.<br><br>Labor has used the figures from the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia to highlight a rising trend in personal insolvency over the past six years.<br><br>The number of personal bankruptcies and debt agreements across Sydney rose by more than half between 1999-2000 and 2005-06. Parts of western Sydney have been hardest hit with a rise of 99 per cent in Blacktown and 70 per cent in the outer west. A slump in property prices since 2004 and relatively high rates of unemployment in some parts of west and south-west Sydney may have contributed to the surge in bankruptcies and debt agreements.<br><br>The jobless rate in both Fairfield and south-west Blacktown was above 10 per cent - more than double the national rate - in the December quarter, figures published by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations show.<br><br>However, some of Sydney's wealthiest areas have also registered big increases in insolvency. Sydney's inner west had an increase of 83 per cent between 1999-2000 and 2005-06 while there was a 74 per cent on the northern beaches and 60 per cent in the eastern suburbs.<br><br>The shadow treasurer, Wayne Swan, said the figures showed many families are under significant financial pressure.<br><br>"Household budgets are being hit by rising petrol prices, high child-care costs and spiralling mortgage repayments caused by eight consecutive interest rate rises, despite John Howard's promise to keep rates at record lows," he said.<br><br>Roger Mendelson, the chief executive of debt collection company Prushka, said easy access to credit was contributing to the rise in bankruptcies and debt agreements.<br><br>"These people are not normally the high-flyers and the total amount owing to creditors is often not all that large, it's just beyond their capacity to repay," he said.<br><br>The total debt burden on Australian households has reached almost $1 trillion and the ratio of household debt to income has reached 160 per cent, one of the highest in the world.<br><br>Interest payments now soak up more than 11 per cent of all household income, about 2 percentage points more than in 1989 when mortgage interest rates were 17 per cent.<br><br>Labor has also highlighted Government figures showing a record amount of superannuation savings has been released to individuals early to assist with financial hardship.<br><br>Those in financial difficulty can apply to withdraw cash from their super account if they are in acute financial need.<br><br>The amount released for this purpose jumped from $70 million in 2005 to $135 million last year, Government answers to Labor questions on notice show.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Population of NSW is 6.8 mil with number of bankrupts at 7492 for '06<br>Population of Singapore 4.5 mil with number of bankrupts at 3506 for '06<br><br>Not a huge difference, and the australian bankrupts are guranteed healthcare and children's education.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I have never heard of the SG govt letting citizens withdraw CPF in times of acute financial need either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales </a><br><a href="http://www.itsa.gov.au/dir228/itsaweb.nsf/docindex/About%20Us-%3EStatistics-%3EStatistics?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.itsa.gov.au/dir228/itsaweb.nsf/docindex/About%20Us-%3EStatistics-%3EStatistics?OpenDocument</a><br><a href="http://app.ipto.gov.sg/QuickAccess.asp?pg=3E2E303C1B0E1B1C" rel="nofollow">http://app.ipto.gov.sg/QuickAccess.asp?pg=3E2E303C1B0E1B1C</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Singapore's 'fat cat' ministers to get fatter</strong></span><br><span class="small">By Alex Au </span><br><br>SINGAPORE - Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently recommended an 83% pay increase for all his cabinet ministers, a proposal that would up their current annual pay rate of S$1.2 million (US$784,300) to S$2.2 million.<br><br>Singapore already pays its senior ministers better than any other Asian country and most Western ones. For instance, Prime Minister Lee's S$1.94 million is currently three times the US$400,000 US President George W Bush takes home in salary<br><br>per year. Lee's salary is currently about 1.6 times that of his cabinet ministers.<br><br>Lee said on March 22 that ministers' current S$1.2 million salaries represented only 55% of the government's benchmark for standardized politician pay rates. Details of the new salary scales will be announced to Parliament on Monday. It is not yet known whether the government intends to adjust the pay packets to the benchmark in one leap or in a series of steps.<br><br>High pay for Singaporean government officials has historically helped curb corruption, which compared with other Asian countries ranks favorably on international graft rankings kept by such organizations as Transparency International. But many here feel that the upward adjustment, which will indirectly benefit Lee's ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which currently dominates Parliament by controlling 82 of 84 seats, is in poor taste at a time that many middle- and lower-class Singaporeans face a declining standard of living.<br><br>The benchmark Lee referred to - code name "MR4" - is a comparable measure based on private-sector compensation in six fields: law, banking, accounting, engineering, multinational companies and local manufacturing companies. Cabinet ministers' pay is equivalent to two-thirds of the midpoint between the 24th and 25th top earners in any of these fields.<br><br>"For the public service to remain an attractive employer," said Lee in his March 22 speech, "our terms must keep pace with the private sector. That is why our policy is to pay public servants competitive salaries, commensurate with private-sector earnings."<br><br>However, one would arguably be hard-pressed to find many Singaporean voters who would agree to the exponential salary increase, judging at least by the steady stream of criticism over the proposal published in Singapore's free-wheeling blogosphere.<br><br>"I think the biggest problem with the entire issue is that we have no check and balance. When ministers make the decision to increase their own pay, who approves?" asked Aaron Ng in his weblog known as Hear Ye Hear Ye.<br><br>Letters from readers published in the mainstream press have expressed more measured skepticism. "By saying that we need to pay top dollar for top talent we are saying that certain people are indispensable. This may breed complacency," wrote Dr Anne Chong Su Yan on April 3 in the government-linked Straits Times.<br><br><a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/ID05Ae01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/ID05Ae01.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahead, the bottom is falling behind and the middle is feeling the pressure."<br><br>Prime Minister Lee's proposed pay increase is clearly aimed at keeping the ruling PAP class in Singapore's upper wage-earning tier. The question is whether the move is controversial enough to create substantial political turbulence.<br><br>Three weeks before Lee spoke about the need to raise his<br><br>politicians' pay by 83%, the government had defended as sufficient its recent decision to increase social welfare to the destitute by S$30 per month. Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan told Parliament during the budget debate: "An elderly recipient, living alone, currently receives about $260 [US$171] a month. We will increase that to $290 a month."<br><br>Even the ruling PAP's own backbenchers were underwhelmed by the marginal boost - cognizant, perhaps, that growing wealth disparity was a hot-button issue taken up by opposition parties during last year's general elections. Member of Parliament (MP) Lily Neo, responding to Balakrishnan, told him: "My single constituents told me that they needed to skip one meal a day to live on the $260 per month. And now, [the ministry] is going to give them $1 more a day."<br><br>Indeed, this "30 dollars" giveaway is the source of much sarcasm in public comments about the proposed ministers' pay raise. Others think it beggars belief that Singapore's civil servants and ministers deserve to be paid multiples of what their counterparts in developed countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia earn.<br><br>Suspect calculations<br><strong>To some, the high figures that the benchmarking formula dispenses makes the formula itself suspect. For example, it has been pointed out by many that the top 24 or 25 earners in the six designated fields are not the same individuals from year to year. Different individuals appear within this set, as it often depends on extraordinary bonuses and stock options that individuals receive in one year, but not necessarily the next. </strong><br><br>Ministers, on the other hand, are rarely changed through elections, so the same individuals get the high benchmarked salaries year in, year out. Some also wonder whether the formula attempts to compare apples with oranges in that the private-sector compensation used for benchmarking refers to total compensation.<br><br>However, the benchmark is believed - and official clarification is rather lacking in this regard - to be used for ministers' and top civil servants' basic salaries exclusive of their total compensation packages. That said, it should be noted that there is a one-third discount in formulating the MR4 benchmark, it being two-thirds of the 24th and 25th private-sector high-flyer.<br><br>Civil servants and ministers also get bonuses on top of their basic salaries, amounting to as much as four months' pay in years when the economy performs well. The result of all these combinations and permutations is that it is actually very hard for ordinary citizens to grasp exactly how much their political leaders pay themselves.<br><br>What they are left with is an uneasy feeling that all these statistical complications and permutations, and a perceived official reluctance to lay out the bare-bone details, could be masking even more shocking financial realities for taxpayers. Consider, for instance, pensions.<br><br><strong>Nearly all Singaporeans save for their own retirement, while ministers get life-long pensions if they have held office for a minimum of eight years and have reached 55 years of age. Again, there's a complex formula for determining the pension amount, with a cap of "two-thirds of the highest annual salary of any office" held by the individual in question. </strong><br><br><strong>The shocker was momentarily revealed in June 2004 - though the mainstream media did not highlight it then nor have they since. That was when an opposition MP asked then deputy prime minister Lee Hsien Loong whether it was true that a "serving minister who turns 55 actually receive[s] both salary and pension at the same time". Lee, in answer, said yes. There are currently eight cabinet ministers aged 55 and above, including Lee himself. </strong><br><br>Alex Au is an independent social and political commentator, freelance writer and blogger based in Singapore.
