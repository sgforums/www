If the figure of the citizens migrating keeps going up, it does not reflect well on the gahmen of Singapore.  Besides, they will lose the chances of "earning" $$$ at these people's expense and losing talents as well.  So it goes without saying why gahmen is so keen to encourage them to come back.<br><br>Who cares if the citizenship in Singapore is not easy to get??  If those who have migrated are enjoying their life there and find that it is better to be there than Singapore , so why worry about obtaining Singapore citizenship in future!!!  Mind you, those who have migrated are not coming back to Singapore for good.<br><br>It is because of people like you that the ruling party is getting more and more daring to do so much at our expense to please and satisfy themselves!!! Wake up!!!  </div></blockquote>i think you will be surprised that the % of total tax revenue from singaporeans will diminish over time.  so the issue of how many singaporeans emigrate wont be tied with tax and $$$.<br><br>it will be more difficult to take back your singapore pink ic in the future, whether you want or not, does not matter.  but it does matter to the generations of singaporeans who stay put.<br><br>there people who will contribute to making singapore a more formidable place, like soul_rage.<br><br>so far, are you one of those who calculate how much the singapore government taxes and how much better it is to gain by moving to somewhere else?  i dont think like you.  i think, is there a profession which teaches others to succeed and yet without getting paid ?  how to improve the situation for my family and close relatives ?<br><br></div>

The point is, that the purpose of the Govt is to temper the inhumane nature of the capitalist system and ensure the have nots can at least benefit in some indirect way from the capitalist system. But our Govt does not believe in any form of welfare though it does to an extent.<br><br>The Govt terms it workfare to ensure everyone has a job, but it quietly ignores the reality that having a job does not mean a person can still survive with the cash he receives. In Singapore, families own flats and not rent them and house ownership becomes an unnecessary burden here. But people are suckered into buying a flat regardless. The Gini Coefficient for Singapore itself says it all: A sizable portion of the population earn less than 2K a year. Work out the math and figure out what happens when one buys a 3 room flat.</div>
