Typical of myopic morons who think they've seen the world (just because you've got a pair of tinted glasses on) and have a knack of making daft assumptions which are as logical as a toddler's.<br><br>I never said private schools were necessarily worse than public schools, did I? I merely challenged your simplistic notion than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">public schools are crap</span></span>. As a matter of fact, Bill Clinton, John Major and Lloyd Blankfein (and they're just 3 among many others) are all prominent alumni of public schools in their respective countries where they have been schooled. I don't think you need a supremely gifted intellect to comprehend the fact that those 3 men have since, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">despite their modest schooling at "crap" public schools</span></span>, gone on to achieve things most schooled in the most privileged private schools can only dream about.<br><br>So who's losing the argument?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The analysis is based on census data (i.e. all schools in the state were assessed), and we've used structural equation modelling to look at the key drivers of student performance.  The results have yet to be publicly released, so I'm going to have to be careful with what I say here, but I can safely tell you that independent schools (a fair number of which offer internationally recognised programs such as the International Baccalaureate) do not outperform public schools once you account for the students' innate levels of ability in the first place.  Put simply, the biggest influence on the students' performance is how they performed when they entered the schools in the first place, and once you account for the students' innate level of ability, there's no such thing as a good school that's going to turn Forrest Gump into Albert Einstein.  The data supports the anecdotal cases proposed by walesa.</div>
