With a good economy, comes good consumerism,  the temptation of credit cards - buy first (beyond your means) pay later.  I got an offer from AMEX to go platinum with a 25k minimum limit (means that I cannot set my limit to 2k )   but that would be stupid because if I cannot pay up , they will repossess whatever I have. Banks are clever like that, I can walk into any bank and get a credit card approved but pay like hell later - credit card interest rates compound.<br><br>Furthermore, foreign debt in Australia will be high. Banks are borrowing from overseas to finance their credit operations because they cannot meet the demand - credit cards, loans for business , loans for homes etc. It is economics.<br><br>I like to pay in full but a credit card is good for travelling and mine gets extended only when I have to travel.<br><br>So don't look crudely at the rates.</div>

I love being able to pack upfor the weekend, and depending on which direction I point my car in, ski, scuba dive or tour a winery.  There's only so  much clubbing and shopping you can do in Singapore before you stop being able to tell one place from another.<br><br>The more important point doesn't have anything to do with money.  I love being able to walk into any pub, plonk myself down at the bar and strike up conversation with the next bloke, be it about his kids, preferences of local or imported beers or what a bunch of knobs the dickheads in parliament are.  We may agree or disagree, but at the end of it we'll agree that it was a good chat.  You can't even maintain eye contact with a stranger in Singapore.<br><br>ON THE OTHER HAND ...<br><br>I've got a close friend who's a regional director with a large American firm in Singapore.  She moved over from Las Vegas a few years ago, and she absolutely loves Singapore's buzz.  She and her husband are in their late forties, have no kids and own a place in Phuket that they pop over to every six weeks or so.  When they first arrived, I gave them my perspective on the social and political situation in Singapore, and despite initially finding it very negative, after a few years she acknowledged that my observations were accurate.  Still, she loves being in Singapore and has no intention to return stateside.  Who am I to question that?<br><br>Anothe close mate of mine is from Sydney, but he spent his formative years in Singapore - his parents still maintain a flat in Woodlands.  He spent a few years later working and living in Singapore, and I have my fun ragging him about liking Singapore while he says the same about me and Australia.  At the end of the day, though, we respect each others' choices.  He says he feel at home in Singapore.  Who am I to question that?<br><br>As I said, it's a matter of perspective.  People have their own personalities, and different places appeal to different personalities - there's no right or wrong in anybody's choice as long as they are happy with it.  What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> wrong is when some jackass starts crapping on about what place is best.  If someone thinks he's in a position to declare what's best, he's got a seriously misguided view of his place in the world.<br><br>As for work-life balance, depending on the time of year, I work anything between the standard 38.5 and 90 hours a week.  The 90 hour-a-week periods are seasonal, usually when my clients want to clear off their projects before the end of financial year, and even then weekends are usually sacrosanct.  I make sure I'm in the fortunate position of being able to both make the money and having the time to spend it.  It's just as well that I love my work, and an even better thing that the missus understands.<br><br>I don't have kids yet, but having been both a student and a teacher in Singapore, I wouldn't want my kids to grow up in that environment.  It's not a matter of competition - if my kids were to be uncompetitive, I'd get concerned.  What I do object to is the way kids in Singapore are measured and valued by a one-size-fits-few yardstick.  It's dehumanising, although to the credit of the Singaporean education system, they finally seem to be slowly realising this and getting with the program.</div>

Do you think you will ever get the payouts?  your retirement age is pushed up and will be pushed up until you have no energy to enjoy it.  The young paying up for the old to retire in your country?  So you dont have enough young working people?  You want young working professionals to come to your country to pay taxes for your retirement? Beg me, maybe i go.<br><br>your so called free education for the young.  come on, dont think i never been to the west.  most public schools are crap.  if i really care for my children, i send them to better quality international schools which cost at least AUD10K in fees each year.  if i send them to crappy public schools, i rather send them to good primary schools in singapore.<br><br>your so called free health service.  what is the quality?  how does it compare to singapore's poly clinics?  if you dont understand what is quality, drop over and find out. </div></blockquote>Hello CannotTahan.<br><br>You know me and I know you.<br><br>Let me make it clear. I pay taxes in Australia, albeit higher . I don't intend to use the social security there when I can work. And when I retire, I don't expect to see myself using the pension system. I just want my healthcare card with plenty of discounts for old retirees when I hit that stage.<br><br>Alot of retirees still work in Australia and the Australian govt is encouraging them without tellling them that THEY HAVE TO DO IT and to accept any shit jobs.  More money for them - they don't feed into the pension system and the government allows them to withdraw a part of their superannuation without tax while their employer still have to put in superannuation for them.<br><br>Pay taxes for my retirement? Nah. I got superannuation in Australia - I direct my reserves into super and then wait for the govt to input 1.5 dollars on top every voluntary dollar I put in. I don't need pension but I would like to have a fallback - it gives me a <strong>sense of security </strong>if something unforseen happens , at least I know the country which I paid taxes to will look after me.<br><br>As for public schooling, of course Australian education system is no competition for Singapore. I like Singapore schooling system - when I studied in Singapore, you learn that if your daddy has plenty of money and connections, you can get the best in life. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Except I wasn't the kid with that dad. </span></strong>So it taught me about a thing or two. I thank my parents for making me work since I was 15 years old for my own pocket money. At least I know as a teenager ,the value of education and money as well as treating others with respect, after watching how seemingly educated people treat the uneducated packers in a Singaporean departmental store. And I learnt the most important thing - it is about which class system you are in ( we are talking money class) . All thanks to Singaporean schooling and confirmation in the real working world when I was a teenager working and studying.<br><br>There are plenty of opportunities in Australia for my future kids with good parenting and encouragement. If public schooling was so awful in Australia, how come Australia can produce Nobel Science Prize winners while Singapore has not produced any yet? So don't condemn another system.<br><br>Free health service - one size fits all. I can still sue doctors in a free health service if they are negligent in undertaking due care in looking after me. Having a user pay system is not exactly a good idea, ever seen a C class ward in Singapore before?<br><br>No thanks I rather have free health service which provides for me in a ward that looks like a B1 class in Australia, and still have a menu I can select. Yes I will wait for my doctor to see me very patiently and I have no doubt that if I am in a critical condition, the consultant will be called down ( that happened before in Australia- they called out the consultant in the middle of the night because I was going into respiratory arrest ).<br><br>I can talk because I worked in the health care institutions of both Singapore and Australia. And as for Singaporean nursing ratios ...it's  a joke compared to the Victorian 1 nurse to 4 patients ratio. So tell me - what were you talking about quality again?<br><br><strong>Don't be mistaken. I still hold my Singaporean health professional colleagues in very high regard and I think they give the best they can. Alot of them do damn well when they come to Australia. However with their workload and the managerial system in Singapore , how can they give the best quality out to Singaporeans in the health system?</strong><br><br>Singapore is small. Easy to get one polyclinic out in the densely populated  country. Australia is vast and it is hard to reach everyone. No doubt there needs to be improvement but you cannot compare a giant jackfruit to a small nectarine.<br><br><strong>Of course, if I was a Singaporean with plenty of old money (millions and millions of dollars) and daddy's connections to back me up, I will make my base Singapore because it is a wise thing to do. That's just good business.</strong><br><br></div>
