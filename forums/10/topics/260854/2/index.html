            <div class='col-md body'>The article appears to give a lot of statistics and let the reader reach his own conclusion. However, I'm not sure whether those statistics are so relevant to the topic, as the majority of emigrants leaving Singapore most probably belong to the professional classes, whose skills make them more economically mobile.<br><br>Something else, besides the higher living expenses or lack of welfarism, must be the main push factor, for example, the pace of life, the culture or the stress level of living and working in this country, which are more difficult to discern from statistics.<br><br>Conversely, we should also look at the pull factors - what is it about other countries that make some Singaporeans prefer to become citizens over there rather than remain here. Of course these factors might be the same ones as those listed above.<br><br>In any case, it is vital for the government to look at these factors and genuinely do something about them rather than complaining, threatening or, as some forumners have put it, resorting to emotional blackmail to persuade Singaporeans to stay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In other words, to borrow somebody elseÂ’s analogy, our current system is looking for Â“wildÂ” cats that are willing to work hard and cheap without any welfare strings attached, as opposed to the local Â“tameÂ” cats that always point out to life beyond the immediate economic realities.<br><br>The weak link in all this is that, the system expects that the imported wild cats will keep all their imported habits and stay for good- in other words, keep contributing all the wild cat benefits until the day they die.<br><br>Unfortunately few wild cats actually see things this way, being wild in nature, many are shrewd enough to realize that such an arrangement is not advantageous. After all few wild cats want to keep working until the day they die in the wild cat environment. At the end of the day, most cats, wild or not still want to have a life outside the economic circle.<br><br>While Singapore is a good spot for wild cats to come and make a living, ultimately itÂ’s not the kind of place the wild cat wants to live in. ItÂ’s very factors and policies that make it attractive to the wild cats as a feeding ground are ironically, make it extremely unattractive to be a place for cats to stay.<br><br>ItÂ’s like how cats will hunt rats in the drains and sewers, but ultimately not sleep or even stay there once they have taken their fill. And is Singapore becoming such a drain or sewer?<br><br>At the same time, some of the so called tame cats realize that they donÂ’t need to live in a place that is becoming a sewer or drain, and hence opt out of the Â“rat raceÂ”. Unfortunately for the system to be lucrative it requires the input of tame cats to do some things that wild cats cannotÂ… for example, only local cats are trusted to guard and defend the territory, and in fact many of the factors that made the place so attractive to the wild cats could only be maintained by selling the Â“tameÂ” local cats short. The local cats are told to put up with turning the place into a sewer to attract the wild cats, as well as expected to die and defend the place in times of trouble.<br><br>At the end of the day the local cat asks Â“whatÂ’s in it for me?Â”, and of course most of the wild cats make it a point never to let itself or its offspring become a local cat if they can help it. While some wild cats are really sincere in wanting to become a part of the local society, some others are also equally mercenary and opportunistic in their motives for coming to the place and making the most out of it. The system however doesnÂ’t bother in distinguishing the two as long as both types of wild cats (sincere or mercenary), earn as much money for it.<br><br>Are rats our only attraction and merit to the wild cat? If so then we are in trouble.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course if the person who came up with this Â“wild cat/tame catÂ” analogy bothered to read up on some basic ecology, he would realize the connotations of his analogy.<br><br>Often alien species that are introduced against which local species cannot realistically compete will devastate the local ecology and eventually destroy the local environment or even work to the determent of the ones who introduced the alien species.<br><br>If not managed properly, the current FT policies could spark a vicious destructive cycle. Our best talents socially mobile will see no need to compete with FT when they can get a better deal elsewhere and simply leave, eroding our local talent base and actually increasing our reliance on foreign talent over time as opposed to adding more skills to Singapore. The ones that cannot move out will be forced to compete in the context of the citizen with NS and other duties, the actual quality of life for the local will be reduced.<br><br>And I donÂ’t think this will help the birthrate, forcing the system to take in MORE FTs and sparking off the cycle in a worse fashion.<br><br>IÂ’m not saying this WILL happen, but I am pointing out that all things if taken to an excess will often have the opposite result from what was intended.<br><br>There is a difference between infusing new blood, adding biodiversity by adding species and infusing the wrong blood type or introducing an alien species as a instant solution for some problem.<br><br>The mosquito fish when introduced, not only failed to control the mosquito problem but ended up finishing off all the local mosquito predators, actually making the problem [I]worse[/I] in the long run.<br><br>This is not saying Singaporeans should be protected from whatever happens in the world and have NO competition. But there is a difference between training your own people to be tougher and more independent and throwing them to the wolves and picking whoever survives.<br><br>Alien species have been successfully introduced before and with good benefit. As with all things this must be done carefully, not in the fashion that goes Â“the mosquito fish will solve all our problems, letÂ’s do it!Â” while actually taking no concrete steps to improve the local birth rate or quality of life.<br><br>And of course, the attitude which goes Â“letÂ’s import wild cats to replace all the CMI local tame catsÂ” is definitely a wrong one. It is exactly the kind of attitude that will make the question of having disinterested or dissenting locals worse and make the whole thing spiral out of control.<br><br>The proper approach would be Â“how can we use the wild cats to aid improve the local cats?Â”, and not Â“if you are not like a wild cat, you are not a worthy catÂ”.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a species of freshwater fish, also commonly known simply by its generic name, gambusia, although such usage is, to say the least, ambiguous. It is sometimes called the western mosquitofish, to distinguish it from the eastern mosquitofish (G. holbrooki). In Hong Kong, it is also known as the live-bearing tooth-carp. It is a member of the family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes.<br><br>These fish are native to the watershed of the Gulf of Mexico, where it has long been known that they feed readily on the aquatic larval and pupal stages of mosquitoes. They are remarkably hardy, surviving in waters of very low oxygen saturations, high salinities (including twice that of seawater), and high temperatures; they can even survive in waters up to 42 Â°C for short periods. For these reasons, this species may now be the most widespread freshwater fish in the world, having been introduced as a biocontrol to tropical and temperate countries in both hemispheres, and then spreading further both naturally and through even further introductions. <strong>The majority of these introductions were foolish; in most countries where mosquitofish have been introduced it is has been proved that the endemic fish species were already providing maximal mosquito control, and that the introduction of mosquitofish has been both unnecessary and highly damaging to endemic fish and other endemic aquatic life. In Australia G.holbrooki has caused great damage to native fish and frog species. For example it is considered responsible for the extinction of rainbowfish in sub-tropical streams around Brisbane.</strong></blockquote>Simply because the alien species is less demanding and easy to put up with might not mean it's a cure all for your local issues. In fact it might even make it worse.<br><br></div>

However, I'm not sure whether those statistics are so relevant to the topic, as the majority of emigrants leaving Singapore most probably belong to the professional classes, whose skills make them more economically mobile.<br><br>Something else, besides the higher living expenses or lack of welfarism, must be the main push factor, for example, the pace of life, the culture or the stress level of living and working in this country, which are more difficult to discern from statistics.<br><br>Conversely, we should also look at the pull factors - what is it about other countries that make some Singaporeans prefer to become citizens over there rather than remain here. Of course these factors might be the same ones as those listed above.<br><br>In any case, it is vital for the government to look at these factors and genuinely do something about them rather than complaining, threatening or, as some forumners have put it, resorting to emotional blackmail to persuade Singaporeans to stay.</div></blockquote>I left Singapore for Australia - have not looked back since.<br><br>Why?

Trust me - it is far higher than what a local will get . On top of that - check their benefits - they probably get accomodation , cars and what's not.<br><br>If they are self starters (for their own business) - it is because the employment rules are more beneficial to them in Singapore ( easier to exploit) than their own countries ( where unions are).
