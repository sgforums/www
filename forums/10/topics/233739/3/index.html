In America, it seems that people do not grumble too much because of the so-called American dream where one could be like "them" if one is capable. Whereas in Britain, the notion of elitism is heavily frowned upon in populist politics, a relic of a time that Britain was heavily elitist where the aristocrats gained more favour than the commoners, especially in the Royal Navy and Royal Army.<br><br>That said, the Govt does champion it's idea of a scholar, and champions as usual, are lightning rods for resentment.</div>

This contrasts with the US where officers who enroll in Military run training institutions such as West Point, or perhaps in universities with military training facilities (ROTC and what not). All officers in general have bachelor degrees so everyone has equal footing who either rise to top either by connections, or by merit. However, the SAF instead decided to have a fast track advancement for SAFOS officers.<br><br>However, it should be noted that all officers have grading systems, grading by both peer and superior. You might not know that if you aren't a clerk that handles such stuff.<br><br>Come to think of it, our meritocracy is a sham. It means that there's only meritocracy up to a certain point, but gain say a PSC or an SAFOS scholarship, you enter the fast road.</div>

Coming up with a good indicator is the toughest thing. In short, I do agree many scholars are yan guo qi shi but is there a better way to pick up potential leaders???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scholar system will deem to exist but we should look for leaders from other aspect also. What the pt of paying so much money on a minister who don't deserve that pay? Spending unnecessary money(like founding a name for budget terminal and ended up they using budget terminal as the name) Marine bay new name ended up they used back marine bay after spending 300k then they realize that. What the hell I think prospect should base on performance not academic....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is unfair to say that scholars can't make it as gd leaders. During my army days I've had the privilage of serving along many of these scholars. I must say, most of them possess the intellect and ability to overcome any challenges being thrusted to them. There is a particular officer who is I believe is an EDB scholar who is a year younger than I was. Knowing that he will face some difficulty with the senior specs, given his age, he took it upon himself to lower his pride and started interacting with us. In the end, he prove to be an individual who took responsibility for his actions and would do anything in his power to protect his man. I must say, through him, it made me take a second look at how I used to percieve the atypical scholar. If only individuals such as him will inherit our leadership roles, I say at least we've got a chance in overcoming the odds.</div>
