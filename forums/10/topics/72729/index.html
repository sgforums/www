            <div class='col-md body'>The following article details the ordeal of a 34 year old indian man who works for HDB and was accused of stealing $200,000.00 from their safe. He was eventually vindicated by his good lawyer, but who pays for his ordeal? HDB readily accuses him, and sets him through the entire ordeal whereby he was forced to make a statement that he stoled the money, but he reported that he was forced into making confession by Police and his lawyer managed to bring about justice. But I just wonder, who pays for his ordeal?<br><br>Does this means, that a government body can just point a fingure at anyone who works for them and get away scott free? Personally, I think HDB should pay his lawyer fees, and the poor man should sue for damages and forget the goddamned job with HDB.<br><br><strong>HDB man cleared of stealing $200,000 </strong><br><br>Confession to cops wasn't given voluntarily<br>Case not proven beyond reasonable doubt<br>By Selina Lum<br><br>A HOUSING Board employee accused of stealing $200,000 from the board's office in Bukit Merah walked out of court a free man yesterday.<br><br>Mr Selvakumar Pillai Suppiah Pillai, 34, wept after he was acquitted by a district court, and knelt down to thank his lawyer.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Mr Subhas Anandan had argued that the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence.<br><br>District Judge Doris Lai acquitted Mr Selvakumar after a 12-day trial, saying that the prosecution had not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>She had earlier thrown out the man's confession as she found the statement had not been given voluntarily.<br><br>Mr Selvakumar had claimed his T-shirt was ripped off and tied around his head while he was interrogated, that he was punched in the stomach, had cold water poured over him while he was naked in an air-conditioned room, and had his nipples pinched by a police officer.<br><br>Clasping his hands together, he told The Straits Times yesterday: 'I'm very happy and relieved.'<br><br>His wife, 33, was close to tears as she tended to their one-year-old daughter.<br><br>Added her husband: 'Right now, I'm waiting for HDB to send me a letter to say I can have my job back.'<br><br>Mr Selvakumar, who had been suspended from his post as an administrative assistant with HDB, was accused of stealing $199,575.78 from a safe at the office after 6.15pm on June 30 last year.<br><br>Three HDB employees testified that he had turned up for work to help count the day's cash collection, even though it was his day off.<br><br>He then disappeared, so they left for dinner without him. He showed up later, saying he had gone home to pick up a bottle of liquor.<br><br>The prosecution highlighted his 'sudden wealth' as clear inference that he had stolen the money.<br><br>On the night of June 30, he deposited $1,000 into two bank accounts. On July 1, he paid more than $21,000 to redeem jewellery he and his wife had pawned.<br><br>On July 2, his father-in-law deposited $16,400 into his own bank account. On July 4, his home was raided and $2,000 found.<br><br>While he was on remand, his wife deposited about $50,000 into her account, some of this from her father, which she used to bail him out.<br><br>Mr Selvakumar earned $1,200 a month, yet he and his family came by in excess of $76,000 overnight, said the prosecution. However, Mr Anandan argued: 'In this country, a man is not convicted on suspicion or on the prosecution's speculations.'<br><br>Mr Selvakumar said he had savings of up to $25,000 at home for emergencies. His wife, Madam Rajaswari Thiruvengadam, said she had borrowed money and pawned jewellery to raise the bail.<br><br>She also said the money in her father-in-law's account was a friend's and he was keeping it for him.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read the article with interest when it first appeared, and while circumstantial evidence seems to point at the guy, it is just that, circumstantial.<br><br>What I'd like to know is that what the hell is the mentality of the police who think they can use this evidence, along with a confession, that as it turned out, was tortured out of the guy. Whatever happened to real investigative police work that should have resulted from the circumstantial evidence, before taking the whole thing to trial?<br><br>A mark of a real "world-class" police force should not just be clearing cases quickly, it should be clearing cases quickly AND CORRECTLY. With this case, and others before it, one can only wonder how many more such cases are there, only with innocent men languishing in jail.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to the unfortunate soul, he was stripped naked, drenched in cold water, and made to stand soaking naked in a super charged aircon room.<br><br>He was also punched in the stomach, which obviously will not leave any bruise mark as it is the softest spot in the body - except that the stomach will soon distender.<br><br>There should be an independent investigation into this obvious case of Police Brutality in Singapore.<br><br>SM LKY had unashamedly admitted that such techniques have been used to obtain information from individuals arrested under the Internal Security Act.<br><br>Does this practise extend into obtaining confession from Singaporeans charged under the Penal Code ?<br><br>Perhaps we should engage the descendants of Pao Kung to oversee justice in Singapore - since the Judicial System in Singapore is incapable or unwilling to rule against the Masters that feed them.<br><br>It is amazing that the poor soul is even looking to the possibility of HDB giving him back the job position.<br><br></div>
