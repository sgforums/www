              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore's Lesson: Buy High, Sell Low </strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Aristocratic lineage isn't a qualification for financial management</strong></span> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong><br> Ho Ching's flawed management of the billions of public savings
              entrusted to her as chief executive of Temasek Holdings has continued
              until the last. </strong></span>Her
              successor, Chip Goodyear, formerly with BHP, moved in as CEO-designate
              in March and formerly takes over in October. But presumably it was Ho
              Ching, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who took the
              decision to sell out of its huge Bank of America holding, an investment
              originally made in Merrill Lynch which was taken over last year to save
              it from bankruptcy.<br> <br> Now she has managed to sell out at what, at least on a six month view,
              looks close to the bottom of the US financial sector. The sale was
              completed by the end of March so presumably took place in the preceding
              few weeks. Since then the BoA share price has risen 66 percent.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Temasek's loss on BoA alone is estimated around US$4.6 billion, or roughly US$1,000 for every single Singaporean citizen.</strong></span></span> Big losses too were sustained on most of the rest of the financial portfolio such as Barclays of the UK and UBS of Switzerland.<br> <br> Other huge losses were sustained by the even less transparent
              Government Investment Corporation, which invested Swiss francs 11
              billion in UBS in 2007 and added to it in a rights issue in 2008. From
              US$60 in New York in 2007, UBS shares have slumped to US$13, having
              been down to US$7. <span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Did
              GIC also sell UBS when Temasek was selling BoA? Or is its presence in
              Singapore, where it occupies the former residence of the president, too
              useful for bringing in business from Myanmar generals and other friends
              of Singapore?</strong></span></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The desire to get out of Wall
              Street's black holes was understandable but the exodus seems to have
              been part of the group's follow-the-crowd mentality.</strong></span></span> And one wonders if it is not going to repeat itself. Goodyear's claim
              to fame was increasing BHP's market capitalization from US$12 billion
              to US$200 billion and a quadrupling its share price in his eight years
              at the helm. However, most of this was luck â€“ the biggest mineral price
              boom for 40 years -- plus acquisitions made at increasingly high
              prices. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Goodyear's reputation
              would be very different if Rio Tinto had accepted BHP's top of the
              market bid made just after he left office but with his support.</strong></span></span>Instead
              Rio's ego maniac chief executive rejected the offer so, having saddled
              itself with massive debt of its own, now going cap in hand to China.<br> <br> Will Goodyear push Temasek into resources because he knows about them
              and Singapore itself has caught the China-growth bug? For sure prices
              of commodities are down a lot from a year ago. But they also have long
              cycles.<br> <br> The latest investment focus of Temasek now, according to an executive
              quoted by Bloomberg, is "going to be driven more and more by China's
              economy and consumers so might as well load up more on Chinese banks."<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>So Temasek is again
              following fashion, re-focusing on Asia at a time when Asian markets
              have already recovered a long way while its former western favorites
              are still languishing. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Temasek still seems to think that Chinese banks made a good proxy for its economy and consumers.</span> Just like Southeast Asia in the 1990s, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">China's economy can grow rapidly, but still leave banks with piles of bad debts flowing from government-directed lending.</span></strong></span><br> <br> For sure, developing Asia looks a better long-term bet than the west,
              but discovering that today is not exactly evidence of being ahead of
              the curve.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Quite how badly Temasek has done is hard to figure out because the data presented is scanty and unconsolidated.</strong></span></span> For example, in 2007-08 the value of its portfolio increased by 13
              percent to S$185 billion but it is unsure how much of that was simply a
              capital injection from the government. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>There
              are also black holes like its subsidiary Astrea, which borrowed US$810
              million in earlier in the decade to invest in a portfolio of private
              equity and buyout funds.</strong></span></span> Another fall for Wall Street fashion which will likely be reflected in pensions for Singaporeans.<br> <br> Meanwhile Temasek's local portfolio has been persistently trimmed and
              now represents only 33 percent of assets. Of course it may make more
              sense to invest in faster growing countries rather than in low growth
              Singapore where there are few new opportunities for a company which
              already controls so much. Nevertheless it hard not to conclude that <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>some
              of these sales, such as the December 2008 sale of PowerSeraya to
              Malaysia's YTL for S$3.8 billion are not partly designed to generate
              capital profits readily available from long-held local assets.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Ho appears to have made a
              career of assuming that smart people with the right degrees and loaded
              up with mathematical models in one hand and high sounding jargon in the
              other knew more than anyone else about investment.</strong></span></span> Thus during the boom years for financial services, Temasek followed the
              crowd, pushing the financial sector component of its portfolio up to 40
              percent, most of it invested in just the high profile western outfits
              favored by Ho's Wharton-bred advisors..<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Like the archetypal senior Singapore bureaucrat,
              paper qualifications seem to have counted for far more than actual
              experience running a business. </strong></span>Such businesses as these
              people run are mostly Singapore public sector ones shielded from the
              force of free competition. Even Singapore Airlines is beginning to look
              jaded in an era of low cost carriers pioneered by a Malaysian, Tony
              Fernandes and AirAsia, and the gradual breakdown of fare cartel.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>If nothing else, the record of
              Temasek gives the lie to notion spread by Singapore's ruling clique
              that they are the best guardians of the people's savings. Paternalism
              morphed into an arrogance whose full cost to Singaporeans is for now
              hidden by the opaque nature of the government's accounts, and the very
              partial revelations provided by Temasek. </strong></span></span>Singaporeans, gather your purse-strings and, together, pull. <br> <br> --------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
