If you work in a Japanese company, you may also wanna think about quitting your job and applying to companies run by others.

Approx. 70% of the cars on the roads are japanese cars. Who would want to buy continental cars at a premium higher than jap cars when u get reasonable quality products from the japs??? 80% of the companies on Jurong Island are Japanese companies. If they pull out of Singapore, the supporting industries of instrumentation (mainly western vendors like Emerson, E+H etc and supporting local subcontractors on the Island) will also collapse. Thus, effectively the petrochem industry of Singapore will be destroyed. While western companies like Maxtor and Seagate are busying retrenching people, jap companies like Yokogawa and Sumitomo are actively expanding their influence here by employing 3000 additional engineers and building new chemical plant on J.Island...<br><br>Additionally, if the petrochem industries titantic, without adequate support from the Petrochem industries for raw materials, the Semicon industries will also get dragged down as they have to purchase their materials from overseas thus higher cost. Then the semicon industries will sink deeper and we are talking about an even greater impact in this field that Singapore is equally dependent upon. So, in short, don't mess around with the Japs...</div>

Such visits are likened to Gerhard Shroeder enshrining and visiting the Berlin bunker where Hitler killed himself. If that were to happen, there will be huge demonstrations all over Europe and America with ppl calling for Shroeder to immediately resign.<br><br>As regards your point that there are other ppl enshrined at Yasukuni, the principal objection as I understand, is against the 14 class A war criminals. What is needed is frank discussion between the Chinese, Korean and Japanese govt. to look for ways forward; eg relocate the 14 war criminals somewhere where Japanese leaders don't visit. Trust you can now understand the reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I guess i was being ambiguous. I agree that jap has conducted many atrocities and war crimes. I am not condoning their crimes and their insistance of their innocence nor the priggish arrogance of their righteousness regarding the war.<br><br>Perhaps their indignation regarding the shrine issue is not so much the correctness of visiting the shrine and its significance, but rather the fact that foreigners like China and Sg are telling them what to do.<br><br>To illustrate my point, would you get upset if I told you not to go to a certain place as i felt it is wrong IN MY OPINION, even though you feel that its none of my business IN YOUR OPINION. Perception comes into play in this affair.<br><br>When discussing this issue, one must bear in mind the possibly that the jap prime minister might have been subjected to the same education that denied the occurance of the atrocities. Of course ignorance is no excuse (although the jap prime minister would beg to differ).</div>
