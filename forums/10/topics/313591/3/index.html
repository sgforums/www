              <p>saw this on TV news yesterday that almost 3/4 of the PRC migrants to SYD cant speak english or dont bother to learn, some citing that there are so many PRCs around that they are very comfortable speaking in their own native tongue.<br><br>i reflect on the state of what sporeans are; we speak english as our 1st language and we are skilled professionals. how come we are so kiasi of emgrating to western countries like australia whereas these PRCs are so bold that they can do it without the ability of languages and skills?<br><br>we really need to learn from these PRCs about their bravery and gungho attitude.</p>

              <p>ever talk to a greek or an italian in Australia? don't be surprised they may be in the country for 20 years but don't speak a word of australian. Greek and Italian are just the two I know of, there are HK who only speak cantonese, and other races from the middle east and eastern europe. their bravery and gungho attitude will allow them to stay and remain separated from the main society.</p>
              <p>wonder how the australian immigration authorities allow those without the ability of languages and skilles entry and settlement in the country. how they guage their bravery and gungho attitude?</p>

              <p>before 1 is allowed in, it is mandatory to take an english test, typically at british council, where 1 is tested on written, oral and conversation english. you need to clear this hurdle. hence, it is not a question of they cannot speak english. they are just comfort creatures prefering their native languages. and birds of the same feathers do tend to flock together there.</p>

              <p>I believe there are other types of immigrants. Those who invest a certain amount of money will get their PR. But I think members of the family are also allowed in as PR or citizens, so you have one young man who pass the test, then his mother, sisters and the extended family can all come in, not sure if they have to pass the mandatory english test. correct me if I am wrong. I do come across an italian, their family have to speak to me through his interpretation. They all long time in australia, their community is big.</p>

              <p>Information on emigrating to Canada. It is much easier than you think, especially if you are educated, speak english and have work experience. Problem is finding a job here once you get here. But if you are determined, nothing can stop you!</p>

              <p><br>Definitely not looking forward to the SG weather. But I haven't put down any roots in Canada either, so I guess I should be a filial son and return to SG to be with my parents for a while. Beside, it is quite easy to move back to Canada if I ever want to again.</p>
