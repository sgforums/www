              <p>last heard, PAP is trying to profile them, for manageability. all chinaman who comes from hainan island and above now must have the pre-fix surname, Tiong.</p>
              <p>example, if the chinaman's name is lee sun, he will be tiong-lee sun. this will not apply to the sports talent scheme though. so li jiawei can stick to her name. they don't want IOC to get suspicious.</p>

              <p>Yes. I totally agree with you. I don't consider singapore to have high quality of life. Everyone here seems to have material as their primary goal. There's even cases of fighting with family members because of money. Apart from that, everytime you read the papers, you see sue here sue there, fine here fine there. $$$!!! Arrghh...</p>

              <p>yesterday i saw on the tv news about how a single mum stayed in a cockroach infested public housing with her 4 kids. frigging scary looking at the hordes of cockroaches running around while she prepare dinner next to it... EEEWWWW.</p>
              <p>and another story about how some ozzies got scammed by cheats too.</p>
              <p>there is no perfect place to stay. u just have to find it yourself. but personally, i would go to whereever my profession are appreciated and quality of life. but now with the high mortgage stress that is on everyone, it is pretty challenging and difficult at times.</p>

              <p>yup.<br>During the time when Jews lost their land and forced to flee to other countries, their hard power seems shrinking but their soft power is increasing steadily. Though a miserable process, but it serve as a foundation for today's powerful Israel.</p>
