              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Population<br>The exodus continues<br>Foreigners more than make up for increasing local outflow; unfortunately it doesn’t help consolidate nationhood. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Feb 24, 2008</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>YEARS of strong economic growth have failed to stem Singapore’s skilled youths from leaving for a better life abroad, with the number topping 1,000 a year. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>This works out to 4%-5%, or three in 10, of the highly educated population, a severe brain drain for a small, young nation, according to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Such high-end emigration is usually associated with less better-off countries where living conditions are poor. Here the opposite is the case. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Last year the economy created almost 200,000 jobs, far in excess of the 38,000 births recorded. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The future doesn’t look better, either, despite Lee holding out promises of “a golden period” in the next five to 10 years. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Lee believes the exodus, which has been worrying him for two decades, could only grow because “every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree.” </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The emigration rate, one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis, is a blow to the government, particularly to Lee, who takes pride in building up this once poor squatter colony into a glittering global city. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>They are people who abandoned their citizenship for a foreign one, mostly in Australia, the United States and Canada. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>It is particularly serious for two reasons. First, Singapore is a young nation that is working hard to consolidate its nationhood and its people, and second, its defence lies in a reservist army. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>This is made up of young men who have served two years of compulsory military training when they reach the age of 18. Any big outflow will badly affect security, not to mention the economy. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Adding to a declining birth rate, the problem of emigration, which appears to have worsened during the past few decades as people became better educated, will further reduce the base of this well-trained people’s army. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Hundreds of thousands of foreigners and permanent residents who have come to Singapore help make up the numbers, but they do not have to serve national service. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The emigrants, mostly professionals, don’t leave Singapore out of poverty but to seek a better, less pressurised life. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Lee recently said the brain drain is touching close to this family. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Lee’s grandson, the elder son of Prime Minister Hsien Loong, who is studying in the United States, has indicated that he may not return. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Over the years, the children of several Cabinet ministers have also made Britain or the US their home. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Lee, aged 84, has often spoken on the issue with emotions, once tearing when referring to the losses. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>However, he has offered no reasons for the exodus beyond economic opportunities, although the government more or less knows what they are. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Singaporeans who have or are planning to emigrate are given a host of 10 questions and asked to tick the three most important ones. They include the following: - </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>&gt; High costs of living </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>&gt; Singapore is too regulated and stifling </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>&gt; Better career and prospects overseas </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>&gt; Prefer a more relaxed lifestyle </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>&gt; Uncertain future of Singapore. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Some liberal Singaporeans believe Lee himself, with his authoritarian leadership and unpopular policies, is largely to blame. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Singapore’s best-known writer Catherine Lim calls it a climate of fear that stops citizens from speaking out against the government, saying it could eventually lead to the decline of the state. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>She praised the government for its economic achievements but added: “A compliant, fearful population that has never learnt to be politically savvy could spell the doom of Singapore.” Globalisation, which offers opportunities in many countries like never before, is a big reason for the outflow. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Many countries, including populous China, are making a special effort to attract foreign talent. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Others who leave were worried about the future of their children living in a small island, and look for security and comfort of a larger country. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The exodus is more than made up – at least in numbers – by a larger intake of professionals from China and India. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>“The trouble is many of the Chinese then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener, Lee said. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>“But even if we only keep 30%-40% and lose 60%-70%, we’re a net gainer,” he added. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>He believed, however, that the Chinese would cease to come in 20 to 30 years’ time, when China’s living standards rise to match Singapore’s. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Some feel the large presence of foreigners, and the perks they enjoy over locals in military exemption as well as in scholarships, are themselves strong push factors. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>They see the foreigners as a threat to jobs and space, undermining salaries and loosening the nation’s cohesion. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>“I just feel very sad to see the Singapore of today with so many talented, passionate Singaporeans moving out and being replaced by many foreigners,” said one blogger. “I feel sorry for the future.” </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Others point out the danger of an easy fix in numbers without regard to quality. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>“Foreigners treat this place as a hotel, when the economy turns they will leave,” said a teacher who is seeing more and more foreign students in his class...</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong></strong></span></p>

              <div id="post-260" class="post">
              <p>Well, I think this math question for my 1506 module will tell us a reason why there is a brain drain in Singapore:</p>
              <p>Both Elves and Dwarves live in Rivendell, but there is a certain irrational resentment<br>between the two groups [placed in their hearts, no doubt, by Sauron]. The amount of<br>racial prejudice is not the same on both sides, Elves tending to be more intolerant than<br>Dwarves, but both groups are inclined to move out of Rivendell at a rate controlled by<br>the number of the other group. Apart from this, both groups reproduce as usual, but<br>Elves can only be killed by violence –they never grow old– so their overall death rate<br>per capita is lower than that of the Dwarves; also, the Elvish birth rate per capita is<br>higher since Dwarf women are scarce [ever seen one?]. Both groups have more births<br>than deaths. We can set up a model of this situation using a pair of simultaneous ODEs<br>with a matrix [where the first row describes the rate of change of the Elf population]<br>5 -4<br>-1 2</p>
              </div>
              <p>Explain why this matrix does represent the situation we described. At a<br>certain time, the number of Dwarves is slightly larger than the number of Elves. Predict<br>what will happen to the population of Elves. This pattern has in fact often been observed<br>in racially discriminatory societies.</p>

              <p>I believe this 10 figure is just on those who give up their citizenship.</p>
              <p>If you include those who haven't given up their citizenship, but live effectively as if they are cut off from Singapore, ie working in another country then the figure is actually higher.</p>
              <p>The main concern as well is that those people tend to be the highly skilled of the population.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for lionnoisy, importing highly-skilled FT does not solve the problem, if carried out in the long term eventually the social strata of higher skilled workers will be dominated by FTs, and the social issues that rise from it will eventually spill over.</p>
              <p>Even more unfortunate, is that the majority of these FTs do not make Singapore their perminant home, and this will show even more 10 or 20 years down the road. lionnoisy fails to accept this because he can't bear to think we have any major problems that isn't being solved.</p>
              <p>But even our government admits that the current FT policy is a stopgap, the issue of brain drain is something that must be reversed, not replaced with a numbers game.</p>
              <p>Of course there is also a major issue of the rising standards of living in countries like China and India which will eventually make Singapore a lot less attractive, and the supply will start to dry up.</p>
              <p>Ultimately if we are so attractive, why can't we retain our top talent and why is there a brain drain in the first place?</p>
              <p>You don't make good use or retain your own talent, then trying to make up for this problem by simply importing people is like trying to replace lost blood volume of a bleeding person with IVs packs of saline solutions... it is a stopgap solution. If the bleeding is not stopped eventually the blood will get so diluted by the IVs you are using to boost the blood voume the patient will die anyway.</p>

              <p>well, the migration business have been thriving for a while. my take it the following:</p>
              <p>1. this is still a business. the chaps advertising are in it for the money. they are not here to do these group of people a favour. it is a window of opportunity to work towards their BMW or Casa whatever condo.</p>
              <p>2. you still need to do various assessments to see if you do really qualify. not every welder in singapore here can migrate to australia/nz or canada at will. most obvious is certification. here in singapore, we can get away with a welder who learn on the job and it became his vocation. elsewhere, it is stricter. necessary vocational certification and other written confirmation about a specific job skill is required. for example, i cannot apply for PR in australia as a hairdresser even if it's in demand there if i cannot prove my competence. or a cook for example. here in singapore, anyonce can set-up a bah-kut teh store overnight. and then there is the language competency test, character tests, medical, etc. it can be daunting.</p>
              <p>3. money can be a problem too. these migration agents will easily charge $5k upwards for each case processed. this will go up once the incidentals comes in. i would think that it can add another $2k for a total of $7k or so for each applicants to cough up. not a small deal for these people. and not all application will be successful. the migration agent will state this upfront. after all these trouble and then if the PR is not approved, it is money down the drain.  </p>
              <p>those who has relatives overseas, like fishbuff helping his in-laws, stand a much better chance as the strongman will know how to navigate certain obstacle to ease the entry. otherwise, it is not plain sailing.</p>
              <p>singapore is not zimbabwe, or nigeria. those with $3-4k disposable income/month here should be able to fend for themselves. they will get a roof under their head, fridge, tv, sofa and beds, plus a handphone per person. they may be starved politically but hey, survival and living are topmost of their mind. if the government can be more compassionate to be more forthcoming to help those who are really struggling, then i think singapore may not be that bad a place after all. </p>
