              I love brisbane. spent 4.5 years there in the 90's doing my studies.
              
              I would advise bringing your laptop/notebook there but make sure its covered by international warranty when you buy it here. Computer and electronic equipment are generally higher in Australia due to taxes.
              
              Love the river rides in winter, great view of the storey-bridge and very relaxing.

              <p><br>i am also expecting some news or program to documentarise the successful examples of locals settling overseas. there are so many cases. bound to have plenty of ex-poreans being happier man and woman living in a place with higher Quality of Life which cannot directly be bought by material wealth or money. if a rich man is rich due to working in a very stressful business, and he is always worrying and hot temper or taking feel good medications, his quality of life is worse than a poor man who is content.</p>
