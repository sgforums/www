              <p>DURING a dialogue at the fifth anniversary dinner of the Lee Kuan
              Yew School of Public Policy on Sept 2, the Minister Mentor was asked by
              writer Catherine Lim: "Sir, in the event of a serious threat of a freak
              election, would you do the unthinkable, that is, send in the army?"</p>
              <p>This is an edited extract from Mr Lee's reply: "You look at our
              record and the moves we've made. Let me put it simply like this. First,
              we maintain a system which gives any opposition the opportunity to
              displace us peacefully.</p>

              "If
              you can win an election, so be it. If at some point we are not able to
              find a team which can equal an opposition team, on that day we deserve
              to be out. If we become corrupt, inefficient, can't deliver, we're out.</p>
              <p>"What if we have a freak election, as we may well have? So we've set
              in place a president with blocking powers. Any opposition that comes in
              will find that he cannot touch the reserves, otherwise you can promise
              the sky and spend the money.</p>
              <p>Second, you cannot change the top officials without the president's
              consent. Any raiding of the funds must be approved by the president who
              has a council of presidential advisers to advise him yes or no.</p>
              <p>"Now, why should we do all these if we expect to overturn an
              election? We expect that if we are voted out, to stay out, and hope
              that within one term, that new government, incompetent and unable to
              deliver, will be out. And there're enough core competencies and the
              funds to enable a fresh PAP government to revive the system.</p>
              <p>"One of the first lessons I learnt in politics was from Harold
              Laski. He said if you don't have a system that allows fundamental
              change by consent, you will have a revolution by violence.</p>
              <p>If we block all possibilities, we must expect violence.</p>
              <p>In that violence, eventually the army won't shoot because you are in the wrong.</p>
              <p>That's what happens in Africa, the army goes in and holds up the president and often shoots him.</p>
              <p>"If we had not these thoughts at the back of our minds, why do we do these things? Just to bluff the people? Doesn't make sense.</p>
              <p>An army commander, air force or police has to be approved by a committee and the president must agree.</p>
              <p>Why? Because we will appoint the commanders?</p>
              <p>No, because a stupid government will do the wrong things and when we
              return, we may find the whole machinery has collapsed, as often is the
              case. Simple."</p>

              <p>Nice joke from old man Lee.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle">ISD to Lim Hock Siew: Confess to save LKY's face</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>C. My Stand on the Demand for support for Parliamentary System</em><br> <br> I hold the view that to support the P.A.P. regime's so-called
              parliamentary system would mean giving the public and the masses a
              false impression that there exist today a genuine parliamentary
              democratic system in Singapore Island. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is an undeniable and
              unforgettable fact that comrade LEE TSE TONG who was elected by the
              people of Singapore in the 1963 General Elections, was arbitrarily
              arrested and detained without trial soon after he was elected.</strong></span> Subsequently, he was deprived of his citizenship and he is still under
              detention as a so-called "banishee" in prisoner's clothes in Queenstown
              prison. The arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention of Comrade Lee Tse
              Tong affords concrete proof that the so-called parliamentary democracy
              is a cruel mockery. It does not exist in Singapore Island. Giving
              support to such a sham parliamentary system means complete betrayal of
              the people. I will never betray the people of my country under any
              circumstance. Bitter sacrifice strengthens bold resolve.<br> <br> Parliamentary democracy does not mean merely casting of votes once in 5
              years during election time. Far more important than this is the freedom
              of thought, the freedom of expression, the freedom of association, the
              freedom of organisation everyday during the 5 years period and
              continuously thereafter. I was arrested when the Barisan Sosialis was
              actively participating in the parliamentary system. For such
              participation, the colonial government, the Lee Kuan Yew and Rahman
              regimes had rewarded me with over 9 years of imprisonment. This again
              amply indicates the utter shamness of the so-called parliamentary
              democratic system. After over 9 years of detention, I am now asked to
              give support to their so-called parliamentary system in order to secure
              my release. I firmly refuse to give my support for the sham and
              illusory democracy in Singapore Island.</p>

              <p>Taiwan has always been referred to as a model as to why Democracy cannot work for Asian, due to its unruly parliamentarians.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that somehow the Taiwanese experience is conveniently now dropped.</p>
              <p>Could it be that despite Taiwan seeing the success of the DPP taking over the government from the long time rule of the KMT - we are now witnessing that Taiwan's economy was left unbroken, even after the two terms with the failed politics of Ah Bien at the helm ?</p>
              <p>The KMT has won the last election in a more open and democratic political system then when it had earlier lost to the DPP, and the Taiwanese economy was not in tatters even as Ah Bien was not paying attention to the economy and was busy with Lee Teng Hui's political agenda for an independent Taiwan.</p>
              <p>If Singapore can be so fragile that the country cannot withstand any government that is formed by an Alternative Political Party - it will be largely due to the inherent weak structure that LKY and the PAP had deliberately designed that makes the entire structure to be in the PAP's continued control.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, if the PAP should lose an election - it will create a situation where all the Government Structures and the sub-Structures of GLCs are now firmly in the control of PAP appointees.</p>
              <p>The PAP dominated legislature has already passed laws that prevent the incoming new Government to change the political appointees that head the various government agencies unless the Elected President consent. We know that the Elected President has always been from the PAP.</p>
              <p>This is the legacy of instability that LKY and the PAP has created for Singapore.</p>

              <p>"if the opposition took power by a "freak result,"- When the oppositions win is by a freak result but a win by PAP is acceptable.What sort of statement by a respected person?It's filled with kiasuism,arrogance,selfishness and downright disrespectful.</p>
              <p>"I spent 15 years thinking up these safeguards."- So now we know he thinks that SG belong to him and his family that's why he spent 15 yrs planning and plugging loopholes along the planning by various tactics to stifle other parties from winning elections after elections,eradicting dissent,using power to stamp down would be strong and possible rivals.</p>
              <p>He spent 15 yrs.What about the other parties who are so keen to run SG.Are u planning the future of SG? If U didn't start immediately or else don't even think about standing for elections anymore.If U do,good.Be patient,be persistent,be smart,be mentally prepared,most important stand up to evry challenge infront.Most important don't be stupid. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Not till you win, please talk less, dun hallucinate yourself and start dreaming. If you really want to win PAP, it is still a long way to go, start working smart and good.</p>

I wonder if the investment is a sound one, considering the fact that billion losses can really make a person sleepless almost every night. I finally knew the reason as to whyy my local fren askem me not to change my citizenship to a Spore citizenship. I also served full-time NS and read report about my local colleuage AWOL to other countries.</p></div>
