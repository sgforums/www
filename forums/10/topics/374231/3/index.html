              <p><strong><em>AP - <span>Thursday, September 3</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE - Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew said Wednesday that he expects his People's Action Party to win the next two elections to extend its grip on power by as much as 10 more years.</span></p>
              <p>"I don't see any problem in the next election or probably in the next one after that," Lee, 85, said at a dinner to mark the fifth anniversary of a college named after him.</p>
              <p>"But if we don't find a good team in the election after that, and the opposition gets a good team together, we are at risk."</p>
              <p>Lee, who founded the PAP and was Singapore's first prime minister from 1959 to 1990, remains a powerful figure in the Cabinet and in the party. The PAP is the only party to have ruled Singapore.</p>
              <p>The current government was elected in 2006. The next elections are set for 2011.</p>
              <p>Lee, who now has the title of mentor minister, said even if the opposition took power by a "freak result," it won't be allowed to fire top police, army and other officials without the approval of the president, who is appointed by a committee of government officials.</p>
              <p>Lee, who is the father of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said an opposition government would by law also need the president's approval to tap international reserves, indicating it would not be given.</p>
              <p>Otherwise "all our hard-earned savings could go in five years," he said. "I spent 15 years thinking up these safeguards."</p>

              He is setting himself as an example to work til you die in Singapore. If he retired, then no more million dollar salary already.  But then, if our elderly are paid his salary, I think they also won't want to retire.

              <p>If you take a look at most PAP ministers, they are not fat, most of our local uncles are more fat then them. As LKY said, you dun fit to wear the white pants and shirt if you are fat, therefore most Ministers understand the effect of getting fatter, both for health sake and following instruction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ability to survive for so long and still going on is because of good plans and decision made, it is of no doubt that whoever took over the govt will struggle to survive, those who planned and make good executive orders will tends to survive. It doesn't matter how long you take to make your plan successful, but if you dun plan, you plan to fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The essence here is to explain that even if CSJ party took over as govt next year, he will also plan with all his might to hold on to the power, he will control the media, laws and order. And he can also be more shrewd and wayward then LKY. He may go away with the presidency and hold full power. But then, i am not going to blame him, because it is a nature for human to seek survivor with all his might, otherwise, within one term only, he can kiss his ass goodbye.</p>

              <p>Nobody here is taking your shit to stop anyone of us talking about PAP.   As I said to you many times, if you don't like the way people talk about PAP please go to PAP website or go to 3in1kopitiam.    I guess you dare not go 3in1kopitiam coz the people there are many times fiercer than anyone of us here.</p>
