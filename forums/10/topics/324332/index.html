              <p>at first it is the people who put PAP in power. no doubt about that. however, after that, the shrewd lee slowly but surely remove that electoral right of the people by devising and revising the voting parameters to suit his own.</p>
              <p>post-lee period is where we will see the change.</p>
              <p>in fact, my take is when the lee regime ends (i.e. LHL faith departed as his father), singapore will go downhill from there as none of the lees' regime nor their cronies will be around anymore. the national coffers will be empty as they would have taken all the monies overseas. the lee's immediate families would have been long gone by then too, leaving in the states or uk. singapore will be left to fend for it self. with power concentration within a few despite all fronts about power succession, all wayang. we know mm goh was a seat warmer because LHL has cancer and isn't ready then.</p>
