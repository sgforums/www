            <div class='col-md body'>As a (soon to be ex) forummer in Sammyboy Coffeeshop, I see attacks on Workers' Party for members praising their opponents (PAP) or being praised by them. They speculate this as a sign that PAP and WP are secretly working together, ridiculous if you ask me.<br><br>What do you guys think about Singapore opposition praising their opponents PAP? Or vice versa? Do you see them as a "endorsement" or just a sign of showing respect for your opponents?<br><br>Do you think such opposition will be more accepted by the people since the people will see them as a fair opposition than an unobjective one?</div>

But do you think their opponents praising them in public is a sign of endorsement or respect? Is it like how people call Chiam and Low "PAP-approved opposition"? Or is it just that PAP respects them for finding it difficult to find candidates able to beat them?</div>

Or if you think PAP is right, just keep quiet like SDP. Any one visited Sammyboy Coffeeshop, can see many forummers are like that.</div>

There could be truth that Chiam, Low, Steve Chia got to where they are or higher because PAP respects them and people still listen to PAP to a certain degree.<br><br>(Maybe that is why PAP stopped praising opponents since Sylvia Lim, whom I recall has never been praised by PAP)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The greatest respect anyone can get even from their opponents is from his own performance and conduct and graciousness with which he performs his duties.<br><br>So is his job is not well done and people are suffering from rising costs of living as against their wages and he is still claiming success or unqualified success like being the world's best condemning others as mediocre then his performance would be too doubtful or even shameful to earn true respect.<br><br>As for now government is the party being elected and paid by the people to do a job to be judged and not the opposition. It must earn the respect of the opposition and not the other way round. It must earn the people's or opposition's respect but it does not admit problems and would deny them time and time again with hypocrisy.<br><br>There is something seriously wrong with the ruling party's motivation and sense of self-worth and if it does not change this mindset then it will continue to be confrontational and suffer loss of respect.<br><br>To earn opposition and people's true respect they must perform their duties with diligence and heart for with good government and not by suing or shouting down opponents or forcing people to accept their errors with hypocrisy and justification it will not gain any true respect from anyone.</div>
