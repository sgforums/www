In addition, he was also told to move from an office of his own to share one with another older academic staff on the scheme Â— or a "half-office", as Dr Tham calls it.

This is different from full-time faculty whose workload is to be apportioned in the areas of teaching, research and service. As such, the workload of faculty on the half-time scheme is generally halved, even with a full-teaching roster."<br><br>Saying that the scheme has been in place since the 1990s, Mrs Lim added: "There is sufficient time to prepare lessons, mark assignments and attend to examination matters with the working load halved."<br><br>Disagreeing with this assessment, the professor said that he now works five days a week, from 8.30am to 5.45pm, and can't see how his workload has been halved.

He said: "Nowhere else can you resign with one click. I may be using it soon."<br></div></blockquote>In the period 1970s- 1980s, the economy grew causing inflations and wage rises. Government introduced public sector iwage restructuring in order to retain talents and attract new ones.<br><br>This policy appeared to be valid during growth phase of the economy. Professors, doctors, professionals all got their wage rises with promotional scales pushing up public sector wage costs three times.<br><br>This wage restructuring of the public sector was sustainable during the growth period. However since 1980s, Singapore economy has been on the down trend due to periodic recessions. Private sector Wages did not go up like the public sector and in fact came down.<br><br>As a result, HDB, SIA, PSA, MediaCorp and now university professors' wages are subjected to competitive pressures from the market forces. HDB had to close down whole departments and sections retrenching thousands of employees. MediaCorp suffered heavy losses mainly due to their following public sector wage costs which were too high.<br><br>PSA and SIA went through the same market corrections. Now lately university professors too have to take wage cuts if they want to stay competitive. If they don't they will suffer deficits or losses as reported by Lee Han Shih at one time in the case of HDB. When MM Lee intervened in SIA's wage disputes with the pilots, he must have known about why SIA wage costs were uncompetitive as their wages were pushed up by the wage restructuring for the whole period with many officers of SIA on secondments from the public sector.<br><br>The next on the list for correction appears to be hospitals when more regional hospitals are competing with ours fiercely.<br><br>Only one sector i.e. public sector wages was insulated because its wages were borne by taxpayers who did not have the power to intervene.<br><br>Those departments which outsourced their less critical services like M&amp;E services of hospitals and Car parking divisions of URA could verify these facts that public sector wages were too high and when outsourced they enjoy better results.<br><br>Now we have to ask whether public sector's ministers and MPs are overpaid. Let the market place decide. Outsource some ministerial functions to the private sector where their works are not too sensitive or critical e.g. the mundane security services of police force.<br><br>Take a look too at NKF. If its CEO at $600,000 pa was too expensive to pay, will it not cause problems with patients' fees and their subsidies.<br><br>What goes up has to come down and if they don't ministers will have no right to increase taxes or fees.<br><br>Ask the SIA, PSA to show ministers their comparison wage costs before and after restructuring. Let the fact speak for themselves. Do not shield the ministers or the SBS by approving their fee increases. Such fee increases might be most unjustifiable until actions are taken first to trim their fats.</div>

However, there is an argument for it. Let me first define two economic concept.<br><br>1. Transfer earning is defined as payment to any factor of production in preventing the factor from being transferred to its next best alternative.<br><br>2. Economic rent is defined as that price paid to any factor of production that is in completely inelastic supply.<br><br>You will have to agree with me that a person who possesses the exemplary leadership quality, honesty, talented, hardworking attitude, capable and lastly but not the least patriotic is indeed a rare find and the blessing of a nation. As such, the economic rent serves as a guide by rationing the available supply(person) to the most efficient use. I.e. to hold office.<br>Meanwhile in a competitive market place where booming private enterprises and MNCs are vying for this rare breed of leaders, are offering attractive wages. To counteract, the wage offered known as transfer earning has definitly got to be tag higher than the equilibrium of private sector wages rate.<br><br>Henceforth, the likelihood explanation of ministers holding high wages in my opinion can be due the form of transfer earning + economic rent because of the scarce natural talents they possessed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
