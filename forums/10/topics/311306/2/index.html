              <p>i do agree with you that the poor needs more help. as for the rich, regardless of situation, they are likely to stay rich or get richer.</p>

              <p>rising cost of living is inevitable.</p>
              <p>the only way is to be frugal in spendings and govt SHOULD implement minimum wages.</p>
              <p>the concept of keeping labour wages low for competition will make the lives of the low income group even harder. it does benefit the rich as they dont need to fork out much for labours and keep even bigger profit for themselves.</p>
              <p>so where is the priority? to look after the citizens or to look after the businesses?</p>
              <p>the problem is the gross misrepresentation of the working class in the current parliament which is predominantly businessmen. do u think the the businessmen will propose more wages for the common people and shoot their profits in their foot?<br>Singapore need the inputs on all policies from a wider range of people from different backgrounds, not just everything from the elites biz people.</p>

              <p>1) increase in taxes, and you're surprised there is a slight
              surplus? If I gave you a pay raise in the middle of the year, would
              you be surprised if you saved more money that year?</p>

              <p>2) Rising cost of land can only be blamed on the people.
              Speculation is what causes bubbles. Sure, the IRs encourage
              speculation. So would a million other things. Should the gov stand
              still for fear of changing the status quo? That's ridiculous.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) I'm interested to hear how the government "goes out of it's
              way" to keep your wages low. Seriously. I've heard this often...and
              I'm interested to hear why you would think so.</p>
              <p>4) I'm looking to get married too, coincidentally. I've also
              been looking at housing. I've actually been surprised at how easy
              it seems to afford a 3 room HDB. Oh sure, it's not in the "popular"
              areas. So what? You're starting a new family...you're SUPPOSED to

              complain of. They spend like there's no tommorow, take out loans
              they don't need, and then complain they can't escape the poverty

              <p>1) Wasn't the increse in GST to offset the costs helping the poor among other costs? Wasn't it to offset a 0.8 Bil projected deficit?</p>
              <p>I quote Ms Syliva Lim</p>
              <p>"For FY08, the government has once again projected a deficit of about
              $0.8b. In a commentary in the Business Times Weekend Edition 16-17 Feb
              08, Chief Economist at Daiwa Institute of Research (Singapore), PK
              Basu, wrote a Commentary entitled: “Deficit Next Year? Just Don’t Bet
              On It”. It was observed that “Singapore’s budgetary accounting system
              is among the most conservative in the world, as the fiscal balance is
              obtained by subtracting both operating and development expenditure from
              the government’s operating revenue alone. The government’s ample
              investment income is not counted as government revenue, (though) in
              recent years (it has made) a “small concession” by using up to 50% of
              investment income to fund special transfers”. The writer also notes
              that since the government is starting FY 08 with a larger surplus as a
              base, next year’s fiscal balance will also be stronger, assuming
              budgeted increases in revenue and expenditure. Coming back to his
              initial question of whether there would actually be a deficit in FY
              2008, he writes: “A betting man could do worse than place a large wager
              on actual revenues comfortably exceeding the Budget’s projections next
              year too!”"</p>
              <p>CitiGroup Economist Kit Wei Seng : "the GST hike may have been unnecessary or could have been delayed or
              staggered…the GST hike has contributed to the unexpected bulge in
              government revenues, while exacerbating inflation pressures”</p>
              <p>2) Isn't the true objective of public housing to maintain an affordable alternative for Singaporeans to get a roof above their heads? But when even the middle class find it hard pressed to afford it.

              <p>in the context of this thread, the 2% gst rise should not cause unnecessary alarm to the middle class. as i mentioned, if you live paycheck to paycheck, it doesn't matter if you earn $2k or $20k, you will feel the pinch.</p>
              <p>if conventional wisdom prevails that a family breadwinners save a portion(20-40%) of their total salary as savings or investments, life will still pretty much be the same. what you cut back are the wants, e.g. 3 movies a month vs 5 previously, or if you need bigger adjustment, sell your 2litre car for a 1.6l.</p>
              <p>As for hiring foreigners, companies do not look for the lowest cost worker to hire. this is a sure fire recipe for business failure. A rationale hirer would look for a combination of a few things, a smart guy, ability to fit in, skill level required and affordability, amongst others. there will be a range of salary that a hirer would be able to afford, and that will include locals and foreigners alike. If the hirer perceived that by paying 20% more for a person who can deliver 50% more productivity, then the choice is clear. always going for the lowest cost is penny wise, pound foolish. I will dread to work for this type of company. your point will apply for job that has little skill required, i.e. pruning trees, or a sweeper.</p>
              <p>and if one is house hunting and don't even have a decent amount of money to fork out, say $20-50k on hand, that person have no business house hunting. the same with buying a car with nothing down or $500 down. that person cannot afford a car, period. getting into such debts is what is creating this `cry foul' mentality because the slightest move in the cost of living index will render these people `invalid'.</p>
              <p>it's high time we take responsibility for our own lives.</p>

              <p>Keeping wages low using the influx of FT is actually more applicable to middle class, regardless blue or white collar (Blue or white collar really is just the nature of the job). Low skilled workers (e.g construction sector) have levies and laws to control hiring. Espeically now with the S pass and employment pass holders are a different matter altogether. No limit on how many a company may hire with no restrictions and no levies. If I remember correctly, they start at mothly wage of S$1800 or somewhere there.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway re the topic on HDB, it's on lease for 99 yrs but I think leasing a HDB flat for 99 yrs is better than leasing those 99 yr condos :x</p>

              <p><strong>Isnt the fact that they can ask for 60k a symptom of a larger or deeper issue? No one is blaming the current owner for asking a high price, high cash upfront.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Hence the dichotomy, stay or leave. Stay and try and work within this system that PAP indirectly or directly created.

              <p>Which is why I started the subject. Many Middle class could have the mobility to move. Its a talking point, and idea, it may become something more, maybe not.</p>
              <p>Like you said, a decision to move is not an easy thing to do. There are still other less tangible factors that would keep someone here, other than the creature comforts. If a decision was based purely on creature comforts, then the decision making will be alot easier wouldn't it? This thread was meant to see both sides of the coin. Can't help but wonder why chose to be confrontational tho. :)</p>
              <p>Money management is key, regardless where you go, so its a common dinominator.</p>
