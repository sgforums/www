              <p><br>You totally missed the point !!</p>
              <p>1) Raise in GST - was it needed ?  It came at a bad timing ... when things are bad.<br>So you got a raise in mid year ... but GST also raise - end up your raise may not even match the gst raise - you are poorer off ... but Government have surpluses !!!<br><br>2) Cost of land to raise is due to poor planning and estimation of the business need for office space by the government ... !!! This lead to shortage and thus speculation !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Govt have been too easy on allowing foreign labours into the market .... this does affect the labour market for local ...!!!  Local are been force out of jobs ....! <br><br>4) How much is your 3 bedroom HDB - how did you pay for it ? CPF ...  yep off course you don't feel the pain .... as you really fork out nothing ... yet CPF will pay for it ... and long installment ! Don't be so cocky ... wait till you old then you find your CPF - pay flat .... after that what is left is not enough to see you through old age !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not take out loan ...  and i do not spend like no tomorrow !! But I do see my standard of living keep dropping !!! Govt policy is just for show for the poor !!! With much more benefit to the rich and themselves !!!  For middle class there is totally nothing !!!  <br></p>

              <p>4) I'm looking to get married too, coincidentally. I've also
              been looking at housing. I've actually been surprised at how easy
              it seems to afford a 3 room HDB. Oh sure, it's not in the "popular"
              areas. So what? You're starting a new family...you're SUPPOSED to
              start from the bottom.</p>
